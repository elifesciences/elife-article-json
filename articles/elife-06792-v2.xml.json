PhoQ activity is repressed by divalent cations and induced in environments of acidic pH, limited divalent cations, and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). Previously, it was unclear which signals are sensed by salmonellae to promote PhoQ-mediated virulence. We defined conformational changes produced in the PhoQ PD on exposure to acidic pH that indicate structural flexibility is induced in \u03b1-helices 4 and 5, suggesting this region contributes to pH sensing. Therefore, we engineered a disulfide bond between W104C and A128C in the PhoQ PD that restrains conformational flexibility in \u03b1-helices 4 and 5. PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> is responsive to CAMP, but is inhibited for activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation. <i>phoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup></i> <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhimurium is virulent in mice, indicating that acidic pH and divalent cation sensing by PhoQ are dispensable for virulence."

PhoQ activity is repressed by divalent cations and induced in environments of acidic pH, limited divalent cations, and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). Previously, it was unclear which signals are sensed by salmonellae to promote PhoQ-mediated virulence. We defined conformational changes produced in the PhoQ PD on exposure to acidic pH that indicate structural flexibility is induced in \u03b1-helices 4 and 5, suggesting this region contributes to pH sensing. Therefore, we engineered a disulfide bond between W104C and A128C in the PhoQ PD that restrains conformational flexibility in \u03b1-helices 4 and 5. PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> is responsive to CAMP, but is inhibited for activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation. <i>phoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup></i> <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhimurium is virulent in mice, indicating that acidic pH and divalent cation sensing by PhoQ are dispensable for virulence."

Critical for salmonellae virulence is their ability to survive and replicate within host cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fields et al., 1986</a>). Following phagocytosis by macrophages, salmonellae are contained within a phagosomal environment containing a diversity of antimicrobial factors including proteases, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, acidic pH and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Flannagan et al., 2009</a>). Salmonellae have multiple mechanisms, including the PhoQ sensor, to sense the phagosomal milieu and respond by increasing their resistance to host antimicrobial factors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Haraga et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Groisman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dalebroux and Miller, 2014</a>). PhoQ is the sensor kinase component of the PhoPQ two-component regulatory system that governs the phosphorylated state of the response regulator PhoP (<a href=\"#bib36\">Groisman et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miller et al., 1989</a>). PhoQ exists as a dimer within the inner membrane and has a periplasmic sensor domain (PD) that transduces signals across the inner membrane to the cytoplasmic histidine kinase domain. Following activation of PhoQ by the phagosomal environment, PhoP is phosphorylated and transcriptionally controls a large network of genes (&gt;300), many of which are involved in virulence (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fields et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Behlau and Miller, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Belden and Miller, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gunn and Miller, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Guo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bearson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Guo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bader et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dalebroux et al., 2014</a>).

Unlike other PDC-sensors, which bind small ligands in a defined binding pocket or PhoQ PD homologs found in environmental bacteria, the PhoQ PD from bacteria that primarily interact with animals has no apparent binding pocket due to an occluding structural element: \u03b1-helices 4 and 5 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cho et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Prost et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cheung et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Prost et al., 2008</a>). Acidic residues on \u03b14 and \u03b15 and \u03b2-strands 5 and 6 in the PhoQ PD form a structural scaffold for binding antimicrobial peptides, as well as the divalent cations Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Waldburger and Sauer, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bader et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cho et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Prost et al., 2008</a>). PhoQ kinase activity is repressed and phosphatase activity is dominant at millimolar or greater concentrations of divalent cations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Garcia Vescovi et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Castelli et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Montagne et al., 2001</a>), presumably due to divalent cation salt-bridges formed between the PD acidic patch and inner membrane phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cho et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, PhoQ activity is repressed by feedback inhibition involving the small inner membrane protein, MgrB (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lippa and Goulian, 2009</a>). Conversely, bacterial growth in sub-millimolar divalent cation conditions results in PhoQ activation and increased kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Garcia Vescovi et al., 1996</a>), presumably due to disruption of salt-bridges between the PhoQ PD and inner membrane. However, the macrophage phagosome has a magnesium concentration of approximately one millimolar and a calcium concentration of approximately 500 micromolar, suggesting PhoQ is not activated by divalent cation limitation during intracellular infection (<a href=\"#bib19\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</a>). At one millimolar divalent cation concentration, PhoQ can be activated by exposure to pH 5.5 or sub-inhibitory concentrations of CAMP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bader et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Prost et al., 2007</a>). These are relevant host signals as the macrophage phagosome acidifies to approximately pH 5.5 and contains CAMP (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alpuche Aranda et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rathman et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rosenberger et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, neutralization of acidified macrophage intracellular compartments with chemical inhibitors results in decreased PhoQ-mediated gene expression during infection (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alpuche Aranda et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</a>). Combined, these findings suggested a model in which acidic pH and CAMP activate PhoQ within the macrophage phagosome; however, the individual contribution of these signals to PhoQ-mediated virulence remained unknown."

A variety of experimental data indicate that CAMP directly compete with divalent cations for binding sites within the PhoQ PD acidic patch, leading to a model in which CAMP activates PhoQ by disrupting salt-bridges with the inner membrane (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bader et al., 2005</a>). The mechanism by which PhoQ is activated by acidic pH appears to be distinct from CAMP and involves perturbations to a network of residues surrounding H157 within the \u03b1/\u03b2-core of the PD (<a href=\"#bib59\">Prost et al., 2007</a>). In this study, we defined conformational changes that occur within the PhoQ PD on exposure to acidic pH. Characterization of the conformational changes induced by acidic pH inspired the construction of PhoQ variants which are impaired for acidic pH and divalent cation sensing, but retain their ability to respond to CAMP. Prior to this study, it was unclear which signals were important for PhoQ-mediated virulence. Utilizing these PhoQ variants, we have now established that acidic pH and divalent cation sensing are dispensable signals for PhoQ-mediated systemic virulence of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhimurium, suggesting that CAMP or other host molecules facilitate PhoQ-dependent pathogenesis."

To extract residue information from the spectra, resonance assignments were determined for the PhoQ PD at pH 3.5, the condition that yielded the greatest number of observable resonances. Of the 138 residues that can yield HSQC signals, 120 resonances could be assigned in the spectrum at pH 3.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Such processes will appear in the so-called \u2018fast-exchange\u2019 NMR regime due to the rapid on/off rate of protons. Many resonances in the PD spectra exhibited pH-dependent fast-exchange behavior, consistent with ionization of the many histidine and acidic residues. In addition, some resonances broadened and disappeared from the spectrum as a function of pH. This behavior corresponds to intermediate-to-slow exchange and is indicative of a conformational change or the existence of multiple states that interconvert slowly. Thus, pH-dependent changes in the PhoQ PD HSQC spectra reveal regions of the domain that experience changes in functional group ionization and conformational dynamics."

A majority of residues affected by pH localize to \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b14, and \u03b15 and proximal regions, including \u03b25, \u03b26, and \u03b27. As an independent approach, we randomly mutagenized the PD to identify mutations that activate PhoQ in the presence of repressing concentrations of divalent cations (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). pH-sensitive regions identified in the NMR experiments overlap or are proximal to many of the mutations identified in our screen for activating mutations in the PhoQ PD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, asterisks). Similar to the activating mutations, a majority of the pH-sensitive residues form an interconnected network which spans \u03b14 and \u03b15 and the \u03b1/\u03b2-core (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These data suggested that PhoQ PD residues and structural features important for activation and repression undergo conformational change during pH titration. A majority of the residues that were unaffected by changes in pH mapped distally to \u03b14 and \u03b15, providing support for the hypothesis that the detection and response to pH is contained within localized structural elements of the PD. Altogether, these observations are consistent with a model where fluctuations in pH promote local conformational dynamics between \u03b14 and \u03b15 and the \u03b1/\u03b2-core as part of the pH sensing mechanism."

Cysteine residues were introduced at positions W104 (on \u03b12) and A128 (on \u03b14) based on their side-chain surface exposure, relative geometries, and C<sup>\u03b2</sup> distance (\u223c6 \u00c5) observed in the <i>S. enterica</i> Typhimurium PhoQ PD structure (PDB 1YAX). Non-reducing SDS-PAGE and western blotting of membranes harvested from <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> <i>S. enterica</i> Typhimurium revealed a faster migrating PhoQ species relative to wild type, suggesting W104C and A128C form an intramolecular disulfide bond when expressed in bacteria (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

When exposed to acidic pH or low divalent cation growth media, activation of the PhoQ-dependent <i>phoN::TnphoA</i> reporter in <i>S. enterica</i> Typhimurium was significantly reduced in <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> relative to wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Additionally, the previously identified T48I activating mutation in the T48 D179 K186 (TDK) network in the PhoQ PD (<a href=\"#bib52\">Miller and Mekalanos, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Garcia Vescovi et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sanowar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cho et al., 2006</a>) was suppressed by the W104C-A128C disulfide bond, supporting the hypothesis that \u03b14 and \u03b15 and the TDK network are an interconnected signaling element (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Interestingly, the T48I mutation potentiates CAMP activation in the <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>T48I W104C-A128C</i></sup> background by an unknown mechanism. Importantly, CAMP still activated the <i>phoN::TnphoA</i> reporter in <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> and <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>T48I W104C-A128C</i></sup> <i>S. enterica</i> Typhimurium at or above wild-type levels, indicating that these mutant proteins are functional (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Chromosomal <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> had a similar phenotype to <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> expressed from the pBAD24 vector, indicating the phenotype is not an artifact of expression <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, the <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> phenotype does not appear to be exclusive to <i>phoN</i> as other PhoQ-regulated genes\u2014<i>pagD</i>, <i>pagO</i>, and <i>phoP\u2014</i>are significantly reduced for induction by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation, but are induced by exposure to CAMP, similar to wild-type bacteria (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Serine substitutions at W104 and A128 did not recapitulate the phenotype observed for <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup>, but rather resulted in increased <i>phoN::TnphoA</i> reporter activity relative to wild type (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Additionally, neither single cysteine nor single serine substitutions at W104 or A128 recapitulated the <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). These results confirmed that a disulfide bond is required for the <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> phenotype. Similar to residues identified in our screen for activating mutations, the replacement of partially buried, hydrophobic residues at positions W104 and A128 with smaller, polar side-chains promoted activation. Altogether, these data confirmed that restricting conformational flexibility or movement of \u03b14 and \u03b15 inhibits activation by acidic pH, divalent cation limitation, and activating mutations in the TDK network. These data suggest that CAMP activates PhoQ by a mechanism that is distinct and separable from the mechanism by which acidic pH or divalent cation limitation activate PhoQ."

This hypothesis was tested by performing thermal melts on purified PhoQ PD and PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> PD at pH 5.5 by following the CD signal of each protein as a function of temperature. We first confirmed that purified PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> PD forms a disulfide as visualized as a shift in SDS-PAGE migration rate relative to PhoQ PD and TCEP-reduced PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The CD spectra revealed that the PhoQ PD and PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> PD with or without TCEP are folded and have relatively similar secondary structure at pH 5.5 and 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thermal denaturation of the PhoQ PD at pH 5.5 proved to be irreversible. Therefore, we reported the apparent transition temperatures (<math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>T</mtext><mi>m</mi><mrow><mtext>app</mtext></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>). While the wild-type PhoQ PD unfolded with a <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>T</mtext><mi>m</mi><mrow><mtext>app</mtext></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> of 56\u00b0C in the presence and absence of TCEP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> PD had a significantly increased <math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>T</mtext><mi>m</mi><mrow><mtext>app</mtext></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> of 75\u00b0C. When reduced with TCEP, the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> PD was slightly destabilized relative to the wild type, with a <math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>T</mtext><mi>m</mi><mrow><mtext>app</mtext></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> 52\u00b0C. Therefore, the W104C-A128C disulfide increased the intrinsic stability of the PD at pH 5.5 relative to wild type. Furthermore, the observations that reduced PhoQ<sup>W104C A128C</sup> PD is less stable than wild type and that <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104S A128S</i></sup> bacteria had increased PhoQ-dependent gene reporter activity relative to wild type (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) suggests that substituting small polar side-chains at these positions in the PD results in decreased stability and increased PhoQ activity. Combined, these results suggest that the mechanism by which the W104C-A128C disulfide bond inhibits PhoQ activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation involves a loss of conformational flexibility between \u03b14 and \u03b15 and the \u03b1/\u03b2-core."

With the construction of <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> <i>S. enterica</i> Typhimurium, the significance of acidic pH and divalent cation sensing by PhoQ to virulence could be directly determined independently of CAMP sensing. Thus, BALB/c mice were infected by the intraperitoneal (IP) route with wild-type, <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup>, or <i>phoQ</i> null (<i>\u0394phoQ</i>) bacteria and splenic bacterial burden was determined at 48- and 96-hpi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, solid lines). Similar to infection with wild-type bacteria, mice infected with <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> bacteria had increased splenic bacterial burden relative to those infected with <i>\u0394phoQ</i> bacteria. The equivalent experiment was performed in resistant A/J mice to determine if the virulence phenotype observed for mice infected with <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup> bacteria was due to the susceptible BALB/c mouse genetic background and to determine whether a subtle fitness defect would be exposed on infection of a relatively resistant inbred mice. Infecting A/J mice revealed the same relative phenotypes for wild-type, <i>phoQ</i><sup><i>W104C-A128C</i></sup>, and <i>\u0394phoQ</i> bacteria, although, as expected, bacterial burden was lower compared to infected BALB/c mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, dotted lines). These results indicate that PhoQ sensing of acidic pH and divalent cation limitation are dispensable for systemic virulence of <i>S. enterica</i> Typhimurium in susceptible and relatively resistant inbred mice."

These bacterial resistance mechanisms are essential for successful infection, necessitating tight regulation by sensors such as PhoQ. Our study defines \u03b14 and \u03b15 in the PhoQ PD as a pH-responsive structural element that experiences a change in its dynamic behavior upon transition to acidic pH.

Unlike other pH-sensors that utilize discrete histidine protonation as a mechanism of activation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Perier et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dawson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">M\u00fcller et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Choi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Williamson et al., 2013</a>), PhoQ activation by acidic pH does not appear to rely strictly on protonation of histidines. Mutagenesis of H157, which is located in the PhoQ PD \u03b1/\u03b2-core and is observed to form hydrogen bonds with T129 on \u03b14 and the backbone hydroxyl of T180 on the \u03b27-\u03b16 loop, results in a modest increase in activity; however, it does not account for the entire pH-mediated activation state (<a href=\"#bib59\">Prost et al., 2007</a>). Mutation of the other two histidines in the PD (H137 and H120) did not significantly affect activation or repression of PhoQ (data not shown). An alternate mechanism of PhoQ activation by acidic pH may involve pH-induced conformational changes within the periplasmic dimerization interface. Notably, an intermolecular disulfide at position T61C in the PhoQ PD dimerization interface results in increased PhoQ-dependent reporter activity at pH 5.5, suggesting that conformational changes in the dimerization interface can directly affect signal transduction (data not shown). Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that the PhoQ PD dimer dissociates as the pH decreases (data not shown). Additionally, work by Molnar et al support the notion that conformational changes with the dimerization interface are concomitant with activation and repression. Recently, it was shown that the <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> chemotaxis receptor, TlpB, utilizes a unique mechanism to sense acidic pH (<a href=\"#bib35\">Goers Sweeney et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, the TlpB PD may sense pH by adopting a \u2018relaxed\u2019 conformation at low pH due to decreased hydrogen bonding to a coordinated urea molecule. It is plausible that similar relaxation may occur in the PhoQ PD between the \u03b1/\u03b2-core and helices \u03b14 and \u03b15 upon exposure to acidic pH. Therefore, pH-induced conformational changes resulting in structural relaxation or flexibility may be an important mechanism by which pH can be sensed."

For example, distinct pH-gradients are established and required in eukaryotic vesicular trafficking pathways and chemical neutralization of acidic compartments within these pathways results in a variety of cellular disturbances including inhibition of acidic hydrolases and proteases, perturbation of molecular sorting and recycling, endocytosis and exocytosis dysregulation, and disruption of vesicular fusion events (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dean et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mellman et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Casey et al., 2010</a>).

Furthermore, structural studies have led to the engineered bifurcation of PhoQ signaling capabilities; separating acidic pH and divalent cation sensing from CAMP signaling. This discovery has allowed us to determine the contribution of acidic pH and divalent cation sensing to <i>S. enterica</i> Typhimurium virulence and will provide valuable insights to the spatial-temporal regulation of PhoQ during pathogenesis."

They identified \u03b14 and \u03b15 and their interactions with the \u03b1/\u03b2 core as the pH-responsive structural element; residues with these structural regions experience ionization and dynamic conformational changes upon transition to acid pH condition. Bases on the proposed structural mechanism, the authors then designed a PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> mutant that has an internal disulfide bond expected to restrict the conformal changes of \u03b14/\u03b15 required for sensing acidic pH. Significantly, the mutant does not respond to acidic pH and divalent limitation-induced PhoQ activation by still can mediate cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) activation of PhoQ. This is particularly important as it is for the first time to separate the function of PhoQ sensing of CAMP from sensing the acidic pH and divalent cation limitation. When expressed in <i>Salmonella</i>, the authors provided strong data demonstrating that the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> mutant behaved similarly as the WT protein in bacterial replication both in cultured macrophages as well as in infected animals. These data potentially resolve a longstanding puzzle about the in vivo function of the PhoP-PhoQ two-component system, i.e. regulating bacterial virulence mainly by responding to CAMP rather than acidification of the <i>Salmonella</i>-containing phagosome and divalent cation limitation. PhoQ is one of the major regulators of pathogenesis in <i>Salmonella</i>, and is also one of the most well studied histidine kinases. The results presented in this paper are interesting and important, and will be of broad interest. The authors should consider the following points to revise the manuscript."

Furthermore, our findings are not mutually exclusive from those of <a href=\"#bib5\">Bader et al. 2005</a>. Perhaps CAMP activates PhoQ in a series of steps beginning with the displacement of divalent cations at the acidic patch, followed by interactions with the adjacent periplasmic domain or transmembrane regions or disruption of local phospholipid packing. Further investigation will be required to determine the mechanism by which CAMP activates PhoQ. We have clarified this in the Discussion by suggesting possible mechanisms by which CAMP activates PhoQ."

Extensive point-mutations in the PhoQ PD acidic patch can lead to reduced activation by CAMP, but activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation are also perturbed (unpublished observations).
