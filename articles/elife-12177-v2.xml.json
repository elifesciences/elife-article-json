                    "text": "Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is a lysosomal membrane protein that exports cholesterol derived from receptor-mediated uptake of LDL, and it also mediates cellular entry of Ebola virus. Cholesterol export is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of U18666A, a cationic sterol. To identify the target of U18666A, we synthesized <b>U-X</b>, a U18666A derivative with a benzophenone that permits ultraviolet-induced crosslinking. When added to CHO cells, <b>U-X</b> crosslinked to NPC1. Crosslinking was blocked by U18666A derivatives that block cholesterol export, but not derivatives lacking blocking activity. Crosslinking was prevented by point mutation in the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) of NPC1, but not by point mutation in the N-terminal domain (NTD). These data suggest that the SSD contains a U18666A-inhibitable site required for cholesterol export distinct from the cholesterol-binding site in the NTD. Inasmuch as inhibition of Ebola requires 100-fold higher concentrations of U18666A, the high affinity U16888A-binding site is likely not required for virus entry."

                    "text": "Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is a lysosomal membrane protein that exports cholesterol derived from receptor-mediated uptake of LDL, and it also mediates cellular entry of Ebola virus. Cholesterol export is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of U18666A, a cationic sterol. To identify the target of U18666A, we synthesized <b>U-X</b>, a U18666A derivative with a benzophenone that permits ultraviolet-induced crosslinking. When added to CHO cells, <b>U-X</b> crosslinked to NPC1. Crosslinking was blocked by U18666A derivatives that block cholesterol export, but not derivatives lacking blocking activity. Crosslinking was prevented by point mutation in the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) of NPC1, but not by point mutation in the N-terminal domain (NTD). These data suggest that the SSD contains a U18666A-inhibitable site required for cholesterol export distinct from the cholesterol-binding site in the NTD. Inasmuch as inhibition of Ebola requires 100-fold higher concentrations of U18666A, the high affinity U16888A-binding site is likely not required for virus entry."

Second, NPC1 is the receptor that permits cellular entry of the RNA genomes of lethal Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and other filoviruses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carette et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011</a>)."

NPC1 mediates the egress of cholesterol that has entered lysosomes through the receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liscum et al., 1989</a>). When cell membranes are depleted of cholesterol, LDL receptors bind circulating LDL, internalize it, and deliver it to lysosomes where acid lipase hydrolyzes the lipoprotein\u2019s cholesteryl esters (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</a>). The liberated cholesterol binds to NPC2, a soluble diffusible protein in the lysosome lumen (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sleat et al., 2004</a>). NPC2 transports the cholesterol to the lysosomal membrane where it transfers its cholesterol to membrane-embedded NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Designated a hydrophobic handoff, this transfer occurs in such a way that hydrophobic cholesterol is shielded from the aqueous environment (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kwon et al., 2009</a>)."

Some of the cholesterol reaches the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it has two actions. First, it binds to Scap, an ER protein that regulates the cleavage and activation of membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Cholesterol binding to Scap prevents the protease-mediated release and nuclear entry of the active fragment of SREBPs, thereby blocking cholesterol synthesis and uptake from LDL (<a href=\"#bib19\">Horton et al., 2002</a>). When excess cholesterol reaches the ER, it is esterified with a long chain fatty acid through the action of acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which converts the cholesterol to its storage form as cholesteryl esters (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brown et al., 1975</a>). Lysosome-derived cholesterol also reaches the plasma membrane where it fills three distinguishable pools, thereby assuring membrane integrity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Das et al., 2014</a>)."

The other group identified small molecules that block Ebola infection and used ultraviolet crosslinking to trace their target to NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011</a>). Mutant cells that lack NPC1 were found to resist Ebola virus infection, and infectivity was restored by transfection with a plasmid expressing full length NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carette et al., 2011</a>). In vitro binding studies demonstrated that an Ebola virus surface glycoprotein binds to luminal loop 2 of NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Miller et al., 2012</a>), the same loop that binds to NPC2 (amino acids 373\u2013620). Indeed, Ebola sensitivity was restored when NPC1-deficient Chinese Hamster Ovary\u00a0(CHO) cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding only the luminal loop 2 portion of NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Miller et al., 2012</a>).
