In <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus, and, in contrast to the phenotypes of several other axon path-finding mutants, <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets, providing in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. These experiments implicate planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in motor axon growth and they highlight the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell\u2013cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth."

In <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus, and, in contrast to the phenotypes of several other axon path-finding mutants, <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets, providing in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. These experiments implicate planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in motor axon growth and they highlight the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell\u2013cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth."

In mouse embryos that lacked Frizzled3, the motor nerves that control breathing and limb movements were thinner than those in normal mice. In the mutant animals, many motor axons failed to form connections with their targets. Instead, these axons came to an abrupt halt midway along their intended paths and the neurons from which they originated died soon afterwards. These experiments support the idea that developing neurons are programmed to die unless their axons progress on the appropriate schedule."

For neurons with distant targets, making the appropriate connections depends on accurate long-range navigation by their growing axons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dickson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">O\u2019Donnell et al., 2009</a>)."

Motor neurons in the brainstem extend their axons within cranial nerves to control muscles involved in feeding, facial expression, and eye, neck, and head movements (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guthrie, 2007</a>). Motor neurons in the spinal cord are arranged in longitudinal columns along the rostrocaudal axis, and the neurons in different columns innervate distinct peripheral targets (<a href=\"#bib39\">Landmesser, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bonanomi and Pfaff, 2010</a>). Spinal motor neurons in the lateral motor column (LMC) innervate the limbs and are therefore present only at brachial and lumbar levels. The LMC is divided into lateral (LMC<sub>L</sub>) and medial (LMC<sub>M</sub>) divisions, which innervate, respectively, the dorsal and ventral limb musculature."

Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling is required for the initial emergence of motor axons from the ventral face of the spinal cord, with ventral axons expressing the Cxcr4 receptor and thereby conferring responsiveness to Cxcl12, which is produced by the adjacent mesenchyme. Sema3A, which is produced throughout the limb bud mesenchyme, acts on Npn1-expressing motor axons shortly after these axons emerge from the spinal cord to control the timing of outgrowth and axon fasciculation; and Sema3F, which is produced in the dorsal limb mesenchyme, repels Npn2-expressing LMC<sub>M</sub> axons to promote a ventral trajectory. The dorsal/ventral decision is also controlled by cooperative and mutually reinforcing interactions between Ephrin/Eph and GDNF/Ret signaling. GDNF, which is produced in the dorsal limb bud, attracts LMC<sub>L</sub> axons, which express high levels of the Ret receptor. Ephrin-A, which is produced in the ventral limb bud, repels LMC<sub>L</sub> axons, which express EphA4. At present, the signaling pathways that determine more distal axon branching patterns and control the specificity of nerve-muscle recognition remain largely unknown."

Frizzled receptors are found throughout the animal kingdom and mediate at least three distinct types of signaling: (1) canonical signaling, in which Wnt binding to Frizzled activates an Lrp co-receptor to elicit stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin, which then migrates to the nucleus to control gene expression in cooperation with LEF/TCF transcription factors; (2) tissue polarity or planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, which acts in many epithelia and features the asymmetric localization of Frizzled and several other proteins in plasma membrane complexes to control cytoskeletal organization; and (3) Wnt/calcium signaling, the least understood of the three pathways, in which Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors leads to release of intracellular calcium (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angers and Moon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nusse, 2012</a>). The PCP pathway was discovered in <i>Drosophila</i> as a regulator of cuticular hair and bristle polarity (<a href=\"#bib64\">Simons and Mlodzik, 2008</a>). The core set of PCP proteins defined by the <i>Drosophila</i> experiments\u2014Frizzled, Dishevelled, Van Gogh/Strabismus, Prickle, Flamingo/Starry Night, and Diego\u2014are conserved in vertebrates. Over the past 15 years, studies in mice, frogs, and zebrafish have shown that core PCP genes play central roles in a wide variety of developmental processes that involve directional information: coordinating cell movements during neural tube elongation and closure (convergent/extension movements), setting up the global orientation of hairs within mammalian skin, orienting motile cilia within epithelia to produce coherent fluid flow, and orienting asymmetric bundles of stereocilia on the apical faces of auditory and vestibular sensory hair cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Nathans, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bayly and Axelrod, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</a>)."

Fz6 controls hair orientation, and Fz3 and Fz6 act redundantly to control inner ear sensory hair cell orientation and neural tube closure (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2006a</a>). Among Frizzled receptors, Fz3 is unique in its role in controlling axon guidance in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is required for the development of major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, and the thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and nigrostriatal tracts (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2006b</a>). Fz3 appears to be part of a system that provides directional information to growing axons, as indicated by the observation that in <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos commissural sensory axons in the spinal cord orient randomly instead of turning rostrally after midline crossing (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</a>). Virtually identical CNS axon phenotypes are observed in embryos lacking Celsr3, one of three mammalian homologues of the core PCP protein Flamingo/Starry Night (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tissir et al., 2005</a>). Fz3 and Celsr1-Celsr3 are also required for caudal and tangential migration of VII<sup>th</sup> cranial (facial branchiomotor) nerve neurons within the developing brainstem (<a href=\"#bib55\">Qu et al., 2010</a>). In the periphery, Fz3 and Celsr3 are required for correctly orienting enteric neurons within the gastrointestinal tract, and Fz3 is required for the development of sympathetic chain ganglia and innervation of sympathetic targets (<a href=\"#bib3\">Armstrong et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sasselli et al., 2013</a>)."

In the limb, the absence of <i>Fz3</i> leads to a specific stalling defect among LMC<sub>L</sub> axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in several other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, providing in vivo evidence for the general idea that as growing axons arrive at intermediate targets essential survival signals are relayed to their cell bodies."

Furthermore, Sox10 and NF immunolabeling within the dorsal clusters appear to be mutually exclusive or nearly so (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2032\u2032,F\u2032\u2032</a>), suggesting that at E11.5 the dorsal clusters consist of two classes of cells: immature NC cells at the migratory stage (Sox10<sup>+</sup>/NF<sup>-</sup>/Brn3a<sup>\u2212</sup>/Islet1/2<sup>\u2212</sup>) and more mature NC cells that are differentiating as DRG neurons (Sox10<sup>\u2212</sup>/NF<sup>+</sup>/Brn3a<sup>+</sup>/Islet1/2<sup>+</sup>).

This delay in apoptotic death among DRG neurons is not observed in the cervical region of E11.5 <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos, which is devoid of dorsal clusters. In DRGs, NC cells differentiate into neurons in greater numbers than are required for full target innervation, and the resulting competition for target-derived survival factors leads to the death of excess neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Oppenheim, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cowan, 2001</a>). Since apoptotic cell death in <i>WT</i> DRGs is well underway by E11.5, when most DRG axons are still far from their final targets, it is likely that intermediate targets are a major source of survival signals. The similar distributions along the spinal cord of dorsal clusters and delayed apoptosis suggested the possibility that in the lumber region of <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos there may be an initial reduction in the number of NC cells arriving at the DRG, leading to decreased competition for peripheral targets and higher rates of survival of DRG neurons."

For both the fore- and hindlimbs in <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos, several findings emerge: (1) the thinning of the dorsal nerve is highly significant statistically and it occurs over a remarkably small interval, between the regions labeled D<sub>Proximal</sub> and D<sub>Distal</sub> in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M</a>; (2) proximal to position D<sub>Proximal</sub>, dorsal nerve thinning is minimal and statistically insignificant; (3) the ventral nerve exhibits a small decrease in thickness in 5/6 comparisons, with 4/6 showing a difference that is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), implying that dorsal nerve axons have not rerouted to the ventral nerve, which would have then shown an increase in thickness; and (4) the average nerve thickness, relative to the littermate controls, is 31% for the dorsal nerve in the hindlimb, 57% for the dorsal nerve in the forelimb, and 82% for the ventral nerve when averaged over fore- and hindlimbs."

This experiment rules out any role for Fz3 in peripheral tissues. <i>Fz3</i> expression in DRG neurons also appears to be irrelevant since <i>Olig2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> is not expressed in DRG neurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Huettl et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Wichterle, 2012</a>), a conclusion that was further confirmed by inactivating the <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>CKO</i></sup> allele specifically in DRG neurons with a <i>Wnt1-Cre</i> transgene (<i>Wnt1-Cre</i>;<i>Fz3</i><sup><i>CKO/\u2212</i></sup>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Danielian et al., 1998</a>) and observing that the dorsal nerves innervating the fore- and hindlimbs were unaffected (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D\u2032</a>). These data imply that the LMC<sub>L</sub> motor axon defect is not an indirect consequence of Fz3-dependent effects on co-fasciculating sensory axons."

In the present study, the loss of <i>Fz3</i> blocks growth but does not alter path-finding among dorsal limb motor axons, and therefore presents as a pure stalling phenotype.

However, experiments with dissociated commissural neurons that express transfected Fz3 or Vangl2 tagged with fluorescent reporters show that Fz3 is enriched in intracellular vesicles and Vangl2 is localized throughout the growth cone plasma membrane with the highest concentration in filopodia (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shafer et al., 2011</a>). While current models of PCP protein action in growth cones are necessarily speculative, the axon growth phenotypes suggest that the signaling repertoire of PCP proteins is more diverse than would be predicted from considerations based only on epithelia. These and other Frizzled and Celsr phenotypes suggest that \u2018tissue polarity\u2019, the original name for the signals sent and received by this pathway, might be more apt than the epithelium-centric name \u2018planar cell polarity\u2019."

However, we would still like to propose this as the leading hypothesis to explain the data. Regarding the editor\u2019s next question and sentence: \u201cHow can a role for intermediate targets be distinguished from a role of the final target in survival? It is unclear whether the Fz3 mutant motor neurons die because of an intrinsic neuronal defect, a defect in the cell's ability to transport survival signals from intermediate or distal targets, or the failure of LMCl axons to contact distal targets that supply trophic support.\u201d This indicates that we have not clearly explained the argument. Our logic is as follows: (1) in the <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> spinal cord, the axons of motor neurons that innervate the dorsal limb stall at the base of the limb at E11.5; (2) the same motor neuron population (and only that population) undergoes massive cell death at the same age (E11.5); (3) in WT embryos, motor axons reach their final targets 2 days later (E13.5), at which time \u223c50% of motor neurons start to undergo developmental cell death; and (4), as described in the Discussion, the genetic elimination of all muscle cells (the distal/final target of motor neurons) in <i>Myf5</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup>;<i>MyoD</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> embryos (Kablar and Rudnycki, 1999) produces massive motor neuron death, but this wave of cell death only begins at the normal time, E13.5, i.e., when the motor axons arrive at the place where the muscle targets should be. Points (3) and (4) imply that the time window when trophic support from distal/final muscle targets becomes required for motor neuron survival begins at E13.5, as judged by the timing of motor neuron death in the absence of that support. Points (1) and (2) demonstrate that in <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> embryos, axon stalling and precocious motor neuron death occur two days prior to the arrival of WT motor axons at their final targets and two days prior to the time when trophic support from distal/final targets is needed to maintain WT motor neuron viability. Putting together points (1)-(4), we conclude that motor neuron death in <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> embryos in not due to trophic effects from the final distal/targets. Furthermore, the coincidence in time between axon stalling and motor neuron death in the same population of motor neurons in <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> embryos suggests that the two events may be mechanistically coupled, although a skeptic could argue that loss of <i>Fz3</i> produces axon stalling and cell death in the same subset of neurons at the same time via two unrelated processes."

However, such an undertaking would constitute a major and independent body of work. In vitro culture experiments that merely recapitulate the in vivo behavior of <i>Fz3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> axons without leading to real mechanistic insights would add only modestly to the present picture. As the work now stands, we believe it constitutes a comprehensive in vivo body of experimental data with several novel and well-documented biological findings, and therefore it makes sense to publish the body of work in essentially its present form. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section to provide more background on axon stalling and to address the growth vs guidance issue."
