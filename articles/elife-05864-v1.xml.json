To understand these processes, the evolution of cell shape, proliferation and gene expression must be quantified. This quantification is usually performed either in full 3D, which is computationally expensive and technically challenging, or on 2D planar projections, which introduces geometrical artifacts on highly curved organs. Here we present MorphoGraphX (<a href=\"http://www.MorphoGraphX.org\">www.MorphoGraphX.org</a>), a software that bridges this gap by working directly with curved surface images extracted from 3D data. In addition to traditional 3D image analysis, we have developed algorithms to operate on curved surfaces, such as cell segmentation, lineage tracking and fluorescence signal quantification. The software's modular design makes it easy to include existing libraries, or to implement new algorithms. Cell geometries extracted with MorphoGraphX can be exported and used as templates for simulation models, providing a powerful platform to investigate the interactions between shape, genes and growth."

To understand these processes, the evolution of cell shape, proliferation and gene expression must be quantified. This quantification is usually performed either in full 3D, which is computationally expensive and technically challenging, or on 2D planar projections, which introduces geometrical artifacts on highly curved organs. Here we present MorphoGraphX (<a href=\"http://www.MorphoGraphX.org\">www.MorphoGraphX.org</a>), a software that bridges this gap by working directly with curved surface images extracted from 3D data. In addition to traditional 3D image analysis, we have developed algorithms to operate on curved surfaces, such as cell segmentation, lineage tracking and fluorescence signal quantification. The software's modular design makes it easy to include existing libraries, or to implement new algorithms. Cell geometries extracted with MorphoGraphX can be exported and used as templates for simulation models, providing a powerful platform to investigate the interactions between shape, genes and growth."

Key to this methodology is the combination of time-lapse microscopy to quantify changes in cell geometry and gene expression with dynamic spatial modeling (<a href=\"#bib26\">J\u00f6nsson et al., 2012</a>). Confocal microscopy is frequently the tool of choice for data collection, as the proliferation of fluorescence markers and variations in the method make it possible to visualize proteins, organelles, cell boundaries, and even protein\u2013protein interaction and protein movement in vivo. Other technologies such as serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</a>) make it possible to study sub-cellular structures at a much higher resolution on fixed samples. However, despite the rapid advancement of 3D imaging technologies, there is a lack of methods and software to process and quantify these data and to integrate them within simulation environments."

This is not surprising since many key biological processes occur on surfaces, for example in epithelial layers (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Savaldi-Goldstein et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heller et al., 2014</a>). Morphogenesis involves complex 3D deformation, such as folding during gastrulation in animal systems or bulging out of new lateral organs in plants, causing significant curvature in the tissues controlling these events. It is therefore essential to be able to quantify cell shapes and fluorescence-based reporters on curved surface layers of cells. The simplest method to achieve this is to take several image slices and project them onto a single plane (<a href=\"#bib7\">Butler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chickarmane et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kuchen et al., 2012</a>). However, when trying to quantify cell shape change, division orientations, or growth, distortions due to the projection quickly become too large as the angle between the surface and the projection plane increases. Even small amounts of tissue curvature can hinder the accurate imaging of a single cell layer over an entire sample. To alleviate some of these issues, methods have been developed to determine the 3D position of cell junctions on the surface, while the segmentation into cells is still performed on flat 2D images (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">de Reuille et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</a>). However these approaches are labor intensive, limited to tissues that can be visualized as a flat 2D image, and are not accurate when the angle of the tissue with the projection plane becomes too large. Furthermore, methods based on tissue casts combined with stereo reconstruction of SEM images (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</a>) need to be combined with methods using fluorescent markers (<a href=\"#bib60\">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</a>) if gene expression is to be monitored."

In addition to 2D curved surfaces, MorphoGraphX also possesses a rich set of tools for full 3D image processing and cell segmentation, and can be used to easily transfer realistic cell geometries and fluorescent marker data into computational modeling environments. MorphoGraphX is built from a collection of loadable modules (shared libraries), centered around an interactive visualization core that exploits the latest features of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This design allows the software to be easily adapted to changing research needs, and facilitates the integration of algorithms from other open-source imaging processing libraries into a custom work flow. The software is the first of its kind specialized to process curved surface layers of cells, and here we demonstrate its capabilities both in plant and animal systems."

                                "text": "A key strength of MorphoGraphX is the ability to summarize 3D data as a curved surface image. After extracting the shape of an organ, 3D data just below the surface can be projected onto it, creating a curved image of the outer layer of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This enables the extraction of precise cell outlines without the distortions associated with a flat 2D projection (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We have found that many algorithms designed for 2 and 3D image processing can be adapted to our curved surface images. Feature extraction in MorphoGraphX typically follows a pattern: (i) volumetric data (often a cell outline marker) is pre-processed to remove noise or obstructions; (ii) the object of interest is turned into a mask (binary image); (iii) the object is extracted as a surface mesh; (iv) volumetric data is projected onto the surface; (v) the projection is used for segmentation of the surface into cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The segmentation can be fully automatic (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) or directed by manually placed seeds. Steps (i\u2013iii) can be repeated as surfaces of interest will often be used to help pre-processing the volumetric data. For example, surfaces can be used to trim the 3D image (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), or to select regions of interest for data analysis."

An extreme example of this is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> where the surface has been shaped to display the cortical cells of a mature <i>Arabidopsis</i> embryo. The Bezier surface can be converted to a triangular mesh, and segmented into cells with the same procedure used for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013E</a>. The extracted tissue geometry can be then used, for example, as template for simulations (<a href=\"#bib48\">Santuari et al., 2011</a>)."

This allows the quantification of genetic expression and protein localization at the cellular, or sub-cellular scale. As with the cell outlines, the projection creates a curved image of the data that can be processed in a similar way as a planar 2D image. Many tools commonly used for the analysis of flat images (for example in softwares such as Adobe Photoshop, Gimp and ImageJ) have been adapted for use on curved surfaces in MorphoGraphX. This includes Gaussian blur, erosion, dilation, morphological closing, local minima detection, normalization, etc. The flexibility of this approach is demonstrated by our implementation of more complex algorithms, such as the watershed transform for cell segmentation and our adaptation of an algorithm based on signal gradients to compute the orientation of microtubules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) that was previously implemented in 2D (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boudaoud et al., 2014</a>)."

This enables the analysis of stacks before and after experimental treatments, or time-lapse data. This capability relies on an efficient method to co-segment samples from two time points. One approach is to segment both stacks separately and then to use an automated algorithm to match the points (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fernandez et al., 2010</a>). However, automatic segmentation and matching can be prone to errors that have to be checked and corrected by hand, which can be very time-consuming depending on the error rate. For this we have developed a user-friendly interface in MorphoGraphX to manually identify cell lineages on curved surfaces representing the tissue at different time points (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Errors in lineage are detected automatically by comparing the neighborhoods of daughter cells and their parents. Once the co-segmentation is complete, changes in cell area or gene expression over the interval between two time points can be computed and visualized as a heatmap (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Cell proliferation can also be visualized as a colormap (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vlad et al., 2014</a>), along with marking of the new walls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Pairwise correspondence between time points can be combined in longer time series (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), for example to perform clonal analysis over several days (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vlad et al., 2014</a>).

The shoot apex is the source of all the aerial structure of the plant. At the summit, a slow growing central zone harbors the stem cell niche, surrounded by a fast growing peripheral zone where organ initiation occurs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Steeves and Sussex, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002</a>). The analysis in MorphoGraphX starts with surface extraction followed by manual or automatic segmentation (<a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2, 3</a>), and lineage matching (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>) of all of the time points in the series. We observed similar patterns of growth, cell proliferation and organ geometry in the tomato shoot apex as those reported in other species (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwiatkowska and Dumais, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grandjean et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kwiatkowska, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Reddy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kwiatkowska and Routier-Kierzkowska, 2009</a>). The first geometrical indicator of primordium initiation we noted was a slightly elevated curvature at the corner of the meristem (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwiatkowska and Dumais, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kwiatkowska, 2004</a>). This early change in shape coincided with increased growth in the peripheral zone. The peripheral zone itself displayed differential growth dependent on the dynamics of primordium initiation. Regions adjacent to older primordia exhibited fast, highly anisotropic expansion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, the part of the meristem closest to the newly separated primordium (P1 in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) was not distinguishable based on growth rates. As previously observed in <i>Anagallis arvensis</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwiatkowska and Dumais, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kwiatkowska and Routier-Kierzkowska, 2009</a>), this accelerating growth of the peripheral zone progressively pushed away newly formed organs as they differentiated, making more space available on the meristem for further initiation and suggesting a possible feedback between lateral organ growth and meristem expansion."

Interestingly, while auxin activity is already visible at the first sign of primordium initiation, DR5 expression does not strictly correlate with growth. In particular, no DR5 signal is detected in the fast expanding regions close to older primordia. We also found that DR5 expression is present in the crease separating young primordia from the meristem, an area where the cells exhibited a slight decrease in surface area (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

However, volumetric segmentation requires very high quality of signals, since the cell outlines must be visible from all angles. For plant tissues, which often display autofluorescence, 3D segmentation of cells from confocal images is therefore mainly used in the case of cleared, fixed samples (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bassel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yoshida et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>) or limited to the outermost layers of cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A, 6D</a>). The penetration of confocal images for 3D segmentation of live samples could be improved by using multi-photon confocal microscopy. Another possibility is to combine confocal stacks acquired from different angles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fernandez et al., 2010</a>).

The cells were segmented on the curved 2D surface, and the process was repeated from the same sample by segmenting the surface layer of cells in full 3D. The heat maps of volume increase in 3D show the same areas of slow and fast growth as the surface segmentation. In cases when the tissue thickness is preserved over growth, as in the epidermal layer of the shoot apex, tracking cell expansion on the surface is therefore a reasonable approximation for volumetric cell expansion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>)."

While automatic segmentation is faster in the case of high quality data, manual seeding is recommended in regions where part of the signal is too faint or blurry, partially masking the cell outline. To estimate the error in our auto-segmentation method, we compared the number of cells segmented automatically vs manually on the same region of two high quality samples. For a tomato shoot apex sample, the auto-segmentation error rate was about 2%, with only 12 cells under-segmented (fused) and 1 cell over-segmented (split) over a total of 576 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

Automatic seeding considerably shortens the time needed to segment large samples, such as a <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

The method is especially powerful for time-lapse confocal imaging, where laser exposure has to be kept to a minimum, limiting penetration to the outermost layers of the sample. In addition to curved surface image processing, MorphoGraphX provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the visualization and editing of 3D volumetric data, making it possible to digitally remove obstructing objects from the surface of interest, such as the peripodial membrane overlying the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2012</a>).

MorphoGraphX is implemented as a collection of shared libraries, and new libraries can be added or removed without recompiling MorphoGraphX. This combines the functionality of plugins with the computational efficiency of C++. The most common operations for 3D visualization, filtering and editing have been written to exploit the massively parallel architecture of modern graphics cards, which can have thousands of processing cores. As a result, 3D operations that would normally be very slow to run on a common PC take seconds to perform, making use of the computational power of inexpensive consumer graphics cards. Many of the more complex operations use the multi-core capabilities of the CPU. This makes most operations interactive and user-friendly, allowing the researcher to easily experiment with new work flows, algorithms and parameters. The flexibility of MorphoGraphX also simplifies the development of modules to import 3D voxel data and cellular or surfaces meshes from other custom imaging platforms. Such bridges have been created to import data from recently published growth tracking softwares including the MARS-ALT multi angle reconstruction pipeline (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fernandez et al., 2010</a>), and the stereo SEM reconstruction software (<a href=\"#bib45\">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</a>)."

C++ processes can access all the internal data structures used in MorphoGraphX and modify them as needed. They can also call other processes or query for their existence, and get parameter values in a uniform way from the graphical user interface. The last parameter values used for each process are stored in the project (.mgxv) file for future reference. All process calls and their parameters are logged to a re-playable python script log file created in the current directory. Each process is represented as a light C++ object defining the name, parameters and code of the process and is bundled in shared libraries for easy distribution. The shared library is placed into a system or user process folder, and the processes it contains are loaded upon startup."

The rendering uses a modified front-to-back depth peeling technique (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everitt, 2001</a>) interweaving the volumetric rendering between peels of translucent surfaces. The volumetric rendering itself is done using volume ray casting (<a href=\"#bib36\">Levoy, 1990</a>), using the depth of the successive pair of peels to limit the ray casting to the region currently being rendered. This method allows for correct polygon\u2013polygon and polygon-volume intersections. Combined with occlusion detection, we implemented early ray termination when the total opacity of the current fragment becomes too high for subsequent peels to be visible."

Next the surface is extracted using a variant of the marching cubes algorithm (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bloomenthal, 1988</a>). Fairly large cubes are used, creating a relatively coarse mesh and avoiding the extraction of very small features due to surface noise (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Once a coarse surface mesh is extracted, it is uniformly subdivided. The resolution of this initial mesh has to be sufficient for a first segmentation, which can be subsequently refined."

The image is segmented into cells using a seeded watershed segmentation algorithm. After blurring the image, auto-seeding is performed by finding local minima of signal within a given radius. Seeds are then propagated with watershed. Depending on the radius used for detecting the local minima, several seeds can be placed within a single cell, resulting in over-segmentation. The cells are later merged, based on the relative strength of signal on the walls separating them (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Normalization of the signal with a radius greater than that of the largest cell typically improves merging results. For convenience, the processes are chained together in a single auto-segmentation process. The final segmentation is then manually corrected. The amount of manual correction required can vary depending on signal quality, and in some cases it can be more efficient to perform some or all of the seeding manually."

To extract the geometry more precisely, the mesh can be subdivided specifically at the interfaces between cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) or in areas of high signal intensity. After subdivision the signal is re-projected, and the surface segmented again. The seeds are retained during this process so that re-seeding is not required. Several steps of subdivision and re-segmentation can be applied until the desired precision is achieved (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The resulting mesh will be dense around the areas of interest (e.g., the interface between cells), while keeping the areas of low interest (the inside of cells) coarse, thus limiting the total size of the mesh file."

The mesh can be simplified to contain only vertices necessary to describe each cell contour and the connections between neighbor cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Plant cells do not slide with respect to each other, therefore the junction between cell walls can be used as landmarks to track tissue deformation over time series (<a href=\"#bib21\">Green et al., 1991</a>). Combined with the cell lineage information, the simplified cellular mesh (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is used to find the correspondence between cell junctions in meshes extracted from different time points (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). After identifying pairs of junctions conserved in both meshes using the lineage information, we project for each cell the junctions on the average cell plane and compute a best fit of the 2D transformation (translation, rotation, anisotropic scaling) that will minimize the squared distance between pairs of junctions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goodall and Green, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</a>).

In that case the vertices belonging to the cell outline are used to compute the principal curvatures for each cell center, within a given periphery. Color maps resulting from the computation of growth, curvature, signal quantification, etc. can be written to a spreadsheet giving easy access for further processing. Similarly, cell axis vectors can also be exported to be either re-rendered in MorphoGraphX or loaded for further analysis using other software, such as Matlab or Python."
