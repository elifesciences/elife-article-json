The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIE consists of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Here we have identified and characterised the function of the TFIIE\u03b2 homologue in archaea that on the primary sequence level is related to the RNAPIII subunit hRPC39. Both archaeal TFE\u03b2 and hRPC39 harbour a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster, which is crucial for heterodimerization of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 and its engagement with the RNAP clamp. TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stabilises the preinitiation complex, enhances DNA melting, and stimulates abortive and productive transcription. These activities are strictly dependent on the \u03b2 subunit and the promoter sequence. Our results suggest that archaeal TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 is likely to represent the evolutionary ancestor of TFIIE-like factors in extant eukaryotes."
