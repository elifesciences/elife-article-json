Here, we develop novel computational methods to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of Myosin II during GBE, at the scale of the tissue. We show that initial Myosin II bipolar cell polarization gives way to unipolar enrichment at parasegmental boundaries and two further boundaries within each parasegment, concomitant with a doubling of cell number as the tissue elongates. These boundaries are the primary sites of cell intercalation, behaving as mechanical barriers and providing a mechanism for how cells remain ordered during GBE. Enrichment at parasegment boundaries during GBE is independent of Wingless signaling, suggesting pair-rule gene control. Our results are consistent with recent work showing that a combinatorial code of Toll-like receptors downstream of pair-rule genes contributes to Myosin II polarization via local cell-cell interactions. We propose an updated cell-cell interaction model for Myosin II polarization that we tested in a vertex-based simulation."

Here, we develop novel computational methods to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of Myosin II during GBE, at the scale of the tissue. We show that initial Myosin II bipolar cell polarization gives way to unipolar enrichment at parasegmental boundaries and two further boundaries within each parasegment, concomitant with a doubling of cell number as the tissue elongates. These boundaries are the primary sites of cell intercalation, behaving as mechanical barriers and providing a mechanism for how cells remain ordered during GBE. Enrichment at parasegment boundaries during GBE is independent of Wingless signaling, suggesting pair-rule gene control. Our results are consistent with recent work showing that a combinatorial code of Toll-like receptors downstream of pair-rule genes contributes to Myosin II polarization via local cell-cell interactions. We propose an updated cell-cell interaction model for Myosin II polarization that we tested in a vertex-based simulation."

This revealed reproducible patterns of actomyosin enrichment. As embryos elongated, the actomyosin cytoskeleton redistributed itself inside the cells: whereas at the start two opposite sides of each cell were enriched in actomyosin (a bipolar distribution), at later times the enrichment occurred on just one side (a unipolar distribution)."

These collective cell behaviours have been mostly studied in the context of axis elongation that accompanies gastrulation in bilaterian animals, but are also found in organogenesis, for example underlying kidney tubule elongation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keller, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tada and Heisenberg, 2012</a>). Understanding convergence and extension movements is important as their failure is associated with congenital diseases, including neural tube defects (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wallingford et al., 2013</a>). The first molecular mechanism for convergence and extension was found in <i>Drosophila</i>, where planar polarisation of actomyosin was shown to underlie the polarised cell rearrangements of germband extension (GBE) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bertet et al., 2004</a>). This discovery paved the way for in-depth studies of how the planar polarisation of actomyosin and other components such as Bazooka (Par-3) and E-Cadherin drives the selective shortening of cell-cell junctions during active intercalation of epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004;\ufeff</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib47\">Rauzi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Levayer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Levayer and Lecuit, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blankenship et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tamada et al., 2012</a>). Recently, actomyosin planar polarisation was also found to be required during convergence and extension in vertebrate tissues (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rozbicki et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nishimura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lienkamp et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</a>)."

In vertebrates, the conserved planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway controls planar cell rearrangements during axis extension (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wallingford, 2012</a>). In the <i>Xenopus</i> model, this pathway was recently shown to do so by biasing the polarisation of actomyosin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, the PCP pathway is not required for polarisation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</a>), which instead depends on the segmentation cascade, the most downstream cues being the striped expression of pair-rule transcription factors such as Eve or Runt (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bertet et al., 2004</a>). Misexpression of these pair-rule transcription factors causes a local reorientation of polarity, which led to the hypothesis that local cell-cell interactions generate planar polarity in the <i>Drosophila</i> germband, rather than more global cues (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</a>). Recent work has provided molecular evidence for this; three Toll-like receptors are expressed in overlapping stripes in the early embryo under the control of the pair-rule genes <i>eve</i> and <i>runt</i> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). Genetic disruption of these receptors leads to defects in GBE and a corresponding loss of the planar polarisation of Myosin II and Bazooka in the tissue. A model was proposed in which the germband is planar polarised through the preferential enrichment of Myosin II at sites of heterophilic Toll-like receptor interactions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). The overlapping expression domains of Toll-like receptors would therefore establish a combinatorial code where every cell along the antero-posterior (AP) axis has a different 'identity', resulting in the bipolar distribution of Myosin II in every cell."

One is what becomes of the combinatorial code and the planar polarisation of Myosin II once the cells have started intercalating and the number of cells increases along AP? Specifically, if the cell identity stripes defined by the Toll-like receptor code are one cell wide to start with as hypothesised (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>), then these would increase to two cells wide on average after one round of cell intercalation. Heterophilic interactions between Toll receptors would no longer be expected at the interfaces between pairs of cells of the same 'identity'. Therefore one possibility is that these interfaces are not enriched in Myosin II at later stages of GBE. Alternatively, a secondary mechanism might be required to polarise the germband in later GBE, for example relying on a global polarising signal, more akin to PCP pathway-reliant polarisation in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib13\">Devenport, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</a>)."

Cell rearrangements by intercalation are sufficient to cause mixing of adjacent cell populations (<a href=\"#bib58\">Umetsu et al., 2014</a>), therefore it is likely that a mechanism exists to maintain order along the AP axis of the germband. At later stages of embryonic development in <i>Drosophila</i>, an enrichment of actomyosin at parasegmental boundary (PSB) cell-cell interfaces is required to prevent cell intermingling caused by cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">2011</a>). The actomyosin enrichment in this case is thought to act as a mechanical barrier, since the enriched PSB cell-cell interfaces align, indicating line tension. Supporting this notion, laser ablation experiments have demonstrated an increase in interfacial tension at compartmental boundaries in the wing disc and abdomen (<a href=\"#bib58\">Umetsu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aliee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Landsberg et al., 2009</a>). Since parasegmental boundaries are defined genetically by pair-rule gene expression before gastrulation starts (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lawrence and Johnston, 1989</a>), an unexplored possibility is that actomyosin enrichments at PSBs could form early, during GBE, and limit intermingling of cells during the large-scale cell rearrangements of convergence and extension."

We aimed to develop an analysis of these at the scale of the tissue, in living wild-type embryos. In particular, we asked what the relationship is between the described bipolar distribution of Myosin II at AP interfaces early in GBE and the later formation of parasegmental boundaries that stop mixing between anterior and posterior compartments. We show that Myosin II has a bipolar distribution in early embryos, which then transitions to a unipolar distribution as a direct consequence of polarised cell intercalation in the germband. Such an observation strongly supports that a cell identity mechanism polarises Myosin II throughout the whole of GBE. We show that the boundaries defined by the unipolar patterns, which include the PSBs, are the sites of the cell intercalation events driving GBE. We demonstrate that the PSB is a distinct mechanical structure from very early in GBE. These findings suggest that the boundaries we identify have a dual role, driving axis extension while ensuring that cell mixing remains limited. Finally, we propose an updated differential cell identity model."

To quantify changes in Myosin II polarisation during GBE, we imaged the ventral surface of <i>Drosophila</i> embryos co-expressing the fluorescent fusion proteins <i>GAP43-mCherry</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Martin et al., 2010</a>), to label the cell membranes, and <i>sqh-GFP</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Royou et al., 2004</a>), to label Myosin II (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Because <i>sqh-GFP</i> was expressed in a <i>sqh<sup>AX3</sup></i> null mutant background, all Myosin II molecules were tagged with GFP (<a href=\"#bib49\">Royou et al., 2004</a>). Images were acquired every 30 s, from before the start of extension, until the enrichment of Myosin II at parasegmental boundaries (PSBs) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>) was clearly detectable at the end of extension (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The <i>GAP43-mCherry</i> signal was used to segment and track apical cell membranes over time (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Butler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lye et al., 2015</a>), while the <i>sqh-GFP</i> signal was used to quantify Myosin II fluorescence intensities for each cell-cell interface identified by cell tracking (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We synchronised movies from 6 embryos to the start of GBE, using our previously described measure of tissue strain rate in the anteroposterior (AP) axis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butler et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Apical cell-cell interfaces are tracked over time based on the cell membrane signal. Next, Myosin II fluorescence intensities associated with the tracked cell-cell interfaces are quantified. Six movies were collected. VML: ventral midline. SEM image on the left from Flybase (<a href=\"#bib14\">dos Santos et al., 2015</a>).

(<b>C</b>) Fourier quantification of Myosin II bipolarity, depicted here on a movie frame 8.5\u00a0min\u00a0after GBE onset. The length of the bipolar green vector represents the amplitude of polarity and its angle, the orientation of the polarity relative to the AP embryonic axis. Because the polarity is essentially aligned along the AP embryonic axis (rosette in <b>C\u2019</b>), the polarity amplitude can be projected onto the AP axis and quantified using a Gaussian fit which allows a better separation between bidirectional and unidirectional polarity signals, compared to the Fourier method (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). (<b>C\u201d</b>) Amplitude of Myosin II bidirectional polarity along the AP axis and over time, calculated using the Gaussian method. (<b>D</b>) Fourier quantification of Myosin II unidirectional polarity, shown on a movie frame 39\u00a0min after GBE onset. The length of the unipolar green vector represents the amplitude of polarity and its slope, the orientation of the polarity relative to the AP embryonic axis (see corresponding rosette in <b>D\u2019</b>). The vector either points towards the anterior or the posterior, depending which side of a given cell is enriched in Myosin II. (<b>D\u201d</b>) Absolute amplitude of Myosin II unidirectional polarity along the AP axis and over time, calculated using the Gaussian method (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Movie frames corresponding to 0 and 50 min\u00a0are shown on the left. At time 0, the mesoderm is invaginating through the ventral furrow (VF, white streak in the middle of the image). Mesoderm and mesectoderm cells on either side of the VF are not included in the analysis, nor are the germband cells at the posterior, because these move out of the field of view with the convergence extension of the tissue. Germband cells included in the analysis are labelled in magenta on both frames. At 50 min, most of the cells in the field of view are included in the analysis, except the mesectoderm cells at the midline (VML) and very dorsal germband cells coming in the field of view (bottom). The amplitude of Myosin II bipolarity is expressed as a proportion (Abbreviated as pp in all figures) of the mean Myosin II intensity around the perimeter of each cell. Scale shows highest bidirectional polarity in bright green and no polarity in black. White lines on the plot follow the displacement of AP coordinates over time, which move posteriorly as the tissue undergoes extension. (<b>F</b>) Spatio-temporal map showing Myosin II unidirectional polarity for the same representative movie. The amplitude of unipolarity is expressed as a proportion (pp) of mean Myosin II intensities at cell-cell interfaces.

Myosin II fluorescence intensities (f.i., y-axis) are plotted along the unwrapped cell perimeter from 0 to 360 degrees (x-axis), starting from the East side of the cell and going anti-clockwise. (<b>B-D\u2019</b>) We used two different methods, 'Fourier' and 'Gaussian', to identify one (unidirectional polarity) or two (bidirectional polarity) peaks in the Myosin II fluorescence signal around the perimeter of each cell. Graphs <b>B-D</b>\u2019 show simulated data for a cell with either bidirectional polarity in Myosin II (<b>B</b>,<b>B\u2019</b>) or unidirectional polarity (<b>C</b>,<b>C\u2019</b>) or a mixture of the two (<b>D</b>,<b>D\u2019</b>). In the first method (<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>), Fourier decomposition gave period 1 (unidirectional polarity) and period 2 (bidirectional polarity) amplitude estimates. In the second method (<b>B\u2019</b>, <b>C\u2019</b>, <b>D\u2019</b>), two Gaussians curves with their means 180 degrees apart were fitted to Myosin II fluorescence intensities through minimisation, varying the amplitude of each Gaussian curve and a standard deviation common to both. (<b>B</b>, <b>B\u2019</b>) Example cell with bidirectional polarity. Both Fourier (<b>B</b>) and Gaussian (<b>B\u2019</b>) methods succeed well at fitting the two peaks of Myosin II intensities (fluorescence intensities, f. i., represented as a black castellated curve as in <b>A</b>,<b>A\u2019</b>). (<b>C</b>, <b>C\u2019</b>) Example cell with unidirectional polarity. The Fourier method fits a unidirectional peak at the correct position, but because the Myosin II signal is discrete, or castellated, there is also a strong period 2 harmonic in phase with the unidirectional signal. Thus with the Fourier method, the quantification of uni- and bi- directional polarities is not completely independent: specifically the period 2 estimate used for estimating bidirectional polarity will also describe some of the unidirectional polarity signal\u00a0(<b>C</b>). Gaussian fitting finds the correct unidirectional peak (<b>C\u2019</b>). (<b>D</b>, <b>D\u2019</b>) Example cell with a combination of uni- and bidirectional polarity. Similar to (<b>C</b>), the period 2 amplitude is augmented by the castellated signal in the Fourier method (<b>D</b>), whereas the Gaussian fitting correctly identifies two independent peaks of different amplitude: the smallest amplitude identified by the West peak (blue) corresponds to the bidirectional polarity, whereas the higher East peak correspond to the unidirectional polarity (<b>D\u2019</b>)."

(<b>A</b>) PSBs are identified at the end of the movie by strong enrichments in actomyosin (arrows). (<b>B</b>) These are used to manually identify each parasegment (differently coloured cell centroids). Note that the mesectodermal cells (ME, highlighted in yellow) present at the midline are not included in our analyses. (<b>C</b>,<b>D</b>) Using parasegment identification, we define 3 classes of linked columns of interfaces, the PSB interfaces (green) and those one cell anterior (named \u2018-1\u2019, in blue) and posterior (named \u2018+1\u2019, in red) to the PSB, shown in a schematic (<b>C</b>) and on the representative movie frame (<b>D</b>). (<b>E</b>) Myosin II fluorescence intensities (y-axis) found at the three different classes of interfaces over time (x-axis) for the six <i>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</i> embryos. Solid lines represent means. Ribbons (error bands) show an indicative confidence interval of the mean, calculated as a sum of the variance of the embryo means and the mean of the within-embryo variances. Blue and red bars at the top of the panel show time intervals over which -1 and +1 interfaces, respectively, differ from the PSB. Significance is calculated for each one-minute bin using a mixed model (\u2018lmer4\u2019 package in \u2018R\u2019) using variation between embryos as the random effect. We use p&lt;0.0005 as the significance threshold, which corresponds to a 0.05 threshold (*) modified by a Bonferroni correction to take into account the 81 one-minutes bins. The same conventions for displaying confidence intervals and statistical significance are used in all subsequent ribbon plots.

The kymograph shows the vertices recoil after ablation (black frame indicated by yellow arrow at time zero). Time corresponds to -3.65 to 29.95 s relative to ablation. The changes in distance between vertices as measured on similar kymographs for each ablation are plotted in (<b>H</b>). The graph shows the mean change in vertex distance over time for ablations at PSB (black) and +1 (red) interfaces (N=19 ablated junctions for each). Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval of the mean. (<b>I</b>) Graph showing linear regression (solid lines) for the first 5 time points after ablation. The 95% confidence interval of the regressed line is also shown (dotted lines). The data did not significantly deviate from linearity. Slopes were significantly different, with gradients of 0.2245 (+-0.02665) for PSBs and 0.1084 (+-0.0201) for +1s, so a ratio of 2.07 between the two.

A LOWESS curve with a smoothing window of 10 points has been fitted to the data, for this graph and all other interface alignment graphs. Statistical comparisons are shown for the time point 40 min\u00a0(Cumulative interface orientation distribution for all interfaces at 40 min are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>).

Note that in these maps, the data for all cells along the dorsoventral (DV) axis, within an AP bin of defined width, are averaged. Myosin II bidirectional enrichment is strong across the whole AP axis from just before the start of extension until about 20\u00a0min, then fades away (green signal in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In the unidirectional polarity maps, cells with posterior interfaces enriched in Myosin II (positive values, magenta signal) are distinguished from those where the enrichment is at anterior interfaces (negative values, green signal) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). A juxtaposition of opposing unidirectional polarities along the AP axis (magenta next to green signal) thus indicates that shared interfaces between neighbouring cells are enriched in Myosin II. Although the signal is noisy for single embryos, many such juxtapositions are found (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These motifs follow the movement of the tissue as it extends towards the posterior (white guide lines in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The most prominent ones occur at a regular spacing (arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We hypothesised that those correspond to early cable-like enrichments of Myosin II at parasegmental boundaries (PSBs)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>)."

First, we identified PSBs from clear cable-like enrichments of Myosin II at the end of the 6 movies analysed above, 60 min after the start of GBE (arrows in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Using these boundaries, we manually assigned a parasegment identity to each tracked cell (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which could be followed back to the beginning of each movie. This identified PSB cell-cell interfaces at each time point (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We also identified the cell-cell interfaces one-cell diameter anterior and posterior to each PSB (named \u2018-1\u2019 and \u2018+1\u2019 interfaces, respectively) over time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). We then quantified the amount of Myosin II found at these three columns of interfaces over time for 3 to 4 parasegments per embryo, for all 6 embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We found that the enrichment in Myosin II at PSB interfaces becomes stronger than in the flanking columns of interfaces by 10\u201315 min\u00a0of extension. If these cell-cell interfaces enriched in Myosin II were interconnected, they would be expected to straighten, a signature of line tension as shown for other tissue boundaries (<a href=\"#bib58\">Umetsu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aliee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Landsberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fagotto, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Calzolari et al., 2014</a>). To test this, we quantified the proportion of interfaces oriented between 60 and 90 degrees relative to the AP axis (thus DV-oriented), for each class (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,J</a>). We find that PSB interfaces are more DV-oriented compared to flanking -1 and +1 interfaces, throughout most of GBE (note that all interfaces become briefly very DV-oriented at the beginning of GBE, which is caused by mesoderm invagination transiently stretching the germband cells along DV, see <a href=\"#bib39\">Lye et al., 2015</a>). We interpret this as evidence that PSB interfaces align more than flanking interfaces. Together with the preferential enrichment in Myosin II at PSBs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), this suggests that PSB interfaces are under higher tension than flanking interfaces during GBE."

We ablated interfaces located at the PSBs at 40 min\u00a0(identified by their enrichment in Myosin II, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) and compared them with the ablation of +1 interfaces (one cell diameter posterior to PSB). We checked that PSB and +1 interfaces selected for ablation did not have significantly different lengths (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). PSB interfaces had more Myosin II than +1 interfaces, as expected (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). PSB interfaces are also more DV-oriented than +1 interfaces (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>) as expected from our interface alignment analysis. We found that PSB vertices recoiled significantly faster than +1 interfaces and to a greater extent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). We estimated the difference in recoil velocities to be a factor of 2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). This confirms that PSB interfaces are under higher tension than flanking interfaces and validates our interface alignment analysis."

We found that <i>eve-EGFP</i> reliably marks the anterior edge of odd-numbered parasegments throughout GBE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013F</a>). This allowed us as before to assign parasegment identities to cells and to track the PSB and flanking -1 and +1 interfaces at odd-numbered PSBs through time, for 3 <i>eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</i> movies. We confirmed that interface orientation differences between PSB and flanking interfaces were replicated in these movies, where PSBs are labelled without relying on their enrichment in Myosin II (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>). Together, these results show that PSB interfaces are mechanically active by 15\u201320 min\u00a0at the latest after GBE onset, much earlier than their previously known role at stage 10 when they segregate dividing boundary cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>). Since cell division in the germ-band ectoderm does not commence until 40 min\u00a0after GBE onset in our movies (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), this suggested that PSBs have an early mechanical role during polarised cell intercalation."

To test this, we generated 3 movies expressing <i>eve-GFP</i> and <i>GAP43-mCherry</i> in a <i>wingless</i> null mutant background (<i>wg<sup>CX4</sup>; eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</i> embryos). We performed the same interface orientation analysis as before, and found that the PSBs straightened in <i>wingless</i> mutant embryos as in wildtype (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K and L</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1K and L</a>). We also quantified Myosin II enrichment at PSBs (relative to +1 interfaces) in fixed embryos at stages 8 to 11 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1M\u2013M\u201d\u2019</a>). Although Myosin II is significantly decreased in <i>wingless</i> mutants at PSBs once the germband has finished extending (stages 9, 10 and 11), confirming our previous findings (<a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">2011</a>), we found no difference during GBE (stage 8). We conclude that the selective enrichment in Myosin II at PSB interfaces and their straightening during GBE is not controlled by Wingless, suggesting that it is under pair-rule gene control."

                                "text": "There were more unidirectional polarity patterns in our spatiotemporal maps than just those corresponding to PSBs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To characterise those, we increased the resolution of our maps by averaging the data collected for each of the 6 <i>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</i> movies. We used our identification of PSB interfaces to attribute a within-parasegment coordinate value to each cell from 0 (anterior-most) to 1 (posterior-most) over time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Using this coordinate system, we averaged data from 3 to 4 parasegments per movie for our 6 movies. We replotted bidirectional and unidirectional polarity patterns at this parasegmental scale (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Confirming individual movie maps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), we found that AP-oriented bidirectional Myosin II polarisation is strong across parasegmental domains until about 15 min\u00a0after extension, decreasing thereafter (bright to dark green signal in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; statistics in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,D</a>). In contrast, unidirectional polarity emerges gradually from the start of GBE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; statistics in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,C,E</a>). First, as expected, anterior and posterior interfaces at PSBs have strong Myosin II enrichments of opposite sign, from as early as 10 min\u00a0after GBE onset (green and magenta respectively at each edge of the plot in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Second, the increase in resolution reveals two more positions along the AP axis where anterior and posterior unidirectional polarities alternate (magenta/green boundaries highlighted with arrows in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; statistics in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This suggests that there are columns of interfaces in at least two stereotypical locations within each parasegment that become enriched in Myosin II. This gradual transition from global bidirectional polarities to precisely located unidirectional polarities suggested that new DV-oriented junctions not enriched in Myosin II form as a consequence of cell rearrangements. To monitor the progress of cell rearrangements, we quantified the number of cells across the parasegmental domains over time. The average number of cells per parasegment width (along AP) almost exactly doubles, from 3.6 cells at the start of axis extension to 7.3 after 60 min\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). This shows that the emergence of unidirectional polarity is concurrent with the progress of polarised cell intercalation."

The anterior-most position is recorded as 0 (red in the heat scale) and the posterior-most position is recorded as 1 (blue). This coordinate system is used to pool cell information from all the different parasegments present throughout each movie, in order to look for stereotypical within-parasegment patterns.

(<b>E</b>) Diagram showing the proposed model: at the start of GBE, 3 to 4 cells of distinct identity per parasegment enrich Myosin II at their shared interfaces. After cell rearrangement, stripes of cells of the same identity become adjacent. Myosin II is enriched preferentially at interfaces shared between cells of different identity (PSBs, S1/2Bs and S2/3Bs, also marked on panel (<b>C</b>). There is more Myosin II enrichment at PSBs compared to other boundaries, indicated as thicker green lines. We postulate that the third stripe, S3 as defined by unidirectional polarity data above (panel <b>C</b>), is composed of a mixture of two identities, named 3 and 4 here, whose boundary is more variable. In support of this, S3 is wider than S1 and S2, but not wide enough for 4 cells across (2+2) (see also cell numbers per stripe in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Because of the precision of the segmentation cascade (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dubuis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2015</a>), it is conceivable that there are as many cell identities as there are cells per parasegment width (3\u20134 on average, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and model in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). At the start of GBE, actomyosin enrichment would occur at each cell-cell interface based on these differences in identity along the AP axis. When cells intercalate and make new contacts, this would bring cells of the same identity adjacent to each other along AP. Because their identities are the same, their new shared interfaces would not enrich in Myosin II (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, interfaces between stripes of cells of different identity would continue to enrich in Myosin II, driving the emergence of persistent unidirectional polarity. A corollary of this model is that Myosin II polarisation is a consequence of local cell-cell interactions rather than global signals. If a global mechanism was at play, actomyosin would be expected to be enriched at all new DV-oriented interfaces, maintaining bidirectional polarisation, which is not what we find (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>)."

In particular, the two new columns of interfaces identified as having strong unidirectional polarity within each parasegment should have more Myosin II and straighten more than the intervening cell-cell interfaces, after they emerge through cell intercalation. We tracked these, by manually identifying junctions enriched in Myosin II at the end of each movie (as previously done for the PSBs), at the AP locations mapped in our spatiotemporal plots (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This initial analysis defined 3 stripes per parasegment (S1, S2 and S3, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>) and identified cell-cell interfaces separating stripes 1 and 2 (S1/2B) and stripes 2 and 3 (S2/3B)\u00a0(boundary\u00a0interfaces), from cell-cell interfaces within each stripe (non-boundary interfaces) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a>). We checked that the S1/2B and S2/3B interfaces identified at the end of GBE had AP positions consistent with their expected boundary positions throughout the movies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Next, we checked that cell numbers for each stripe matched those expected from the model, with S1 and S2 increasing approximately from 1 to 2 cells wide, and S3 from 1.5 to 3 cells wide, from start to end of GBE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The larger width of S3 is explained in our model: S3 would be composed of a mixture of cell identities 3 and 4, because there are not enough cells in a parasegment (3.6 cells on average rather than 4 at the onset of GBE, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) to make a two-cell stripe for either identities 3 or 4 at the end of GBE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

To test this prediction, we examined Myosin II enrichment at boundary interfaces (PSBs, S1/2B and S2/3B) relative to non-boundary interfaces, as a function of interface orientation relative to the AP axis. Before 25 min\u00a0of GBE, boundary interfaces have more Myosin II than non-boundary interfaces for all orientations except those parallel to AP (0 to about 20 degrees) (left panel in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C\u2019</a>). For both types of interface, there is some dependency upon orientation, with higher enrichment for interfaces closer to 90 degrees relative to AP (DV-oriented interfaces), consistent with previous studies (see for example Figure 4D in <a href=\"#bib30\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>). This dependency upon orientation is lost after 25 min, with boundary interfaces strongly enriched compared to non-boundary interfaces, irrespective of orientation (right panel in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C\u2019</a>).

(<b>D</b>) We compared interface lengths predicted by a Voronoi tessellation (black on the left, dotted grey on the right) with real interface lengths (magenta) to extract a length deviation from the Voronoi tessellation, a geometric proxy for local stress. (<b>E</b>) Graph showing the average deviation in length from a Voronoi prediction (y-axis), for all interfaces (black line), for boundary interfaces (magenta curve) and for non-boundary interfaces (green curve), as a function of GBE time (x-axis). Non-boundary interfaces are on average longer and boundary interfaces shorter than the average length deviation for all interfaces. (<b>F</b>) On average, boundary interfaces become increasingly geometrically stressed (shorter than Voronoi prediction) over a period of 15 min\u00a0just prior to T1 transitions. (<b>G-K</b>) Fate of boundary (abbreviated to B) and non-boundary (abbreviated to nonB) interfaces during GBE, for stripes S1 and S2 (Data pooled from 6 embryos, N=96,343 interface instances). (<b>G</b>) S1 and S2 interfaces behaviours fall into four main types: interfaces that remain boundary throughout GBE and do not go through a T1 transition (black); interfaces that remain boundary throughout but go through a T1 transition (grey); boundary interfaces that go through a T1 transition and become non-boundary (orange); interfaces that remain non-boundary interfaces throughout (purple). The percentage of each interface type is shown. Within each type, interfaces are sorted according to the time of T1 transition (white lines). Black arrows indicate two infrequent subtypes. In the orange class, a subtype of boundary interfaces corresponds to interfaces between either cell identities 1 and 3 (cell identity 2 is missing) or 3 and 2 (cell identity 1 is missing). We call these interfaces 'super-boundaries' (abbreviated to superB) (see main text). We have inferred that identity 1 or 2 are skipped because for this subtype the tracking data shows that either stripe S1 or stripe S2 has a local width of zero. The other subtype is in the purple class (arrow) and corresponds to rare non-boundary interfaces that do go through a T1 transition. (<b>G\u2019</b>) Comparison of the timings of T1 transitions in the different interface types. The two infrequent subtypes have opposite behaviours: the super-boundary T1 transitions (dashed orange curve) are earliest, while non-boundary T1 transitions are latest (purple curve) compared to boundary T1 transitions (orange and grey). (<b>G\u2019\u2019</b>) Comparison of the distributions of the orientations of interfaces 2.5 min prior to T1 transition for the different types of interface. 'Super-boundary' interfaces are the most DV-oriented (dashed orange). (<b>H</b>) Cartoon showing the expected location of the four types of interfaces relative to the position of the stripe boundaries (dashed black lines). Green shows Myosin II enrichment. (<b>I</b>) Graph giving the frequency (y-axis) of each type of interface as a function of the AP position within a S1 or S2 stripe (x-axis). Each AP location (bin) within a stripe is attributed a within-stripe coordinate from 0 (anterior-most) to 1 (posterior-most). (<b>J</b>) Plot showing the fates of each type of interface during GBE. The mean interface orientation (y-axis) and length (x-axis) is plotted for each type over time. Dashed arrows show the direction of time. Dashed lines connect interfaces before and after T1 transitions. See <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a> for individual curves for each <i>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</i> movie. (<b>K</b>) Cartoon summarising the behaviour of each type of interface during GBE. Changes in length and orientation of interfaces are depicted as well as the transition between boundary and non-boundary class. Direction of time is indicated by arrows. The dashed part of the grey arrow depicts the situation where a boundary interface remains a boundary after a T1 swap.

We have already shown that PSBs, S1/2Bs and S2/3Bs become straighter than intervening interfaces, which is evidence that they are more contractile. To ask if they participate more in cell rearrangements, we developed a method to capture the cell neighbour exchanges called T1 transitions (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). T1 transitions are identified by following the shrinkage of a given interface and linking it to the growth of a new interface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Using this method, we identified every T1 transition occurring in stripes S1 and S2 for all tracked parasegments in our 6 <i>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</i> movies. We did not analyse stripe S3 as we cannot unambiguously\u00a0identify boundary interfaces separating the putative cell identities 3 and 4 in that stripe. For each T1 transition identified, we have information on how much Myosin II is found at shortening and elongating interfaces. Pooling all the T1 transitions in S1 and S2 together, we find that Myosin II increases with interface shortening prior to the interface swap (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), consistent with prior studies (see for example <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g,i</a>\u00a0in <a href=\"#bib48\">Rauzi et al., 2010</a>). To distinguish between the interfaces that are shortening actively from those that may shorten passively, we developed another method to probe geometric stress (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We assume that a Voronoi tessellation based on cell centroid locations represents a mechanically neutral configuration for the cell-cell interfaces. We measured the deviation in interface length from this tessellation for boundary and non-boundary interfaces (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We find that boundary interfaces are shorter than predicted by a Voronoi tessellation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), particularly so in the 15 min\u00a0prior to a T1 transition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), indicating that they actively shorten during GBE. We conclude that the boundary interfaces that we have identified drive convergence of the germ-band."

We identify four main interface behaviours. About a quarter of interfaces are boundary interfaces which are not involved in any T1 transitions and remain boundary interfaces throughout GBE (black in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013K</a>). At the start of GBE, these interfaces are oriented on average about 50 degrees relative to the AP axis, then rotate to become oriented closer to DV, around 70 degrees (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,K</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Another quarter of interfaces are boundary interfaces involved in T1 transitions, with two distinct behaviours: some remain boundary interfaces after the T1 swap, while others become non-boundary interfaces (grey and orange, respectively, in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013K</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Finally, the rest of the interfaces are non-boundary interfaces which, for their large majority, are not involved in T1 transitions as expected (purple, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013K</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This confirms that boundary interfaces are those involved in cell neighbour exchange. Each interface behaviour occurs at the expected AP locations within each stripe, giving further support to our model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>)."

Interestingly, we also find a T1 transition peak in the middle of S3 (blue curves in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F,F\u2019</a>), which would correspond in our model to an incomplete or variably located boundary between cell identities 3 and 4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This is corroborated by a peak in Myosin II in the middle of stripe S3 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Using an independent measure of cell intercalation (intercalation strain rate, see (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butler et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchard et al., 2009</a>)\u00a0and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), we find that the rate of intercalation is higher in stripe S3, compared to stripe S1 and S2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). We think that this higher rate of intercalation in stripe S3 is caused by missing cells of identity 3 or 4 in this stripe. We postulate that when a cell identity is missing in the AP parasegmental sequence, such as cell identity 3 or 4, the resulting interface enriches more Myosin II and consequently intercalates faster and earlier that other interfaces. We expect these 'superboundary' interfaces (behaving as 'superintercalators') to be most prevalent in stripe S3 because of insufficient cells there, but our data suggest that these can be found also (but rarely) in stripe S1 and S2 (SuperB subtype in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013G\u201d</a>). We conclude that the variable number of cells per parasegment along AP causes a faster intercalation rate in the posterior part of the parasegment compared to the anterior part (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>)."

The code is thought to be incomplete because it currently does not explain interface enrichment at PSBs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). Here we asked what is the minimum number of receptors that could explain all of the Myosin II patterns that we have uncovered in this study. We first considered a scenario recapitulating as closely as possible the expression of the three Toll-like receptors (Toll-2, Toll-6 and Toll-8) identified in <a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al. (2014)</a>. We noted that Toll-6 and Toll-8 were largely interchangeable (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). Therefore our first scenario has a receptor A and a receptor B respectively expressed in pair-rule patterns broadly similar to Toll-2 and Toll-6/8 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Assuming initially 4 cells per parasegment, we counted by how many receptors adjacent cells differed along the AP axis. For example, if a cell expresses a receptor and the adjacent cell does not, then we recorded a difference of 1 for the corresponding AP interface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We postulate that a difference of one receptor or more triggers Myosin II enrichment at the corresponding interface. In this first scenario, all interfaces along AP differ by one receptor, except at the PSBs where there are no differences, consistent with the conclusion that the Toll-like receptor patterns currently do not explain Myosin II enrichment at PSBs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>)."

PSBs are shown as solid black lines. Summing the number of receptor differences at each boundary, this combination lacks a difference at the PSBs. For cell pairs brought together when single cells are missing (second line), the number of cell receptor differences increases only when cell identity 2 or cell identity 3 is missing (grey boxes highlight an increase in receptor differences). There is no increase in receptor differences, hence no robustness, built in if two contiguous cells are missing at any location (third line). We calculate a 'robustness' score by adding the number of instances, for two parasegments, where there is an increase in receptor differences in the event of 1 or 2 cells missing: the score for this scenario is 10\u00a0(number of grey boxes for a double parasegment unit) (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). (<b>B</b>) When considering 0, 1 or 2 missing cells, the most robust solution with three receptors is achieved with an additional receptor C spanning one parasegment out of two (either odd or even). This provides a receptor difference at the PSBs (grey boxes in first line) and systematically increases receptor differences when one cell is missing at a given location (grey boxes in second line). When 2 cells are missing, the number of receptor differences increases at a subset of locations, notably in the case where cell identities 3 and 4 are missing (grey boxes in third line).

We know this has to be frequently the case since we find an average of 3.6 cells per parasegment at the start of GBE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We counted again the number of receptors at interfaces, when a cell is missing at a given position. For example, if cell identity 2 is missing, cell identities 1 and 3 become adjacent; since cell identity 1 is expressing receptor A and cell identity 3, receptor B, we scored a difference of two receptors for this particular interface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Remarkably, we find that the number of receptor differences increases by one in many locations when a cell identity is missing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We predict that the number of receptor differences is likely to be proportional to the amount of Myosin II recruited. In other words, we propose that the receptor identity system is quantitative. If the amount of Myosin II enriched is indeed proportional to the number of receptor differences, then more rapid cell intercalation would be expected to occur where cells are missing in the AP sequence (see 'superboundaries' and 'superintercalators' introduced earlier). Increased cell intercalation would fill the gaps in cell identity during GBE and maintain the cell order along AP. From our data, the cell identities that are most likely to be missing are 3 and 4, since we find that there are not enough cells to make two columns of two cells at the end of GBE in stripe 3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4D</a>). For example, according to the scenario in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, if cell identity 3 is missing, the receptor numbers at adjacent interfaces 2/4 increases from 1 to 2 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This in turn should translate into an increase in Myosin II at those interfaces, which then would increase the rate of intercalation. This notion is supported by our data, since we find that the cell intercalation rate is higher in stripe 3 containing identities 3 and 4, than in stripes 1 or 2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>)."

                                "text": "From the above, we propose that the receptor system is robust to missing cells because gaps in the pattern will be 'repaired' by speeding up intercalation at cell-cell interfaces most different in their receptor composition. Building on this hypothesis, we looked for the most likely expression pattern for a third putative receptor that would both explain the enrichment at the PSBs but also confer enhanced robustness to missing cells. To do this, we explored all possible permutations of three receptors, where each is expressed in a putative pair-rule pattern (four cell-stripes out of eight, in a given double parasegment unit) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We scored each permutation by summing both the number of immediate neighbour receptor differences, and also the <i>increase</i> in receptor differences at each interface if one or two cell identities are missing in a given row of cells. The permutation that scored highest (20, see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) expresses two receptors in the same exact pattern as our first scenario (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and a third receptor in every other parasegment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). With this solution, the number of receptors at cell-cell interfaces increases systematically from one to two when a cell identity is missing anywhere in a double parasegment unit, therefore showing robustness. When two cells are missing, this number increases to three receptors at a subset of locations. Interestingly, one of these locations corresponds to the case where cell identities 3 and 4 are both missing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Since our data suggest that identities 3 and/or 4 are those most likely to be absent (1 and 2 being more systematically specified), this solution confers adequate robustness, taking into account the observed polarity of the parasegment. Note that a solution with 4 receptors instead of 3 does show a better robustness throughout the double parasegment unit (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), but since cell identities 1 and 2 are less likely to be missing according to our data, we conclude that the three-receptor solution shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> is the most parsimonious."

Cells are considered as two-dimensional polygons representing cell-cell interfaces, with vertices forming where three polygons meet. An \u2018energy function\u2019 is calculated and used to update the position of every vertex <i>i</i> over time. This energy function encodes mechanical contributions associated with cell elasticity, cortical contractility and interfacial \u2018line tension energy\u2019. We consider a number of simulations (see main text), which differ in the hypothesised dependence of the line tension <i>f</i> on interface lengths. (<b>B</b>) The initial configuration for each simulation comprises regular hexagonal cells organised into parasegments, each comprising cells of 4 stripe identities (S1-S4). Note that the initial configuration starts with 14x20 cells (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) and smaller snapshots are shown in this Figure and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. (<b>C</b>) In simulation 2, the line tension energy <i>f</i> varies linearly with interface length for non-boundary interfaces, but we specify a nonlinear dependence for boundary interfaces to represent a positive feedback between interface shortening and Myosin II enrichment. In this simulation, cells undergo neighbour exchanges but become stuck locally in four-cell junctions and hence convergent extension cannot proceed (<b>D</b>, <b>D\u2019</b>). In Simulation 3, we apply our non-linear dependence of line tension to the total length of contiguous <i>boundary</i> interfaces for a given cell (length <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mi>L</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>) (<b>E</b>), rather than to individual boundary interfaces (length <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msub><mi>l</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>) (<b>D</b>, <b>D\u2019</b>). This allows vertices to slide independently on either side of a column of interfaces that makes a boundary (<b>E\u2019</b>, <b>E\u201d</b>) and the simulated tissue now undergoes convergent extension (F), but identities S3 and S4 clump together. (<b>G</b>) Simulation 4 resolves this issue by incorporating \u2018supercontractility\u2019, where boundary interfaces between cells of non-adjacent identities (\u2018skipped boundary\u2019) are more contractile.

Cells fail to undergo neighbour exchange in this simulation. In simulation 2, the linearity of line tension energy is replaced at boundary interfaces by a non-linear relationship, where the line tension energy decreases at an ever-faster rate as the interface shortens. This models a positive feedback between interface shortening and Myosin II enrichment, supported by our data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In this simulation 2, cells do now undergo neighbour exchanges, but become stuck in a four-cell junction topology (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D\u2019</a>). In simulation 3, we allow vertices to slide independently on either side of a column of interfaces that makes a boundary (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013F</a>).

In previous studies, the analysis of Myosin II planar polarity has focused on bipolarity, often comparing the enrichment in Myosin II at the DV-oriented sides (also called vertical sides) of germband cells relative to their AP-oriented sides (also called horizontal sides) (for example, see <a href=\"#bib54\">Sim\u00f5es et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>). Here, in addition to using a measure of bidirectional polarity, we have developed a measure of unidirectional polarity, to identify when one side of a cell is enriched relative to all other sides. By distinguishing between bi- and unidirectional polarities, we have been able to identify novel patterns that inform how Myosin II planar polarisation arises and drives cell and tissue behaviours. Furthermore, by taking a live-imaging approach, we have been able to observe how these polarities evolve with unprecedented temporal resolution."

A long-standing hypothesis in <i>Drosophila</i> segmentation is that the cascade of genes from maternal determinants, gap genes and then pair-rule genes is able to establish differential 'identities' with single-cell precision along the AP axis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dubuis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2015</a>). The discovery of a role for Toll-like receptors, under the control of pair-rule genes in GBE, has provided compelling molecular evidence for this model (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). One question arising from this work is what happens to Myosin II planar bipolarity once polarized cell intercalation proceeds. Indeed, polarized cell intercalation will increase the cell number along AP, thus bringing cells with the same identity next to each other along this axis. If differential cell identity via heterotypic interactions drives Myosin II polarisation throughout GBE, then some cells should find themselves in homotypic interaction with either an anterior or posterior neighbour, which would not lead to Myosin II enrichment (See <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The unipolarity patterns that we find are consistent with this hypothesis, identifying alternating domains of enriched and not enriched cell-cell interfaces along AP, which emerge during the course of axis extension. These correspond to Myosin II-enriched boundaries between parasegmental domains (PSBs) and to at least two more locations within each parasegment from early in GBE. The AP position of these enrichments is consistent with these being the consequence of the doubling of cell numbers along AP via polarized cell intercalation. Therefore the differential identity model predicts a transition between bidirectional and unidirectional polarities over the course of GBE, which is validated by our data."

We were able to test this by comparing the orientation of enriched boundary interfaces (heterotypic in our model) versus non-boundary interfaces (homotypic). Early GBE (0\u201325 min) is characterised by two features. First, as predicted by a cell-cell interaction model, boundary interfaces are significantly more enriched than non-boundary interfaces for most orientations. However, overlaid on this, DV-oriented interfaces are also more enriched in Myosin II, irrespective of their boundary/non-boundary identity. This relationship between interface orientation and Myosin II enrichment in early GBE is at odds with a model based solely on cell-cell interactions. It is unclear what the cause of this relationship might be. Some planar polarity and cell intercalary behaviours remain in mutants for all three Toll-like receptors identified (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). A possibility is that the remaining polarity is due to a more distant polarising signal operating in early embryos, which would direct Myosin II to all DV-oriented interfaces. Later in GBE (25\u201350 min), our analysis shows that Myosin II enrichment becomes independent of interface orientation, indicating that distant polarising signals are not acting on the germband at this stage and that local cell-cell interactions dominate."

Our quantification shows that parasegments are in fact on average only 3.6 cells wide at the onset of GBE (sampling parasegments 4 to 7, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The widths of the stripes containing cell identities 1 and 2 are consistent with single-cell wide columns increasing to two-cell wide columns and therefore behave as expected from the differential cell identity model. However, the distinction between the stripes containing cell identities 3 and 4 as predicted by <a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al. (2014)</a> was less clear. Instead we observe a third stripe, which is 1.5 cells wide in AP on average at the start of GBE, increasing to 3 after 60 min. We think it likely that the cell types 3 and 4 do exist as postulated by <a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al. (2014)</a>, since there are detectable peaks of Myosin II and neighbour exchanges in the middle of our third stripe (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>,<a href=\"#fig5s1\">G</a>). But because parasegments are less than 4 cells across at GBE onset, some rows would have only cell types 1,2,3 or 1,2,4, while others have the full complement of cell types 1,2,3,4 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). After 60 min of GBE, stripes 3 and 4 would then give a mixture of arrangements, such as 3,3,4 and 3,4,4. As a result, the expected enrichment of Myosin II at heterotypic interfaces between cells of identity 3 and 4 would not align well, explaining why we cannot resolve a stripe 3/4 boundary in our data. If our reasoning is correct, this implies that there is an inherent polarity within each parasegment, with the anterior half made of cell types 1 and 2 being robustly specified, while in the posterior half, specification of cell identities 3 and 4 is more variable. This polarity might be important for the tissue to cope with the variation of cell number across parasegments and to repair the AP patterns during cell intercalation. Indeed, at the start of axis extension, although parasegments are usually 3 or 4 cells across, they occasionally have rows that are fewer or more cells across (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lawrence and Johnston, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Busturia and Lawrence, 1994</a>). We conclude that the mechanism of active convergence of the germ-band must be robust to variable cell number within each parasegmental unit."

                        "text": "Our modeling suggests a mechanism by which the embryo copes with this variable cell number during axis extension. We postulate that the cell-cell interaction mechanism that triggers Myosin II enrichment at interfaces along AP is quantitative. It has been proposed that the stripy expression of Toll-2, 6 and 8 receptors generate heterotypic interactions that result in Myosin II enrichment (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). We further\u00a0propose that these receptors, in addition to at least\u00a0another receptor at the PSB, produce Myosin II enrichment which is proportional to the strength of the heterotypy. In other words, the more adjacent cells differ in the number of receptors they express, the more Myosin II will accumulate at their shared interfaces. We find that three receptors expressed in a pair-rule pattern is sufficient in theory to explain the planar polarization of Myosin II at every interface along AP in the germband, including the PSB interfaces which were not accounted for by the Toll-2,6,8 combinatorial code (<a href=\"#bib46\">Par\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). Two of the receptor patterns we identify correspond to the patterns of Toll-2 and Toll-6/8 (Toll-6 has a pattern similar to Toll-8) and the third provides heterotypy at the PSB. The remarkable finding with this minimal combination of receptors is that heterotypy increases when one cell is missing in any position along AP. Moreover, heterotypy increases further when two cells are missing at half of the positions along AP. This is true in particular when identities 3 and 4 are both missing, which are the identities we think are most likely to be absent, based on our data. So when cells are missing, heterotypy would increase, triggering more Myosin II enrichment. This would increase the intercalation rate at the most mismatched interfaces and lead to pattern repair. In support of this, we do find an increased rate of cell intercalation in the posterior part of the parasegment (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>), where we predict more mismatches because of too few cells of identities 3 and 4."

We had to implement specific interface behaviours in the model to have successful convergence-extension of the <i>in silico</i> tissue. These are based on plausible behaviours in vivo. In particular, one limitation of vertex models is that apposed cortices are modeled as a single interface. The changes between Simulation 2 and 3 attempt to go round this limitation: what we tried to model is a situation where cells behave independently on either side of a boundary. For example, junctions could slide independently of each other on either side of the boundary. This is possible in vivo because a boundary is made of two cell cortices, and each cell cortex at the boundary interface could elongate or shorten independently. This could conceivably happen if the two cell cortices on either side of a boundary have different contractile forces. In addition to junctional sliding, cell-cell sliding could occur along the boundary, for example if adhesion is decreased there. Further work is required to determine if these processes are happening during GBE. Another point of note, we have implemented ratios of 1:2:8 for the line tension energies between non-boundary, boundary and 'supercontractile' boundary interfaces in Simulation 4. The 1:2 ratio is quantitatively consistent with observed ratios of tension between PSB boundary and non-boundary interfaces obtained by laser ablation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). We do not know what to expect as a ratio between boundary and supercontractile boundary interfaces, but 8 seems high. A discrepancy between the ratios of tension needed for a successful simulation of boundary behaviour and the ratios estimated in vivo by laser ablation has been noted by <a href=\"#bib33\">Landsberg et al. (2009)</a> and so the relationship between line tension energies in vertex models and tension measured by laser ablation might not be simple/linear. For this paper, the key point is that the model qualitatively supports the idea that some boundary interfaces are more contractile than others."

By identifying PSB interfaces at late stages by their strong myosin enrichment and backtracking to earlier in development, we have further demonstrated that the PSB dominates over the two intra-parasegmental boundaries in terms of myosin enrichment. The predominance of the PSB is detectable from very close to the start of GBE. At the onset of GBE, PSBs are already demarcated genetically by the expression of the pair-rule genes such as <i>eve</i> and <i>ftz</i> and the gradually increasing expression of segment polarity genes <i>wg</i> and <i>en</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</a>). However, this is the first time that a cellular (rather than genetic) characteristic has been identified for PSBs this early. After the end of germband extension, later in development when epidermal cells are actively dividing, the movement of dividing cells across PSBs is prevented because the boundary interfaces enrich in Myosin II relative to non-boundary interfaces (<a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>), as for other compartmental boundaries in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib58\">Umetsu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aliee et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Landsberg et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib40\">Major and Irvine, 2006</a>) and for tissue boundaries in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib11\">Calzolari et al., 2014</a>)\u00a0and <i>Xenopus</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fagotto, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fagotto et al., 2013</a>). In all these cases, the enrichment in Myosin II has been proposed to increase interfacial tension and promote tissue segregation. A possibility is that the PSBs fulfill a similar role during GBE, to prevent mixing between adjacent parasegments that cell intercalation might cause otherwise. Our interface orientation analyses and our laser ablation experiments demonstrate that there is indeed an increase in interfacial tension at PSBs early in GBE. We propose that elevated line tension at PSBs and also, to a lesser extent, at the two intra-parasegmental boundaries that we have identified, contribute to maintain the AP sequence of cell identities while cell rearrangements are occurring."

This could be explained if the heterotypy between cell identity 1 on the posterior side of the PSB is strongest in combination with cell identities 3 or 4 on the anterior side of the PSB. We predict that a not yet identified receptor, with a pattern of expression corresponding to receptor C in our most parsimonious model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), directs myosin II recruitment at the PSB interfaces. It could be that this putative receptor triggers a stronger response at the PSBs compared to the Toll-like 2,6,8 receptors at the other boundaries. Alternatively, more than one receptor might be contributing heterotypy at the PSBs. Our data suggest that we can rule out an early role for Wingless signaling in contributing to a PSB-specific response. Indeed, while Wingless is required to maintain Myosin II enrichment at the PSB later in development (<a href=\"#bib42\">Monier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">2011</a>), it is not required for the enrichment <i>during</i> germ-band extension (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M</a>), which is corroborated by the fact that PSBs straighten in <i>wingless</i> mutants as in wildtype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>).

We first expressed interface fluorescence intensity around each cell perimeter as a function of angle, from the embryonic posterior (zero) anti-clockwise (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Treating this intensity signal from 0 \u2013 360 degrees as a periodic repeating signal, we calculated its Fourier decomposition, extracting the amplitude of the period 2 component as the strength of Myosin II bipolarity (equivalent to planar cell polarity), with its phase representing the orientation of cell bipolarity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>, red lines). We also extracted the period 1 component as a Myosin unipolarity measure (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>, cyan lines). The orientations of both uni- and bipolarity distributions for our dataset were strongly and consistently biased towards the AP-axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2019, D\u2019</a>). However, there was some pollution of the unipolarity signal in the bipolarity signal, with the latter enhanced because of the castellated (discontinuous) nature of the average interface intensity signal (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>, black lines). We therefore explored further methods to calculate independent uni- and bipolarity quantities. Based on the consistent AP bias to both kinds of polarity, we measured the polarity in the AP axis only. We found that fitting two Gaussians independently, centred on the anterior and posterior sides of each cell works well, and is able to separate combinations of uni- and bipolarity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2019-D\u2019</a>)."

The bipolarity signal was taken as two peaks of the amplitude of the smaller of the two Gaussians. Subtracting the bipolarity signal from the combined Gaussians, the remainder is the unipolarity signal. Because overall Myosin II intensity differed between embryos, we normalised the strength of both polarities by dividing the allocated Gaussian amplitude area by the cell\u2019s mean perimeter Myosin II signal, so that they would be consistent across embryos."

We therefore fitted a smooth to the Myosin II intensity across each image separately (with a kernel size of 1/20<sup>th</sup> of the image width), calculated the local gradient of this smooth for each cell, and rebalanced the local gradient effect while keeping the mean cell perimeter fluorescence the same."

We first defined relaxed geometries. We chose a Voronoi tessellation, based on cell centroid locations, as a simple first approximation to relaxed geometries. A Voronoi tessellation identifies cell-cell interfaces as the set of points equidistant from two neighbouring cell centroids.

We quantified the difference between actual cell perimeters and those based on Voronoi predictions. By definition, as cell shapes become geometrically stressed, cell perimeters will on average become longer than those predicted by the Voronoi tessellation. We subtracted tessellated interface lengths from observed interface lengths to get a measure of geometric stress. A value near zero indicated a relaxed geometry, with increasing deviation from zero indicating increasingly stressed geometries (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We expected relaxed cell geometries twenty min before the start of GBE, when cells have finished cellularisation but before gastrulation and before polarised Myosin II expression. Indeed, perimeter stress was low and stable until the start of GBE, when it rose sharply then remained high throughout GBE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, black line). Mesoderm invagination no doubt introduces some stress from -5 to 5 min (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lye et al., 2015</a>), but the fact that the geometric stress index remained high thereafter shows that this stress is likely to be actively maintained in the germ-band."

We investigated further, aligning interfaces in time to zero at the point of neighbour exchange. The deviation of boundary interface length increased prior to exchange events, coinciding with a similarly increase in interfacial myosin prior to exchange as interfaces shortened (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Upon neighbour exchange, these interfaces became non-boundary interfaces and showed an elongated signature. Overall, these data suggest that the active contraction of boundary interfaces is driving convergence in DV, and that as soon as they become non-boundary interfaces they take on a passive signature."

It describes with unprecedented resolution the stereotyped changes in the planar distribution of non-muscular Myosin II (MyoII) in wild-type embryos. To do so, the authors combined live imaging with computational methods to precisely quantify the dynamics and the spatial patterns of MyoII planar polarization. The authors showed that the initial bipolar distribution of MyoII is most pronounced at parasegmental boundaries and that this initial bipolar distribution is rapidly followed by its unipolar accumulation at stereotyped positions relative to parasegmental boundaries. This shift from bipolar to unipolar correlates temporally with cell intercalation. Moreover, the authors show that MyoII accumulation better correlated with the juxtaposition of cells of different identities than with the orientation of the cell-cell interfaces relative to the body axis. These findings led the authors to revise the current Toll receptor model to explain how different cell identities generate the planar polarization of MyoII, hence germ-band extension."

In the present study, we calculated instead how clustered the cell-cell interface orientations were relative to the DV axis (perpendicular to the AP-oriented ventral midline) for a given boundary, using -1 (one cell diameter away to the anterior) and +1 (posterior) interfaces controls. If the boundaries are straight, the orientations should be clustered around the orientation of the DV axis (90 degrees relative to AP). We compared the degree of clustering using circular statistics with highest kappa values indicating strongest clustering of interface orientations. These graphs were given in the previous version of the manuscript and showed that PSBs, S1/2B and S2/3B boundaries have a higher kappa than flanking (+1, -1) interfaces."

In addition, to respond to the reviewers\u2019 point, we have performed laser ablations on the PSBs and control +1 interfaces to validate that our alignment measure is indeed an indication of interfacial tension. In <i>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</i> embryos, we identified PSB interfaces by their enrichment in Myosin II at about 40 minutes after GBE onset and ablated these interfaces and +1 interfaces as a control (N=19 for each class). We measured the distance between recoiling cell vertices as a function of time and found that PSBs interfaces recoil faster than +1 interfaces. The estimated recoil velocity differs by a factor of about 2 between experiment and control. This shows that PSB interfaces have higher interfacial tensions than +1 interfaces and corroborates our alignment analysis. We infer from this validation that S1/2 and S2/3 boundaries have also higher interfacial tension than flanking interfaces. Note that we attempted initially to perform the ablations in <i>eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</i> embryos, where PSBs would have been labelled without relying on visual inspection of Myosin II enrichment. However, it proved impossible to do these ablations, as not only GAP43-Cherry gave a low signal with the two-photon we were using, but also caused sample overheating. We also considered performing ablations of S1/2B and S2/3B interfaces, in addition to the PSBs (using <i>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</i> embryos), but renounced because of the number of ablations we would have to perform to have a conclusive result, which would have taken us beyond a reasonable revision time. We feel that the laser ablation experiment we provide on the PSB validates adequately our more sensitive measures of interface alignment (which consider hundreds of interfaces for a given class) that we have performed on all three classes of boundaries."

So we think that in biological terms, what we are attempting to model is a situation where cells behave independently on either side of a boundary. For example, junctions could slide independently of each other on either side of the boundary. This is possible in vivo because a boundary is made of two cell-cell interfaces, and each of these cell interfaces could elongate or shorten independently. This could conceivably happen if the two cell cortices on either side of a boundary have different contractile forces. In addition to junctional sliding, cell-cell sliding could occur along the boundary (simple shear), for example if adhesion is decreased there."
