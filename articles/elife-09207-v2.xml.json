In prostate cancer, structural genomic rearrangements are a common mechanism driving tumorigenesis. However, somatic alterations predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements in prostate cancer remain largely undefined. Here, we show that <i>SPOP</i>, the most commonly mutated gene in primary prostate cancer modulates DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, and that <i>SPOP</i> mutation is associated with genomic instability. In vivo, <i>SPOP</i> mutation results in a transcriptional response consistent with <i>BRCA1</i> inactivation resulting in impaired homology-directed repair (HDR) of DSB. Furthermore, we found that SPOP mutation sensitizes to DNA damaging therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors. These results implicate SPOP as a novel participant in DSB repair, suggest that <i>SPOP</i> mutation drives prostate tumorigenesis in part through genomic instability, and indicate that mutant <i>SPOP</i> may increase response to DNA-damaging therapeutics."

In prostate cancer, structural genomic rearrangements are a common mechanism driving tumorigenesis. However, somatic alterations predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements in prostate cancer remain largely undefined. Here, we show that <i>SPOP</i>, the most commonly mutated gene in primary prostate cancer modulates DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, and that <i>SPOP</i> mutation is associated with genomic instability. In vivo, <i>SPOP</i> mutation results in a transcriptional response consistent with <i>BRCA1</i> inactivation resulting in impaired homology-directed repair (HDR) of DSB. Furthermore, we found that SPOP mutation sensitizes to DNA damaging therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors. These results implicate SPOP as a novel participant in DSB repair, suggest that <i>SPOP</i> mutation drives prostate tumorigenesis in part through genomic instability, and indicate that mutant <i>SPOP</i> may increase response to DNA-damaging therapeutics."

Cancers develop when cells in the body acquire genetic mutations that allow the cells to grow rapidly and form a mass known as a tumor. Prostate cancer cells from different individuals can carry different genetic mutations, which affects whether the disease progresses and how the tumors respond to medical treatments. This genetic variety arises in cancer cells partly from a phenomenon known as genomic instability, in which DNA mutations accumulate due to defects in DNA repair."

The experiments show that the cancer cells with high levels of genomic instability also often had mutations in a gene that encodes a protein called SPOP. These mutations occur in about 10 percent of men with prostate cancer and appear early in the development of the tumors. Next, they studied the SPOP protein in zebrafish (which is nearly identical to human SPOP), as well as in mouse and human cells. The experiments show that SPOP normally helps the cell to accurately repair DNA that has been damaged. Mutations in SPOP change the DNA repair process, which lead to genomic instability by increasing the likelihood that broken chromosomes will be stuck back together incorrectly."

When both of these pathways were inactivated\u2014one by the SPOP mutation, the other by the drug\u2014the cancer cells died more quickly. Therefore, men that are diagnosed with types of prostate cancer in which the gene that encodes SPOP is mutated might benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors or other therapies that affect DNA repair."

This analysis revealed a bimodal distribution, with a more common, \u2018low-rearrangement\u2019 population, and a less frequent \u2018high-rearrangement\u2019 population primarily driven by intrachromosomal rearrangements (deletions, inversions, and tandem duplications), rather than balanced interchromosomal rearrangements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Independent analysis of SCNAs from three publicly available data sets comprising 430 tumors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baca et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barbieri et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Consortium TCGA, 2015</a>), including 47 <i>SPOP</i> mutant prostate cancers, confirmed that the rearrangement-associated deletions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were those enriched in <i>SPOP</i> mutant prostate cancer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). When individually comparing <i>SPOP</i> mutations and associated deletions (<i>CHD1</i> and <i>MAP3K7</i>), we did not observe significant differences in SCNA burden for any one lesion (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Analysis of clonality (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baca et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Prandi et al., 2014</a>) of specific lesions showed that <i>SPOP</i> mutations were highly clonal compared to loci in the associated deletion peaks, supporting that <i>SPOP</i> mutations precede deletions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In addition, analysis of dependencies of the lesions supports <i>SPOP</i> mutations preceding <i>CHD1</i> deletions; no lesions were predicted to precede <i>SPOP</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Together, these data nominate a distinct prostate cancer class characterized by early <i>SPOP</i> mutations and genomic instability.

                        "text": "We explored the functional role of SPOP in vivo, using zebrafish as a rapidly assessable vertebrate model system. SPOP is highly conserved (97.3% identical at the amino acid level between human and zebrafish, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Knockdown of <i>Spop</i> by two different splice-blocking morpholinos (MO5, MO7) dramatically impaired brain and eye development as well as decreased overall body size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), resulted in gene expression changes consistent with p53 activation, and apoptosis measured by TUNEL assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Microinjection of human SPOP mRNA rescued these phenotypes, confirming specificity of the morpholino effects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). To nominate signaling pathways impacted by Spop, we performed transcriptional profiling using RNA-seq on zebrafish with <i>Spop</i> knockdown and ectopic expression of wild-type SPOP (SPOP-wt) and SPOP-F133V, the most commonly mutated residue in prostate cancer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Consistent with recently reported proteomic data (<a href=\"#bib31\">Theurillat et al., 2014</a>) and heterodimerization between mutant and wild-type SPOP in our models (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), transcriptional responses to SPOP-F133V compared with SPOP-wt and Spop morpholino showed a pattern consistent with dominant negative, selective loss of function; SPOP-F133V correlated with SPOP-wt for some gene sets (Cluster B) and correlated with Spop morpholino for others (Cluster A) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) revealed gene sets involving DNA repair impacted by modulating SPOP function (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). Notably, the transcriptional response to F133V correlated highly with BRCA1 inactivation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). While SPOP has been previously proposed as involved in DNA damage and repair (DDR) signaling based on in vitro experiments (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>), these results for the first time implicate a functional role for SPOP in DDR signaling in vivo and suggest this function is selectively impaired by prostate cancer-derived SPOP mutations. To test this hypothesis in human prostate cancers, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of transcriptional data from 11 SPOP mutant and 53 SPOP wild-type tumors, based on the transcriptional signature of BRCA1 inactivation (MSigDB: M2748). We observed significant segregation of SPOP mutant tumors (p-value = 9.5e<sup>\u221207</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) using this signature, with less robust segregation of tumors harboring CHD1 or MAP3K7 deletions co-occurring with SPOP mutation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These data suggest that human prostate cancers with <i>SPOP</i> mutations show transcriptional effects similar to BRCA1 inactivation, consistent with a role for SPOP in DSB repair. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed a trend of mutual exclusivity between <i>SPOP</i> mutations and <i>BRCA1</i> alterations in genomic data (p-value = 0.0496, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

To further define the impact of SPOP mutation in response to DNA damage, we utilized primary prostate cells isolated from transgenic mice with Cre-dependent conditional expression of SPOP-F133V. After transduction with Tamoxifen-inducible Cre (Cre-ERT2), cells were treated with 4-OH tamoxifen or vehicle and exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Spop localized in nuclear foci similar to human LNCaP cells in mouse prostate cells (MPCs) after IR, with no alteration in foci by expression of SPOP-F133V (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). Induction of SPOP-F133V resulted in delayed recovery from IR-induced damage as measured by comet assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). No differences were seen in apoptosis after IR, as measured by PARP cleavage (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), subG1 events, or caspase-3 cleavage (data not shown). To functionally characterize how SPOP mutations affect response to DSB, we expressed SPOP-wt and SPOP-F133V in benign prostate epithelial cells (RWPE) and prostate cancer cells (22Rv1), and examined the induction, recognition, and resolution of CPT-induced DSBs. We found that DSB formation (measured by \u03b3H2AX foci and protein levels) was not affected by modulating SPOP function with siRNA, or expression of wildtype or mutant SPOP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Furthermore, there were no observed differences in early DNA damage signaling events, such as phosphorylation of ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>), indicating that SPOP did not affect initial induction and recognition of DSBs or initial steps in DDR signaling. Consistent with this, SPOP showed only limited co-localization with early markers of DSB (\u03b3H2AX, phospho-ATM) in irradiated prostate cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>)."

RAD51 is a component of the HDR pathway and a marker for engagement of the HDR machinery (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baumann et al., 1996</a>). 53BP1 is a positive regulator of NHEJ that blocks 5\u2032-DNA-end resection and therefore functions at the intersection of HDR and NHEJ; if 53BP1 is not cleared from sites of DSB by HDR components, it promotes error prone NHEJ (<a href=\"#bib24\">Panier and Boulton, 2014</a>). Strikingly, SPOP-F133V-expressing prostate cells showed delayed clearance of 53BP1 from sites of DSB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>); similar effects were seen with another SPOP mutation (F102C) commonly observed in prostate cancer (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3I,J</a>). Furthermore, SPOP-wt increased RAD51 foci formation compared to controls, while SPOP-F133V-expressing cells showed a dramatic decrease in RAD51 foci formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), consistent with impairment of HDR. Induction of SPOP-F133V in primary MPCs similarly decreased Rad51 foci after IR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). Knockdown of <i>SPOP</i> also resulted in a decrease of RAD51 foci, suggesting a selective loss of function of SPOP-F133V in HDR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). We also observed decreased clearance of 53BP1 foci and decreased RAD51 foci formation in SPOP-F133V-expressing cells after gamma irradiation, indicating that this effect is not specific to one mechanism of DSB induction (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013H</a>).

In contrast, the Pem1-Ad2-EGFP NHEJ reporter assay indicated an increase of NHEJ activity in SPOP-F133V expressing epithelial cells, while both <i>SPOP</i> siRNA and <i>BRCA1</i> siRNA increased NHEJ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that SPOP promotes HDR, while somatic mutation in <i>SPOP</i>, as observed in prostate cancer with increased genomic rearrangements, impairs HDR and promotes error-prone NHEJ."

For SPOP mRNA, in vitro transcription SPOP cDNA was TOPO TA cloned into a pCR 8 TOPO TA Gateway entry vector by using the pCR 8/GW/TOPO TA cloning kit (K2500-20, Invitrogen). 3-way-gateway recombination was then performed by using LR clonase II (11791, Invitrogen) to recombine SPOP cDNA from the pCR 8 TOPO TA gateway middle entry vector into a pDestTol2pA2 attR4-R3 (#394) destination vector. The 5\u2032 entry clone was (p5E-CMV/SP6, #382) and the 3\u2032 entry clone was (p3E-poly A, #302). The final vector contains a SP6 site for subsequent in vitro mRNA transcription."

The manuscript describes the characterization of <i>SPOP</i> mutations in prostate cancers and reveals a new role for SPOP in the DNA damage repair response (DDR). While analyzing data on chromosomal rearrangements and mutational status of hundreds of prostate cancers, the authors make the interesting observation that \u2018high rearrangement\u2019 correlates with <i>SPOP</i> mutations. They go on to show that SPOP is involved in late steps of the DDR response, and that <i>SPOP</i> mutations impair homologous recombination (HR) and favor error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), which could potentially explain the correlation between <i>SPOP</i> mutations and high frequency of rearrangements. This function resembles that of the DDR factor BRCA1. In fact, <i>SPOP</i> mutations also seem to be mutually exclusive with <i>BRCA1</i> mutations. Finally, the authors show some data suggesting that <i>SPOP</i> mutations may sensitize cells to PARP inhibitors, which have been shown to be synthetic lethal with <i>BRCA1</i> mutations."

The \u201chigh-rearrangement\u201d group was significantly associated with <i>SPOP</i> mutations, but also with recurrent deletions on 5q and 6q, containing the tumor suppressors CHD1 and MAP3K7. Because of clonality studies the authors pursue the role of <i>SPOP</i> mutations only. Though the data regarding contribution of <i>SPOP</i> mutation to DNA damage response and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors are convincing, no attempt is made to see whether losses at 5q and 6q contribute to this phenotype independently or cooperatively with <i>SPOP</i> mutation. 5q CNAs, specifically loss of CHD1, have been implicated in high chromosomal rearrangements, and MAP3K7 is also highly correlated with chromosomal rearrangements. Examining the 5q and 6q status of the patients in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, either alone or in combination with <i>SPOP</i> mutant status would be informative and provide a clearer understanding of the contributions of these genes to the DNA damage phenotype (<i>BRCA1</i> mutant gene set) of this subtype.

Therefore to address this issue, we developed a model system expressing inducible mutant SPOP in mouse prostate organoids. These are derived from a genetically engineered mouse model expressing SPOP-F133V in a Cre dependent manner, using a knock-in to the <i>Rosa26</i> locus (manuscript in preparation).
