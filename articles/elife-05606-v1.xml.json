However, the molecular mechanism by which the G9a/GLP complex is targeted to the specific gene loci for H3K9 methylation is unclear. In this study, with unbiased protein affinity purification, we found ZNF644 and WIZ as two core subunits in the G9a/GLP complex. ZNF644 and WIZ interact with the transcription activation domain of G9a and GLP, respectively. Moreover, both ZNF644 and WIZ contain multiple zinc finger motifs that recognize consensus DNA sequences. ZNF644 and WIZ target G9a and GLP to the chromatin and mediate the G9a/GLP complex-dependent H3K9 methylation as well as gene repression. Thus, our studies reveal two key subunits in the G9a/GLP complex that regulate the function of this histone methyltransferase complex."

However, the molecular mechanism by which the G9a/GLP complex is targeted to the specific gene loci for H3K9 methylation is unclear. In this study, with unbiased protein affinity purification, we found ZNF644 and WIZ as two core subunits in the G9a/GLP complex. ZNF644 and WIZ interact with the transcription activation domain of G9a and GLP, respectively. Moreover, both ZNF644 and WIZ contain multiple zinc finger motifs that recognize consensus DNA sequences. ZNF644 and WIZ target G9a and GLP to the chromatin and mediate the G9a/GLP complex-dependent H3K9 methylation as well as gene repression. Thus, our studies reveal two key subunits in the G9a/GLP complex that regulate the function of this histone methyltransferase complex."

Both contain a transcription activation domain (TAD), a glutamate-rich domain, a cysteine-rich domain, 7 tandem ankyrin repeats (ANKs), and a methyltransferase domain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Roopra et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dillon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Purcell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bittencourt et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, G9a and GLP form a heterodimer via the interaction between the C-terminal catalytic domains (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tachibana et al., 2005</a>). The major function of the G9a/GLP complex is to catalyze H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 in euchromatin, which is associated with transcriptional repression (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tachibana et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2008</a>). Accumulated evidence has shown that this methyltransferase complex regulates multiple biological processes, such as meiosis, embryonic development, immune response, and tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Tachibana et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Schaefer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</a>). Interestingly, if one of these two methyltransferases is deleted, the other one alone has little enzymatic activity in vivo, suggesting that the heterodimer formation is important for the function of this enzyme complex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tachibana et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2008</a>). Downstream functional partners of the G9a/GLP complex have been examined. Since HP1 recognizes H3K9me2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bannister et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lachner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Nielsen et al., 2001</a>), it is likely that the G9a/GLP complex mediates the recruitment of HP1 to specific gene loci for transcriptional repression (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ogawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Nishio and Walsh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</a>). Moreover, the ANKs of G9a and GLP also recognize H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Collins et al., 2008</a>), which may facilitate the chromatin spreading of the G9a/GLP complex."

In addition to histone methylation, the G9a/GLP complex also regulates DNA methylation during early embryogenesis, which is independent of their methyltransferase activity. It has been reported that the G9a/GLP complex associates with DNMT1 through PCNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esteve et al., 2006</a>).

In this study, we searched other possible subunit(s) in the G9a/GLP complex. With unbiased protein affinity purification, we found that ZNF644 and WIZ, two zinc finger proteins, interact with G9a and GLP, respectively. These two zinc finger proteins target G9a and GLP to genomic loci for the regulation of gene transcription."

Since G9a and GLP form a heterodimer in vivo (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tachibana et al., 2005</a>), we could easily detect GLP as a partner of G9a in this purification, which was served as a positive control. Interestingly, besides GLP, G9a also interacted with two other proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that these two proteins were ZNF644 and WIZ, two zinc finger proteins. Between these two proteins, WIZ has been known to regulate the stability of the G9a/GLP heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ueda et al., 2006</a>), while the function of ZNF644 has not been characterized yet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Based on the domain architecture (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</a>), we generated four internal deletion mutants of G9a to delete the TAD, the Glu-rich and Cys-rich domains, the ANKs and the catalytic domain, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interestingly, the D1 mutant of G9a abolished the interaction with ZNF644 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

However, the catalytic domain of G9a also interacts with the catalytic domain of GLP for a heterodimer. Thus, it is possible that the association between G9a and WIZ is mediated by GLP.

In contrast, the catalytic domain of GLP is required for the interaction with ZNF644 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Since the catalytic domains of G9a and GLP form a heterodimer, it is likely that ZNF644 directly recognizes the TAD of G9a and associates with GLP via the interactions between G9a and GLP.

The D1 mutant of ZNF644 abolished the interaction with G9a (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), suggesting that the N-terminus of ZNF644 interacts with the TAD of G9a. In contrast, the C-terminus of WIZ is required for the interaction with GLP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Taken together, with the analyses on the internal deletion mutants, we found that the N-terminus of ZNF644 interacts with the TAD of G9a, while the C-terminus of WIZ interacts with the TAD of GLP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Since both ZNF644 and WIZ have multi zinc-finger motifs, it is likely that both ZNF644 and WIZ regulate the function of G9 and GLP."

We lysed cells with NETN100 solution (0.5% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, and 100 mM NaCl). However, both ZNF644 and WIZ could not be eluted into soluble fraction under low salt conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, after treating the insoluble pellets with Benzonase to digest the genomic DNA, both ZNF644 and WIZ were eluted into the soluble fraction, suggesting that ZNF644 and WIZ are chromatin-bound proteins. Usually, chromatin-bound proteins could be eluted from genomic DNA by 300 mM NaCl treatment (<a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). With increased sodium concentration in the lysis buffer, \u223c 50% of ZNF644 was eluted out. However, only a small fraction of WIZ could be eluted from the chromatin, and the remaining WIZ was still tightly associated with genomic DNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus, these results indicate that both ZNF644 and WIZ tightly bind to chromatin. It is also consistent with our affinity purification results that WIZ is slightly difficult to be identified in the mass spectrometry analyses."

                                "text": "To determine if ZNF644 and WIZ target G9a to specific genomic loci, we performed high-throughput ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine the genome-wide localization of G9a, ZNF644, and WIZ in 293T cells. We identified 14,153 G9a enriched regions, 12,777 ZNF644 enriched regions, and 11,853 WIZ enriched regions, respectively. The ChIP-seq results were validated using ChIP-qPCR to examine 30 randomly picked loci that represent a broad range of ChIP-seq fragment counts (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To analyze genome-wide distribution of those enriched regions, the whole genome was partitioned into three regions: intragenic region, promoter region (5 kb upstream or downstream of the TSS), and distal intergenic region not encoding any genes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Approximately, 40% of G9a peaks, 45% of ZNF644 peaks, and 43% of WIZ peaks were distributed in gene promoter region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We found around 54% of WIZ-enriched regions were bound by G9a, and around 58% of ZNF644 enriched regions were bound by G9a, while around 63% of G9a enriched regions were bound by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results indicate that most G9a-enriched regions are associated with ZNF644 and/or WIZ, which is in agreement with our results that the chromatin loading of G9a is dependent on the ZNF644 and/or WIZ. It has been shown that G9a regulates gene transcription via catalyzing H3K9me2 at promoter regions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Su et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kubicek et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fang et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we analyzed G9a peaks in promoter regions and found that around 82% of G9a-enriched peaks in promoter region were bound by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Further analyses across G9a peaks in promoter regions show that ZNF644 and WIZ profiles are also associated with the G9a profiles in promoter region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, accumulated evidence suggests that G9a is clearly associated with ZNF644 and WIZ, especially in promoter regions. To further analyze the co-localization of ZNF644 and WIZ with G9a at specific gene loci, we studied several genes with promoter enrichment of G9a. At <i>CWH43</i>, <i>DIP2C</i> and <i>ROCK1</i> loci, G9a, ZNF644 and WIZ co-localized together at the promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). At <i>CACNA2D1</i>, <i>ANKRD26P1</i>, <i>USP14,</i> and <i>HCN1</i> loci, only ZNF644, but little WIZ, significantly co-localized with G9a in the promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). In contrast, at <i>PARD3</i>, <i>ABCA13</i>, <i>SENP5</i>, and <i>NRXN3</i> loci, WIZ, but little ZNF644, co-localized with G9a (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Taken together, ZNF644 and/or WIZ associate with G9 at the promoter regions of specific loci."

Using Peak-motifs software (<a href=\"http://floresta.eead.csic.es/rsat/peak-motifs_form.cgi\">http://floresta.eead.csic.es/rsat/peak-motifs_form.cgi</a>), we examined only ZNF644-enriched regions (lacking WIZ), by which we excluded the possible loading of ZNF644 onto chromatin via WIZ. A specific DNA-binding sequence was concluded by the software (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), and this sequence was confirmed at <i>CACNA2D1</i>, <i>ANKRD26P1</i>, <i>USP14,</i> and <i>HCN1</i> loci only occupied by ZNF644. Similarly, a specific DNA binding sequence of WIZ was also obtained from software analyses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>) and was confirmed at <i>PARD3</i>, <i>ABCA13</i>, <i>SENP5</i>, and <i>NRXN3</i> loci. Moreover, both ZNF644 and WIZ-binding sequences were identified at the loci co-occupied by ZNF644 and WIZ, such as <i>CWH43</i>, <i>DIP2C</i>, and <i>ROCK1</i> loci (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and found that the consensus DNA-binding motifs of ZNF644 and WIZ showed strong binding with full-length recombinant proteins (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In agreement with the ChIP-seq results, ZNF644, WIZ, and G9a localized at <i>CWH43</i>, <i>DIP2C,</i> and <i>ROCK1</i> loci (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, down-regulation of ZNF644 and WIZ impaired the localization of G9a at these loci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), suggesting that ZNF644 and WIZ are important for targeting G9a to this specific loci. However, down-regulation of G9a did not affect the chromatin localization of ZNF644 and WIZ at these loci (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since G9a catalyzes H3K9me2 that is recognized by HP1\u03b1, we found that both H3K9me2 and HP1\u03b1 were enriched at these loci. Lacking G9a abolished the enrichment of H3K9me2 and HP1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Similarly, loss of ZNF644 and WIZ also impaired the enrichment of H3K9me2 and HP1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting that ZNF644 and WIZ are important for the G9a-dependent H3K9 methylation at G9a targeting genes. Since G9a mainly occupied the promoter regions at these gene loci, G9a-dependent H3K9 methylation is likely to repress gene transcription. Down-regulation of G9a by siRNA indeed increased gene transcription at these loci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Again, loss of ZNF644 and WIZ also facilitated gene transcription (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that ZNF644 and WIZ regulate the function of G9a during transcription. Moreover, we examined only ZNF644 or WIZ occupied gene loci, and similar results were obtained (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

With the analyses on the internal deletion mutants, we found that the N-terminus of ZNF644 interacts with the TAD of G9a, while the C-terminus of WIZ interacts with the TAD of GLP. In the previous study (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ueda et al., 2006</a>), WIZ was found to interact with the catalytic domain of G9a. We obtained the similar result (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, the catalytic domain of G9a also interacts with the catalytic domain of GLP to form a heterodimer. Lacking G9a did not impair the interaction between WIZ and GLP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that the interaction between WIZ and G9a might be indirect and mediated by the catalytic domain heterodimer of G9a and GLP."

However, both G9a and GLP lack the DNA recognition domains for targeting specific genes. Here, we show the evidence that ZNF644 and WIZ, two multi zinc finger motif-containing proteins, mediate the recruitment of G9a and GLP to the specific gene loci. ZNF644 has 8 zinc finger motifs, while WIZ contains 12 zinc finger motifs. It is likely that these zinc finger motifs function together to recognize specific DNA sequences. Based on our ChIP-seq analyses, we identified the DNA sequences recognized by ZNF644 and WIZ. Thus, ZNF644 and WIZ act as two hands to grab the genomic DNA and target enzymatic subunits G9 and GLP for H3K9 methylation. It is also interesting to notice that ZNF644 and WIZ bind the TADs of G9a and GLP, respectively. Thus, the complex may form a symmetric structure with ZNF644 and G9a on one side, and WIZ and GLP on the other side. These two parts are linked by the interaction between the catalytic domains of G9a and GLP in the middle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2I and 3D</a>). The double DNA recognition may reduce the flexibility of the complex on the chromatin and allow the G9a and GLP to precisely catalyze histone methylation at gene loci."

Thus, it is possible that ZNF644 or WIZ alone is sufficient for targeting G9a and GLP to certain loci for H3K9 methylation and transcription repression. Since ZNF644 and WIZ bind different DNA sequences, in these cases, different DNA-binding subunits target G9a and GLP to different loci. With only one DNA-binding arm, the G9a/GLP complex may have more flexibility to methylate targets. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small amount of G9a or GLP only form homodimers. Since ZNF644 only recognizes the TAD of G9a, and WIZ interacts with the TAD of GLP, only ZNF644 or WIZ is sufficient to target the homodimer to the chromatin. Moreover, a small set of G9a associates with neither ZNF644 nor WIZ. Thus, it is possible that a small set of G9a may interact with other regulators. It has been shown that G9 associates with other zinc finger proteins, such as Blimp-1, which may also target G9a to the substrates (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gyory et al., 2004</a>). However, Blimp-1 is mainly expressed in plasma cells as the major function of Blimp-1 is to regulate plasma cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shaffer et al., 2002</a>). Thus, Blimp-1 mainly regulates G9a's activity in plasma cells."

Consistently, we found that G9a associated with ZNF644 and WIZ, especially in the promoter regions, to regulate transcription. Interestingly, <a href=\"#bib35\">Wen et al. 2009</a> examined H3K9me2-enriched loci in the differentiated tissues and found that large chromatin regions associate with H3K9me2. These regions were named as large organized chromatin K9 modifications (LOCKs). However, the function of LOCKs remains unclear. Interestingly, LOCKs are dynamically regulated during development, and the size of LOCKs varies in different types of cells during differentiation, suggesting that LOCKs might be regulated by not only histone methyltransferases but also demethylases. It is possible that the G9a complex plays a key role for LOCKs formation. However, LOCKs do not exist in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wen et al., 2009</a>). Future analysis of the G9a complex during tissue development and differentiation may reveal the mechanism and function of LOCKs. It is possible that, besides ZNF644 and WIZ, other functional partners of G9a regulate LOCKs."

Furthermore, in a major breakthrough the paper demonstrates that WIZ and ZNF644 bind directly to specific DNA sequences and thereby target G9a to specific chromosomal locations. Previously, it was known that a few repressive DNA binding transcription factors can recruit G9a to specific chromosomal loci, but this paper describes a major new mechanism for targeting G9a and GLP to chromatin. The scientific quality of the data presented is generally quite good, but with a few exceptions noted below. There are significant English problems with the manuscript."

Statistical analyses need to be provided for the quantitative PCR data. Furthermore, the data on changes in gene expression when G9a-GLP complex components are depleted is weak and of questionable statistical significance. This data should either be improved (at least to statistical significance) or eliminated. While it would be nice to have an indication that G9a-GLP is having an effect on gene expression at the sites where they are recruited, the novel targeting mechanism would still, in my opinion, be important enough to merit publication.

This is a key question in the field of chromatin biology. The authors show that the zinc finger TFs WIZ and ZN644 associate with G9a-GLP in vivo. They map interacting domains by co-IP with deletion mutants and present genome wide ChIP data on co-localization of the complex and locus-specific ChIP in various RNAi mutants. The interaction with WIZ was previously shown so the novelty here is the association with ZN644, the identification of binding motifs and validation of co-localization genome wide.

There is an overemphasis on locus-specific ChIP studies that lacked measures of statistical significance. Moreover, the paper lacked a deeper discussion of and comparison with other discoveries in the field. For example, there is some disagreement between the authors' analysis and previous studies in terms of domains of interaction between WIZ and G9a-GLP. Additionally, Feinberg showed megabase size domains of histone H3K9me2, while the authors' studies focus on the promoters. Is WIZ-ZNF644-G9a-GLP binding inside as well as at gene promoters? Finally, there are a huge number of disappointing grammatical issues."

G9A/GLP activity results in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. Affinity purification of G9A and ZNF644 was used to determine that G9A/GLP, Wiz and ZNF644 form a core complex. Wiz was shown previously to associate with G9A/GLP and alter its stability (Udea et al.); however, ZNF644 is a new component identified by this manuscript. Using immunoprecipitations of deletion mutants the authors determine that the TAD Domain of GLP and G9A interact selectively with WIZ and ZNF644, respectively. The authors go on to identify the genomic location of WIZ and ZNF644 and that the sites occupied by these proteins accounts for the majority of G9A occupied sites in the genome. Recruitment of G9A and the downstream readers of H3K9 methylation are effected by suppressing WIZ expression. Overall, the data make a compelling case for an important role of WIZ and ZNF644 in recruiting G9A/GLP to their genomic locations. To fully support the proposed role of these proteins in recognition of select genes through a defined DNA sequence, the following points should be addressed:"

The whole genome was partitioned into three regions: intragenic region, promoter region (5kb upstream or downstream of the TSS), and distal intergenic region that does not encode any gene. As shown in revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, a total of 14153 genomic regions are enriched with G9a. Around 40 % of peaks are in promoter region, 16 % are in intergenic region, and 44 % are in intragenic region (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We found around 63 % of G9a peaks were occupied by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (Revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which is consistent with our biochemistry analyses of the G9a complex. By analyzing the genome-wide distribution of the co-localized regions, we found that around 82 % of G9a-enriched peaks in promoter region were bound by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Further analyses across G9a peaks in promoter regions show that ZNF644 and WIZ profiles are associated with the G9a profiles in promoter region (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These results were further validated by individual gene analyses (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> E\u2013G). Since both ZNF644 and WIZ are DNA-binding proteins, it suggests that ZNF644 and WIZ may target G9a to promoter regions.

Consistently, we found that G9a associated with ZNF644 and WIZ, especially in the promoter regions, to regulate transcription (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Wen et al. examined H3K9me2-enriched loci in the differentiated tissues and found that large chromatin regions associate with H3K9me2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wen et al. 2009</a>). These regions were named as large organized chromatin K9 modifications (LOCKs). Interestingly, LOCKs are dynamically regulated during development, and the size of LOCKs varies in different types of cells during tissue development and differentiation, suggesting that LOCKs might be regulated by not only histone methyltransferases but also demethylases. It is unclear whether LOCKs are exclusively dependent on the G9a complex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wen et al. 2009</a>). And the function of LOCKs is unclear. Moreover, LOCKs do not exist in human tumor cell lines (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wen et al. 2009</a>). Nevertheless, LOCKs might be very important chromatin modifications. And we have discussed the possible link between LOCKs and the G9 complex (in the beginning of the Discussion section). It is possible that the G9a complex dynamically regulates LOCKs. However, due to current research setting using 293T cells (human tumor cells), we could not analyze LOCKs in our system. It is possible that both WIZ and ZNF644 regulate LOCKs during development. But we could not rule out other possibilities such as demethylases or other functional partners of G9 specifically expressed during development."
