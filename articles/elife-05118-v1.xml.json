How this harmonization is achieved is not known. Here, we found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin 1 orchestrates the membrane association/disassociation cycle of Rab3, which functions in activity-dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, synaptotagmin 1 binds to Rab3 GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits the GTP hydrolysis of Rab3 protein. Rab3 GAP resides on synaptic vesicles and synaptotagmin 1 is essential for the synaptic localization of Rab3 GAP. In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, synaptotagmin 1 releases Rab3 GAP and promotes membrane disassociation of Rab3. Without synaptotagmin 1, the tight coupling between vesicle exocytosis and Rab3 membrane disassociation is disrupted. We uncovered the long-sought molecular apparatus linking vesicle exocytosis to Rab3 cycling and we also revealed the important function of synaptotagmin 1 in repetitive synaptic vesicle release."
