Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which fragments and solubilizes total chromatin, CUT&amp;RUN; is performed <i>in situ</i>, allowing for both quantitative high-resolution chromatin mapping and probing of the local chromatin environment. When applied to yeast and human nuclei, CUT&amp;RUN; yielded precise transcription factor profiles while avoiding cross-linking and solubilization issues. CUT&amp;RUN; is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only ~1/10<sup>th</sup> the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT&amp;RUN; especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT&amp;RUN; mapped long range contacts at high resolution. We conclude that in situ mapping of protein-DNA interactions by CUT&amp;RUN; is an attractive alternative to ChIP-seq."
