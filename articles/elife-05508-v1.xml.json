Here, we determine mechanistically how Tolloid activity is regulated by its non-catalytic CUB domains in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. We show that Tolloid, via its N-terminal CUB domains, interacts with Collagen IV, which enhances Tolloid activity towards its substrate Sog, and facilitates Tsg-dependent stimulation of cleavage. In contrast, the two most C-terminal Tld CUB domains mediate Sog interaction to facilitate its processing as, based on our structural data, Tolloid curvature positions bound Sog in proximity to the protease domain. Having ascribed functions to the Tolloid non-catalytic domains, we recapitulate embryonic BMP gradient formation in their absence, by artificially tethering the Tld protease domain to Sog. Our studies highlight how the bipartite function of Tolloid CUB domains, in substrate and ECM interactions, fine-tune protease activity to a particular developmental context."

Here, we determine mechanistically how Tolloid activity is regulated by its non-catalytic CUB domains in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. We show that Tolloid, via its N-terminal CUB domains, interacts with Collagen IV, which enhances Tolloid activity towards its substrate Sog, and facilitates Tsg-dependent stimulation of cleavage. In contrast, the two most C-terminal Tld CUB domains mediate Sog interaction to facilitate its processing as, based on our structural data, Tolloid curvature positions bound Sog in proximity to the protease domain. Having ascribed functions to the Tolloid non-catalytic domains, we recapitulate embryonic BMP gradient formation in their absence, by artificially tethering the Tld protease domain to Sog. Our studies highlight how the bipartite function of Tolloid CUB domains, in substrate and ECM interactions, fine-tune protease activity to a particular developmental context."

To achieve this level of organisation, it is important that the cells in the embryo know their location and receive the correct instructions on how to develop, when to divide or move. Many animals are roughly symmetrical about an imaginary line that runs from their head to their tail; a developing embryo can provide its cells with information about their position along this head-to-tail axis and the axis that runs from its front to its back."

The experiments show that two non-catalytic domains at one end of Tolloid help the enzyme to bind to the inhibitory molecules. At the other end of the Tolloid enzyme, another non-catalytic domain can bind to a structural protein called Collagen IV. This enhances the ability of the enzyme to break down the inhibitory molecules and release the BMPs."

In dorsolateral regions, an inhibitory complex is formed, with the Dpp-Scw heterodimer bound by the extracellular antagonists Sog and Tsg (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</a>), aided by the scaffold protein Collagen IV (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</a>). In this inhibitory complex, the Dpp-Scw heterodimer is unable to bind to receptors or Collagen IV, but is free to diffuse dorsally. The secreted Tld metalloproteinase cleaves Sog to release active BMP ligand, however in dorsolateral regions due to the high concentration of Sog, the ligand dimer is rebound. Thus it is through a cycle of complex formation, diffusion and cleavage that the ligands accumulate at the dorsal midline where, upon cleavage by Tld, Dpp-Scw is free to signal (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</a>). A second phase of gradient formation involving intracellular positive feedback then refines this initial broad Dpp-Scw gradient into a peak of BMP receptor activation at the dorsal midline (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang and Ferguson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gavin-Smyth et al., 2013</a>)."

Structural analysis of mammalian Tolloids has revealed that both mammalian Tolloid (mTld) and Tolloid-like-1 (Tll-1) form dimers in which the most C-terminal EGF and CUB domains act in a substrate exclusion mechanism to restrict enzyme activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berry et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2010</a>). In contrast, the highly active, shorter BMP1 protease is monomeric (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berry et al., 2009</a>). Although <i>Drosophila</i> Tld possesses a similar domain structure to mTld, previous studies suggest that removing the three most C-terminal domains, to mimic a shorter BMP1-like form, results in a loss of activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Canty et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, a substrate exclusion mechanism may not exist for <i>Drosophila</i> Tld.

Further detail was extrapolated from the SAXS data on the location of the CUB and EGF domains of Tld by rigid body modelling (RBM). The model retains similar characteristics to the SAXS bead model with the approximate dimensions of 16.6 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 9.2 nm. An overlay of the <i>ab inito</i> model and rigid body model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) shows that Tld displays an elongated conformation with protein curvature around the C-terminal tail (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This brings the most C-terminal CUB domains into close proximity to the N-terminal protease domain. Single particle analysis TEM demonstrates that <i>Drosophila</i> Tld is a monomer, with the overall shape of the 3D reconstruction in agreement with the SAXS model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition to being relatively elongated, the curvature of the EM model mimics that seen in the RBM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). However, it is evident that the TEM model is shorter; this suggests flexibility of the most C-terminal regions that is likely to result in loss of information on this region during the averaging procedure."

To facilitate detection of the Sog\u2013Tld interaction, for all Sog binding experiments described here we used catalytically inactive versions of Tld and the various derivatives tested, by introducing the previously described E94A mutation into the protease active site (<a href=\"#bib13\">Garrigue-Antar et al., 2001</a>). Analysis of Sog\u2013Tld interactions reveals that, similar to the isolated protease domain, the CUB4 and CUB5 deletions are unable to interact with Sog, suggesting that these domains mediate Sog interaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To determine whether the loss of activity for the \u0394CUB4 and \u0394CUB5 forms is due to a specific requirement for both CUB4 and CUB5 domains in Sog interaction rather than an issue of protein length, full-length variants of Tld were generated with CUB4 or CUB5 domain duplications at the C-terminus. However, these enzymes are also inactive, demonstrating a specific requirement for the CUB4\u2013CUB5 domain pair at the C-terminus of Tld (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For the other single CUB deletions, \u0394CUB2 interacts with Sog to a similar extent as wildtype Tld even though its activity is reduced and, despite being inactive, the \u0394CUB1 and \u0394CUB3 forms can bind Sog, albeit at reduced levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These data suggest that a correct protein conformation is important for Tld activity, or that CUB1 and CUB3 mediate a different protein interaction that is important for Sog binding (see later)."

To both validate a direct interaction between Tld and Collagen IV, and determine which domains in Tld are responsible for this interaction, we tested the ability of full-length Tld and the individual CUB domain deletion variants to bind to the NC1 domain of the Viking (Vkg) Collagen IV protein fused to GST. The Collagen IV NC1 domain is a highly conserved globular domain that has been shown to bind Dpp and Sog previously (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>). Tld binds to Collagen IV via its N-terminal CUB domains, with deletion of CUB1, CUB2 or CUB3 reducing binding to &lt;25% that of full-length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, removal of the Sog interacting domains, CUB4 and CUB5, has little effect on the Tld-Collagen IV interaction. No interaction with the control GST protein was observed for any of the Tld-HA proteins (data not shown). To test the effect of Collagen IV on Tld and Sog interaction, their binding was investigated in the presence of an increased amount of Collagen IV.

It is likely that soluble Collagen IV, or its cleavage fragments following matrix turnover, are present in the media from transfected cells along with the test proteins. Therefore, to limit Collagen IV levels, test proteins were obtained from transfected cells that were also treated with <i>vkg</i> RNAi. Despite this, we expect that the \u2018\u2212Collagen IV\u2019 condition will still contain some Collagen IV, and compare this low level to a \u2018+Collagen IV\u2019 condition in which the Vkg and Dcg1 NC1 domains were added. The addition of Collagen IV enhances Tld cleavage at both the 50 and 33 kDa sites of Sog (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), consistent with increased Sog\u2013Tld interaction in the presence of Collagen IV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The addition of Tsg increases Sog cleavage, especially at the 33 kDa site in the presence of Collagen IV. However, the Collagen IV enhancement of Sog processing is reduced in the presence of high levels of Tsg (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, little enhancement at either the 50 or 33 kDa site is observed in the presence of Collagen IV when the \u0394CUB2 mutant, that is defective in Collagen IV interaction, is tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As before (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), Tsg fails to enhance Sog processing by the \u0394CUB2 mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting that Tsg function may depend on a Tld-Collagen IV interaction.

This mutant Sog is a much poorer substrate for Tld cleavage compared to wildtype Sog, and no enhancement of cleavage in the presence of added Collagen IV is observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), contrary to that observed with wildtype Sog (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In addition, there is very little of the 33 kDa cleavage fragment, even when Tsg is added in increasing amounts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), suggesting that Tsg function requires a Sog-Collagen IV interaction, in addition to a Tld-Collagen IV interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Consistent with SogCR14* being a poorer Tld substrate in vitro, analysis of embryos expressing either wildtype Sog or the SogCR14* double mutant under the control of the <i>sog</i> lateral stripe (ls) enhancer reveals that the SogCR14* mutant accumulates to a greater level than the wildtype Sog in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together these data show that binding of both Sog and Tld to Collagen IV is necessary for efficient Sog processing."

The surface position of these mutations in the CUB2 and CUB3 domains is shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>. The mutations were engineered into Tld-HA and we first tested for Collagen IV binding, which is reduced by at least two-fold in all CUB2/3 point mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We next tested the effect of these point mutations on Sog interaction. All Tld mutants show reduced Sog interaction, with the same severity profile as that observed for the defects in Collagen IV binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Di,iii</a>, cf with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Cii</a>), consistent with the data presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> that Collagen IV promotes the Tld\u2013Sog interaction. To show that the effects on Sog interaction are an indirect effect of the Tld mutant proteins being unable to bind Collagen IV, which promotes Sog\u2013Tld binding, we uncoupled the assay from Collagen IV, again using the mutant form of Sog that is defective in Collagen IV binding (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>). As predicted, Tld binding to this mutant form of Sog is weaker as the Collagen IV enhancement is lost (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Dii</a>). However, the four mutant Tld proteins all show equivalent levels of binding to this form of Sog, as that observed for wildtype Tld (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Dii,iii</a>). These data reveal that the CUB2/3 mutations do not affect Sog interaction per se, but rather disrupt the stimulatory effect observed through Collagen IV. In terms of cleavage activity, the four mutant Tld proteins show reduced cleavage of Sog, especially of the 33 kDa fragment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), consistent with their reduced ability to bind Sog and the requirement for Collagen IV for Tsg enhancement of processing at the 33 kDa site. Together, these data suggest that the molecular defect underlying the phenotypes associated with the CUB2/3 point mutations is a weak ability to bind Collagen IV."

Immunoprecipitations confirmed the ability of the leucine zippers to induce enzyme-substrate interaction; SogZ+ specifically interacts with the corresponding MPZ\u2212 zipper but not the MPZ+ or unmodified MP domain controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To test whether the interaction induced by the leucine zippers is sufficient to rescue the activity of the isolated protease domain, cleavage assays were carried out in cell culture.

Thus, Tld represents the first five CUB domain family member that exists as a monomer, as Tll-1 and mTld have previously been shown to be dimers that exclude Chordin substrate resulting in low catalytic activity towards it (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berry et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2010</a>). Thus, whereas the dimeric Tolloids require the affinity of substrate interaction to be higher than the intramolecular affinity within the dimer for activation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hintze et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berry et al., 2009</a>), this is not a limitation for <i>Drosophila</i> Tld. We show that the Tld CUB1-3 domains bind Collagen IV. Consistent with this, recently an interaction has been identified between Collagen IV and the CUB domains of PCPE-1 (<a href=\"#bib34a\">Salza et al., 2014</a>), and Collagen IV binds the zebrafish G-protein coupled receptor GPR126, via a region containing the CUB domain (<a href=\"#bib30a\">Paavola et al., 2014</a>). We also show that Tsg enhancement of Sog processing by Tld is dependent on the Tld-Collagen IV interaction.

In addition to Sog and Dpp-Scw, which have been previously shown to bind independently to Collagen IV (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>), the data presented here show that Tld, via its CUB1-3 domains, also binds to Collagen IV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, step 1). In the model, we suggest that initially there is no interaction between Sog, Dpp-Scw or Tld bound to Collagen IV. However, in the next step, when Dpp-Scw is transferred to Sog from Collagen IV, as has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>), we suggest that Tld is transferred at the same time, interacting with Sog via the Tld CUB4 and CUB5 domains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, step 2). Tsg has previously been shown to release Dpp-Scw/Sog from Collagen IV as a Dpp-Scw/Tsg complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2008</a>), with Tsg recruitment or interaction potentially stabilised by the BMP binding capacity of Tsg's N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Oelgeschlager et al., 2000</a>).

As Tsg has been suggested previously to compete with Collagen IV for binding to the SogCR1 domain to release the Sog-BMP complex from Collagen IV (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>), it is possible that there is little Sog binding to Collagen IV when Tsg is in excess, so the positive effect of Collagen IV is reduced."

In support of this, we find that Tld is unable to bind to Sog in the absence of Dpp (data not shown). In addition, our mechanism of gradient formation puts the emphasis on a balance between the distance that the Tld-BMP-Sog-Tsg complex diffuses and the rate with which Tld cleavage occurs, rather than on a limitation in terms of Tld recruitment. Although Tld levels are not limiting in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eldar et al., 2002</a>), it is possible that Tld activity is suboptimal in order to allow sufficient diffusion required for peak gradient formation. Consistent with this idea, mathematical modelling has revealed that lowering Tld processing activity favours a more defined BMP peak, due to an increase in BMP shuttling to the dorsal midline (<a href=\"#bib31\">Peluso et al., 2011</a>). In addition, a recent model of BMP shuttling in the sea urchin embryo finds Tld to be a dominant determinant of the system, with reduced levels of Tld relative to the fly system necessary for the best fit to the spatial extent of the BMP signalling peak in sea urchins (<a href=\"#bib43\">van Heijster et al., 2014</a>)."

For example, all of the CUB2/3 point mutants are more severely compromised in their ability to cleave the 33 kDa site, compared to the 50 kDa site. Similarly, we also show that Tld cleavage of a mutant form of Sog, which is defective in Collagen IV interaction, does not release the 33 kDa fragment. As Tsg releases the BMP-Sog-Tld complex from Collagen IV in our model, we suggest that this release involves a remodelling of protein interactions that alters the interaction of Tld with Sog allowing better access to all Sog cleavage sites, but especially the 33 kDa site, which is Tsg-dependent (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shimmi and O'Connor, 2003</a>). Moreover, we speculate that Tld can cleave the 50 kDa Sog site, that does not require Tsg, when the BMP-Sog-Tld complex is bound to Collagen IV, although the dual binding of Tld to Collagen IV and Sog holds Tld in a conformation that prevents both processing at the 33 kDa site and inactivation of Sog, prior to Tsg release. If these assumptions are correct, it follows that cleavage at the 33 kDa site within Sog is necessary for complete loss of Sog inhibition of Dpp-Scw. In support of this, the Sog C-terminal fragments generated by cleavage at the other two sites retain some BMP inhibitory activity when assayed in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yu et al., 2004</a>). In addition, complete cleavage of Chordin, the mammalian Sog ortholog, is required for relief of BMP inhibition (<a href=\"#bib41\">Troilo et al., 2014</a>). We also note that although our zipper system can rescue BMP signalling thresholds in the embryo, cleavage at the 33 kDa equivalent cleavage fragment of the Sog-zipper fusion protein is the preferred site, consistent with cleavage at this site being key to full release of the Sog inhibitory effect."

Supersog consists mainly of the Sog CR1 domain and has been suggested, like Tsg, to compete with full-length Sog for binding to Collagen IV to release the shuttling complex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>). However, it may be that incomplete processing of Sog by Tld in the absence of Tsg does not relieve full inhibition of the BMP ligands. Such a role for Tsg would be in addition to the Sog-independent positive role with respect to BMP signalling that has also been described (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang and Ferguson, 2005</a>)."

Mutations in CUB1-2 and CUB4-5 reduce Collagen IV and Sog binding, respectively, resulting in lower levels of Sog cleavage. As the shuttle-transport mechanism relies on cycles of complex diffusion, destruction and reformation, decreased Sog cleavage disrupts formation of the Dpp activity gradient resulting in ventralisation. Our in vitro data show that the CUB2 deletion behaves differently from the CUB2 point mutants in that, although the \u0394CUB2 and point mutants all show reduced binding to Collagen IV, unlike the point mutants, the \u0394CUB2 mutant remains able to bind Sog, although it cleaves very poorly. We suggest that the \u0394CUB2 mutant is conformationally different so it can bind to Sog without prior presentation by Collagen IV, but cleavage is affected, especially of the 33 kDa fragment, and not enhanced by Tsg, which may reflect perturbation of the Tld\u2013Sog interaction, as proposed above."

Revertants of these antimorphic mutations have also been identified within the CUB1, 2 and 5 domains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Childs and O'Connor, 1994</a>), but as they reduce secretion of the mutant Tld proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2009</a>), they provide only limited insight into the molecular mechanism of the antimorphic mutants. Nevertheless, based on the finding that <i>Drosophila</i> and vertebrate Tld CUB1/2 or CUB4/5 domain pairs can bind BMP4 and BMP7, and inhibit BMP signalling when injected into <i>Xenopus</i> embryos (with reciprocal inhibition of Tld by BMP interaction), it was proposed that the antimorphic effect of <i>tld</i> alleles may be due to an inhibition of Dpp activity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2009</a>). However, the role of the Tld-BMP interaction in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo is not fully understood and only point mutants in the CUB2 or protease domains behave in an antimorphic manner (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ferguson and Anderson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Finelli et al., 1994</a>). One possibility is that Tld and Dpp binding to Collagen IV largely prevents a direct Tld\u2013Dpp interaction, but instead favours shuttling complex assembly in the presence of Sog and Tsg. In the absence of Collagen IV binding, the CUB2 point mutants could inhibit Dpp to some extent, further reducing Dpp activity that is already compromised in a background heterozygous for a weak <i>tld</i> or <i>dpp</i> allele."

Similarly, ONT1, a secreted Olfactomedin-class protein, facilitates Chordin-BMP1 interaction by independently recruiting both proteins, resulting in robust BMP gradient formation during embryonic DV patterning. In addition, for procollagen III processing by BMP1 in the presence of PCPE-1, heparin-like sulphated glycosaminoglycans may act as a scaffold for BMP1 processing of procollagen III in vivo (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bekhouche et al., 2010</a>).

It would be interesting to determine whether tethering the BMP1 protease domain to Chordin can circumvent the requirement for the BMP1 non-catalytic domains in vertebrates. Perhaps this would allow too much turnover of Chordin in vivo given that BMP1 cleavage of Chordin is independent of BMPs. In addition, BMP1 MP domain tethering would prevent interaction with secreted Frizzled-related proteins, which are recruited via the non-catalytic domains of mammalian Tolloids to mediate important further positive and negative control of activity in specific regions of vertebrate embryos (<a href=\"#bib29\">Muraoka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kobayashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ploper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">De Robertis and Colozza, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Inomata et al., 2013</a>). It is interesting that <i>Drosophila</i> lacks secreted Frizzled-related proteins, suggesting that ECM control of the Tld-substrate interaction is sufficient for fine control of Tld activity and the resulting Sog and BMP levels in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. This may stem from Tld processing of Sog being BMP-dependent in <i>Drosophila</i>, a situation that has already been shown to favour the steep BMP gradient required in this context (<a href=\"#bib31\">Peluso et al., 2011</a>). Given that the leucine zipper system mediates an interaction between two different proteins synthesised in distinct regions of the embryo, we suggest that it will be useful for not only determining sufficiency of other interactions, but also for determining the effect of mediating ectopic or prolonged interactions between other test proteins in vivo."

Recombinant Dpp was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN) and reconstituted in 4 mM HCl. Total reaction volume was kept constant by the addition of mock transfected cell medium. When complete, reactions were stopped with sample buffer (2.5% glycerol, 12.5% SDS, 20% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 24 mM Tris/HCl) and analysed by Western blot. Cleavage assays using the zipper fusion proteins were performed by co-transfecting the appropriate plasmids, as described above."

Following binding, the beads were washed multiple times in IP buffer and resuspended and heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min in 30 \u00b5l 1XSDS sample buffer for analysis by Western blot. The same principle was followed for leucine zipper immunoprecipitations in the absence of rDpp. GST pulldown assays were carried out using 10\u2013300 \u00b5l Tld-HA proteins (levels normalised by Western blot) as described (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sawala et al., 2012</a>)."
