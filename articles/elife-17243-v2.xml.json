                    "text": "We hardly notice our eye blinks, yet an externally generated retinal interruption of a similar duration is perceptually salient. We examined the neural correlates of this perceptual distinction using intracranially measured ECoG signals from the human visual cortex in 14 patients. In early visual areas (V1 and V2), the disappearance of the stimulus due to either invisible blinks or salient blank video frames ('gaps') led to a similar drop in activity level, followed by a positive overshoot beyond baseline, triggered by stimulus reappearance. Ascending the visual hierarchy, the reappearance-related overshoot gradually subsided for blinks but not for gaps. By contrast, the disappearance-related drop did not follow the perceptual distinction \u2013 it was actually slightly more pronounced for blinks than for gaps. These findings suggest that blinks' limited visibility compared with gaps is correlated with suppression of blink-related visual activity transients, rather than with \"filling-in\" of the occluded content during blinks."

Patients had the opportunity to consent prior to electrode implantation and were informed that they may choose to decline or later withdraw from the study without affecting their clinical care. Consent includes agreement to participate with studies of cognitive and sensorimotor processes and publication of any deidentified data obtained. Risks include tedium and potential breach of medical information and are minimized by giving ample breaks and implementation of protocols to deidentify data close to the time of recording.

We examined the neural correlates of this perceptual distinction using intracranially measured ECoG signals from the human visual cortex in 14 patients. In early visual areas (V1 and V2), the disappearance of the stimulus due to either invisible blinks or salient blank video frames ('gaps') led to a similar drop in activity level, followed by a positive overshoot beyond baseline, triggered by stimulus reappearance. Ascending the visual hierarchy, the reappearance-related overshoot gradually subsided for blinks but not for gaps. By contrast, the disappearance-related drop did not follow the perceptual distinction \u2013 it was actually slightly more pronounced for blinks than for gaps. These findings suggest that blinks' limited visibility compared with gaps is correlated with suppression of blink-related visual activity transients, rather than with \"filling-in\" of the occluded content during blinks."

Data was obtained as part of protocol number 07-125. Patients had the opportunity to consent prior to electrode implantation and were informed that they may choose to decline or later withdraw from the study without affecting their clinical care. Consent includes agreement to participate with studies of cognitive and sensorimotor processes and publication of any deidentified data obtained. Risks include tedium and potential breach of medical information and are minimized by giving ample breaks and implementation of protocols to deidentify data close to the time of recording. Benefits to the subject include increased monitoring of the electrocorticogram and involvement of research methods to help localize electrodes with respect to preoperative MRI."

Towards the back of the brain, where cortical processing of visual signals begins, neurons responded in a way that was consistent with the physical information the eye actually received rather than the perception of vision. Thus, neurons showed the same responses to easily seen blank frames in a movie as to unnoticeable blinks. However, as the signals streamed forward to down-stream brain regions involved in vision, neurons in successive areas were increasingly likely to distinguish between the perceptually visible blank frames versus the invisible blinks."

External darkenings of such duration have been shown to cause a robust percept (<a href=\"#bib51\">Riggs et al., 1981</a>). Strikingly, since blinks normally occur at least 1000 times an hour (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cruz et al., 2011</a>), about three or four percent of our waking hours are unknowingly spent with our eyes closed. While spontaneous blinks are invisible, voluntary blinks are not. However, their perception is also not veridical: they are experienced as shorter and less dim than physically comparable artificial darkenings (<a href=\"#bib51\">Riggs et al., 1981</a>)."

Consider a reduction of retinal input driven by an external origin, such as when someone briefly turns off the lights. Such a reduction will diminish low-level visual activity as well, yet, unlike blinks, this external reduction is clearly visible. Hence, it seems that a neural basis for the special perceptual status of blinks requires a representation that is both unperturbed by blinks and yet still sensitive to perceived external darkenings. Furthermore, if one assumes that perceived continuity relies on a read-out of an ongoing representation of the visual scene, this entails an active 'filling-in' of this visual representation during blinks but not during external darkenings (<a href=\"#bib10\">Billock, 1997</a>). Operationally, a filling-in mechanism would be reflected in continuous neural activity across blinks but not across gaps despite the decrease in retinal input common to both. This hypothetical effect is in an opposite direction to the previously reported neuronal suppression."

Intriguingly, both low and high-level cortical sites failed to exhibit a differential filling-in for blinks compared to gaps, suggesting that the perceived continuity of the visual scene might not depend on a continuous neural representation in category-selective visual areas but on the lack of representation of discontinuities, that is, stimulus disappearances and reappearances."

The patients viewed consecutively presented grayscale photographs of faces and non-face images from several categories (houses, tools, abstract patterns and animals). The patients clicked the mouse button each time they detected an animal image (mean hit-rate\u00a0=\u00a086.1%, mean false-alarm rate\u00a0=\u00a03.4%). Target (animal) trials were excluded from further analysis. The images were presented at a pace of one image per second with no inter-stimulus blanks (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and Materials and methods). The patients were concurrently monitored for eye blinks by a video eye tracker and an electrooculogram (EOG). Once every ten images, a gray screen was displayed for three seconds, serving as a baseline and partitioning the trials into ten-trial long blocks. Critically, in some of the trials, the displayed stimuli were interrupted by either spontaneously produced eye blinks, periodic (~1 Hz) voluntary eye blinks whose production was cued at the beginning of some of the blocks, or 'gaps', produced by replacing the stimulus with a black or gray screen for variable latencies and durations, aimed at evaluating the purely retinal impact of blinks. Individual latencies and durations of the three kinds of interrupting events for each patient are presented in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

Therefore, we first tested which electrodes reliably responded to the presented stimuli (e.g. faces) themselves. Since we were interested in local field potential correlates of average spiking rate, all of our analyses were conducted on the high-frequency broadband power envelope (sampled between 70 and 150 Hz). A number of previous studies have shown the HFB signal to be a good index of the\u00a0aggregate firing rate (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mukamel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ray et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rasch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Manning et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nir et al., 2007</a>). Following standard preprocessing and HFB computation, we tested the onset response (50\u2013350 ms, uncontaminated by either gaps or blinks) to each electrode optimal object stimuli, compared with the inter-block gray blank baseline periods (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib40\">Noy et al., 2015a</a>), responsivity of a considerable effect size was found almost entirely within the anatomically defined visual cortex, showing only minimal responses in more anterior cortical regions."

Patient P57 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a,c</a>) had concurrent recordings in V1 and in a site in a\u00a0high-level dorsal stream region, over the middle temporal gyrus, slightly less than 1 cm anterior to the border of anatomically defined MST/TO2. The dorsal high-level electrode showed a positive HFB response triggered by the image disappearance (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>, compare with <b>1c</b> for image-reappearance-lock) due to gaps and no response whatsoever for blinks.

Responses followed a consistent hierarchical progression: in V1 and V2, gaps, voluntary blinks and spontaneous blinks all produced qualitatively similar (but not identical) responses \u2013 which consisted of a dip in activation in response to the image disappearance, followed by an overshoot beyond baseline levels triggered by the image reappearance. Progressing along the visual hierarchy, the response to gaps and blinks diverged: the response to the image reappearance was sustained only when triggered by the termination of an external gap, and not by the termination of a blink. The negative activation dip reduced its amplitude along the hierarchy, even more so for gaps than to blinks. This is in stark contrast with the expected filling-in during blinks but not gaps. As an alternative analysis, we derived traditional event-related averages of the HFB signal of uninterrupted stimuli and subtracted them from each trial (instead of the deconvolution procedure) before computing gap and blink-related event-related-averages. This procedure yielded very similar results (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>), which rules out the possibility that the observed results were somehow an artifact of the deconvolution analysis we adopted."

Specifically, for each electrode and interrupting event (gap/spontaneous blink/voluntary blink), we searched the reappearance-related response for clusters of contiguous above-baseline timepoints. The cluster of largest activation integral that followed the reappearance was marked as the electrode's reappearance-related overshoot component. Similarly, the contiguous below-baseline cluster in the disappearance-locked response with the largest (negative) activation integral was marked as the electrode's negative-dip component. This procedure directly addressed the response-latency variability across electrodes, reflected in the travelling wave-like nature of the responses across the visual hierarchy (see <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>)."

The results of this analysis can be interpreted similarly to the more commonly used repeated-measures ANOVA, however, since the mixed-effects approach naturally allows for missing values, it is well suited for data sampled with varying anatomical coverage. The estimated responses are presented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. We first describe the results for the reappearance-related overshoot (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a\u2013b</a>). The two ANOVA tests of primary interest are (a) the interaction of ROI with interruption, which was significant (F(12,471.29) = 4.38, p&lt;0.001), indicating that gaps, voluntary blinks and spontaneous blinks indeed affected different ROIs differently and (b) the three-way interaction between ROI, interruption and category, which was not significant (F(12,463.31) = 0.59, p=0.85), potentially because category appeared to modulate interruption only in a single ROI (face-selective electrodes). The significant ROI and interruption interaction was further investigated by testing for simple effects between spontaneous blinks, voluntary blinks and gaps within each ROI. In agreement with our previous analysis, in face-trials, gaps showed significantly larger reappearance-related overshoot responses compared with voluntary blinks both in VO, the face-selective and high-level face non-selective ROIs (p<sub>FDR</sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05).

As in the reappearance-related overshoot data, the three-way interaction of interruption, category and ROI was not significant (F(12,463.10) = 0.45, p=0.94). Inspecting the effects between the three kinds of interruptions within each ROI found that the activation dip triggered by gaps was smaller (more shallow) compared to that triggered by voluntary blinks in most ROIs (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c\u2013d</a> for detailed simple effects results, p<sub>FDR</sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) and it was also smaller than the dip triggered by spontaneous blinks in V1 and V2 (both face and non-face trials, p<sub>FDR</sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). Importantly, no evidence was observed for greater (deeper) activation dip for gaps compared with either spontaneous or voluntary blinks in any ROI, and except for the high-level face non-selective ROI during non-face trials, the non-significant trend in all ROIs was inverse (gaps had smaller dips than both kinds of blinks), once again, a result that is inconsistent with selective filling-in of blinks but not of gaps. Repeating the mixed-effects analysis after normalizing each ROI by its total response to the object-images (e.g. normalizing by the integrals of the traces depicted in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) yielded very similar results. Note that both the electrode-level permutation testing and group mixed-effects analysis demonstrated a compatible pattern of effects."

We tested that possibility by post-hoc selecting subsets of gaps and blinks such that their latency or duration histograms will tightly match (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig7s2\">2</a>, correspondingly). The matching procedure was done independently for voluntary and spontaneous blinks, using face-trials. Whereas this post-hoc selection led to considerably increased sampling error estimates (due to the usage of only a fraction of the original trials), the observed pattern of results largely reproduced the results reported above and was qualitatively indistinguishable from that produced by the entire dataset, both for matching the events latencies (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1c\u2013f</a>) and for matching the events durations (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2c\u2013f</a>). Specifically, in all matched analyses, we still observed significant advantages of the reappearance-related overshoot for gaps compared with spontaneous and voluntary blinks in the higher-level ROIs (face-selective and non-face selective high-level visual electrodes, p<sub>FDR</sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). The finding of greater (deeper) activation dip for blinks compared with gaps was even more pronounced than in the original (unmatched) analysis, with no ROI showing even a non-significant trend in the inverse direction."

First, in nine patients, half of the gaps were implemented with a gray instead of a black blank. This manipulation has the effect of decreasing both the amplitude of the image transients caused by the gap and their spatial extent; since the same gray-level was used as the screen background, only the central part of the screen was perturbed instead of its entirety. If transients produced by gaps persisted in higher-level visual cortex due to greater low-level impact, this manipulation should reduce this effect. However, using gray instead of black gaps produced qualitatively similar results (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3a\u2013b</a>), keeping the pattern of high-level advantage of gaps over blinks intact."

(b) The activation overshoot triggered by blinks' termination gradually decreased along the cortical hierarchy, whereas the overshoot produced by gaps' termination was sustained, resulting in an increasing difference between the responses to gaps' and blinks' termination in higher-level visual cortex.

Can these potential retinal differences account for the differential response to gaps and blinks we observed in high-level visual cortex? We believe that the observed similarity between gap and blink-related responses in early visual cortex empirically argues against this possibility. Put simply, the responses in early visual cortex can be viewed as an 'internal control' of the low-level effects of these two types of events- and these early responses were quite similar for gaps and blinks (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, left column).

This pathway might be shared with saccades: this possibility is supported by psychophysical similarities of blink-suppression and saccade-suppression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bidder and Tomlinson, 1997</a>) and by the documented occurrence of a brief 1\u20132\u00b0 rotation of the eye during the downward phase of the blink, which might provide a sufficient efferent signal to enable blink suppression (<a href=\"#bib50\">Riggs et al., 1987</a>).

It is conceivable that the onset (disappearance-related) and offset (reappearance-related) sensitive responses in higher-level dorsal stream sites that we noted (albeit infrequently due to coverage limitations. See <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) play a critical role in this task: a burst of activity in such sites may underlie the percept of a flicker caused by a stimulus disappearance (gap) or external darkening. By contrast, during blinks, blink-suppression signals may actively block these detectors of discontinuity, resulting in the experience of continuously perceived stimuli (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>). Thus, we propose that the neuronal representation of perceived face-disappearance is found outside the ventral face-selective areas. The upshot of this is that one cannot attribute the content of a conscious percept to a single cortical element, necessitating a joint-representation across diverse content-selective regions."

All patients gave fully informed consent, including consent to publish, according to NIH guidelines, as monitored by the institutional review board at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data was obtained as part of protocol number 07\u2013125. Patients had the opportunity to consent prior to electrode implantation and were informed that they may choose to decline or later withdraw from the study without affecting their clinical care. Consent includes agreement to participate with studies of cognitive and sensorimotor processes and publication of any deidentified data obtained. Risks include tedium and potential breach of medical information and are minimized by giving ample breaks and implementation of protocols to deidentify data close to the time of recording. Benefits to the subject include increased monitoring of the electrocorticogram and involvement of research methods to help localize electrodes with respect to preoperative MRI. Five additional patients performed the experiment but their recordings were excluded after initial data quality inspection. Reasons for exclusion were independent of the main analyses and consisted of: (1) widespread interictal spikes, (2) no visual coverage, (3) severe visual field impairments (4) contamination of the ECoG signal by synchronization triggers and (5) a case in which the patient misunderstood the instructions to voluntary blink and executed prolonged eye closures (mean duration of 642 ms) instead."

Blocks of grayscale still images of faces, houses, tools, abstract patterns or animals, embedded in a uniform gray background, were presented at a constant pace of 1 Hz, with no blanks between consecutive stimuli. The images subtended a visual angle of 15.8\u00b0. Stimuli were grouped in blocks of ten consecutive images of mixed categories, separated by between-block intervals of blank gray screen (three seconds long). A total of 32 blocks per subject were considered for this study (additional 12 blocks included sudden spatial displacements of the stimuli and were not included in the analysis). In 10 of the 14 patients (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), twelve of the blocks were preceded by an auditory cue to blink at a steady pace of one blink per second until a stop signal that followed the block's end. Blinks occurring during these blocks were categorized as 'voluntary' and blinks occurring outside these blocks were classified as 'spontaneous'. In the rest of the blocks, gaps in the visual stimulation were pseudo-randomly introduced in 60% of the trials at 350, 550 or 750 ms post stimulus transition. We applied a wide range of gap durations (100\u2013200 ms in most patients, see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) in order to allow for post-hoc matching of blinks and gaps. The subjects' main task was to click the mouse button when an image of an animal appeared. These trials were later excluded from the analyses. Each patient participated in a single session that was divided by three short breaks in which the patients were required to rest with their eyes closed. Including the breaks, an entire session typically lasted about 15 min. As the experiment proceeded, additional controls for the gap event were introduced: In nine of the subjects (starting at P36), half of the gaps were gray (intensity level 183/255, where the object stimuli mean intensity level was 160/255) instead of black (0/255 intensity level) and in seven of these patients (starting at P46), half of the gaps were faded in and out through four frames (16.6 ms each) of 25%, 50% and 75% and 100% mixing levels between the image and the blank screen (manipulated orthogonally of the gray/black gap manipulation). The task was implemented using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems)."

The onsets of new face stimuli (i.e. the beginning of face trials) and the onsets of new non-face stimuli (excluding animals) were modeled by two sets of 375 FIR predictors spanning from 0 to 1500 ms post stimulus onset. The onsets of spontaneous blinks, that is, the image disappearances due to spontaneous blinks, were also modeled separately for face and non-face trials: Image disappearances due to spontaneous blinks occurring during were modeled using a set of 187 FIR predictors, spanning from \u2013250 to 500 ms post blink onset, with separate predictors for blinks occurring at face trials and at non-face trials. Each unit pulse within an FIR predictor spanned exactly one timepoint (4 ms). Gaps and voluntary blinks were modeled by four additional predictor sets (again, modeling separately events that happened during face and non-face trials) of the same parameters. In principle, blink and gap offsets (i.e. the reappearance of the stimuli) could have been modeled in parallel with the onsets within the same model. However, we found that such a model suffers from issues related with collinearity. Therefore, the effects of image reappearance were tested by fitting an alternative model in which blink and gap offsets were used instead of onsets. A model incorporating both onsets and offsets simultaneously was used only for the plotting of the stimulus-related responses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Timepoints during animal trials, timepoints rejected due to signal outliers or eye tracking problems and timepoints during the rest breaks were all excluded from this analysis by the inclusion of a dummy nuisance predictor for each excluded timepoint. For conciseness and ease of visualization, the non-selective single electrode responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and the group gap-blink response map (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) were derived from a simpler regression model built without the distinction between face and non-face stimuli."

The estimated polynomial baseline was then removed from the trace. Next, the baseline-removed trace was thresholded: the sample that first passed the threshold marked the blink onset and the first sample that crossed back below it marked the blink offset. The individual threshold level for each of the two patients was determined empirically from the other 12 patients that did have concurrent EOG and eye tracking: for each such patient, the median amplitude of the EOG blink-artifact produced by spontaneous blinks was estimated. We scanned the range between 0 and 100% and found the threshold of 22% to best predict the eye-tracker based blink duration from the EOG artifact.

They examined responses at earlier and later stages of visual cortical processing in 14 patients during spontaneous blinks, voluntary blinks and during equivalent external gaps in visual stimulation. They found that in early visual cortex responses showed a dip following any interruption in the visual input, irrespective whether it was caused by a spontaneous or voluntary blink or by a gap in visual stimulation. However, at subsequent stages of visual cortical processing, the effect of the blink declined but not that of the gap in visual stimulation. The reduction in the effect of blinks was present in area V4 and was even more pronounced in VO1 and in the ventral temporal cortex. The authors explain the reduction of blink effects at later stages of cortical processing by the operation of the mechanisms that suppress blink-related visual transients, arguing against \"filling-in\" of the missing stimulus content."

However, the metric that the authors use is a non-standard one: In the caption they write: 'The circles' face hue is mapped to the ratio between the gap and blink measures and its saturation to their combined magnitude (Pythagorean sum)'. Using ratios especially when signals are small (e.g. in the higher level ROIs) may inflate small signal differences (i.e. the ratio of a division of small numbers may be large). Instead, I suggest to re-plot this figure by generating a map of the effect size (i.e. difference of the responses to gaps vs. blinks) or a map of the t-contrast between the response to gaps vs. blinks. These analyses would be (i) more directly relatable to the prior figures, (ii) will provide more stable summaries of the data, and (iii) will not be prone to the inflation of small signals."

Each experimental condition (e.g. 'face-images', 'blinks over face-images', 'gaps over non-face images' and so on) was modeled by a set of non-overlapping pulses, each pulse spanning exactly one timepoint. Hence, for a particular experimental event (e.g. a particular blink), these predictors are completely independent from each other, as they form a standard (and hence orthogonal) basis (e.g. [1 0 0],[0 1 0],[0 0 1]). This reflects the fact that when there is no overlap between the responses to different experimental events, the deconvolution analysis is equivalent with standard event-related averaging (see Dandekar et al., 2012). Hence the threat of non-independance can come only from systematically overlapping events. Since gaps and blinks did not appear in all of the trials and when they appeared, they had highly variable onset latencies (gaps by design, blinks empirically, see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the potential for a collinearity issue in this model is very low."

However, the metric that the authors use is a non-standard one: In the caption they write: 'The circles' face hue is mapped to the ratio between the gap and blink measures and its saturation to their combined magnitude (Pythagorean sum)'. Using ratios especially when signals are small (e.g. in the higher level ROIs) may inflate small signal differences (i.e. the ratio of a division of small numbers may be large). Instead, I suggest to re-plot this figure by generating a map of the effect size (i.e. difference of the responses to gaps vs. blinks) or a map of the t-contrast between the response to gaps vs. blinks. These analyses would be (i) more directly relatable to the prior figures, (ii) will provide more stable summaries of the data, and (iii) will not be prone to the inflation of small signals.</i> "
