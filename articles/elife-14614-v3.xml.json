However, learning specificity diminishes with additional exposure of the transfer orientation or location via irrelevant tasks, suggesting that the specificity is related to untrained conditions, likely because neurons representing untrained conditions are neither bottom-up stimulated nor top-down attended during training. To demonstrate these top-down and bottom-up contributions, we applied a \u201ccontinuous flash suppression\u201d technique to suppress the exposure stimulus into sub-consciousness, and with additional manipulations to achieve pure bottom-up stimulation or top-down attention with the transfer condition. We found that either bottom-up or top-down influences enabled significant transfer of orientation and Vernier discrimination learning. These results suggest that learning specificity may result from under-activations of untrained visual neurons due to insufficient bottom-up stimulation and/or top-down attention during training. High-level perceptual learning thus may not functionally connect to these neurons for learning transfer."

                        "text": "Visual perceptual learning is the process in which the observers improve their discrimination of fine differences of basic visual features, such as contrast, orientation, motion direction, etc., through practice. For several decades visual perceptual learning has been regarded as a distinct format of learning because it is specific to the orientation and retinal location of the trained stimulus (<a href=\"#bib18\">Schoups et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar and Hochstein, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Shiu and Pashler, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dosher and Lu, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Poggio et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Fiorentini and Berardi, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Yu et al., 2004</a>). Such learning specificity has inspired theories that interpret visual perceptual learning as a result of training induced neural plasticity in the early visual areas (<a href=\"#bib18\">Schoups et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Karni and Sagi, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Teich and Qian, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bejjanki et al., 2011</a>). For example, it has been proposed that training could sharpen neuronal orientation tuning in the primary visual cortex (V1), so that neurons become more sensitive to the fine changes of orientation differences (<a href=\"#bib25\">Teich and Qian, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Schoups et al., 2001</a>). The learning specificity has also constrained alternative reweighting theories of visual perceptual learning (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dosher and Lu, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Poggio et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Yu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Mollon and Danilova, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Petrov et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Law and Gold, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2009</a>). These theories propose that training may not change the tuning properties of sensory neurons. Rather, the inputs from activated neurons are reweighted through training to improve readout at a later decision stage. Reweighting theories are supported by neurophysiological evidence. For example, motion direction learning in monkeys is correlated with changes in motion-driven responses of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) that is related to the transformation of motion information into decisions (saccadic choices), but not with changes of neurons in the medial temporal area (MT) that represents motion direction signals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Law and Gold, 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "However, in a series of 'double training' studies we demonstrated that visual perceptual learning of various tasks can transfer significantly, and often completely, to new orientations or locations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Xiao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Wang et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2014</a>). In a double training experimental design the observers are additionally exposed to the new orientation or location via practicing an irrelevant task besides the primary learning task. For example, perceptual learning of foveal orientation discrimination (e.g., which of two consecutively presented gratings is more clockwise-tilted?) initially shows little transfer to an orthogonal orientation. However, if the observers are exposed to an orthogonal orientation via an irrelevant contrast discrimination task (e.g., which of two gratings has higher contrast?), learning transfers completely to the orthogonal orientation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, perceptual learning of Vernier discrimination (e.g., whether a lower grating is placed to the left or right of an upper grating) can also transfer significantly and often completely to a new retinal location when the observers are additionally exposed to the transfer location via an irrelevant contrast or orientation discrimination task (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wang et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2014</a>). These results suggest two important insights regarding visual perceptual learning. First, visual perceptual learning is mainly a high-level rule-based learning process that occurs beyond the retinotopic and orientation selective visual areas, so that learning is in principle transferrable to untrained conditions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). Second, learning specificity may be related to the untrained conditions, rather than the trained conditions as the field has been assuming (i.e., plasticity with the trained early visual cortical neurons or reweighting of the inputs from these neurons). The second insight, which stands completely different from the interpretations of\u00a0specificity\u00a0by the field, forms the basis of the current study."

For example, an observer has to focus the attention on the near-threshold difference between the reference orientation and the target orientation at a specific location. As a result the untrained orientations and locations, and thus the visual neurons representing these orientations and locations, are neither bottom-up stimulated nor top-down attended during training. We thus suspect that this insufficient bottom-up stimulation of, and/or top-down attention to, the untrained conditions are responsible for the orientation and location specificity. In other words, because visual neurons representing untrained conditions are not properly activated as a result, high-level perceptual learning may not be able to functionally connect to these neurons for learning transfer."

In the current study we applied a continuous flash suppression (CFS) technique (<a href=\"#bib26\">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005</a>) to suppress the exposure stimulus into sub-consciousness (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We further manipulated the subconscious stimulus conditions to make the exposure task to be bottom-up only or top-down only. The results show that either bottom-up stimulation of the untrained condition, or top-down attention to it, is sufficient to enable substantial and often complete transfer of learning. These results provide a solution to the mystery of learning specificity that has dominated the history of perceptual learning research. With learning specificity considered as a by-product of training, the field should move on to study the brain mechanisms of perceptual learning without much of specificity-related constraints. Moreover, more efficient training paradigms can be designed to generate perceptual learning without the unwanted specificity in practical settings."

To separate the potential bottom-up and top-down contributions of the secondary task, we applied a continuous flashing suppression (CFS) technique (<a href=\"#bib26\">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005</a>) to render the exposure stimulus (a Gabor orthogonal to the trained orientation) subconscious. This was achieved by presenting the flashing noise to the dominant eye, which suppressed the perception of the orthogonal Gabor in the non-dominant eye (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>)."

Here our results paint a completely opposite picture: It is the actions (or the absence of actions) with the untrained conditions that decide the learning specificity and transfer.

However, if learning does not transfer, as shown in about half the observers, the P1-N1 changes are limited to the trained location. We interpret P1-N1 changes as possible indications of top-down connections between high-level Vernier learning and visual neurons at the trained location, as well as at untrained locations when learning transfers. We also interpret learning specificity as a result of absent functional connections. Our current data suggest that both bottom-up stimulation of, and top-down attention to, untrained conditions may activate visual neurons representing the untrained conditions, so as to foster the connections to enable learning transfer."

These results together may also explain fMRI results that orientation specificity is accompanied with refined representation of the trained orientation in early visual areas (<a href=\"#bib9\">Jehee et al., 2012</a>). This is because top-down modulation by high-level orientation learning may not reach the early cortical representations of untrained orientations as a result of absent functional connections."

The untrained orientations and retinal locations, and thus the relevant visual neurons, are neither bottom-up stimulated nor top-down attended. At least in the case of location specificity, there is evidence that spatial attention could suppress other unattended locations even with no presence of competing stimuli (<a href=\"#bib23\">Smith et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Shmuel et al., 2006</a>), as is typical in a perceptual learning study. We suspect that some or all of these factors could contribute to under-activations of neurons at untrained conditions, which in turn could lead to missing functional connections of these neurons to high-level learning to prevent learning transfer."

These transfer results prompted us to propose a rule-based perceptual learning theory. Specifically, we suggest that visual perceptual learning is a high-level process. The brain learns the rules of reweighting visual inputs to achieve better visual performance, and these rules are potentially applicable to new orientations and retinal locations. More recent evidence also suggests that these rules are conceptual, in that learning can transfer between physically distinct stimuli that are initially encoded by different neural mechanisms (e.g., between local and global orientations defined by gratings and symmetric dot patterns, or between first- and second-order motion directions) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). The current findings add to this theory by elucidating why perceptual learning, if high-level and rule-based, can be specific in the first place. These results also suggest that double training schemes function by providing bottom-up and top-down forces to activate untrained neurons, which in turn initiate functional connections for learning transfer. A recent computational model explains how such functional connections can be built with double training (<a href=\"#bib24\">Solgi et al., 2013</a>). In the model, the secondary training task activates the untrained neurons, which could be recalled when the brain is off-task, so that high-level 'concept neurons' that have learned the task can connect to these untrained neurons in an off-task self-organization manner for learning transfer. Apparently the activations of untrained neurons due to unconsciousness stimulation, or top-down attention without actual stimulation, can also be recalled off-task in the context of this computational account."

However, we found no evidence for learning transfer. A more recent psychophysical study also replicated the null-transfer results (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mastropasqua et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, an earlier monkey-recording study (<a href=\"#bib17\">Schoups et al., 2001</a>) reported that orientation discrimination learning does not transfer to a different location where a same grating stimulus is simultaneously presented. These null-transfer effects may be caused by attentional competition, in that concentrated attention to the training location would suppress the high-contrast stimuli at a different location (<a href=\"#bib30\">Watanabe et al., 2001</a>). The attentional suppression effect is avoided in double training when the primary training and the secondary training that stimulates the untrained location are performed in alternating blocks of trials (<a href=\"#bib31\">Xiao et al., 2008</a>), or when the stimulation of the untrained locations is below awareness as in our current study. In the latter case the bottom-up stimulation of transfer location through one eye may create an input contrast in the eye-of-origin feature, and this contrast, although invisible perceptually, has been shown to be very salient because it more strongly activates V1 neurons than the surrounding stimuli (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zhaoping, 2008</a>)."

Watanabe and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib30\">Watanabe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Seitz and Watanabe, 2003</a>) reported that training improves discrimination of a nearby feature that is task irrelevant and sub-threshold (to avoid attentional suppression), and that the learning occurs only when the irrelevant feature is temporally paired with rewards with the trained task. They explained this task irrelevant perceptual learning (TIPL) as a result of interactions between spatially diffusive rewards and bottom-up exposure of the task irrelevant feature (<a href=\"#bib19\">Seitz and Watanabe, 2005</a>). Note that our double-training enabled learning transfer are distinct from TIPL in two important ways. First, unlike TIPL, the training and exposure do not require temporal pairing and spatial proximity of two stimuli. Indeed the training phase can precede the exposure phase with a time gap of up to 8 weeks (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), and the training and exposure locations can be at diagonal quadrants of the visual field separated by 10 degrees (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), while double training is still effective. In the current study, the training and sub-threshold exposure are performed in separate blocks of trials, rather than paired, in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, and are spatially separated by 10 degrees in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Second, our recent evidence suggests that double-training enabled learning transfer is still task specific (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cong et al., 2016</a>). We found that orientation discrimination learning cannot transfer to a contrast discrimination task using the same Gabor stimulus, even after the observers receive additional exposure of the transfer task through easy trials in separate blocks of trials. The same is true at a reverse direction when the observers learn contrast discrimination and receive exposure of orientation discrimination, the transfer task, through easy trials."

Such C1 changes are not evident with an untrained shape-discrimination task (Zhang et al., 2015) or with passive viewing (Bao et al., 2010). These results further indicate that the functional connections are task specific, consistent with the observations that perceptual learning is task specific (Shiu and Pashler, 1992; Ahissar and Hochstein, 1993; Cong et al., 2016). The task-specific functional connections associated with learning and its transfer are also supported by fMRI evidence, in that the generalized orientation discrimination learning is accompanied with task-specific enhancement of orientation-selective responses in the early visual areas including V1, V2 and V3 (Byers and Serences, 2014). These results together may also explain fMRI results that orientation specificity is accompanied with refined representation of the trained orientation in early visual areas (Jehee et al., 2012). This is because top-down modulation by high-level orientation learning may not reach the early cortical representations of untrained orientations as a result of absent functional connections.\u201d"

However, 2400 trials in 3 days is a lot of trials for perceptual learning to occur in many tasks. So we double-checked their non-learning baseline results with nearly identical procedures. All observers we trained showed consistent and significant orientation learning, as much as when exogenous attention was introduced. We showed the data to Carrasco recently when she was visiting us in Beijing. It would be better that we solve the discrepancies with Carrasco in a different occasion."
