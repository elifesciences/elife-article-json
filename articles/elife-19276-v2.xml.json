To study the mechanisms of RNA packaging into exosomes, we devised a purification scheme based on the membrane marker CD63 to isolate a single exosome species secreted from HEK293T cells. Using immunoisolated CD63-containing exosomes we identified a set of miRNAs that are highly enriched with respect to their cellular levels. To explore the biochemical requirements for exosome biogenesis and RNA packaging, we devised a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the species-selective enclosure of miR-223 in isolated membranes supplemented with cytosol. We found that the RNA-binding protein Y-box protein I (YBX1) binds to and is required for the sorting of miR-223 in the cell-free reaction. Furthermore, YBX1 serves an important role in the secretion of miRNAs in exosomes by HEK293T cells."

Using immunoisolated CD63-containing exosomes we identified a set of miRNAs that are highly enriched with respect to their cellular levels. To explore the biochemical requirements for exosome biogenesis and RNA packaging, we devised a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the species-selective enclosure of miR-223 in isolated membranes supplemented with cytosol. We found that the RNA-binding protein Y-box protein I (YBX1) binds to and is required for the sorting of miR-223 in the cell-free reaction. Furthermore, YBX1 serves an important role in the secretion of miRNAs in exosomes by HEK293T cells."

One exosome-specific microRNA, called miR-223, was further studied via a test-tube based system that uses extracts from cells rather than cells themselves. These experiments confirmed that miR-223 is selectively packed into exosomes that formed in the test tube. Using this system, Shurtleff et al. then isolated a protein called Y-box Protein I (or YBX1 for short) that binds to RNA molecules and found that it was required for this selective packaging."

Indeed, our understanding of unconventional secretory mechanisms is limited to a few examples of leader-less soluble and transmembrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Malhotra, 2013</a>). Unconventionally secreted molecules may be externalized in a soluble form by translocation across various membranes. This may include direct translocation across the plasma membrane, or across an organelle membrane followed by fusion of the organelle with the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang and Schekman, 2013</a>). Alternatively, proteins and RNAs can be secreted within vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane, as in the budding of enveloped viruses such as HIV, or within vesicles internalized into a multivesicular body (MVB) that fuses with the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib11\">Colombo et al., 2014</a>)."

It is often assumed that vesicles fitting this description are derived from the multivesicular body, but some evidence suggests that physically and biochemically indistinguishable vesicles bud directly from the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib7\">Booth et al., 2006</a>). Numerous studies have reported the presence of RNAs, especially miRNAs, from fractions containing exosomes, though many of these studies have relied on isolation techniques (e.g. high speed sedimentation) that do not resolve vesicles from other cellular debris or RNPs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bobrie et al., 2012</a>). Thus, it is difficult to know in which form RNAs are secreted and even more challenging to determine which miRNAs may be specifically secreted as exosome cargo. The use of many different cell lines, bodily fluids and isolation methods to identify which miRNAs are specifically packaged into exosomes further complicates the establishment of widely accepted exosomal miRNA cargo."

We define exosomes as ~30\u2013100 nm vesicles with a density of 1.08\u20131.18 g/ml and containing the tetraspanin protein CD63. Based on these criteria, purified exosomes were recovered using a three-stage purification procedure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). First, large contaminating cellular debris was removed during low and medium speed centrifugation and exosomes were concentrated by high-speed sedimentation from conditioned medium. Next, to eliminate non-vesicle contaminants, the high-speed pellet fraction was suspended in 60% sucrose buffer and overlaid with layers of lower concentrations of sucrose buffer followed by centrifugation to float vesicles to an interface between 20 and 40% sucrose. Analysis of this partially purified material by electron microscopy showed vesicles of the expected size and morphology with fewer profiles of larger (&gt;200 nm) membranes and reduced appearance of protein aggregates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a> compared to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d,e</a>).

Tetraspanin proteins share a common topology in which the amino- and carboxyl-termini face the cytoplasm resulting in a predicted orientation inside the lumen of an exosomal vesicle. Although an intact C-terminal sequence is reported to be required for the proper localization of CD63 to the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rous et al., 2002</a>), we found that our overexpressed CD63-luciferase fusion was localized to a variety of cell surface and intracellular membranes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using isolated exosome fractions, we confirmed that the CD63-luciferase fusion maintained the expected topology. Luciferase activity was stimulated by the addition of detergent to disrupt the membrane and allow access to the membrane impermeable substrates luciferin and ATP, and to trypsin, which inactivated luciferase activity in the presence but not in the absence of detergent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). The CD63-luciferase cell line was then used to monitor exosome purification. CD63-luciferase specific activity increased at each step of the purification, yielding a 5-fold purification of exosomes from the starting 100,000\u00a0\u00d7g pellet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a>). Additionally, following immunoisolation, most of the RNA was found in the CD63 positive bound (B) fraction, showing that RNA is associated with purified exosomes from HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). These results established that the RNA is associated with CD63-containing exosomes, but not necessarily enclosed within exosomes."

To identify the specific miRNAs that are enriched in CD63-positive exosomes from 293T cells, we performed Illumina-based small RNA sequencing on libraries prepared from purified exosomes and from cells. We obtained a total of 123,679 miRNA reads (4.4% of total mapped reads \u2013 <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) in the exosome library representing 502 distinct miRNAs and 880,093 reads (7.3% of total mapped reads \u2013 <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) representing 637 miRNAs in the cell library (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). To determine if a particular miRNA species was over-represented in exosomes, we analyzed the datasets for reads mapping to miRNA precursors and the targeting or passenger strand of mature miRNAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Exosomes were slightly enriched in reads mapping to precursor and passenger strand transcripts, however, the vast majority of miRNAs (91% from cells and 88% from exosomes) mapped to the mature targeting strand. The relative abundance of each miRNA was estimated by normalizing to the total number of miRNA-mapped reads (i.e. the number of reads mapped to a miRNA locus divided by the total number of miRNA mapped reads for each dataset \u2013 RPM). Of these, 134 and 269 miRNAs were uniquely found in the exosome and cell datasets respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Most of the miRNAs uniquely found in exosomes were of very low abundance, with only a few counts for each miRNA. A notable exception was miR-223-3p, which was in the 72nd percentile for normalized reads in exosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,d</a> \u2013 red). The relatively high abundance of miR-223 in exosomes and its low level in the cellular library indicated that miR-223 was very efficiently packaged and secreted via exosomes."

Our results showed a selective enrichment of both miR-223 and miR-144 at each stage of the purification (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e and f</a>). Thus, these miRNAs are associated with CD63 exosomes. To determine if these exosome associated RNAs are contained within exosomes and not simply bound to the surface, we performed an RNase protection experiment. Both miRNAs were protected from RNase I digestion, unless detergent was added to disrupt the membrane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>).

Previous studies have reported the use of cell-free assays to monitor multivesicular body biogenesis and sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into intraluminal vesicles (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tran et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Falgui\u00e8res et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</a>). To specifically monitor exosome biogenesis, we measured the protection over time of luciferase fused to CD63. The fusion protein displayed luciferase on the cytoplasmic face of a membrane such that its incorporation into a vesicle by budding into the interior of an endosome (or into a vesicle that buds from the cell surface) would render the enzyme sequestered and inaccessible to exogenous luciferin and ATP, the substrates of catalysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). During the incubation, substrate would have access to luciferase exposed on the cytoplasmic face of a membrane or to enzyme about to be internalized into a bud, but not to luciferase that had already become sequestered within vesicles in cells prior to rupture (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). In order to focus only on luciferase that became sequestered during the cell-free reaction, aliquots taken after a 20 min incubation of membranes, cytosol and substrate at 30\u00b0C were sedimented, resuspended in buffer and sedimented again to remove excess substrate, and CD63-luciferase remaining exposed on the surface of membranes was inactivated by treatment with trypsin (0.5\u00a0mg/ml) for 1h at 4\u00b0C. Remaining luciferase activity was then monitored in a luminometer. Since the substrates D-luciferin salt and ATP are membrane impermeable, the residual luminescence measured in trypsin-treated samples should derive from luciferase that became segregated along with substrate during the cell-free incubation. Relative protection was quantified as the ratio of relative light units (RLU) for reactions incubated without cytosol, at 4\u00b0C and in the presence of detergent (Triton X-100) divided by the RLU for a complete reaction incubated at 30\u00b0C. We observed that the formation of sequestered luciferase required cytosol and incubation at 30\u00b0C and was disrupted in incubations containing detergent (Triton X-100) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). These results suggest that our conditions reconstitute the formation of exosomes in a cell-free reaction."

Given the low relative abundance of miR-223 in HEK293T cells, we set the exogenous concentration in the incubation to be ca. 1000 fold in excess to ensure that the chemically synthetic material predominated in any packaged signal. After a 20 min incubation at 30\u00b0C, aliquots were treated with RNase I to digest any unpackaged miRNA. RNA was then purified, reverse transcribed using a miRNA specific primer and the amount of miRNA that became protected during the incubation was measured by quantitative PCR. Packaged RNA was quantified as the percentage of miR-223 RNA molecules protected from RNase during the course of incubation. Packaging of miR-223 required membranes, cytosol and incubation at physiologic temperature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). As expected for the segregation of miR-223 into a membrane bound compartment, addition of TX-100 during the RNase incubation abrogated protection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Furthermore, at a minimal concentration of cytosol (0.5 mg/ml), protection was stimulated two-fold over reactions performed in the in the absence of ATP, or in the presence of apyrase or a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>)."

Exosomal miR-223 was more efficiently packaged into vesicles (9%) than cellular miR-190 (1.5%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). Furthermore, the rate of miR-223 packaging mirrored the rate at which luciferase became sequestered in the biogenesis reaction whereas the rate of miR-190 protection in a 30\u00b0C incubation reflected the low rate of formation of sequestered luciferase in an incubation held on ice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>).

YBX1 also co-localizes with cytoplasmic P-bodies containing members of the RISC complex, including GW182 which can be found in exosomes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Goodier et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gallois-Montbrun et al., 2007</a>).

Furthermore, YBX1 has been detected by mass spectrometry in isolated exosomes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ung et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buschow et al., 2010</a>).

The CD63 positive (exosome) fraction contained most of the RNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>).

We first performed immunoblot on 100,000\u00a0\u00d7g pellet fractions (which should contain vesicle associated and non-vesicle associated Ago2) and vesicle fractions purified on a buoyant density gradient (which should eliminate non-vesicle Ago2) to determine if we could detect Ago2 in fractions that contain exosomes. As expected, after flotation the exosome marker proteins were enriched compared to the pellet fraction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). In contrast, Ago2 was not detected in the density gradient purified vesicle fraction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). The apparent lack of Ago2 in vesicles could be due to its absence in vesicles or a relatively low chemical abundance relative to other molecules. Regardless, our results show that in HEK293T cells the large majority of extracellular Ago2 exists as a non-vesicle associated species. These results support previously published evidence that Ago is not associated with density gradient purified exosomes isolated from breast cancer (MCF7) cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Van Deun et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "To further investigate the role of Ago2 in sorting miR-223 into exosomes, we employed the cell-free packaging assay. The inability to detect Ago2 in our mass spectrometry results from in vitro packaged miR-223 could be due to technical limitations of our reaction. We considered two potential technical explanations. First, we used the single stranded guide RNA in our reaction rather than a duplex RNA molecule. Although Ago2 associates with guide RNA in a reaction containing purified components (<a href=\"#bib40\">MacRae et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gagnon et al., 2014</a>), single-stranded miRNA may be rapidly degraded in a crude extract (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gagnon et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it was possible that the duplex molecule might represent a more relevant packaging substrate. Second, 3' biotinylated RNA was used as the substrate for the packaging reaction. A recent report suggested that, in some cases, 3' biotinylated RNA could prevent the proper loading of the miRNA into complex with Ago2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo and Steitz, 2014</a>). To address these concerns we synthesized miR-223 passenger strand and guide strands biotinylated at the 3' end or internally at position 13 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). The internal position was chosen because in crystal structures of miRNA-protein complexes, middle positions of guide RNAs do not appear to be in direct contact with Ago2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo and Steitz, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Elkayam et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schirle and MacRae, 2012</a>). We then annealed the guide and passenger strands to form the miR-223 duplexes. To determine if the guide or passenger strands can be efficiently loaded into Ago2 in our in vitro reaction conditions, we first mixed the biotinylated substrates with cytosol alone and evaluated complexes that associated with streptavidin beads. In our reaction conditions, both the single stranded guide and duplex oligonucleotides bound apparently equally to Ago2 in cytosol alone and there was no discernible difference in the association comparing 3' or internally biotinylated oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). We then tested the various substrates in our complete packaging reaction including membranes, cytosol and an ATP regenerating system. Duplex substrates were packaged ~2-fold more efficiently than the single stranded guide RNA, irrespective of the position of the biotin group (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). Interestingly, in reactions programmed with duplex RNA substrate, only the guide RNA and not the passenger RNA was sorted into a protected compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). In similar incubations, the YBX1 protein was ~2X more efficiently packaged in reactions programmed with duplex RNA but Ago2 was not detected associated with miR-223 in any of the complete reactions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e,f</a>). This suggests that whereas the RNA substrates are capable of being bound by Ago2 in the cytosol, in the complete reaction containing membranes and ATP, YBX1 is the predominant binding factor. These results explain why Ago2 was not detected in the mass spectrometry data and are consistent with our failure to detect Ago2 in buoyant density-fractionated extracellular vesicles. Similarly, <a href=\"#bib63\">Van Deun et al. (2014)</a> found no evidence of Ago2 in density gradient-isolated exosomes from MCF7 cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Van Deun et al., 2014</a>)."

We measured the amount of miR-144 and miR-223 secreted into the medium and retained in cells by qRT-PCR. \u0394YBX1 cells showed a significant decrease in secretion of both miRNAs, though more notably of miR-144, during a 24 hr incubation in fresh medium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>). When the YBX1 paralog YBX2 was knocked down in \u0394YBX1 cells, miR-223 secretion was diminished to the baseline level, suggesting partial functional redundancy for YBX paralogs in the secretion of miR-223 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The defect in miR-223 secretion was less substantial in cells compared to the cell-free reaction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>), possibly reflecting a rate effect that distinguishes the magnitude of the defect in a 20 min cell-free incubation at 30\u00b0C vs. a 24\u00a0hr incubation of cells at 37\u00b0C. Nonetheless, the secretion defect was accompanied by an ~three\u2013four fold accumulation of each miRNA in cells. No accumulation was observed for another miRNA (miR-190), which is not released in exosomes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>). To determine if Ago2 binds miR-223 that accumulates in \u0394YBX1 cells, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation with Ago2 or isotype matched control IgG in lysates of WT and \u0394YBX1 cells and quantified the amount of associated miR-223 by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). No miR-223 above background co-immunoprecipitated with Ago2 in WT cells. In contrast, miR-223 accumulated in \u0394YBX1 cells was found to be associated with Ago2. These results suggest that miR-223 is properly processed in HEK293T cells, likely loaded into Ago2 and then efficiently dissociated and bound by YBX1. Taken together, our results show that YBX1 controls the secretion of select exosomal miRNAs in vitro\u00a0and in vivo."

This motif is recognized by hRNPA2B1, a T-cell exosome RNA-binding protein, which requires sumoylation for efficient secretion via exosomes.

Furthermore, the mature targeting strand of miR-223 packaged into exosomes contains no guanine nucleotides and hRNPA2B1 was not detected in our mass spectrometry results for proteins bound to miR-223-biotin isolated from vesicles formed in our cell-free reaction. The human genome encodes more than 1000 experimentally determined and predicted RNA-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cook et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gerstberger et al., 2014</a>). We therefore propose that different cell types may use RNA binding proteins with distinct binding preferences to secrete miRNAs, and perhaps other RNA classes, in exosomes. In addition, some cell types may deploy multiple RNA-binding proteins to sort RNAs into exosomes, in which case motif discovery would be challenging, even in highly purified vesicles, due to diverse motif preferences from distinct proteins."

YBX1 is found within mammalian P-bodies (GW bodies) containing untranslated RNAs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kedersha and Anderson, 2007</a>) and in the nucleus where it plays a role in RNA splice site selection by binding short sequence motifs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). YBX1 binds RNA via an internal cold shock domain and an inherently disordered, highly charged C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lyabin et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, another cold shock domain containing protein, Lin28, binds pre-miRNAs of the Let7 family via hairpin-loop structures (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nam et al., 2011</a>). YBX1 also binds hairpin-loops in a murine retrovirus, leading to stabilization of the viral RNA genome and increased particle production (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bann et al., 2014</a>). YBX1 binding of viral RNA also increases production of other retroviruses, including HIV (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 2012</a>).

This in spite of our observation that cell-free reaction reconstitutes sorting of the mature strand from a duplex RNA. Some recent evidence suggests that Ago2 may be sorted along with miRNAs into exosomes as a result of aberrant KRAS signaling. Analysis of extracellular RNA in isogenic cell lines differing only in KRAS status revealed that secretion of a sub-population of miRNAs is decreased in colorectal cancer cells harboring an activating KRAS mutation whereas other miRNAs are secreted at equivalent levels irrespective of KRAS status (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cha et al., 2015</a>). Subsequent experiments showed that KRAS mutation results in phosphorylation of Ago2 causing its re-localization from multivesicular bodies to P-bodies leading to decreased secretion of select miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib43\">McKenzie et al., 2016</a>). Notably, the miRNA (miR-223-3p) shown here to be dependent on YBX1 is among the cohort of miRNAs that were not affected by KRAS status. These results combined with ours suggest two possible routes for miRNA egress via exosomes, an Ago2-associated pathway and a RNA-binding protein-dependent pathway that we term chaperone-mediated sorting. The chaperone-mediated pathway would include the previously identified hnRNPA2B1 in T-cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib64\">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</a>) and YBX1 in HEK293T cells. Interestingly, one other highly enriched miRNA (miR-328-5p) has been previously shown to conditionally associate with either Ago2 or with the RNA-binding protein hnRNPE2\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Eiring et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that these two pathways may not be mutually exclusive. A notable feature of the chaperone-mediated pathway is that the RNA content of exosomes may be manipulated by altering the expression of individual RNA binding proteins involved in RNA export with distinct nucleic acid binding specificities. Further characterization of the chaperone-mediated pathway may then allow for targeted sorting of engineered RNA species into exosomes."

Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs can be transferred to neighboring cells in experimental settings (<a href=\"#bib54\">Skog et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Valadi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kosaka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cha et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pegtel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mittelbrunn, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rana et al., 2013</a>). However, the transfer of miRNAs in biologically significant quantities for function in a physiological context is far from proven. Indeed, a recent study reported a stoichiometry of less than one specific miRNA per exosome, with the caveat that this study characterized crude, high-speed pellet fractions from conditioned medium (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chevillet et al., 2014</a>). Functional miR-223 transferred between macrophages and miR-223-containing exosomes can induce macrophage differentiation, however, it has yet to be shown that miR-223 transfer plays a direct role in the differentiation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ismail et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, direct and convincing evidence for a physiological role of miRNAs secreted via exosomes has so far proven elusive. Alternatively, exosomes may be a convenient carrier to purge unnecessary or inhibitory RNAs from cells. A recent report provided evidence for both alternative views with the demonstration that target transcript levels for miRNAs in the cell modulate the abundance of miRNAs in macrophage exosomes, and this in turn dictates which miRNAs are transferred to repress transcripts in recipient cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Squadrito et al., 2014</a>). Because YBX1 and the RISC machinery have both been shown to localize to P-bodies and P-bodies are closely juxtaposed to multivesicular bodies, all of the necessary machinery is poised to efficiently secrete miRNAs in exosomes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gibbings et al., 2009</a>). YBX1 may complex with miRNAs whose mRNA targets are not expressed, and sort them into the intralumenal vesicles of a multivesicular body for export by unconventional secretion. Physiological studies of the function miRNAs that are secreted via the Ago2-associated vs. chaperone-mediated pathways may explain contradictory results for different miRNAs and provide general rules for extracellular miRNA function."

A CRISPR guide RNA targeting the first exon of the YBX1 open reading frame was selected using the CRISPR design tool (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hsu et al., 2013</a>). The YBX1 guide RNA was introduced into pX330-Venus by oligonucleotide cloning as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cong et al., 2013</a>). HEK293T cells were transfected for 48 hr at low passage number, trypsinized and sorted for single, venus positive cells in a 96 well plate using a BD Influx cell sorter. Wells containing single clones (16 clones) were allowed to expand and were screened by semi-nested PCR using primers targeting the genomic region flanking the guide RNA site. Primers for the first round of PCR (10 cycles) were: YBX1-F1 (GGTTGTAGGTCGACTGAATTA) and YBX1-R1 (ACCGATGACCTTCTTGTCC). The PCR primers from the first round were removed using DNA clean and concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer's instructions and the second round of PCR (25 cycles) was performed with primers: YBX1-F2 (CGGCCTAGTTACCATCACA) and YBX1-R1 (ACCGATGACCTTCTTGTCC). PCR products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel to identify products smaller than the wild type PCR product, indicating a deletion. Clones (8) showing homozygous or heterozygous mutations were then screened by immunoblot to identify those that did not express YBX1. A clone containing a single homozygous mutation at the target site and not expressing YBX1 by immunoblot was recovered and designated \u0394YBX1."

It is clear that miR 223 goes through normal maturation since approximately 90% of miR 223 molecules in exosomes are the mature targeting strand. Accordingly it is unclear if the cell free assays are relevant since naked miR 223 is the substrate in these reactions. Much more appropriate would be reactions in which miR 223 was built up in cells (wherein exosome synthesis was blocked by inhibitor). Mixing of extracts from such cells with exosome competent extracts would be a good experiment. If such an experiment were not possible, building up of 223 in YBOX1 YBOX2 deficient cells could also be tried."

However, the reads number was very low (58,848 total miRNA reads for the exosome and 511,555 total miRNAs for the cells). With the HiSeq platform, a single lane should yield at least 200M reads. Because the authors didn't provide the mapping information including how many total reads were generated, how many reads were mapped to miRNAs vs other RNAs, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of small RNA sequencing experiments. The very low reads number could be simply due to low coverage of the sequencing but could also be due to technical issues. Because the preferential loading of miR-223/144, which are lowly expressed by the cells but highly represented in the exosome, onto the exosome is a key finding of this study, it is important for the authors to provide more information for both exosome miRNA profiles and cellular miRNA profiles.

However, they used a single-stranded miR-223 for both experiments (based on the description in the method section). But I am not sure if this is the right approach. During miRNA biogenesis, one strand of the double-stranded miRNA duplex (post Dicer cleavage) is incorporated into an Ago protein. The incorporation of a single-stranded miRNA into Ago protein, which triggers a conformational change of the Ago protein according to multiple structural studies, is clearly important for the stability of both miRNA and Ago. In Dicer cKO when all miRNAs are abolished, Ago protein levels are strongly depleted and in Ago1/2 double KO most miRNAs are depleted. Therefore, it is unclear how much single-stranded, free miRNAs are available in the cytosol for sorting into the exosome. In addition, in the miR-223 associated proteome, the authors didn't identify Ago proteins. This result suggests that single-stranded miRNA can't be incorporated into Ago. The authors may consider to use miR-223 duplex for both experiments and determine how much miR-223 is sorted into the exosome and analyze whether YBX1 is still the main protein associated with the exosome miRNA."

This is demonstrated through a combination of cell culture experiments and reconstitution assays. A highlight of the article is that several experimental approaches are pioneered. The authors developed a method to purify exosomes from cell culture media using density gradients coupled to immunoisolation via CD63 antigen. Small RNA content in the isolates is then assessed through high-throughput sequencing, revealing a set of enriched miRNAs. The two most abundantly recovered miRNA species (miR-223 and miR-144) are validated for exosome loading through qPCR and biochemical assays. The sorting of miR-223 into exosomes is then reproduced in a cell-free assay, which is subsequently used as a system for identifying factors involved in the process-with the most highly recovered factor being YBX1. Finally, the authors demonstrate the dependency of miR-223 and miR-144 sorting on YBX1 using mutant cells."

It is not clear what the authors mean by precursor only. Does this mean loop (products of dicer cleavage) or reads that map haphazardly to precursor hairpins? This is an important distinction. miRNA loops can become loaded and act as regulators in RISC. If loop species are what is meant by \"precursor only\" then shuttling of miRNAs may happen after loading into Argonautes. On the other hand if the recovered precursor species are derived from fragmented precursor then sorting of miRNAs may happen at the level of dicer/dicer loading complex before RISC formation. This has a significant implication: If miRNAs are diverted before Ago loading, exosome sorting may have an antagonistic role on miRNA function."

They showed that whereas miR-223 can be correctly programmed with Ago2, Ago2 is not detectable in the exosome. Interestingly, duplex miR-223 has higher efficiency of incorporating into the exosome than the single-stranded counterpart. In addition, the \"correct\" guide-strand is incorporated into the exosome, implying the same strand sorting mechanism also works for the exosome. Together with the results that Ybx1 is required for incorporating miR-223 into the exosome, these data provide strong evidence that Ybx1 but not Ago2 is associated with miRNAs in the exosome. Overall, this revised manuscript is greatly improved and should be suitable for <i>eLife</i>."

To distinguish between these possibilities one additional experiment would be informative. In YBOX1 knockout cells miRs 223 and 144 accumulate inside of cells. Are these miRNAs associated with Ago? A simple IP and qPCR would answer this question. Subsequent work beyond the scope of this manuscript could then sort out the biochemistry of how YBOX1 could dissociate a tightly bound miRNA from Ago.

However, they used a single-stranded miR-223 for both experiments (based on the description in the method section). But I am not sure if this is the right approach. During miRNA biogenesis, one strand of the double-stranded miRNA duplex (post Dicer cleavage) is incorporated into an Ago protein. The incorporation of a single-stranded miRNA into Ago protein, which triggers a conformational change of the Ago protein according to multiple structural studies, is clearly important for the stability of both miRNA and Ago. In Dicer cKO when all miRNAs are abolished, Ago protein levels are strongly depleted and in Ago1/2 double KO most miRNAs are depleted. Therefore, it is unclear how much single-stranded, free miRNAs are available in the cytosol for sorting into the exosome. In addition, in the miR-223 associated proteome, the authors didn't identify Ago proteins. This result suggests that single-stranded miRNA can't be incorporated into Ago.

On the other hand if the recovered precursor species are derived from fragmented precursor then sorting of miRNAs may happen at the level of dicer/dicer loading complex before RISC formation.

This may also help to explain why double stranded RNAs are more effectively bound by YBX1. At a minimum read alignments should be done for miR-233 and miR-144 to demonstrate the exosome sorted RNAs are appropriately processed.</i> "

Alternatively, biogenesis of miR-223 may bypass Ago involvement altogether which would be a remarkable result. To distinguish between these possibilities one additional experiment would be informative. In YBOX1 knockout cells miRs 223 and 144 accumulate inside of cells. Are these miRNAs associated with Ago? A simple IP and qPCR would answer this question. Subsequent work beyond the scope of this manuscript could then sort out the biochemistry of how YBOX1 could dissociate a tightly bound miRNA from Ago. Providing this experiment is done the paper is viewed to be now acceptable for publication in eLife.</i> "

We performed the requested experiment by IPing Ago in WT and \u2206YBX1 cells and detected bound miR-223 by qPCR. We found no detectable miR-223 above background associated with Ago2 in WT cells, however, in KO cells, we detected miR-223 in complex with Ago2. These results support the notion that miR-223 undergoes normal biogenesis and may be loaded into Ago2 and then, in HEK293T wild type cells, is efficiently displaced or simply replaced by YBX1. Future work will determine if YBX1 is directly involved in the dissociation of miR-223 from Ago2 or simply binds miR-223 that is released from Ago2 via another mechanism."
