However, selecting improved variants from gene libraries in living cells requires plasmid expression systems that suffer from variable copy number effects, or the use of complex marker-dependent chromosomal integration strategies. We developed quantitative gene assembly and DNA library insertion into the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> genome by optimizing an efficient single-step and marker-free genome editing system using CRISPR-Cas9. With this Multiplex CRISPR (CRISPRm) system, we selected an improved cellobiose utilization pathway in diploid yeast in a single round of mutagenesis and selection, which increased cellobiose fermentation rates by over 10-fold. Mutations recovered in the best cellodextrin transporters reveal synergy between substrate binding and transporter dynamics, and demonstrate the power of CRISPRm to accelerate selection experiments and discoveries of the molecular determinants that enhance biomolecule function."

However, selecting improved variants from gene libraries in living cells requires plasmid expression systems that suffer from variable copy number effects, or the use of complex marker-dependent chromosomal integration strategies. We developed quantitative gene assembly and DNA library insertion into the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> genome by optimizing an efficient single-step and marker-free genome editing system using CRISPR-Cas9. With this Multiplex CRISPR (CRISPRm) system, we selected an improved cellobiose utilization pathway in diploid yeast in a single round of mutagenesis and selection, which increased cellobiose fermentation rates by over 10-fold. Mutations recovered in the best cellodextrin transporters reveal synergy between substrate binding and transporter dynamics, and demonstrate the power of CRISPRm to accelerate selection experiments and discoveries of the molecular determinants that enhance biomolecule function."

Scientists have learned how to use the principles that underlie evolution to similarly engineer proteins in the laboratory. This process, known as directed evolution, is a powerful tool for improving how proteins function. Directed evolution normally involves mutating the gene that encodes the protein of interest, selecting the genes that produce the most promising proteins for another round of mutation, and repeating the process until the desired protein function is achieved."

These are joined to circular pieces of DNA known as plasmids that can replicate themselves inside cells. However, the number of plasmids than can be taken up differs from cell to cell. This complicates experiments, and the ideal directed evolution experiment would have the same number of plasmids, or target genes, being delivered into each cell."

This can make direct changes to a DNA strand such as inserting or deleting specific sequences that code for proteins. Ryan et al. used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create multiple DNA breaks simultaneously across the genome of yeast cells, and joined \u2018barcoded\u2019 DNA or DNA for intact genes to these breaks. This avoids the need to use plasmids to introduce foreign DNA into cells. Ryan et al. have named this method the Multiplex CRISPR (or CRISPRm) system."

This protein transports the sugar cellobiose into yeast cells, where it can be converted into alcohol by fermentation. This is important for making biofuel from plants. After just one round of directed evolution using CRISPRm, Ryan et al. successfully isolated a form of the CDT-1 protein that increased the rate of fermentation over 10-fold; hence this CDT-1 variant could be used to increase biofuel production."

However, present directed evolution systems require the use of extrachromosomal gene libraries encoded in bacteriophage or plasmids, which suffer from high levels of copy number variation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yokobayashi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Turner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Esvelt et al., 2011</a>). For example, in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, common yeast centromere containing (CEN) plasmids vary widely in copy number per cell resulting in highly variable expression levels from cell to cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Ideally, the selective pressure applied to evolve improved or new biomolecule function should be limited to the DNA sequence level and not to gene copy number in a given cell (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). To overcome copy number variation in yeast, the standard genetic tool of integrating linear DNA into the genome by homologous recombination is too inefficient to insert DNA libraries without multiple steps that rely on dominant selectable markers for chromosomal integrations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wingler and Cornish, 2011</a>) or specialized strain backgrounds (<a href=\"#bib3\">DiCarlo et al., 2013a</a>)."

Genome editing CRISPR-Cas systems require a Cas9 endonuclease that is targeted to specific DNA sequences by a non-coding single guide RNA (sgRNA) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jinek, et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jinek et al., 2014</a>). The Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex precisely generates double-strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic genomes at sites specified by a 20-nucleotide guide sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the sgRNA that base pairs with the protospacer DNA sequence preceding a genomic protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sternberg et al., 2014</a>).

We used an intermediate strength promoter, <i>P</i><sub><i>RNR2</i></sub>, to express Cas9 for genome targeting experiments, because Cas9 (Cas9-NLS-His8x) expression from the <i>P</i><sub><i>RNR</i>2</sub> promoter resulted in yeast strains with near wild type fitness whereas Cas9 expressed using strong yeast promoters such as <i>P</i><sub><i>TDH3</i></sub> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2013</a>) reduced yeast fitness relative to wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Second, we designed a new sgRNA architecture in order to improve its expression and function. Cellular levels of sgRNAs correlate with the efficiency of Cas9-mediated genome targeting in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hsu et al., 2013</a>). Controlled expression of nuclear-localized RNAs and the correlation between sgRNA levels and Cas9-editing in yeast has not been explored. To better control cellular levels of correctly folded sgRNA, we developed a modular design by fusing the sgRNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mali et al., 2013a</a>) to the 3\u2032 end of the self-cleaving hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ke et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Webb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Ribozyme removal of the tRNA would then separate transcription initiation from within the tRNA sequence (<a href=\"#bib26\">Marck et al., 2006</a>) and tRNA nuclear export (<a href=\"#bib21\">K\u00f6hler and Hurt, 2007</a>) from the process of forming functional sgRNA complexes with Cas9."

We targeted a cellodextrin utilization pathway from the cellulolytic fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, comprised of the cellodextrin transporter (<i>cdt-1</i>) and an intracellular \u03b2-glucosidase (<i>gh1-1</i>), to assemble in vivo in diploid <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In combination, these two genes result in yeast cells capable of consuming the disaccharide cellobiose, which could be used to improve biofuel production (<a href=\"#bib9\">Galazka et al., 2010</a>). To select for improved cellobiose utilizing strains we used error-prone PCR to amplify the <i>cdt-1</i> gene. We co-transformed the library of mutated <i>cdt-1</i> alleles, along with overlapping dsDNA fragments for the promoter and terminator, for assembly and integration into the <i>URA3</i> locus (<i>ura3</i>::<i>P</i><sub><i>PGK1</i></sub><i>-cdt-1-T</i><sub><i>ADH1</i></sub> library) of a diploid strain with a previously integrated \u03b2-glucosidase <i>gh1-1</i> gene (<i>lyp1</i>::<i>P</i><sub><i>TDH3</i></sub><i>-gh1-1-T</i><sub><i>CYC1</i></sub>) using CRISPRm. We then grew the transformants in medium containing cellobiose as the sole carbon source to select for functional <i>cdt-1</i> alleles and identified one strain with 2.6-fold (homozygous <i>cdt-1</i> N209S/I354N/S360P/T406S/W531L allele) and one strain with 1.7-fold (homozygous <i>cdt-1</i> Q45H/F262Y/F533Y allele) increased cellobiose utilization capacity over wild type <i>cdt-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The mutations were mapped in CDT-1 onto structures of the homologous major facilitator superfamily (MFS) hexose-like transporters XylE from <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sun et al., 2012</a>) and GlcP from <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Iancu et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Notably, one site maps to a site that likely interacts directly with the sugar substrate (N209S) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Whereas two mutations in the second allele (Q45H, F533Y) map to non-conserved regions of the transporters, one (F262Y) maps to a site immediately adjacent to the nearly universally-conserved PESPR motif in hexose transporters that is involved in transporter dynamics (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sun et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, the mutation from phenylalanine to tyrosine results in an expanded motif (PESPRY) that is present in all of the major hexose transporters in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We then used CRISPRm to introduce the N209S mutation (nucleotide G626A) in the <i>cdt-1</i><sup><i>Q45H/F262Y/F533Y</i></sup> diploid yeast background. The quadruple mutant <i>cdt-1</i> allele resulted in synergistic cellobiose utilization with 3.9-fold increased growth over strains expressing wild-type <i>cdt-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We next tested the selected <i>cdt-1</i> alleles in anaerobic fermentations using cellobiose as the sole carbon source.

Although we used a relatively small library size in the present experiments, even in this small library we observed impressive gains in transporter function. We observed 2\u20133 mutations per kilobase in the selected transporter genes, resulting in 3\u20135 amino acid substitutions per transporter. We were then able to combine the mutations in a single transporter with superior fermentation performance. Library sizes introduced by CRISPRm should be scalable to the limits of transformation efficiency, to 10<sup>7</sup> or larger (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kawai et al., 2010</a>). CRISPRm should also enable multiple rounds of selection for directed evolution experiments. We envision that each cycle would involve error-prone PCR of the gene of interest, either from a starting sequence or an enriched and improved cell population, followed by CRISPRm-mediated integration of the amplified gene and selection. This cycle would compare favorably with that required for plasmid-based selections, yet would avoid the problem of plasmid copy number variation. CRISPRm should also be adaptable to screens that rely on sorting large populations of cells, that is by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We envision that CRISPRm could improve the discovery of human therapeutics by yeast display (<a href=\"#bib22\">Krugel et al., 1988</a>), and could be used to map the importance of protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</a>) via multiplexed library insertion."

The ease of discovering tRNAs in any genome and the universality of the sgRNA construct means that, with few modifications, CRISPRm can be used directly in non-model fungal hosts, such as pathogens or organisms used in the biotechnology industry. The genetics of many of these organisms have not been studied in any depth due to the technological limitations of available genetic manipulation techniques. For example, industrial <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains are more stress tolerant and produce much higher yields of desired biofuel or renewable chemical end products than laboratory strains (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kerr and Service, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Farrell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rubin, 2008</a>). However, linking genotypes of industrial yeasts to their phenotypes remains difficult. CRISPRm should serve as a rapid and high throughput means for connecting the genotypes of these organisms to their phenotypes, that is for generating marker-free barcoded alleles for large-scale pooled fitness studies of loss-of-function mutants in these organisms (<a href=\"#bib10\">Giaever et al., 2002</a>). In the future, CRISPRm may also be applicable to interrogating mammalian cells, if the levels of HDR are sufficiently high. Finally, the ability to use CRISPRm for multiplexed targeting paves the way for applying directed evolution to cellular pathways and genetic circuits for higher order synthetic biology applications in any host strain."

The RT-qPCR expression level data was quantified using the Comparative CT<sub>T</sub> (\u0394\u0394C<sub>T</sub>) method and relative abundance of the sgRNA was normalized to the mRNA transcript <i>UBC6</i>, which was used as the endogenous control (<a href=\"#bib34\">Teste et al., 2009</a>). The primer sequence used for the RT reaction was 5\u2032-AAAAGCACCGACTCGGT-3\u2032 and the additional q-PCR primer used was 5\u2032-GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG-3\u2032. The primers used for the <i>UBC6</i> endogenous control were (RT) 5\u2032-CATTTCATAAAAAGGCCAACC-3\u2032 and (qPCR) 5\u2032-CCTAATGATAGTTCTTCAATGG-3\u2032.

To achieve anaerobic conditions, the headspaces of the sealed flasks were purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min. These were then cultivated at 30\u00b0C and 220 rpm."

Although the library size here was small, we were able to isolate in one experiment a better transporter than the entire field working on this problem had been able to achieve in the past 3-4 years. CRISPRm can be scaled simply by transforming more linear repair DNA. We believe that significant improvement within a single round of selection by using a relatively small library is a powerful proof-of-principle result. We did not want to find too many mutations to follow up as we are in an ultra-competitive CRISPR field. Obviously, increasing the scale and iterations of CRISPRm would yield more evolved proteins until one reaches an optimum. We therefore think that there is only upside potential to the approach with further optimization."

CRISPRm should also enable multiple rounds of selection for directed evolution experiments. We envision that each cycle would involve error-prone PCR of the gene of interest, either from a starting sequence or an enriched and improved cell population, followed by CRISPRm-mediated integration of the amplified gene and selection.
