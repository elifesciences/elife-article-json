Here, we show interactions between <i>Streptomyces</i> and fungi trigger a previously unobserved mode of <i>Streptomyces</i> development. We term these <i>Streptomyces</i> cells \u2018explorers\u2019, for their ability to adopt a non-branching vegetative hyphal conformation and rapidly transverse solid surfaces. Fungi trigger <i>Streptomyces</i> exploratory growth in part by altering the composition of the growth medium, and <i>Streptomyces</i> explorer cells can communicate this exploratory behaviour to other physically separated streptomycetes using an airborne volatile organic compound (VOC). These results reveal that interkingdom interactions can trigger novel developmental behaviours in bacteria, here, causing <i>Streptomyces</i> to deviate from its classically-defined life cycle. Furthermore, this work provides evidence that VOCs can act as long-range communication signals capable of propagating microbial morphological switches."

Here, we show interactions between <i>Streptomyces</i> and fungi trigger a previously unobserved mode of <i>Streptomyces</i> development. We term these <i>Streptomyces</i> cells \u2018explorers\u2019, for their ability to adopt a non-branching vegetative hyphal conformation and rapidly transverse solid surfaces. Fungi trigger <i>Streptomyces</i> exploratory growth in part by altering the composition of the growth medium, and <i>Streptomyces</i> explorer cells can communicate this exploratory behaviour to other physically separated streptomycetes using an airborne volatile organic compound (VOC). These results reveal that interkingdom interactions can trigger novel developmental behaviours in bacteria, here, causing <i>Streptomyces</i> to deviate from its classically-defined life cycle. Furthermore, this work provides evidence that VOCs can act as long-range communication signals capable of propagating microbial morphological switches."

Scientists have been studying <i>Streptomyces</i> for over 70 years, and in all this time, there has been unanimous agreement on how these bacteria grow. That is to say that, unlike most other bacteria, <i>Streptomyces</i> grow like plants: they don\u2019t move, and instead produce spores that are dispersed like seeds. This stationary lifestyle makes these bacteria somewhat vulnerable to predators, and so it is thought that <i>Streptomyces</i> make antibiotics to help protect themselves from other bacteria that are able to move around in the soil."

Microbial behavior is now known to be modulated by neighbouring organisms, where interspecies interactions can have profound and diverse consequences, including modifying virulence of human pathogens (<a href=\"#bib40\">Peleg et al., 2010</a>), altering antibiotic resistance profiles of mixed-species biofilms (<a href=\"#bib37\">Oliveira et al., 2015</a>), enhancing bacterial growth (<a href=\"#bib46\">Romano and Kolter, 2005</a>), and increasing production of specialized metabolites by fungi and bacteria (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schroeckh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stubbendieck and Straight, 2016</a>).

First, a spore germinates to generate one or two germ tubes. These grow by apical tip extension and hyphal branching, ultimately forming a dense vegetative mycelial network that scavenges for nutrients. Second, in response to signals that may be linked to nutrient depletion, non-branching aerial hyphae extend into the air away from the vegetative cells. These aerial hyphae are coated in a hydrophobic sheath that enables escape from the aqueous environment of the vegetative mycelium (<a href=\"#bib9\">Claessen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Elliot et al., 2003</a>), and their emergence coincides with the onset of specialized metabolism within the vegetative cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kelemen and\u00a0Buttner, 1998</a>). Aerial development requires the activity of the \u2018<i>bld\u2019</i> gene products, where mutations in these genes result in colonies lacking the fuzzy/hydrophobic characteristics of wild type. The final developmental stage involves the differentiation of aerial hyphae into spores through a synchronous cell division and cell maturation event. This process is governed by the <i>whi</i> (for \u2018white\u2019) gene products, whose mutants fail to form mature, pigmented spores (<a href=\"#bib34\">McCormick and Fl\u00e4rdh, 2012</a>). In addition to being highly stress-resistant, spores also provide a means of dispersing <i>Streptomyces</i> to new environments, as all characterized <i>Streptomyces</i> cell types are non-motile."

Amino acid catabolism is also upregulated under alkaline growth conditions in other bacteria (<a href=\"#bib38\">Padan et al., 2005</a>).

It does possess homologues of <i>cutCD</i>; however, these genes were more highly expressed (~5 fold) in static <i>S. venezuelae</i> cultures (where no TMA was ever detected), than in spreading cultures. This suggested that these gene products may not direct TMA production in <i>S. venezuelae</i>. TMA can also be produced upon biogenic reduction of trimethylamine <i>N-</i>oxide (TMAO) by TMAO reductases. Bacteria known to carry out this reaction typically encode one or more TMAO reducase operons, including some combination of <i>torSTRCAD</i> (or <i>torSTRCADE</i>), <i>torYZ, dmsABC,</i> and <i>ynfEFGH</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dunn and Stabb, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">McCrindle et al., 2005</a>). <i>S. venezuelae</i> encodes homologs to some of these genes [specifically <i>torA</i> (top hit: <i>SVEN_1326</i>), <i>dmsAB</i> (top hit: <i>SVEN_3040-3039</i>), and <i>ynfEFG</i> (top hit: <i>SVEN_3040, 3040 and 3039</i>)].

In this system, spore dispersal is the sole means by which these bacteria can establish themselves in new environments. Here, we demonstrate a new developmental behavior for <i>Streptomyces</i> that provides them with an alternative means of colonizing new habitats. In response to fungal neighbours and nutrient (glucose) depletion, <i>Streptomyces</i> can escape the confines of their classically defined lifecycle, and initiate exploratory growth. Exploratory growth is remarkably relentless: explorer cells are not limited by inanimate barriers, and can grow over abiotic surfaces. Explorer cells alter their local environment through the release of the alkaline, volatile compound TMA. Emitting TMA not only promotes exploratory behaviour by the producing cells, it also functions as an airborne signal that elicits an exploratory response in physically distant streptomycetes, and provides further fitness benefits by inhibiting the growth of other bacteria."

We observed exploratory growth under low glucose conditions. In low-glucose areas of the soil, <i>Streptomyces</i> may initiate exploratory growth in an attempt to colonize environments with more readily available nutrients, whereas in high-glucose areas (<i>e.g.</i> near plant roots, or in association with fruit) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kliewer, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lugtenberg et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Romano and Kolter, 2005</a>), exploration may be less advantageous, initiating only after nearby fungi \u2013 or other microbes \u2013 consume the existing glucose supply. Microbial alteration of nutrient profiles is likely to be common in the soil environment (<i>e.g.</i> <a href=\"#bib46\">Romano and Kolter, 2005</a>), and we expect that the exploratory growth away from glucose-depleted areas would provide a benefit analogous to that of motility systems in other bacteria.

TMA can further induce exploration in physically distant streptomycetes. Importantly, this volatile signal is not limited to <i>S. venezuelae,</i> and can be both transmitted and sensed by other <i>Streptomyces</i> species. Consequently, it is possible for <i>Streptomyces</i> to respond to TMA produced by other bacteria and initiate exploratory growth under conditions where glucose concentrations are high and/or glucose-titrating organisms are absent. Developmental switching in response to VOC eavesdropping has not been previously reported, but exploiting community goods in this way is not unprecedented. For example, quorum signals and siderophores produced by one organism can be taken up or used by others (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lyons and Kolter, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Traxler et al., 2012</a>). The VOC repertoire of microorganisms appears to be vast (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chuankun et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Insam and Seewald, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sch\u00f6ller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schulz and Dickschat, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wilkins and Sch\u00f6ller, 2009</a>). Volatile compounds have historically been implicated in the \u2018avoidance responses\u2019 of fungi, promoting their growth away from inanimate objects (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gamow and B\u00f6ttger, 1982</a>). Increasingly, these compounds are now being found to have important roles in communication between physically separated microbes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Audrain et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bernier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Briard et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Letoffe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schmidt et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tyc et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wheatley, 2002</a>). A range of fungi use the volatile alkaline compound ammonia to induce morphological switches in other fungi, and to mediate inhibition of neighbouring colonies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Palkov\u00e1 et al., 1997</a>). Our observations suggest that VOCs may also be key bacterial morphological determinants, communicating developmental switches both within and between different microbial species."

TMA is a particularly potent example. Here, we show that exposure of other bacteria to TMA inhibits their growth, while previous work has revealed that TMA exposure increases bacterial sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Notably, <i>Streptomyces</i> synthesize an extraordinary range of antibiotics, including many aminoglycosides. Thus in the soil, <i>Streptomyces-</i>produced TMA may have direct antibacterial activity, in addition to sensitizing bacteria to the effect of <i>Streptomyces-</i>produced antibiotics. The ability of <i>Streptomyces</i> to modulate the growth of other soil-dwelling bacteria during exploratory growth would maximize their ability to colonize new environments, and exploit whatever nutrients are present."

When grown next to yeast, explorer cells emerge from a mass of sporulating cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This functional differentiation represents an effective bet-hedging strategy, whereby spreading explorer cells scavenge nutrients for the group, while the sporulating cells provide a highly resistant genetic repository, ensuring colony survival in the event of failed exploration. Explorer cells resemble vegetative hyphae, in that their surface is hydrophilic; however, unlike traditional vegetative hyphae, explorer cells do not appear to branch. We presume that explorer cells dispense with frequent branching as a trade-off for the ability to rapidly spread to new environments. Exploratory growth also occurs independently of the typical <i>bld-</i> and <i>whi</i>-developmental determinants, supporting the notion that this is a unique growth strategy. It is possible, however, given the slower exploration observed for <i>bldN</i> mutants (where <i>bldN</i> encodes a sigma factor), that BldN regulon members help to facilitate the exploration process."

Using elegant experimental designs the authors show that rapid glucose consumption by the fungus turns on a deep <i>Streptomyces</i> metabolic reprogramming, alkalinization of the surrounding environment and a switch to a new \"exploratory\" lifestyle. The pH drop seems to be driven by a volatile molecule, TMA, which raises the interesting possibility that <i>Streptomyces</i> colonies can exchange differentiation signals at a distance, and possibly use TMA from other bacteria to adapt their lifecycle."
