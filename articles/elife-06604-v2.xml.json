DOI: 10.7554/eLife.03722 [<a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>]) how a normative theory based on the efficient coding principle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barlow, 1961</a>) can account for the allocation of resources for the representation of complex sensory features. Specifically, we analyzed the local statistics of natural images, and compared the variability of these statistics with their perceptual salience. The statistics that were the most variable\u2014that is, the least predictable and therefore the most informative\u2014were the most salient perceptually. This relationship, in which greater resources are allocated to more variable features, emerges from the efficient coding principle in the regime that the main constraint is input sampling (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barlow, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">van Hateren, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Doi and Lewicki, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>). The observed relationship contrasts with the more familiar \u2018whitening\u2019 regime (<a href=\"#bib29\">Srinivasan et al., 1982</a>), which emerges when the main constraint is output capacity (e.g., with regard to the retina and the optic nerve bottleneck); the whitening regime predicts that fewer resources are allocated to more variable features. We note that the results of (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>) provide empirical support for the hypothesis that input sampling, rather than output capacity, is the main constraint\u2014since a transmission limit would have predicted a lower sensitivity for image statistics that were the most variable, the opposite of what we found."

This approach has several advantages. First, it reduces the dimensionality of the space of image statistics that need to be considered, since it can be applied to binarized images, and it separates informative from uninformative statistics (<a href=\"#bib30\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2010</a>). Second, the approach enables rigorous tests of theoretical predictions, since the individual kinds of informative and uninformative multipoint correlations can be isolated in synthetic image sets (<a href=\"#bib34\">Victor and Conte, 2012</a>). In contrast, the multipoint correlations in natural images covary in a complex manner that is difficult to capture or control. Synthetic image sets that isolate individual kinds of multipoint correlations are highly un-natural, but here this is an advantage: our predictions, which are derived from natural images, are tested in an out-of-sample fashion."

We used a two-stage model: first, the informative multipoint features (as identified by [<a href=\"#bib30\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2010</a>]) are extracted from a visual image by a set of local nonlinear processing elements. Then, the output of this stage, that is, the frequency of each feature in patches of the image, is represented and transmitted by central visual areas, to serve as the basis for visual inferences (Figure 4C of [<a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>]). We used a linear channel with additive Gaussian noise as an approximation for this latter process. While obviously a simplification, this leads to an analytic solution (<a href=\"#bib31\">van Hateren, 1992</a>) for the allocation of resources that maximizes the mutual information between stimuli and their central representation\u2014and the analytic solution accurately accounted for dozens of independently-determined psychophysical parameters (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>)."

The asterisks indicate responses to the structured stimulus sets (black) that are significantly different (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) from the responses to the random stimuli (light gray, beginning of each row). Decremental responses following contrast onset were present in both areas, but more often in V2.

Sensitivity to multipoint correlations was also present in isolated units that did not have overt RFs by hand-mapping or by reverse correlation (81/269 in V1 and 65/152 in V2); these units had waveforms that were isolated by the tetrode recordings, and likely include many of the \u2018unresponsive\u2019 neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Olshausen and Field, 2004</a>) that would not have been selected for study with single-electrode methods.

In granular and supragranular layers, the above observations hold, but there is a suggestion of a subset of V1 neurons with large RFs (lower left panel) that are sensitive to multipoint correlations. However, it is unlikely that this subpopulation underlies the high MCDI seen in V2: the targets of infragranular V1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>) are the superior colliculus (layer 5) and the lateral geniculate (layer 6), while the inputs to V2 arise mainly from layers 2, 3, and 4b, where the MCDI is low. Moreover, the difference between supragranular V2 and the V2 input layer strongly suggests that the behavior in supragranular V2 is a result of intrinsic processing in V2, not a feature of signals passed on by V1 (which would already have been present in the granular layer)."

Few neurons, either in supragranular V2 or across the population, discriminated among pairs of the stimuli with uninformative multipoint correlations (<i>random</i>, <i>wye</i>, and <i>foot</i>). To visualize the pattern of discrimination across the neuronal population, we applied multidimensional scaling to the data of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>. This led to a three-dimensional representation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) in which the seven stimulus types are represented by points, and the distance between the points corresponds to the fraction of neurons that distinguishes between them (i.e., the average pair-specific MCDI across the population). In V1, points are clustered near the origin, since most neurons cannot distinguish between any stimulus types. In V2, the representation expands into a multidimensional space. The two opposite stimulus pairs (<i>even</i> vs <i>odd</i>, and <i>white triangle</i> vs <i>black triangle</i>) are separated along different axes. Correspondingly, psychophysical studies show that the <i>even</i>-vs-<i>odd</i> gamut, and the <i>white triangle</i>-vs-<i>black triangle</i> gamut are independent perceptual axes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Victor and Conte, 2012</a>) (Figure 8 panel 2 of reference [<a href=\"#bib34\">Victor and Conte, 2012</a>], and the [<i>\u03b8</i>, <i>\u03b1</i>]-panels of Figure 3 of <a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al.

First, the points corresponding to the uninformative stimuli are close to, but not superimposed on, the random stimulus. Additionally, while psychophysical sensitivity to the <i>odd</i> stimulus is only about 25% less than sensitivity to the <i>even</i> stimuli (<a href=\"#bib34\">Victor and Conte, 2012</a>), the MCDI for the <i>odd</i> stimulus is much lower. We note that the <i>odd</i> stimulus contains <i>even</i> correlations when analyzed at spatial scales larger than a single check (<a href=\"#bib32\">Victor and Conte, 1989</a>), so neuronal mechanisms sensitive to the <i>even</i> correlation will also contribute to the perceptual salience of the <i>odd</i> stimulus. More generally, the discrepancies between V2 neuronal activity and perception may reflect the simple measure used for quantifying discrimination at the population level (the average MCDI and multidimensional scaling), as well as further neural processing between V2 and perception."

Within V2, the greatest sensitivity is in the supragranular layers, where the typical (median) neuron can distinguish between two or three of the stimulus pairs. In contrast, typical neurons in V1 do not distinguish between any of the stimuli, although there appears to be a subpopulation of large-RF neurons in infragranular V1 with a modest level of selective sensitivity.

The distinction between informative and uninformative multipoint correlations emerged from a formal information-theoretic analysis of natural images (<a href=\"#bib30\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2010</a>). While this analysis did not relate \u2018informativeness\u2019 to these other characteristics, inspection of the examples of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> suggests several points of contact. With regard to junctions and contours, examples of the <i>odd</i> ensemble images contain large numbers of corners, while examples of the <i>even</i> ensemble contain large numbers of crossings. The extended contours evident in the <i>even</i> ensemble are a kind of illusory contour, since the polarity changes that define them undergo random flips, which would confound a linear edge detector. With regard to figure vs ground, stimuli in the <i>black triangle</i> and <i>white triangle</i> ensembles appear to contain, respectively, black figures on white backgrounds, vs white figures on black backgrounds\u2014even though the stimulus sets are matched for spatial frequency content and the number of black and white checks. Thus, informative multipoint correlations result in images that are enriched for junctions, contours, and objects, compared to images that have the same first- and second-order statistics but lacking these correlations. While the extent to which these local features account for \u2018naturalness\u2019 remains for future work, the present results show that selective sensitivity of V2 neurons for informative multipoint correlations persists even when they are removed from the context of a natural image."

Human sensitivity to these correlations is present over at least a similar range of check sizes (0.03\u20130.25 deg, Figure 2, 8 of [<a href=\"#bib32\">Victor and Conte, 1989</a>]; also [<a href=\"#bib3\">Conte et al., 2014</a>]) comparable to the range of check sizes used in this study (0.08\u20130.5 deg). This broad range of sensitivities is found even when stimuli are restricted in eccentricity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Victor and Conte, 1989</a>). <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (right column) shows that V2 sensitivity to multipoint correlations also does not require a close match between RF size and the scale of the multipoint correlation; this sensitivity is present over a threefold range of length scales (i.e., a 10-fold range of the number of checks per receptive field). Thus, it is likely that the entire range of scales relevant to perception can be accounted for by the properties of individual neurons, along with the variation in RF sizes at each eccentricity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1968</a>)."

We were able to analyze their responses here because of the tetrode recording method, and found that many V2 neurons whose RFs could not be mapped nevertheless often showed selective sensitivity to multipoint correlations. We consider some possible reasons for this here. As defined in this paper, a neuron is considered to have a mappable RF if the reverse correlation of the neuron's responses to the stimulus passes a statistical criterion (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Standard practice is to use random binary stimuli for this mapping procedure (<a href=\"#bib21\">Reid et al., 1997</a>); here we include stimuli with high-order correlations in the mapping computation. The rationale is that inclusion of these stimuli allows some kinds of nonlinear responses to emerge in a first-order cross-correlation between stimulus and response, because of correlations within the stimuli (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schmid et al., 2011</a>). But even an expanded stimulus set may not reveal the RFs of all neurons that respond to multipoint correlations. Reverse correlations may not exceed our statistical threshold because of response variability, or because the neuron is only responsive to stimulus configurations that occur very rarely in the stimulus set. We also note that from a computational point of view, our assay for sensitivity to multipoint correlations is independent of whether the neural response is correlated with the state of any single check: for each of the ensembles that probe a different kind of multipoint correlation, the number of black and white checks are equated, at each location. Thus, it is quite possible for a neuron to process information in a localized region of space (as manifest by its sensitivity to multipoint correlations) yet fail to have a RF that is measurable by reverse correlation methods, as we show here."

Many biologically-plausible mechanisms can extract multipoint correlations, including a simple linear-nonlinear cascade (provided that the nonlinearity is more than quadratic), and modulatory surrounds (<a href=\"#bib24\">Schmid and Victor, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Self et al., 2014</a>). But models need to account for the specificity of the responses, not just their existence. In this regard, we note (<a href=\"#bib33\">Victor and Conte, 1991</a>) that the specificity we observe can be produced by a two-stage (linear-nonlinear-linear-nonlinear) cascade, in which the first linear-nonlinear element detects local edges, and the second one combines signals from collinear edges via a second threshold. Removal of either component of the second stage\u2014either its linear or the nonlinear element\u2014eliminates this specificity. The finding that responses to multipoint correlations are more prominent in supragranular V2 than in its input layers or in V1 suggests possible correspondences between this cascade and neural circuitry. One possibility is that the first stage is in V1 and the second stage is in V2 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wilson et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Rust et al., 2005</a>). Alternatively, the two linear-nonlinear stages may represent two loops of signal passage through a recurrent network within a single cortical area (<a href=\"#bib13\">Joukes et al., 2014</a>)."

In the \u2018<i>odd</i>\u2019 set, there was always an odd number of white (or black) checks in a 2 \u00d7 2 neighborhood. <i>Even</i> and <i>odd</i> sets are the opposite extremes of the visually salient four-point correlation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>), \u03b1. In the \u2018<i>white triangle</i>\u2019 set, there were always one or three white checks within a triangular region; in the \u2018<i>black triangle</i>\u2019 set, there were always one or three black checks within a region of the same shape. These two sets correspond to opposite extremes of the visually salient three-point correlation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>), \u03b8. We also examined responses to four-point correlations in two other spatial configurations, \u2018<i>wye</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>foot</i>.\u2019 Multipoint correlations in the <i>wye</i> and <i>foot</i> configurations are predictable from simpler quantities in natural images (<a href=\"#bib30\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2010</a>), and, in keeping with predictions of efficient coding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hermundstad et al., 2014</a>), they are not visually salient (<a href=\"#bib33\">Victor and Conte, 1991</a>)."

The response measure was the total number of spikes over the duration of each presentation (320 ms) averaged across both repetitions; this is equivalent to computing the spike-triggered-average and then summing over the stimulus duration. Maps were separately computed for each of the seven stimulus types; as reported previously, some neurons (<a href=\"#bib26\">Schmid et al., 2012</a>) that did not have mappable RFs for random checkerboards nevertheless had mappable RFs for the other stimulus types. Statistical significance for each of these seven maps was determined by a shuffle test: we recomputed maps from 500 surrogate data sets in which the responses to each stimulus type were permuted, determined the mean and standard deviation of these surrogate maps at each check, and then used the corresponding Gaussian distribution to determine which actual map values were significant at p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed, correcting for multiple comparison via the Benjamini-Hochberg method, that is, false discovery rate [FDR] method) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</a>). We then determined the union of the seven maps obtained from each stimulus. Usually this yielded a single connected component, and the RF was taken to be its convex hull. When more than one connected component was present, smaller components were merged with the largest one if they were separated by no more than a single check, and the convex hull of the resulting region was taken as the RF. The number of checks in this convex hull was taken as the measure of RF size. If none of the seven classes of stimuli yielded a significant RF map by the above criteria, the neuron was considered not to have a mappable RF. As an alternative procedure, we also computed RF maps by correlating the responses with all (7 \u00d7 1024) stimuli, and this yielded very similar results."

For each of the stimulus types, we accumulated a PSTH across all 1024 examples (and 2 repeats), and then determined the smoothed firing rate via local linear regression (<a href=\"#bib15\">Loader, 2012</a>). Significance of the difference between two firing rate functions was determined by a shuffle test, in which 3000 surrogate data sets were created by randomly exchanging responses among a pair of stimulus types. The exchanges were limited to responses that were recorded in adjacent trials (within 4 s of each other), to avoid confounds due to slow changes in firing rate over time. The difference between the smooth firing rates of the actual data was compared to the distribution of differences seen in the surrogate datasets at each 5 ms bin, from 55 to 250 ms. The number of times the actual difference was exceeded by any of the 3000 surrogates yielded a raw two-tailed p-value at each of these 40 time points. If the raw p-value was below the false-discovery-corrected threshold of p = 0.05, the neuron was considered to have a different response to the two kinds of stimuli at that time point. For each neuron, the MCDI at each time point (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) was defined as the fraction of stimulus pairs that elicited statistically different responses as determined by the above procedure; the MCDI was therefore <i>n</i>/21, where <i>n</i> is the number of stimulus pairs that elicited statistically different responses. For each of the seven stimuli, we also calculated a stimulus-specific MCDI, considering only the six pairs of discriminations involving that particular stimulus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>); this was therefore a quantity <i>n</i>/6. Finally, to detail the pattern of pairwise discriminations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>), we computed a \u2018pair-specific\u2019 MCDI\u2014either 0 (no discrimination) or 1 (discrimination), and averaged it across the population. For this purpose, we considered a neuron to distinguish a pair of stimuli if a difference was present at any time during the 55\u2013250 ms period, again using the above statistical criteria."

I have two comments. First, in panel a, the \u201ceven and odd\u201d correlation structure picks out the corners of the black bars. As such, the association of this correlation with the illusory contour is a consequence of the fact that the bars are spaced by the same distance that defined the \u201ceven and odd\u201d correlation structure. Can the authors say anything about whether there is an association between the spatial scales of illusory contour detection and the \u201ceven and odd\u201d correlation structure? For example, do humans perceive illusory contours over the same length scales that \u201ceven and odd\u201d correlation structures are informative for natural images? Has V2 previously been shown to be sensitive to illusory contours on the spatial scale that the authors use in the \u201ceven and odd\u201d correlation structure? Second, the \u201cwhite and black triangle\u201d correlation structure is the only correlation structure that can distinguish between the two stimuli in panel b because it's the only odd-ordered correlation. This is why I earlier alluded to the point that it would have been helpful to include an uninformative third-order correlation stimulus. Also, in the specific example shown, couldn't one just use the mean (i.e. a first-order structure) to discriminate between the stimuli? I wonder if there might be a better choice of stimuli for this panel."

Because of space limitations in the original submission, we had only touched on this, mentioning that responsiveness to multipoint correlations was similar for neurons with large and small receptive fields (RF\u2019s); we now devote a new figure to this issue (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), and add material describing this analysis to the Results section, after <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. Briefly, the new figure shows that the difference between V1 and V2 cannot be explained merely by a difference in RF size, or a difference in the number of checks within the RF: whether one compares the MCDI for V1 and V2 neurons with comparable RF sizes, or for V1 and V2 neurons stimulated with comparably scaled stimuli, the V2 neurons have a larger MCDI. The upper left panel shows the MCDI is plotted as a function of RF area, showing a difference in MCDI for V2 vs. V1 neurons across the entire range. So, V2 neurons are not simply larger versions of V1 neurons. But, as the reviewers point out, since we adjust the stimulus to match the resolution of the neural activity at one of the tetrodes (i.e., at one brain site), there is the possibility that the V2 vs. V1 difference relates to the number of the checks in the receptive field, or, equivalently, the fraction of the 16 x 16 stimulus array that is \u201cseen\u201d by the RF. The upper right panel rules out this possibility as well: when compared on the basis of equal number of checks within the RF, V2 neurons have a larger MCDI than V1 neurons. The remaining rows of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> supplement break the analysis down by laminar compartment; there are no surprises in the supra\u2010 and granular layers but the analysis of the infragranular compartment (see below) suggests that there is a subset of V1 neurons with large receptive fields that are sensitive to multipoint correlations. We now mention this point at the end of the new paragraph devoted to <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, but (as discussed below) it does not change our basic finding, that sensitivity to multipoint correlations arises primarily in V2."

With regard to (a), the new analysis presented in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a> provides an important clue, which we now mention in the Results where the summary statistics are described: the infragranular layer contains a subset of V1 neurons, with large receptive fields, and this subpopulation has a large MCDI. With regard to (b), we don\u2019t think that the existence of these neurons changes the basic conclusion that sensitivity to multipoint correlations arises primarily in V2: these units make up only a small subset of one laminar compartment in V1, and even among these neurons, the median MCDI does not approach the levels in supragranular V2. Independently, anatomical evidence supports this view: the targets of infragranular V1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Felleman and Van Essen (1991)</a>) are the superior colliculus (layer 5) and the lateral geniculate (Layer 6); while the inputs to V2 arise mainly from layers 2, 3, and 4b, where the MCDI is low. Finally, the difference between supragranular V2 and the V2 input layer strongly suggests that the behavior in supragranular V2 is a result of intrinsic processing in V2, not a feature of signals passed on by V1 (which would already have been present in the granular layer). We now mention these points in the main text concerning <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>.

The characteristics of human perception are approximately constant over a similar range of length scales (.03 to 0.25 deg checks, a range similar to that used in these experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and 8 of <a href=\"#bib32\">Victor and Conte 1989</a> [four\u2010point correlations]; also Victor, Thengone, Rizvi, and Conte et al., VSS Abstracts 2014 [two\u2010 and three\u2010point correlations as well]).

In brief, there are several ways in which neurons that are not \u201cmappable\u201d could, nevertheless, participate in form vision tasks in general (<a href=\"#bib19\">Olshausen and Field 2004</a>) , or, in particular, discriminate among multipoint correlations (as we show here). As defined in this paper, a \u201cmappable\u201d RF requires that reverse correlation of the neuron\u2019s responses to the stimulus passes a statistical criterion. Standard practice is to use random binary stimuli for this mapping procedure; here we include stimuli with high\u2010order correlations in the mapping computation. The rationale is that this allows some kinds of nonlinear responses to emerge in a first\u2010order cross\u2010 correlation between stimulus and response, because of correlations within the stimuli (Schmid, Yu, and Victor, SfN Abstracts, 2012). But there is no reason to believe that this expanded stimulus set reveals all RFs. For example: (i) reverse correlations may not exceed threshold because of response variability; (ii) a neuron may only be responsive to stimulus configurations that occur very rarely in the stimulus set; or (iii) a neuron may be selectively responsive to one or more of the multipoint correlations tested, but since the occurrence of this configuration is not correlated with whether a check is white or black, there will be no correlation of the response to the state of individual checks. Our data do not permit us to determine which of these explanations dominate, but we suspect that (i) and (iii) contribute."

As is standard, the FDR threshold for a given significance level alpha is a data\u2010 determined quantity q, for which it can be anticipated that less than a fraction alpha of the values below q are false\u2010 positives. Typically q is substantially less than alpha (in the case shown in the Figure, alpha is 0.05 but q is &lt;0.01). We clarify this by labeling the significance threshold in panel d as \u201cq\u201d, and adding text to the caption to highlight that the FDR threshold q is distinct from, and more stringent than, the un\u2010corrected significance threshold of alpha=0.05. With regard to positive correlations among the individual values, the false discovery correction procedure we used takes this into account: under conditions of positive correlation, the standard procedure reduces to the FDR procedure we used (Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli, (2001), \u201cThe control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency\u201d, Annals of Statistics 29 (4): 1165\u20131188. doi:10.1214/aos/1013699998.
