                    "text": "Hippocampal oscillations are dynamic, with unique oscillatory frequencies present during different behavioral states. To examine the extent to which these oscillations reflect neuron engagement in distinct local circuit processes that are important for memory, we recorded single cell and local field potential activity from the CA1 region of the hippocampus as rats performed a context-guided odor-reward association task. We found that theta (4\u201312 Hz), beta (15\u201335 Hz), low gamma (35\u201355 Hz), and high gamma (65\u201390 Hz) frequencies exhibited dynamic amplitude profiles as rats sampled odor cues. Interneurons and principal cells exhibited unique engagement in each of the four rhythmic circuits in a manner that related to successful performance of the task. Moreover, principal cells coherent to each rhythm differentially represented task dimensions. These results demonstrate that distinct processing states arise from the engagement of rhythmically identifiable circuits, which have unique roles in organizing task-relevant processing in the hippocampus."

To examine the extent to which these oscillations reflect neuron engagement in distinct local circuit processes that are important for memory, we recorded single cell and local field potential activity from the CA1 region of the hippocampus as rats performed a context-guided odor-reward association task. We found that theta (4\u201312 Hz), beta (15\u201335 Hz), low gamma (35\u201355 Hz), and high gamma (65\u201390 Hz) frequencies exhibited dynamic amplitude profiles as rats sampled odor cues. Interneurons and principal cells exhibited unique engagement in each of the four rhythmic circuits in a manner that related to successful performance of the task. Moreover, principal cells coherent to each rhythm differentially represented task dimensions. These results demonstrate that distinct processing states arise from the engagement of rhythmically identifiable circuits, which have unique roles in organizing task-relevant processing in the hippocampus."

In contrast, interneurons were more likely to fire in synchrony to each of the four rhythms at some point during a correct choice. Among the four rhythms, coordinated principal cell and interneuron firing with respect to the beta rhythm was most tightly linked with a correct choice. These findings reveal that investigation of rhythmic dynamics in the hippocampus can provide insight into how the timing of cell activity is coordinated to support memory."

The unique connectivity of a network constrains the number of distinct rhythmic profiles that its local circuits can manifest, and the input to the network at a given time dictates the rhythmic circuits that are engaged (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon et al., 2014</a>). The dynamics of rhythms can thus reflect fast-paced changes in the coordination of activity within local circuits during information processing. Changes in the oscillatory activity of the hippocampus, a brain structure important for memory function, occur as it processes information it receives from multiple brain regions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Draguhn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Schomburg, et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Igarashi et al., 2014</a>). By studying the interactions of hippocampal neurons with their rhythmic circuits, we gain insight into how single neuron activity is coordinated into the local circuit and systems level processes that support memory. Although great advances have been made in describing both single cell and rhythmic correlates of memory in hippocampal circuits, relatively few studies examine the interaction of these phenomena."

The theta (4\u201312\u2009Hz) rhythm is a dominant rhythm in the hippocampus that engages both principal and interneuron cell types, and depends on inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the medial septum (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kocsis et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Montgomery et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kubie et al., 1990</a>). The hippocampus also exhibits oscillations in the beta and gamma frequency ranges that span from 15-150Hz (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Freeman, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Colgin and Moser, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kay and Freeman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Martin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gourevitch et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Schomburg, 2015</a>). Changes in the prominence of these higher frequency oscillations can reflect changes in input from converging afferents. Specifically, slow and fast gamma oscillations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus are thought to arise from the influence of CA3 and MEC inputs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib13\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Schomburg, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schomburg et al., 2014</a>). In addition, an intermediate beta frequency range in CA1 has been hypothesized to reflect inputs from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Igarashi et al., 2014</a>). These higher frequency oscillations often occur concurrently with the theta<sub>4-12Hz</sub> rhythm, and previous studies suggest that coordination of cell activity within co-occurring rhythms produces nested levels of organization in the hippocampal network (<a href=\"#bib13\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Harris et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mizuseki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2010</a>).

Interneurons in the CA1 region\u00a0differ greatly according to their thresholds of excitability, the decay time of their inhibition, and the subcellular compartments where they preferentially target principal cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Royer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roux et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Roux and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2015</a>).

In addition, cross-frequency coupling in the hippocampus develops while learning context-guided odor-reward associations (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tort et al., 2009;</a> <a href=\"#bib48\">2010</a>), which occurs concurrently with the development of odor-place conjunctive encoding in hippocampal principal neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Komorowski et al., 2009</a>). Since the hippocampus exhibits distinctive rhythmic states during memory tasks, and several of them are tied to the onset of learning, these changes in oscillatory profiles could reflect circuit level processes supporting memory function.

Prominent changes in amplitude were observed in the theta (4\u201312\u2009Hz), beta (15\u201335\u2009Hz), low gamma (35\u201355\u2009Hz), and high gamma (65\u201390\u2009Hz) frequency ranges (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> (<i>middle, bottom</i>), b-c). For each frequency band, we determined whether amplitude changed over the course of the nose poke or differed according to behavioral outcome (correct or incorrect). We performed a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA and found a significant main effect of time during the nose poke for all frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e\u2013h</a>; <i>time</i>: repeated measures ANOVA<sub>theta</sub>: d.f. = 5, F= 10.32, p&lt;0.00001; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>beta</sub>: d.f. = 5, F= 23.87, p&lt;0.00001; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>low gamma</sub>: d.f. = 5, F= 17.34, p&lt;0.00001; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>high gamma</sub>: d.f. = 5, F= 63.78, p&lt;0.00001), and no main effect for outcome (correct or incorrect) in any frequency (<i>outcome</i>: repeated measures ANOVA<sub>theta</sub>: d.f. = 1, F= 1.19, p=0.2797, n.s.; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>beta</sub>: d.f. = 1, F \u2248 0, p=0.9746, n.s.; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>low gamma</sub>: d.f. = 1, F = 1.32, p=0.2546, n.s.; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>high gamma</sub>: d.f. = 1, F = 0.08, p=0.7747, n.s.). These results indicate that while all four frequencies demonstrated significant changes in amplitude over the course of the nose poke, mean amplitudes were not significantly different across correct and incorrect trial types. However, we observed a significant interaction effect in the low gamma<sub>35-55Hz</sub> frequency range, due to increased low gamma<sub>35-55Hz</sub> amplitude during correct trials during the last second of the odor-sampling interval (time x outcome: repeated measures ANOVA<sub>theta</sub>: d.f. = 5, F= 0.34, p=0.8886, n.s.; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>beta</sub>: d.f. = 5, F = 1.46, p=0.2008, n.s.; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>low gamma</sub>: d.f. = 5, F = 4.32, p=0.0008; repeated measures ANOVA<sub>high gamma</sub>: d.f. = 5, F = 0.40, p=0.8513, n.s.). This increase in low gamma<sub>35-55Hz</sub> amplitude at the end of the nose poke during Correct Trials Only is evident in the ratio of the spectrograms for correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). This indicates that there is a change in processing over the course of the nose poke within low gamma<sub>35-55Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits that differentiates between correct and incorrect trials. Together, these results indicate that the nose poke interval contains a shift in processing state in the hippocampus, which is observable through the onset of changes in rhythmic circuits."

To test whether single cell entrainment to theta<sub>4-12Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55Hz</sub>, or high gamma<sub>65-90Hz</sub> frequency ranges was related to successful performance of the associative memory task, we first examined whether interneuron spike-phase coherence to each frequency range during the odor sampling interval was selective to correct or incorrect trial types. This interval was initiated by a nose poke, and continued as the poke was sustained for 1.5\u2009s, when the rat committed to a decision. The interneurons (N = 67, 45 sessions with each half-session analyzed separately, 6 rats, see Materials and methods) were categorized as exhibiting significant spike-phase coherence to a given frequency range during Correct Trials Only, Incorrect Trials Only, or All (both correct and incorrect) Trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). If single cell engagement in a rhythm in the form of spike-phase coherence is important for successful processing during the task, one might expect a larger number of cells to be coherent during Correct Trials Only. The converse might be true if single cell spike-phase coherence was to interfere with successful performance, resulting in a larger number of cells exhibiting significant spike-phase coherence during Incorrect Trials Only. Lastly, cells that exhibit significant spike-phase coherence to a rhythm on All Trials (correct and incorrect) might instead be engaged in underlying processes that are not task-specific. For each rhythm, the proportions of interneurons in each category were compared to the proportions that would be expected if the cells were equally distributed across all three categories. This comparison thus asks whether the number of cells exhibiting significant spike phase coherence to a rhythm is different across the three performance categories."

Adjusting for firing rate differences between trial types (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a, b</a>, see Materials and methods), we observed significant decreases in the strength of interneuron spike-phase coherence to each rhythm during incorrect trials when compared to correct trials (Median (Mdn)<i><sub>theta-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.1884, Mdn<i><sub>theta-incorrect\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.0998, Wilcoxon signed-rank test Z = 4.76, p&lt;0.00001; Mdn<i><sub>beta-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.0883, Mdn<i><sub>beta-incorrect\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.0223, Wilcoxon signed-rank test Z = 9.25, p&lt;0.00001; Mdn<i><sub>low gamma-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.0906 Mdn<i><sub>low gamma-incorrect\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.0317, Wilcoxon signed-rank test Z = 7.27, p&lt;0.00001; Mdn<i><sub>high gamma-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.0830 Mdn<i><sub>high gamma-incorrect\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.0221, Wilcoxon signed-rank test Z = 8.28, p&lt;0.00001). Since higher firing rates in phase-modulated cells can increase estimates of spike-phase coherence strength, we determined whether firing rate differences between correct and incorrect trials could explain the differences in selective coherence. If the decrease in coherence during Incorrect Trials Only is due to lower firing rates during incorrect trials, then we would observe significantly lower firing rates during incorrect trials compared to correct trials. To the contrary, we observed that interneurons exhibited significantly higher firing rates during incorrect trials than correct trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>; Mdn<i><sub>correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 12.78\u2009Hz, Mdn<i><sub>incorrect\u00a0</sub></i>= 14.20\u2009Hz, Wilcoxon signed-rank test Z = -3.22, p=0.0013). Thus, the lack of interneuron engagement during Incorrect Trials Only is not due to firing rate differences between correct and incorrect trial types. Instead, unsuccessful processing during the task coincides with a unique inability to engage the interneuron population in rhythmic circuits. Taken together, these results suggest that trial outcome is strongly related to interneuron engagement in each of the four rhythms."

If engagement in a rhythm during Correct Trials Only represents participation in a rhythmic processing state that occurs uniquely during successful task performance, then the phase of interneuron spiking activity may change between correct and incorrect trials. In addition, interneurons exhibiting coherence to a rhythm during All Trials might exhibit the same phase preference during correct and incorrect trials because their participation is not related to successful task performance. We first tested the interneurons that exhibited significant spike-phase coherence to a specific rhythm during Correct Trials Only by performing circular correlations on their preferred (average) phase during correct and incorrect trials. Interneurons that were coherent to theta<sub>4-12Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35Hz</sub>, and high gamma<sub>65-90Hz</sub> during Correct Trials Only did not exhibit a consistent phase preference between correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>; R<i><sub>theta-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.26, p=0.0823; R<i><sub>beta-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.12, p=0.4003; R<i><sub>high gamma-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.16, p=0.2012). Interneurons that were coherent to low gamma<sub>35-55Hz</sub> during Correct Trials Only exhibited only a weak correlation in phase preference between correct and incorrect trials (R<i><sub>low gamma-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.31, p=0.0258). Overall, the interneurons that were coherent during Correct Trials Only did not exhibit similar engagement across trial types as measured by spike-phase coherence. Given that the magnitude of coherence is greater across this population during correct trials, together these results suggest that there is a critical reorganization of spike timing in these interneurons during successful processing in the hippocampus. In stark contrast, interneurons that were coherent to theta<sub>4-12Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55Hz</sub>, and high gamma<sub>65-90Hz</sub> during All Trials exhibited relatively strong correlations between the average phases observed across the population during correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>; R<i><sub>theta-all\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.82, p&lt;0.00001; R<i><sub>beta-all\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.55, p=0.0402; R<i><sub>low gamma-all\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.41, p=0.0131; R<i><sub>high gamma-all\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.66, p=0.0002). Thus the interneurons that are coherent during All Trials also have similar phases of entrainment during correct and incorrect trials, suggesting that they are similarly engaged in processing within local rhythmic circuits irrespective of whether the rat successfully performs the task. Combined with evidence that each rhythm demonstrates a unique ability to engage interneurons across correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), these results demonstrate that each rhythmic circuit differentially participates in task-related processing as demonstrated by the selective entrainment of interneuron spike timing."

The principal cells coherent to theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> and high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> during Correct Trials Only did not exhibit a consistent phase preference across correct and incorrect trial types (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>; R<i><sub>theta-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= -0.05, p=0.4107; R<i><sub>high gamma-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= -0.10, p=0.2239), suggesting that these principal cells are engaged by theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> and high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits differently on correct and incorrect trials. For the principal cells coherent to beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> during Correct Trials Only, the preferred phase during correct trials was anti-correlated to the average phase during incorrect trials (R<i><sub>beta-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= -0.35, p=0.0027), indicating that the preferred phase of entrainment during correct trials in this population was often opposite (i.e. separated by 180 degrees) to the average phase during incorrect trials. In contrast, the principal cells coherent to low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> during Correct Trials Only exhibited similar phases across correct and incorrect trials (R<i><sub>low gamma-correct\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.35, p=0.0006), indicating that there is some similarity in how the spike timing of these cells relates to the low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> oscillation during both trial types despite a lack of significant coherence during incorrect trials. This suggests that the low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuit tends to engage its principal cells at a specific phase irrespective of trial outcome, while the magnitude of this engagement is a stronger predictor of correct performance. For the relatively few principal cells that were coherent to theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub>, and high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> during All Trials, the preferred phase angles during correct trials were not correlated to the preferred phase angles during incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>; R<i><sub>theta-all\u00a0</sub></i>= -0.12, p=0.3693; R<i><sub>beta-all\u00a0</sub></i>= -0.89, p=0.1747; R<i><sub>low gamma-all\u00a0</sub></i>= 0.07, p=0.8175; R<i><sub>high gamma-all\u00a0</sub></i>= -0.05, p=0.8751), indicating that these principal cells are engaged by rhythmic circuits differently on correct and incorrect trials. These results further demonstrate that principal cells are distinctly engaged in rhythmic circuits when the rat is effectively processing information in order to correctly respond in the task."

                                "text": "We then examined the extent to which interneurons and principal cells were exclusively coherent to one rhythm or flexibly engaged in many. In our previous analyses, cells were identified as coherent to one rhythm without regard for its coherence to the other three frequency ranges examined. It is possible that many of the cells coherent to beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, for example, are also coherent to theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub>, and high gamma<sub>65-90H</sub>. To examine the extent to which cells categorized as coherent to a specific rhythm are actually engaged in many, we first identified the number of interneurons and principal cells coherent to theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub>, or high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> that were either coherent to only one rhythm or multiple rhythms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). As the strength of coherence for both interneurons and principal cells is notably lower during incorrect trials, this analysis was restricted to Correct Trials Only. Tests for differences between the interneuron and principal cell populations revealed that interneurons were significantly more engaged in multiple rhythms than the principal cell population in each rhythmic category (\u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>theta (P v I)</sub></i> (1, N=300) = 49.65, p&lt;0.00001; \u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>beta (P v I)</sub></i> (1, N=122) = 33.40, p&lt;0.00001; \u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>low gamma (P v I)</sub></i> (1, N=145) = 26.56, p&lt;0.00001; \u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>high gamma (P v I)</sub></i> (1, N=178) = 31.17, p&lt;0.00001; for the interneurons and principal cells engaged in multiple rhythms, see the specific combination of rhythms in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1 and 2</a>, respectively). Thus, interneurons often participate in multiple types of rhythmic circuits, whereas principal cells often exhibit engagement limited to a single rhythm. These results suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in engaging interneurons and principal cells in rhythmic circuits, leading to the capacity for interneurons to readily participate in multiple rhythmic processing states."

To investigate this question, we determined the number of interneurons coherent to every combination of the four rhythmic categories during correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Interneurons were not equally distributed across the fifteen combinations of the four rhythms during correct trials (\u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>correct</sub> </i>(14, N=134) = 326.97, p&lt;0.00001), with the largest number of the interneurons coherent to all four rhythms. In contrast, during incorrect trials, the interneurons were unequally distributed such that they were most often coherent to theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> only (\u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>incorrect</sub> </i>(14, N=100) = 203.30, p&lt;0.00001). The distribution of interneurons across the fifteen rhythmic categories was significantly different during correct and incorrect trial types (\u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>correct v incorrect</sub> </i>(14, N=234) = 52.46, p&lt;0.00001). The most striking differences were observed in the proportion of interneurons coherent to theta only and the proportion of interneurons coherent to all four rhythms (\u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>theta only</sub> </i>(1, N=234) = 18.99, p&lt;0.00001; \u03c7<i><sup>2</sup><sub>all rhythms</sub> </i>(1, N=234) = 21.67, p&lt;0.00001). These results indicate that interneuron engagement in all four rhythms is strongly related to successful performance of the task, and suggests that interneuron engagement solely in a theta rhythmic circuit is a marker of a processing state that is maladaptive for good performance in our task."

If the latter possibility were the case, we would expect the coherence of the interneurons to be similarly modulated on each trial by our rhythms of interest. To examine whether interneurons were engaged in combinations of rhythms at similar times during the nose poke, we performed multi-taper spike-phase coherence analysis to acquire the magnitude of coherence at four frequencies (7\u00a0Hz, 20\u00a0Hz, 45\u00a0Hz, and 75\u00a0Hz) within each of the four bands used in this study for every correct trial. We then asked whether the magnitude of coherence to one frequency was correlated with the magnitude of coherence to another frequency across trials by performing correlations on the coherence values across trials for every pair of frequencies (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). There were no significant differences in the correlations values obtained for any pair of rhythms for the subpopulation of interneurons that were coherent to all four rhythms (one-way repeated measures ANOVA, N=53, d.f. = 5, F= 1.59, p=0.1648). Although we are open to the possibility that there is coordinated (e.g. correlated or anti-correlated) coherence to multiple rhythms, there do not appear to be any obvious trends in our data."

                                "text": "We also attempted to examine whether the amplitudes of the four rhythms were co-modulated during correct trial nose pokes. To do this, we examined amplitude dynamics in the local field potential alone, independently of the spiking activity. For every session, we calculated the instantaneous amplitude of each of the four frequency ranges during correct trials and performed correlations on the amplitude values for every pair of frequencies (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>, see Materials and methods). We observed significant differences in the correlations between different pairs of frequencies (one-way ANOVA, d.f. = 5, F= 42.06, p&lt;0.00001). Post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that some pairs of frequencies appear to be more correlated or anti-correlated than others (for the results from all pairwise comparisons, see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>). Specifically, theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> and low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> amplitudes are more anti-correlated than all other pairs of frequencies (Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference test, p&lt;0.00001, for all post hoc pairwise comparisons of theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> and low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> amplitude correlations against all other pairs of frequencies). In contrast, theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> and beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> amplitudes, as well as beta<sub>15-35H</sub> and low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> amplitudes were more correlated than most other pairs of frequencies (Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference test, p<sub>theta-beta v theta-low gamma</sub> &lt; 0.00001, p<sub>theta-beta v theta-high gamma</sub> &lt; 0.00001, p<sub>theta-beta v beta-low gamma</sub> = 0.248, p<sub>theta-beta v beta-high gamma</sub> = 0.020, p<sub>beta-low gamma v beta-high gamma</sub> = 0.676; p<sub>beta-low gamma v theta-low gamma</sub> &lt; 0.00001, p<sub>beta-low gamma v theta-high gamma</sub> &lt; 0.00001, p<sub>beta-low gamma v beta-high gamma</sub> &lt; 0.00001, p<sub>beta-low gamma v low gamma-high gamma</sub> = 0.003). Correlations between high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> amplitude and other frequencies (theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, and low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub>) were lower than beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> and low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> correlations, indicating that co-modulation of frequencies with high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> is generally not as strong. These findings suggest that while theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> and low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> amplitudes tend to undergo opposing changes, they both are often co-modulated with beta<sub>15-35H</sub> amplitude at some point during correct nose pokes. Importantly, many pairs of frequencies appear correlated in some sessions and anti-correlated in others (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>). Thus, while these results reveal that there are trends towards co-modulation of some frequencies, we did not observe strikingly robust co-modulation or mutual exclusivity for any pair of frequencies in this study. Consequently, it seems that each rhythmic circuit can operate independently, and therefore the engagement of interneurons into each rhythmic network also likely occurs independently."

Position information describes the extent to which the spiking activity of a neuron differentiates between the four possible odor port positions. Odor information describes the ability of the neuron to discriminate between odors (A, B, C, and D). Odor-position information describes the extent to which neural activity was selective for the co-occurrence of a specific odor in a particular odor port location. A neuron was considered to have significant information for a task dimension if the information score exceeded the 95% confidence interval of 1000 scores calculated from trial-shuffled conditions."

Together, these results suggest that rhythmic circuits differentially contribute task-relevant information, and that these contributions occur during different key intervals of the task. Moreover, beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits may be particularly selective for processing odor-position information, which is critical for successful task performance."

Understanding the flexible engagement of neurons into rhythmic circuits allows us to uncover the mechanisms through which single cells contribute to systems level processes. Our results indicate that the hippocampus can support multiple distinct, rhythmically identifiable processing states that are tightly linked to behavior in a context-guided odor-reward association task. During odor-sampling intervals, we observed transient amplitude dynamics in theta (4\u201312\u2009Hz), beta (15\u201335\u2009Hz), low gamma (35\u201355\u2009Hz), and high gamma (65\u201390\u2009Hz) oscillations, indicating that there is a shift in processing state within the hippocampal circuit.

We quantified this engagement by determining which interneurons demonstrated significant spike-phase coherence to the ongoing rhythms during odor sampling, as well as the magnitude and phase of their coherence. These measures demonstrated that engagement arises from a reorganization of spike timing with respect to each rhythm during task-related processing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a and b</a>), and not from enhanced participation through differences in overall firing rate between correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Importantly, the relationship between task performance and interneuron engagement differed across the four frequency ranges examined, suggesting that coordination within each rhythm may have a differential contribution to task-related processing. Notably, the largest proportion of interneurons exhibiting significant spike-phase coherence to theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> did so irrespective of whether the trial was correct or incorrect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), suggesting that recruitment of these interneurons into theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits is not related to successful performance of the task. In contrast, interneurons that exhibited significant spike-phase coherence to beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> were coherent almost exclusively during correct trials, suggesting that task-related processing consistently recruits interneurons into beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits. Thus coordination of interneuron activity within each rhythm corresponds to task-related processing to a different extent. We further characterized task-related coordination in our analysis of phase preferences during correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We found that the phase preference between trial types was grossly different for the class of interneurons coherent during Correct Trials Only, but not for the interneurons that were coherent during All Trials. This indicates that task-related engagement manifests in both magnitude and preferred phase, suggesting that interneuron spike timing relative to the ongoing rhythms reflects its participation in task-related processing states. As the proportions of cells coherent during Correct Trials Only and All Trials differ across the four rhythms, we can surmise that each rhythm contributes uniquely to the orchestration of spike timing in the service of task-related processing."

Notably, principal cell engagement in each rhythm occurred almost exclusively during correct trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a and b</a>), despite similar firing rates between correct and incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). This could be observed through the large proportions of principal cells with significant spike-phase coherence to each rhythm during Correct Trials Only (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Selective engagement of the principal cell population during correct trials was not equal across the four frequencies examined. Beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub>, and high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> coherent principal cells exhibited this preferential coherence during Correct Trials Only more often than theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> coherent principal cells, which consisted of a larger proportion of cells that were coherent irrespective of trial outcome. Though this difference is less pronounced in theta rhythmic principal cells than theta rhythmic interneurons, it nonetheless suggests that task-related processing more consistently recruits principal cell activity in beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub>, and high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits than in theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits. The strength of principal cell coherence to each rhythm was also greater during correct trials than during incorrect trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a and b</a>), suggesting that there is an organization of principal cell spike timing that is unique to correct trials. The analysis of phase preference between correct and incorrect trials also revealed unique spike timing properties across the rhythms. The principal cells coherent to theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, and high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> during Correct Trials Only exhibited inconsistent phases of entrainment across correct and incorrect trials, providing further evidence that these principal cells are engaged in their rhythmic circuits differently on correct and incorrect trials. In contrast, the principal cells coherent to low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> during Correct Trials Only exhibited similar phases across correct and incorrect trials, suggesting that there are features of engagement in low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmic circuits that are independent of trial outcome. Despite these finer differences in the nature of principal cell coordination within each rhythmic circuit, principal cells demonstrate a selective reorganization of spike timing during task-related processing."

Interneurons flexibly interacted in multiple rhythmic circuits, which was most apparent in the large proportion of interneurons that exhibited coherence to all four rhythms during correct trials, though potentially not all at the same time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Indeed, interneuron spike-phase coherence to multiple rhythms might be a signature of correct performance, whereas interneuron engagement in a single rhythm is more often observed during incorrect trials. This result indicates that the flexible engagement of the interneuron population in multiple rhythmic circuits is important for task-related processing. In contrast, larger numbers of principal cells were preferentially coherent to only one rhythm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>), providing evidence that theta<sub>4-12\u00a0Hz</sub>, beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub>, low gamma<sub>35-55\u00a0Hz</sub> and high gamma<sub>65-90\u00a0Hz</sub> reflect functionally distinct processing states. This result suggests that principal cells can often participate in segregated rhythmic circuits with separable functions. Moreover, as many principal cells were engaged in single rhythmic circuits during correct and incorrect trials, engagement in multiple rhythmic circuits appears more related to task performance in the interneuron population. These dramatically different profiles of engagement between interneurons and principal cells indicate that each group interacts with the surrounding rhythmic circuits in markedly different ways."

The instantaneous amplitudes of certain pairs of rhythms were correlated during the task, although not consistently across all sessions.

These coordinated dynamics among specific pairs of rhythms suggest that there is some consistency in the organization of interneuron activity within each of the four rhythms that can include both co-modulation within some rhythmic circuits and temporally segregated entrainment in others."

Task-related increases in coherence could then facilitate the effective communication of subpopulations of CA1 neurons with specific downstream targets that exhibit similar resonance. The ability of a single network to process information at multiple different frequencies thus creates an opportunity for multiplexing through frequency division and the selective readout of signals that are segregated into different frequency bands (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akam and Kullmann, 2014</a>.).

Notably, beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> coherent principal cells only exhibited increases in information for odor-position conjunctions, which are a hallmark of associative memory (<a href=\"#bib24\">Komorowski et al., 2009</a>).

Identifying the mechanisms that give rise to the beta<sub>15-35\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythm can provide insight into how it contributes to associative memory processes. The selective entrainment of the interneuron population to beta<sub>15-25\u00a0Hz</sub> during correct trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) could reflect the receipt of rhythmic input from an upstream structure that engages neurons in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>, mechanism <b>1</b>). This hypothesis is supported by recent studies suggesting that coherence between the CA1 and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) parallels the onset of learning in an olfactory discrimination task and the development of task-selective ensemble activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Igarashi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rangel and Eichenbaum, 2014</a>). As the LEC has been shown to be important for the processing of multi-modal object information (<a href=\"#bib50\">Young et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</a>), communication between LEC and hippocampus could be critical for the association of odors with their reward contingencies. In addition, a recent study that used current source density analysis to reveal the location of current sources and sinks corresponding to beta oscillations in the dentate gyrus found that beta oscillations in this structure are likely driven by perforant path input (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rangel et al., 2015</a>). It is thus possible that beta oscillatory dynamics in the CA1 are the product of entrainment by an upstream cortical afferent. As an alternative to inheriting beta<sub>15-25\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythmicity from upstream structures, it is also possible that the hippocampus locally generates a beta<sub>15-25\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythm when engaged by specific afferents (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>, mechanism 2). Under this hypothesis, a change in communication between local neurons produces a functional circuit that resonates at beta<sub>15-25\u00a0Hz</sub>, which optimally facilitates associative memory processing. As a third possibility, the beta<sub>15-25\u00a0Hz</sub> rhythm could reflect the broad coordination of activity across disparate neural networks (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kopell et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bibbig et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pinto et al., 2003</a>). The hippocampus is just one of many structures that engage in beta rhythmic processing during the presentation of meaningful cues (<a href=\"#bib21\">Igarashi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kay and Freeman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rangel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Quinn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buschman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Leventhal, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tingley et al., 2015</a>). Together, these structures could constitute an integrated network of circuits that span the brain. Rhythmic synchronization of this distributed network through a central rhythm generator could then enable information processing as a coordinated unit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>, mechanism 3)."

First, interneuron and principal cell coherence have distinct relationships to task performance. Second, we show that interneurons, unlike principal cells, are often flexibly engaged in multiple rhythms. These differences may shed light upon the distinct roles of excitation and inhibition in processing within rhythmically identifiable hippocampal circuits. Taken together, our results suggest that different rhythms make unique contributions to information processing within the hippocampus, and changes in the rhythmic profile reflect dynamic coordination of its cell activity. Further characterization of these rhythmic circuits will be critical for understanding how cell activity within the hippocampus is flexibly coordinated in the service of memory."

Upon entering the study, rats were first exposed to the testing apparatus: a two-arm apparatus constructed of black plastic (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Two 45-cm arms extended from opposite ends of a 30-cm central chamber. The central chamber consisted of 20-cm high walls and two pairs of doors, one black and one clear, that opened onto either arm. All doors could be independently raised and lowered by electric actuators. The end of each arm contained a widened area with two circular odor ports (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, inset), into which an odorant could be released by opening an air solenoid. Odorants were delivered by air flowing over vials of oil-based scents. A total 12 odors were used over the course of training and experimental sessions. Some of the odors were natural scents (maple, cedar, spearmint, strawberry, sweet orange, mango, lemon) while the others were chemical odorants (2-phenylpropionaldehyde, allyl-a-ionone, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, guaiacol, isoamyl acetate). Each port also contained a vacuum, which removed the odorant after release to prevent cross-contamination of odors between trials. Below each odor port was a tray with a well, into which water could be released to reward successful performance. Throughout the apparatus there were LED sensors to verify rat movement: two along the length of each arm, one in each odor port, one in each water well, and two in the central chamber. LED sensors in each odor port acted to record nose poke onset. All apparatus functions were controlled via a computer by customized MATLAB programs (MathWorks, Natick,\u00a0MA)."

Rats received training sessions in which initially 100\u00a0ms nose pokes elicited a water reward. The nose poke criterion increased by 100 ms for each poke of sufficient length and dropped by 100 ms for every two successive unsuccessful nose pokes until rats learned to consistently poke for 1.5 s. During this process, rats only had access to one port at a time and received equal exposure to all four ports on the apparatus. Following nose poke training, each rat was taught to discriminate between two odors of an odor pair. During early discrimination sessions, two different context overlays made of distinct materials were placed over each side of the apparatus, and the rat was given access to one arm of the apparatus at a time. Rats alternated between arms in blocks of 20 trials during initial training, followed by blocks of 10 trials upon improved performance. Ultimately, arms switched in a pseudorandom, counterbalanced fashion in all later sessions."

Rats could initiate the delivery of an odor by poking their snouts into an odor port. Odors were released within the port after a 250\u00a0ms delay. One odor of the pair was designated as a \u201ccorrect\u201d odor, and sustaining a nose poke of 1.5 s in the odor port containing this odor resulted in a water reward. The other odor was not rewarded, and a white noise buzz would occur if the rat sustained a nose poke for 1.5 s in that port. After each trial, the rat returned to the central chamber, the doors surrounding the chamber were elevated, and the next trial would begin. We analyzed neural activity during trials when the rat maintained a nose poke for 1.5\u00a0s while sampling a rewarded odor (correct trials) and during trials when the rat maintained a nose poke for 1.5\u00a0s while sampling the non-rewarded odor (incorrect trials). The same odor was always correct for a given context overlay and side of the apparatus. The location of the correct odor could switch between the left and right ports each trial, and trials were counterbalanced and pseudo-randomized before each session. The reward contingencies of the odors were reversed for each arm: the incorrect odor from the first arm was the correct odor on the second arm and vice versa.

Local field potentials (LFPs) were digitally isolated with a band-pass filter from 1\u2013400\u2009Hz. LFP and spike channels were globally referenced to a wire above the cerebellum, and spike channels were also locally referenced to a wire with low activity. Throughout the session, the rat\u2019s location was recorded via digital video and tracking software (CinePlex, Plexon,\u00a0Dallas,\u00a0TX) that monitored the motion of two LEDs mounted at the top of the rat hyperdrive. Tracking data was time stamped and synchronized with neural recording data, all of which was stored offline for later analysis. Only sessions in which the rats performed at greater than 75% accuracy were used in analysis. Electrophysiological features such as the presence of theta (4\u201312Hz) oscillations, sharp-wave ripples, and theta-modulated complex spiking activity were used to estimate tetrode locations. To confirm tetrode locations, rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isofluorane and small lesions were made by passing 40 \u00b5A of direct current through each wire. Final tetrode locations were visualized via a Nissl stain in 40 \u00b5m coronal sections.

Gamma co-occurs with theta and its amplitude is modulated by theta phase (e.g., Bragin et al., 1995).

It might be easier to evaluate these results if the proportions of the total cells entrained to different rhythms were also presented together (e.g., 70% of cells entrained to theta only, 5% entrained to beta only, 5% entrained to gamma only, 5% entrained to gamma and theta, 5% entrained to gamma and beta, 5% entrained to beta and theta, 5% entrained to all three rhythms), as opposed to only presenting the proportions separately for each rhythm class."

Related to this issue, when neurons fired in phase with more than one rhythm, where the rhythms coordinated? That is, were the cells triggered by power/power, power/phase, or phase/phase comodulation? Finding that different principal cells are best locked to different rhythms raises a fascinating neurocomputational question concerning the mechanisms by which individual and presumably neighboring cells could become phase locked to different rhythms.
