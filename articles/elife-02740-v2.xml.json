Despite recent progress in structure determination of these transporters, the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the work of substrate translocation remains undefined. Here, we have investigated the conformational cycle of BmrCD, a representative of the heterodimer family of ABC exporters that have an intrinsically impaired nucleotide binding site. We measured distances between pairs of spin labels monitoring the movement of the nucleotide binding (NBD) and transmembrane domains (TMD). The results expose previously unobserved structural intermediates of the NBDs arising from asymmetric configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of the TMD, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, is driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These findings provide direct evidence of divergence in the mechanism of ABC exporters."

Despite recent progress in structure determination of these transporters, the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the work of substrate translocation remains undefined. Here, we have investigated the conformational cycle of BmrCD, a representative of the heterodimer family of ABC exporters that have an intrinsically impaired nucleotide binding site. We measured distances between pairs of spin labels monitoring the movement of the nucleotide binding (NBD) and transmembrane domains (TMD). The results expose previously unobserved structural intermediates of the NBDs arising from asymmetric configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of the TMD, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, is driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These findings provide direct evidence of divergence in the mechanism of ABC exporters."

Mishra et al. found that those parts of the two proteins that bind to ATP can adopt a range of different shapes that had not been seen before. Moreover, the parts of the proteins that extend across the cell membrane face into the cell when the ATP binds, and switch to face out of the cell when the ATP is broken down. This movement of the proteins would allow toxic molecules inside the cell to enter the exporter, and then be pushed to the outside of the cell."

Mammalian ABC transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), are exclusively of the exporter class, play critical physiological roles and are associated with disease (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higgins and Linton, 2004</a>). Importers and exporters share a modular molecular architecture featuring two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs or ATP binding cassettes) that turnover ATP and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that are presumed to form a translocation pathway across the bilayer. The four modules of ABC transporters can be encoded by separate genes and assembled as homo- or hetero-dimers, or expressed as a single polypeptide chain (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higgins and Linton, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rees et al., 2009</a>)."

In contrast, the proposed structural mechanism of ABC exporters is less elaborate invoking two states captured by crystallography: Inward-facing devoid of substrates and/or nucleotides (referred to as apo) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aller et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jin et al., 2012</a>) and outward-facing with bound nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2007</a>).

Inward-facing structures of the bacterial homodimer MsbA (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2007</a>) and eukaryotic Pgp (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aller et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jin et al., 2012</a>) have inverted V-shapes wherein the two leaflets of the transporters are separated by a large chamber open to the cytoplasm and the bilayer. In these nucleotide and substrate-free structures, the two NBDs are disengaged and separated by 10\u201350 \u00c5. In contrast, nucleotide-bound, outward-facing structures of MsbA (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2007</a>) and its homolog Sav1866 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2007</a>) have the two NBDs in close contact, bringing together the ABC signature motif from one subunit and the Walker A and Walker B sequences from the other subunit to form the nucleotide binding sites (NBSs). Inward- and outward-facing exporter structures were interpreted to imply that transport entails cycles of association and dissociation of the NBDs powered by ATP binding and hydrolysis. In this model, substrate partitions into the large chamber cradled by the two TMDs and is pushed along to the outer membrane leaflet by ATP-induced alternating access of the chamber. However, central elements of this model are considered inconsistent with mechanistic studies, primarily of the mammalian ABC exporter Pgp, implying catalytic asymmetry between the two NBSs and constant contact between the NBDs during transport (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tombline and Senior, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Siarheyeva et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">George and Jones, 2012</a>).

The \u2018alternating site hydrolysis\u2019 model posits that the two NBSs turnover ATP in an alternating manner constantly holding an intact ATP molecule in one of the NBSs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tombline and Senior, 2005</a>). The conjecture that the large inward-facing cavity observed in the apo structures is required to accommodate the large substrates of exporters has also been challenged (<a href=\"#bib16\">George and Jones, 2012</a>) by the observation of smaller openings in the outward-facing conformations of MsbA and Sav1866 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2007</a>)."

Unlike MsbA, Sav1866 and Pgp, TM287/288 is a heterodimeric ABC transporter with non-canonical sequences in the Walker B and switch motifs of one subunit resulting in a catalytically impaired NBS. In the TM287/288 structure, the impaired NBS, also referred to as the degenerate NBS, is bridged by an AMP-PNP molecule while the intact NBS, referred to as the consensus NBS, is more open creating an asymmetric NBD interface. Despite the partially engaged NBDs, the TMDs still form a chamber open to partitioning of substrates from the cytoplasm but does not appear to be accessible from the bilayer (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hohl et al., 2012</a>). This structure is consistent with biochemical studies of bacterial ABC heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lubelski et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zutz et al., 2011</a>) that suggest catalytic asymmetry between the NBSs. However, while the TM287/288 structure provides a structural basis for asymmetric nucleotide binding, it does not elucidate the mechanistic role of such an intermediate in the transport cycle in the presence of substrate and under conditions of ATP turnover. Importantly, the broader question of how the mechanism of homodimers and heterodimers differ as a consequence of impairment of an NBS remains unanswered. In addition to their importance to understanding the fundamental mechanism of transport, addressing these questions provides insight into the role of catalytic asymmetry in mammalian ABC transporters such as CFTR and TAP1/2, which play fundamental physiological roles and have been directly associated with diseases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abele and Tamp\u00e9, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aleksandrov et al., 2007</a>)."

Similar to other ABC heterodimers, sequence modifications in the consensus motifs of the NBDs, including the replacement of the Walker B catalytic glutamate by an aspartate in BmrD, suggest that ATP turnover is impaired. <i>BmrC</i> and <i>BmrD</i> genes are upregulated in the response of <i>B. subtilis</i> to antibiotics exposure and BmrCD confers multidrug transport activity on inside-out <i>Escherichia coli</i> membrane vesicles (<a href=\"#bib51\">Torres et al., 2009</a>) and in reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dezi et al., 2013</a>).

The experimental design reconstructs the conformational dynamics of the transporter by comparing distance distributions obtained under turnover conditions with those measured in trapped catalytic intermediates. Our results reveal structural asymmetry at the NBSs presumably reflecting asymmetric binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase cycle proceeds through multiple conformations of the NBD dimer while the TMDs undergo an inward- to outward-facing transition powered exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These are distinct mechanistic steps compared to ABC homodimers where a two-state association/dissociation cycle of the NBD is tightly coupled to the transition of the TMD from inward- to outward-facing conformations with ATP binding providing the power stroke (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zou and Mchaourab, 2009</a>).

Three distinct conformations for apo, AMP-PNP-bound and the HES intermediates are deduced from the shifts in distance distributions at the NBSs for all the pairs. However, the shape of the distributions uncovers fundamental structural differences between consensus and degenerate NBS. Consistently, spin labels reporting on the consensus NBS have overlapping distributions in the AMP-PNP-bound and trapped HES intermediates whereas at the degenerate site the distributions are by and large distinct (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, compare panels A, B, and C with D, E, and F). The breadth of the AMP-PNP distribution at the consensus NBS demonstrates that ATP binding enables a range of conformations to be populated that includes the HES. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis is required to observe an HES population at the degenerate NBS as inferred from the predominantly distinct distributions in the presence of AMP-PNP and ADP-Vi. In the presence of excess ADP, the degenerate NBS has a predominantly ATP-bound like conformation while the consensus NBS has a significant population of apo-like conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Both NBSs disengage in the absence of nucleotides consistent with the relative distance and conformational flexibility observed at the NBD interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, black traces). Addition of the transport substrate Hoechst (<a href=\"#bib51\">Torres et al., 2009</a>) did not change the distance distributions of the AMP-PNP and ADP-Vi states (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Furthermore, the intracellular side of apo BmrCD appears to be more closed than that of apo MsbA consistent with TM287/288 structure and the homology model. For instance, the distance between the symmetry-related residues 103 in the MsbA homodimer (previous work <a href=\"#bib8\">Borbat et al., 2007</a> and see below) is outside the range of measurable distances by DEER, at least 10 \u00c5 longer than the distance measured at the equivalent BmrCD pair, 96/188."

Spin label pairs at the intracellular and extracellular sides have identical distance distributions in apo and AMP-PNP-bound (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, black and blue traces respectively). This finding suggests relative flexibility between the NBD and TMD that allows large independent movement of the former upon ATP binding. In contrast, when ATP is hydrolyzed and ADP subsequently trapped by the addition of Vi, we observed concomitant shifts in the average distance at the intra- and extracellular sides of the transporter. Coupled to the formation of the NBD closed dimer, ATP hydrolysis induces closing of the intracellular side and opening of the extracellular side consistent with an alternating access mechanism involving inward-facing and outward-facing conformations. Compared to MsbA (residue 103) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borbat et al., 2007</a>) the distance change at the intracellular side is of smaller magnitude (approximately 15 \u00c5 for BmrCD 96/188 vs 25 \u00c5 for MsbA 103) primarily due to a closer distance between the TMDs in the apo conformation of BmrCD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). More importantly, while conformational changes in MsbA are induced by the binding of AMP-PNP, the inward- to outward-facing transition in BmrCD requires ATP hydrolysis revealing a distinct power stroke between homodimers and heterodimers."

ATP hydrolysis is required to transition between these states whereas BmrCD bound to AMP-PNP- is in the inward-facing conformation, in agreement with the observations in detergent micelles described above (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Thus, not only is there a correspondence between conformational states in detergent micelles and lipid bilayers but also the power stroke is essentially identical. Remarkably, the transition between inward- and outward-facing conformations in nanodiscs shows a more stringent dependence on the presence of substrate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3 fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4</a>).

Following incubation with ATP in the presence and absence of the substrate Hoechst, distance distributions were compared at two time points, where the ATP concentration is calculated to remain above the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>. At the degenerate NBS, we observed predominantly two-component distance distributions that reflect two distinct transporter populations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). By comparing distance distributions for the same spin label pair in trapped intermediates and under turnover conditions, the two components are identified as arising from nucleotide-bound (ATP or ADP) and HES-like states. The population ratio of the two components shifts from the HES-like towards the nucleotide-bound state with little if any apo population observed at the two time points. In contrast, multicomponent distributions at the consensus NBS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) show, in addition to the HES-like and nucleotide-bound states, clear evidence of an apo-like population where the two NBDs are locally disengaged."

However, the differences in the population amplitude of these states reveal that the two NBSs do not have to concurrently be in the same catalytic intermediate. For example, while a significant population of the consensus NBS is in apo-like conformation, the degenerate NBS is predominantly in either the nucleotide-bound or HES-like conformations. Such an asymmetric disengagement of the signature and Walker A motifs at the consensus NBS, which requires their separation by more than 20\u201340 \u00c5, is not structurally compatible with an HES-like conformation at the degenerate NBS. Therefore, the distributions under turnover conditions imply the existence of a transporter intermediate wherein the degenerate NBS is ATP-bound while the consensus NBS assumes an apo-like conformation. Similarly, we can infer the presence of another state of the transporter wherein the degenerate NBS is in a HES-like state and the consensus NBS is in the ATP-bound conformation."

Pairs of spin labels were introduced in each MsbA protomer with the purpose of monitoring the two NBSs following the design principles described above for BmrCD. Because MsbA is a homodimer, this strategy introduces four spin labels in the functional unit related by six distances (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). If the NBD interface is twofold symmetric, three of these distances are unique (d1, d2, d3, in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Two distances relate labels at distinct sites: one is short range (d1) arising from pairs monitoring the NBS while the other represents symmetry-related sites that interact across the dimer interface and is considerably longer (d2). Therefore, in addition to considerations of ATPase activity (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and surface localization, the two sites, 350 and 471, were selected to maximize the differences between spin labels reporting on the NBS conformation vs those reporting the distance between symmetry-related spin labels in the dimer. These selection criteria simplify the interpretation of the distance distributions and allow for the identification of the components that arise from dipolar coupling between spin labels across the NBS. However, the projection of the spin labels relative to the C\u03b1 breaks the symmetry leading to distinct distances in the 350/350 and 471/471 pairs. This complication does not affect the interpretation of the short component which monitors the NBSs."

As expected, MsbA NBDs completely dissociate in the absence of nucleotides as evidenced by the absence of a short distance component that would be expected from the assembly of the signature motifs into a NBS. In contrast, this short distance component is present to the same extent in the AMP-PNP-bound and ADP-Vi intermediates supporting the previous conclusion that ATP binding is the power stroke of transport for MsbA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zou and Mchaourab, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

No other short distance component is detected as would be expected if the NBS were structurally asymmetric; although the detection of such asymmetry is limited by the intrinsic width of the distance distributions. Thus, we conclude that the two NBSs are structurally equivalent in the HES.

Modifications of the Walker B, signature and/or switch motifs sequences, which lead to selective catalytic impairment of one of the NBSs in a subclass of ABC exporters (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gao et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aleksandrov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Procko et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boncoeur et al., 2012</a>), are associated with fundamental differences in the conformational dynamics of the NBDs and in the power stroke of transport. In contrast to the ATP-induced association/dissociation cycle of NBDs in bacterial homodimers reported previously (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borbat et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zou et al., 2009</a>) and further confirmed here, the NBDs of heterodimers form structurally asymmetric dimers as a consequence of ATP binding and its subsequent hydrolysis. We uncovered conformations wherein the impaired NBS holds on to an ATP molecule while the consensus NBS disengages enabling product release and rebinding of ATP. Asymmetric NBD conformations were hypothesized from the elegant mechanistic analysis of Pgp by Senior et al. but were not directly detected (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tombline and Senior, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tombline et al., 2005</a>). We propose that the distinct mechanism of heterodimers requires a less efficient coupling between the NBD and TMD, a \u2018conformational leak\u2019, to enable NBD movement without transmission to the TMDs. This would require a tuning of the sequences and interactions of the IH1 and IH2 coupling loops and possibly the cytoplasmic extension of TMs, regions hypothesized to form the transmission interface between the NBDs and TMDs of ABC transporters (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hollenstein et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Oancea et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Loo et al., 2013</a>). There is a substantial impact of lipids on the coupling between the NBD and TMD. Transmission of the conformational changes to the TMD is more stringently dependent on the presence of substrate in lipid bilyaers. This finding is consistent with previous work revealing that lipids can shift the conformational preferences of ion-coupled transporters (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hanelt et al., 2013</a>)."

Unlike previous studies, which investigated exclusively stable intermediates (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borbat et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zou et al., 2009</a>), here the mechanistic implications of these intermediates were challenged under substrate and nucleotide conditions that mimic those of the cell. Another unique experimental design is the selective monitoring of individual NBSs rather than the NBD interface facilitated by the heterodimeric nature of BmrCD. NBS distance distributions capture the interconversion of the transporter between conformations corresponding to those observed under trapped conditions, thereby establishing the direct relevance of the trapped conformations to the substrate-coupled ATPase cycle. Furthermore, the observation of a steady state population of apo-like conformation of the consensus NBS, even in the presence of excess ATP, prompts us to conclude that disengagement of this NBS is required for ADP-Pi dissociation and subsequent binding of ATP, thereby establishing the mechanistic significance of a local apo-like conformation."

Distinguishing features of this model include the formation of structurally asymmetric conformations of the NBDs and the association of the transporter power stroke with ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of cellular ATP concentrations, BmrCD will have at least one ATP molecule bound, most likely at the degenerate NBS as evidenced by the fact that an apo-like conformation was nearly undetectable at this NBS in the presence of excess ATP. Such an ATP-bound resting state does not hinder substrate access to the putative binding chamber at the TMD interface, since ATP binding does not induce closure of the cytoplasmic side of BmrCD. ATP binding to the consensus NBS yields an intermediate with two ATP molecules bound (\u20181\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We refer to this conformation of the NBD dimer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) as a pre-hydrolysis intermediate reminiscent of the pre-hydrolysis complex observed in a crystal structure of the maltose transporter, MalK (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oldham and Chen, 2011</a>). In this conformation, the NBDs are engaged but the NBSs have not formed the canonical configuration and are therefore not catalytically competent. ATP turnover is initiated by fluctuations at the consensus NBS which enables transition to a hydrolysis-competent configuration (HES-like) as deduced from the overlapping distance distributions in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. This is a relatively minor population of the transporter which likely explains the relatively slow ATP turnover by BmrCD (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). ATP hydrolysis switches TMD accessibility thereby catalyzing the extrusion of the substrate. Turnover rates are stimulated if the substrate binds prior to hydrolysis but there is a considerable basal consumption of ATP (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While there is evidence of ATP turnover by impaired NBSs, consideration of the reaction mechanism as well as previous biochemical studies of ABC heterodimers support an intrinsically slower rate at the degenerate NBS (<a href=\"#bib38\">Procko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zutz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boncoeur et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, ADP and Pi are released from the consensus site prior to hydrolysis at the degenerate site enabling multiple rounds of asymmetric ATP hydrolysis without the complete disengagement of the NBDs to an apo conformation."

Whether ATP hydrolysis at the degenerate NBS could occur prior or concomitant with release of ADP and Pi from the consensus NBS cannot be conclusively addressed from our data. However, the negligible population of apo-like degenerate NBS and the fact that ADP-bound NBDs form a partially engaged dimer argue against significant population of an apo state of the transporter where the two NBDs are separated by more than 50 \u00c5. Thus, this \u2018global\u2019 apo state (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) appears not to be mechanistically relevant in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of ABC heterodimers. We propose that ADP-Pi release, as a consequence of infrequent hydrolysis at the degenerate site, occurs while ATP is bound at the consensus NBS."

We conclude from the comparative analysis of BmrCD and MsbA conformational cycles that the controversy regarding NBD disengagement vs constant contact (<a href=\"#bib16\">George and Jones, 2012</a>) is a consequence of extrapolation of models between mechanistically distinct classes of ABC exporters."

While all ABC transporters derive energy from an ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle, fundamental differences exist in the regulation of ATP turnover by catalytic elements and/or structural intermediates as evidenced here. Although it was anticipated that the inward- to outward-facing transition of ABC exporters would follow the structural mechanics defined by the structures of MsbA (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2007</a>), we show in this work that coupling of the TMD transition to the ATPase cycle is not identical between subclasses of exporters. Evidence of more variation in the coupling mechanism has emerged recently from a structure of a human ABC homodimer where the NBSs are disengaged even in the presence of AMP-PNP (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shintre et al., 2013</a>). Finally, if indeed TMD conformational changes require hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule in heterodimers, it raises the conundrum of why two molecules are hydrolyzed in ABC homodimers to achieve what would appear to be similar type of mechanical work. Addressing these questions is the next frontier in understanding the mechanism of ABC exporters."

In order to correctly map the consensus and degenerate nucleotide-binding sites, TMD287 was chosen as the template for BmrC and TMD288 as a template for BmrD. The alignment between BmrC and TM287 was directly generated by pairwise Blastp (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, due to low sequence identity, the homology of the first \u223c150 amino acids of BmrD could not be determined through direct pairwise alignment. The BmrD/TM288 alignment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) was instead obtained by manually optimizing a multiple alignment involving sequences of BmrC, BmrD, TM287, TM288, and SAV1866 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which was generated using Clustal-\u03a9 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sievers et al., 2011</a>). In the multiple alignment, the N-terminal region of BmrD (Met1-Leu48) is aligned to the elbow helix and the TM1 of other ABC transporters, followed by a heterologous insertion of \u223c100 residues. Assuming the aligned sequence within a transmembrane helix is ungapped, the BmrD alignment near the heterologous insertion was then manually optimized by ungapped extension from the aligned sequence immediately C-terminal to the inserted region, which covers most of the TM2 of TM288. Similarly, the alignment of BmrD/TM288 near the TM5 (Asn333-Gly365 of BmrD) was also manually optimized due to its lower local sequence identity and the presence of inserted residues in the transmembrane region of the BmrD sequence. The inserted region of BmrD (Cys49\u2013Ile146) was not modeled due to the lack of homologous sequence in any protein structure. The final sequence alignment used for homology modeling is shown in (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To maintain the structural stability and the global conformation during the refinement of the initial homology model, C\u03b1 atoms in ungapped aligned regions (Tyr15-Asp46, Leu57-Gly84, Leu93-Asp124, Leu137-Leu316, Gly335-Gln573 of BmrC; and Met1-Ile47, Phe162-Arg328, Ser368-Glu411, Arg429-Ala673 of BmrD) were excluded from the refinement, that is, their positions remain fixed in the final model."

The motivation for developing this software was to carry out global analysis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beechem, 1992</a>) of the DEER decays obtained under different conditions for the same spin label pair. The distance distribution is assumed to consist of a sum of Gaussians, the number of which is determined based on a statistical criterion. The optimal number of Gaussian components and the center, width and amplitude of each component were allowed to vary between conditions. The slope of the background was assumed to be uniform across the data set but was fit rather than set by the user. Care was taken to ensure that the concentration of samples for the same spin label pair were identical within experimental error. The statistical significance between fits with increasing number of Gaussian distributions was determined using an F test. The root-mean squared difference between the data and fit was minimized using the trust-region-reflective algorithm implemented in the MATLAB routine \u2018lsqnonlin\u2019. We compared results from this analysis to those obtained by using the package DeerAnalysis 2011 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jeschke et al., 2006</a>) for data obtained in the trapped conditions (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2 fig3\">Figures 1\u20133</a>) and found that the resulting distributions are very similar. The main advantage of this approach is the accurate determination of changes in the amplitude of distance components under turnover conditions where a subjective determination of the background in DeerAnalysis can distort these changes.
