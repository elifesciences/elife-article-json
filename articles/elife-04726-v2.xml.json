Despite being central for its function, the molecular basis of SCRIB recruitment and stabilization at the cell cortex is poorly understood. Here we show that SCRIB binds directly to the CH1 domain of \u03b2 spectrins, a molecular scaffold that contributes to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and connects it to the plasma membrane. We have identified a short evolutionary conserved peptide motif named SADH motif (SCRIB ABLIMs DMTN Homology) which is necessary and sufficient to mediate protein interaction with \u03b2 spectrins. The SADH domains contribute to SCRIB dynamics at the cell cortex and SCRIB polarity function. Furthermore, mutations in SCRIB SADH domains associated with spina bifida and cancer impact the stability of SCRIB at the plasma membrane, suggesting that SADH domain alterations may participate in human pathology."

Scribble is one such multi-tasking protein that is found in a diverse range of species, including fruit flies and humans. Although Scribble commonly helps to ensure that the components of a cell are in their correct locations, its exact roles vary between species. To perform its role well, Scribble itself must localize to the cell cortex\u2014the inside surface of the cell membrane\u2014at the regions where cells connect to one another. How this localization occurs is not fully understood; and defects in the human form of Scribble have been linked to diseases including spina bifida and cancer."

These motifs can bind to proteins called beta spectrins, which connect the cell's outer membrane to the scaffolding-like structure inside the cell that provides support."

Nine independent clones encoding \u03b22-spectrin (<i>SPTBN1</i> gene) and seven independent clones encoding \u03b23-spectrin (<i>SPTBN2</i> gene) were recovered (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The overlapping sequences of these clones map to the calponin homology one (CH1) domain of spectrins. GST-SCRIB proteins including the C-terminal fragment (1223\u20131630aa) or the C1 fragment (1223\u20131424aa) bound endogenous \u03b22 spectrin from cell extracts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>).

No homology between the SADH motif sequences and the previously characterized 10 kDa spectrin-actin-binding domain of the band 4.1 family of proteins could be detected (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gimm et al., 2002</a>)."

We determined the Cortical Localisation Index (CLI, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), defined as the ratio between the mean GFP fluorescence intensity in the cortical region and the mean fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm of the cell. A CLI superior to one indicates that GFP is enriched at the cell cortex while a CLI equal to one shows that the GFP is equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the cortex. GFP alone had a CLI around 1 (0.9) whereas a control GFP-CAAX construct which essentially localized at the cell membrane had a CLI of 1.75. Short and long WT SCRIB (\u2212/+ exon36) constructs showed a strong cortical accumulation (CLI = 1.8 and 2 respectively). In contrast the P305L SCRIB mutant that carries a mutation in the N-terminal LRR region which impedes SCRIB plasma membrane localization (<a href=\"#bib19\">Legouis et al., 2003</a>) was mainly cytosolic (CLI = 1). SCRIB SADH1+2 mutant showed a statistically weaker cortical recruitment (CLI = 1.4) than the WT protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) suggesting that SADH mutations may influence SCRIB recruitment and/or stabilization at the membrane. We assessed SCRIB WT and SADH mutant protein dynamics at the membrane by monitoring FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) at cell\u2013cell contact in confluent transiently transfected 16HBE cells. A membrane associated GFP-CAAX showed a fast recovery rate (<i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 10 s) and the vast majority of the protein was available for exchange (mobile fraction of 97%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,D</a>). In contrast GFP-WT SCRIB exchanged less rapidly (<i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 26 s) and had a smaller mobile fraction (60%). SCRIB SADH12 mutant displayed a significantly faster exchange (<i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 18 s) than the WT SCRIB protein with 82% of the protein pool available for exchange (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,D</a>).

Almost 10% of these mutations (6/61) fall within the <i>SCRIB</i> SADH motifs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), which account for less than 5% of <i>SCRIB</i> sequence (75/1657aa). One of the mutations (R1322W) identified in a lung cancer patient directly impacts the core SADH2 consensus motif. In contrast to GST-SADH2 WT sequence, GST-SADH2 R1322W mutant did not bind to the spectrin GFP-CH1 domain pointing to the R1322W mutation as a spectrin binding loss of function mutation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). <i>SCRIB</i> mutations have also been described in congenital diseases (<a href=\"#bib30\">Robinson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lei et al., 2013</a>). In particular, six SCRIB mutations have been recently described in <i>spina bifida</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lei et al., 2013</a>) and two of those six fall within the SADH2 motif sequence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The A1315T mutation did not affect the ability of a GST-SADH2 to bind to GFP spectrin. In contrast the P1332L mutation noticeably increased GST-SADH2 affinity for GFP spectrin in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D,E</a>). These mutations did not impact significantly SCRIB overall recruitment to the cellular cortex (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, FRAP experiments showed that GFP R1322W and GFP P1332L SCRIB mutants exchanged more rapidly than the GFP WT SCRIB at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Surprisingly, P1332L mutation also increased SCRIB exchange at the plasma membrane, suggesting that, in the context of the SCRIB full length molecule, the P1332L mutation prevents rather than increases spectrin binding. We cannot however exclude the possibility that this mutation also affects other yet-unidentified function of the SADH domain. Altogether these observations indicate that mutations of the SADH motifs may participate in human pathology by impacting the stability of SCRIB at the cell cortex."

Nevertheless it is clear that some phenotypic differences exist between <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse <i>Scrib</i> mutant models like the severity of apico-basal epithelium polarity phenotype, and that the <i>scribble/SCRIB</i> genes have undergone some intra-phylum specific adaptation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bilder et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Murdoch et al., 2003</a>). No phylum specific SCRIB interacting partner has been characterized so far that could account for the differences observed between invertebrates and vertebrates SCRIB function. The vertebrate-specific spectrin binding motifs SADH located inside SCRIB divergent C-terminal region appears to be a good candidate to bear such role."

A 9 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> square region of interest to be bleached was defined for the FRAP and maximum laser power at 488 nm for one iteration was used to bleach signals. After bleaching, images were taken within the same focal plane at regular intervals (between 3 and 10 s) to monitor fluorescence recovery. After background subtraction the recovery of the GFP signal was measured using ImageJ and fitted using the Prism software and the equation Y<sub>(t)</sub> = (Y<sub>max</sub> \u2212 Y<sub>min</sub>) (1 \u2212 e<sup>2kt</sup>) \u2212 Y<sub>min</sub> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Weisswange et al., 2009</a>), where Y(t) is the intensity of fluorescence at time t, Y<sub>max</sub> and Y<sub>min</sub> are respectively the maximum and minimum intensities of fluorescence post-bleaching and k is the rate constant of recovery.

Could the binding of SADH motifs with Spectrins contribute to a cellular function of Scrib other than cell polarity?</i> Spina bifida <i>does not seem to be caused by cell polarity defects/tissue overgrowth, but rather by defects in neural tube development</i>."

We can only speculate that the P1332L mutation increases spectrin binding ability at the SADH2 25aa peptide level, as observed in our binding assay but has the opposite effect in the context of the full length SCRIB molecule. This hypothesis is difficult to test as we cannot produce full length SCRIB protein in vitro (180 kDa) to perform discriminating binding affinity measurement between WT and mutant SCRIB sequences. As the reviewer suggests, the SADH motifs may also contribute to a SCRIB function different than cell polarity, more connected to neural tube development. However SCRIB is not the only polarity gene found mutated in <i>spina bifida</i> (CELSR1, FZD6 and PRICKLE1 and 2; Juriloff and Harris, 2012), suggesting that this pathology is connected to polarity defect. The effects of the P1332L mutation are now further discussed in the revised manuscript."

Structural studies have shown that the CH1-CH2 tandem domains can switch between an open conformation where the CH1 domain binds to F-actinrobustly and a close conformation in which the CH1 and CH2 domains are closely apposed and display a weak F-actin affinity (Sjoblom, Ylanne et al., 2008; Galkin, Orlova et al., 2010). The GFP tagged \u03b22 spectrin CH1-CH2 domain in HeLa cells display poor F-actin colocalization compared to GFP CH1 domain alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), in agreement with the idea that the \u03b22 spectrin CH1-CH2 tandem domain adopt a close conformation when expressed in cells. Furthermore we show that SCRIB C1 region pulls down the \u03b22 spectrin CH1 domain together with actin, suggesting that SCRIB binds to the CH1 domain in an open conformation and does not compete with actin binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

As previously described (Ivanov, Young, 2010) SCRIB-depleted cells show a significant delay in tight junction reassembly inCaco-2 cells. In these conditions, WT SCRIB partially rescues the phenotype while the SADH mutant does not (new <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). This observation suggests that SADH domains are involved in cell junction formation."
