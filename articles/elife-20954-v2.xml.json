This complex formation can modulate their folding, activity as well as substrate selectivity. Non-disruptive methods avoiding critical steps, such as membrane disintegration, transfer into artificial environments or chemical modifications are therefore essential to analyze molecular mechanisms of native membrane protein assemblies. The combination of cell-free synthetic biology, nanodisc-technology and non-covalent mass spectrometry provides excellent synergies for the analysis of membrane protein oligomerization within defined membranes. We exemplify our strategy by oligomeric state characterization of various membrane proteins including ion channels, transporters and membrane-integrated enzymes assembling up to hexameric complexes. We further indicate a lipid-dependent dimer formation of MraY translocase correlating with the enzymatic activity. The detergent-free synthesis of membrane protein/nanodisc samples and the analysis by LILBID mass spectrometry provide a versatile platform for the analysis of membrane proteins in a native environment."

This complex formation can modulate their folding, activity as well as substrate selectivity. Non-disruptive methods avoiding critical steps, such as membrane disintegration, transfer into artificial environments or chemical modifications are therefore essential to analyze molecular mechanisms of native membrane protein assemblies. The combination of cell-free synthetic biology, nanodisc-technology and non-covalent mass spectrometry provides excellent synergies for the analysis of membrane protein oligomerization within defined membranes. We exemplify our strategy by oligomeric state characterization of various membrane proteins including ion channels, transporters and membrane-integrated enzymes assembling up to hexameric complexes. We further indicate a lipid-dependent dimer formation of MraY translocase correlating with the enzymatic activity. The detergent-free synthesis of membrane protein/nanodisc samples and the analysis by LILBID mass spectrometry provide a versatile platform for the analysis of membrane proteins in a native environment."

The majority of membrane proteins is organized in higher order complexes and oligomeric assembly is frequently used to modulate protein function or it is even essential for activity. Unfortunately, the analysis of membrane protein oligomerization <i>in vivo</i> is challenging due to the high complexity of natural membranes. Furthermore, classical <i>in vitro</i> studies need to implement disruption of membranes and subsequent solubilization of the membrane proteins into detergents (<a href=\"#bib41\">Seddon et al., 2004</a>). This relatively harsh treatment can irreversibly modify the stoichiometry or even disrupt and unfold native membrane protein complexes. In addition, the presence and composition of the lipid environment can influence folding, proper adoption of quaternary structures and the assembly of heteromeric complexes. Lipids can even be components of membrane protein structures and act as modulators of membrane protein function (<a href=\"#bib45\">van Dalen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hunte and Richers, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Laganowsky et al., 2014</a>). In this respect, the recently developed nanodisc technology, based on well-defined disc-shaped bilayer patches stabilized by two copies of a membrane scaffold protein, provides excellent and well-defined alternative lipid environments for membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayburt and Sligar, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The utilization of nanodiscs is extremely beneficial as they are completely soluble, enabling the application of numerous biophysical and biochemical techniques for the characterization of membrane proteins in a native bilayer environment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Denisov and Sligar, 2016</a>). Furthermore, in order to avoid potentially critical detergent contacts of membrane proteins, we have developed a detergent-free strategy for the co-translational insertion of membrane proteins into preformed empty nanodiscs by cell-free (CF) expression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Roos et al., 2014</a>). For example, in the case of the extremely detergent-sensitive <i>E. coli</i> MraY translocase, a membrane-integrated enzyme essential for lipid I biosynthesis, this lipid-based CF expression (L-CF) was the only way to obtain functionally folded protein (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Henrich et al., 2016</a>). In addition, CF expression enables the production of toxic or otherwise difficult membrane proteins and provides numerous options for their efficient labeling (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reckel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Henrich et al., 2015b</a>)."

However, oligomeric states of proteins can be extremely sensitive toward covalent modifications or environmental parameters (<a href=\"#bib34\">Politi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maciejko et al., 2015</a>). Recently developed non-covalent mass spectrometry (MS) using mild ionization techniques such as electrospray-ionization (ESI) or laser-induced-liquid-bead-ion-desorption (LILBID) thus became key technologies for the analysis of soluble proteins as well as of detergent solubilized membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barrera and Robinson, 2011</a>). Sample transfer from solution to gas phase is most critical for non-covalent MS and requires carefully adjusted settings to maintain intact membrane protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barrera et al., 2008</a>). LILBID-MS as a technique complementary to ESI-MS emerged as new tool to investigate membrane proteins in native-like environments, especially based on its wide tolerance to additives needed for membrane protein solubilization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morgner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vonck et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maciejko et al., 2015</a>)."

However, this procedure still includes the risk of complex disintegration by the classical detergent treatment of the protein samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). By combining cell-free synthetic biology (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hodgman and Jewett, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Smith et al., 2014</a>), nanodiscs and LILBID-MS, we have established a new platform avoiding any detergent contacts and enabling the analysis of non-modified membrane proteins in their initial expression environment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). In addition, the created synergies streamline the process of membrane protein complex analysis by reducing the workflow to three basic steps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). The platform is suitable for a wide range of applications as it extends the analysis of challenging membrane proteins (i) that cannot be synthesized in vivo, (ii) that are sensitive to detergents, (iii) that do not tolerate covalent modifications or (iv) that require stable isotope labeling for better resolution."

When the LILBID laser, desorbing the sample droplets, was tuned to a low laser power of 10 mJ, signals were revealed corresponding to intact nanodiscs comprising two copies of the scaffold protein and roughly 200 DPPC lipids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). However, spectra remain broad and not well resolved and are not suitable for detailed assignments. Nevertheless, single lipids could be resolved by tuning the laser power to 23 mJ causing the disintegration of the nanodiscs. Detected signals correspond to scaffold proteins with a few remaining lipid molecules. A complete overview of all analyzed empty nanodiscs is shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. The homogeneity of the analyzed nanodiscs was controlled by size exclusion chromatography (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1b</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2b</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">3b</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) and exemplarily by negative stain electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>)."

To investigate the influence of different nanodisc features on the obtained mass spectra, we scanned various scaffold proteins and lipids. Switching from MSP1D1\u0394H5 over MSP1 to the larger MSP1E3D1 scaffold protein coincides with an increase from six to up to eleven attached DMPG molecules (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Elongation of the alkyl chain with unsaturated alkyl groups led to further increased numbers of attached lipids with 15 or 20 for POPG and DOPG, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In contrast to the chain length, the variation of the lipid head groups (from DOPG to DOPS or DOPC) did not modulate lipid attachments drastically (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Notably, the utilization of DOPE lipids leads to the formation of highly heterogeneous nanodiscs (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3a,b</a>). This could be caused by the intrinsic tendency of PE lipids to form non-bilayer phases with higher curvature (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gruner, 1985</a>), which possibly prevents the formation of proper nanodiscs. Moreover, as shown for the multi-drug transporter EmrE, non-bilayer lipids can significantly decrease reconstitution and activity of membrane proteins in liposomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Curnow et al., 2004</a>). Due to these possible negative effects on disc stability, nanodiscs reconstituted with DOPE were excluded from further studies."

In case of DMPG:cardiolipin mixtures, the mass difference between the two lipids was sufficient to clearly distinguish and count the scaffold-bound cardiolipin and DMPG molecules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). It appears therefore feasible to tune the complexity of resulting mass spectra via specific nanodisc selection as well as to identify lipids staying attached to proteins within the sample. In general, spectra of nanodiscs composed out of lipids with shorter chain length lead to better resolved spectra due to the decreased number of attached lipid molecules. This will be especially important the more complicated the spectra of membrane protein/nanodiscs complexes are. Therefore, nanodiscs containing the short-chain lipids DMPG and DMPC were chosen for the following studies of membrane protein/nanodiscs complexes."

Mild laser conditions revealed only tetrameric complexes for KcsA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>), but a variety of oligomeric states for other proteins such as PR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). A possible explanation could be laser-induced dissociation of protein complexes, with the degree of dissociation depending on the particular complex stability. Detection of several oligomeric forms could also reflect a natural variation in complex formation. PR is folded and active under numerous conditions such as pentamers or hexamers, and its characteristic photocycle is observed even in monomeric conformation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reckel et al., 2011</a>). However, we have seen that, if laser dissociation occurs, the scaffold proteins are among the first proteins to leave the disc (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), giving rise to\u00a0signals representing complexes with only one or no scaffold proteins. As the dominating species of the heterogeneous distribution of PR oligomerization states under mild laser conditions all include both scaffold proteins we can conclude that the detected species represent complexes in solution, meaning that PR is present in different oligomeric states. Under high laser intensities PR oligomers without scaffold proteins are released and can be detected as well up to hexamers, indicating that the PR proteins indeed form complexes and are not present as individual entities in the nanodiscs."

Protein synthesized in the presence of the detergents DH7PC and GDN, previously identified to support the folding and stability of PR, was mostly present in monomeric conformation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). This observation is in agreement with previous structural studies with solution NMR by using identical sample preparations and showing monomeric PR (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reckel et al., 2011</a>). In contrast to the utilization of different detergents that results in different oligomer distributions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reckel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maciejko et al., 2015</a>), the variation of the lipid within the nanodiscs bilayer does not change the oligomerization behavior of cell-free produced PR (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). In the case of PR lipids seem to support the formation of higher oligomer complexes but PR does not discriminate between different lipid species. Due to the increased number of attached lipids for other lipid species as discussed before for empty nanodiscs the peaks get broader and less resolved, but the overall peak pattern stays the same indicating a comparable oligomeric composition (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>)."

The presented strategy is therefore complementary to established techniques as it allows a completely detergent-free process suitable also for detergent-sensitive membrane proteins. Moreover, our platform provides valuable synergies by combining (i) fast and efficient production of even toxic or specifically labeled membrane proteins enabled by cell-free expression, (ii) defined, stable membrane environments contributed by nanodiscs and (iii) sensitive and tunable particle detection facilitated by LILBID-MS. This strategy is, furthermore, a fast and straightforward process and does not depend on chemical protein modifications."

Labeling of the target protein with stable isotopes can address this problem as demonstrated for KcsA or hHv1-VSD. The sample production by cell-free expression is here highly advantageous, as the complete control over low-molecular-weight compounds in cell-free systems allows efficient labeling of synthesized proteins in any amino acid combination (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reckel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sobhanifar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">LaGuerre et al., 2015</a>). Switching to a different scaffold protein upon nanodiscs preparation could be an alternative option to improve spectral resolution as demonstrated for LspA. In general, even complicated LILBID-MS spectra are comparably straight forward to analyze. Despite the complexity caused by numerous oligomeric states of the target protein in addition to its combinations with different numbers of the scaffold protein, within LILBID-spectra every species is only present with a few charge states (<a href=\"#bib30\">Morgner et al., 2006</a>). In our nanodiscs spectra mainly the singly charged species are observed."

Elevated laser intensity modulates the LILBID process resulting into partly disintegrated nanodisc structures. This is presumably caused during the explosive expansion of the sample droplet after laser irradiation. Lipids are lost most likely due to deformation and subsequent rupture of the flat disc-shaped membrane. However, the mild ionization conditions of LILBID-MS are capable of preserving at least partly the initial membrane protein complex. The absence of scaffold proteins and lipids, furthermore, improves spectral resolution and helps to identify the intact as well as partly dissociated protein complexes. This is especially effective if the scaffold size is largely compared to the protein complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>)."

Complexes indicating an artificial stoichiometry different from the expected oligomeric state could never be found for any tested protein. The highest detected oligomeric state always corresponded to the previously determined native state of the target. The results, furthermore, indicate that the implemented L-CF expression of membrane proteins results into the assembly of native complexes. Therefore, the strategy allows to rapidly determine the oligomeric state of a protein within the nanodiscs in context of a membrane with defined lipid composition, giving important insights for the understanding of functional dynamics. Lipid-dependent oligomerization is a so far rarely observed regulatory mechanism of membrane proteins. The reported study on the <i>E.coli</i> MraY translocase is one of the first examples showing such a lipid-triggered dimerization. Notably, even close homologues such as <i>B.\u00a0subtilis</i> can significantly differ in their oligomeric assembly mechanism and the LILBID-MS observations nicely match with previous reports on MraYs functional activity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Henrich et al., 2016</a>)."

Nanodiscs were formed by the dialysis of a mixture of MSPs and lipids in a defined protein to lipid ratio as described previously (<a href=\"#bib38\">Roos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Henrich et al., 2016</a>).

In brief, purified MSP and the desired lipids were mixed at the defined ratios, combined with 0.1% DPC and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. For the nanodiscs formation, these mixtures were applied to dialysis bags with a MWCO of 12\u201314 kDa or Slide-A-Lyzer devices with a MWCO of 10 kDa and dialyzed against 5 l DF-buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) for\u00a0~16 hr at room temperature.

The residual four amino acids namely asparagine (<sup>15</sup>N labeled), cysteine (unlabeled), glutamine (<sup>15</sup>N labeled) and tryptophan (<sup>15</sup>N labeled), which are not included in the algal mixture, were added to this mix to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. 55 \u00b5l of reaction mixture was applied to Mini-CECF containers that were placed in the cavities of a 24-well cell-culture plate holding 825 \u00b5l of feeding mixture.

The droplets are transferred to high vacuum and irradiated by an IR laser operating at 2.94 \u00b5m, a vibrational absorption wavelength of water. The laser is a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, pumping an optical parametric oscillator, converting the wavelength to 2.94 \u00b5m. Laser pulse length is 6 ns, and the pulse energy output is between 9.5\u00a0and\u00a023 mJ. LILBID settings have previously been published in detail (<a href=\"#bib30\">Morgner et al., 2006</a>). Laser irradiation leads to an explosive expansion of the sample droplet and ions are released which were accelerated by a pulsed electric field and analyzed by a homebuilt reflectron-time-of-flight (TOF) setup. Ion acceleration is based on a Wiley-McLaren type ion source with a delayed acceleration pulse of 370 \u00b5s and an overall acceleration of 6.6 kV, working at 10<sup>\u22125</sup> mbar."

Previous reports showed the ESI-MS analysis of comparable samples prepared by the classical post-translational mechanism and corresponding references have been cited (see Introduction, third paragraph). However, the stoichiometry of membrane protein assemblies could be affected by the rigid membrane extraction and detergent solubilization process used for the \u201cclassical\u201d strategy. One discussed example is proteorhodopsin, which is monomeric in the particular detergent DH7PC but multimeric in lipid environments (see new <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, many membrane proteins are hard to synthesize in traditional cell-based expression systems or denature upon membrane extraction or contact with detergents. One shown example is <i>E. coli</i> MraY, which was completely inactive and aggregated in presence of detergents. This sample cannot be prepared by the classical technique. Therefore, cell-free expression largely extends the portfolio of membrane protein complexes that can be analyzed by LILBID-MS or similar techniques, it removes uncertainties and risks due to the necessary detergent treatment with classical protocols and it significantly accelerates and streamlines the overall sample preparation process concomitant with enabling numerous labelling and sample refinement opportunities (see Introduction, third paragraph)."

The nanodisc complexes may differ in the amount of proteins they carry, but always have two scaffold proteins. A key point of our platform is that we can probe the tightness of protein interactions by tuning the laser power of LILBID-MS (see subsection \u201cOligomer formation of proteorhodopsin (PR) in nanodiscs\u201d, second paragraph). So, weak non-specific interactions, e.g. in between membrane proteins and the scaffold proteins or in between two different membrane protein complexes inside one nanodisc, will dissociate first at already low laser power. \u201cReal\u201d membrane protein complexes having a tight and specific interface will only disrupt at higher laser power. Tuning the disruption of the membrane protein/nanodisc complexes leads then to gradually loss of integrated membrane proteins as well as of scaffold proteins (see new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). Spectra taken at lower laser power still reveal the integrated membrane proteins together with both scaffold proteins and thus could indicate potential sample heterogeneity, e.g. by multiple integration of monomeric or dimeric proteins. However, spectra taken at higher laser power, and this was the routine measurement condition in the manuscript, show the dissociation of the sample into complexes still remaining one or two scaffold proteins, but also gave signals of the free membrane proteins. The maximum stoichiometry of these free protein complexes, which have already lost the non-specific interaction to both scaffold proteins, therewith reflect the highest oligomeric stoichiometry of the particular membrane protein (see the aforementioned paragraph). We speculate, and this is supported by the results obtained with all six analyzed membrane proteins, that potential non-specific interaction in between multiple inserted proteins within one nanodisc membrane would not stay together after applying laser power conditions that already result into loss of both scaffold proteins."

Whether oligomeric complexes re-assemble upon the classical reconstitution procedure into membranes cannot be predicted. Our strategy eliminates the solubilization step and the proteins are directly analyzed in the initial membrane, in which they have been co-translationally inserted (see Introduction, first paragraph and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

However, this example shows that functional assays alone must not be a proof of native conformation (see also Laguerre et al. 2016, which has been included now). The direct co-translational insertion of proteorhodopsin into nanodisc membranes results into the native multimeric complexes and eliminates tedious screening of detergents supporting multimer formation by photocycle kinetics. With the second example of <i>E. coli</i> MraY, we have previously shown that contact with detergent completely inactivates the protein (see corresponding citation Ma et al. 2011). The established strategy of detergent-free production with nanodiscs is therefore the only way to isolate this protein for in vitro characterization."

The largest complex in the spectra thus represents the highest stably incorporated oligomerization state and the biologically relevant complex in the membrane. The partially dissociated species under higher laser conditions originate from dissociation and appear with no or one scaffold protein as well. In order to support this assumption, we have analyzed several well-studied model proteins having different oligomeric forms such as proteorhodopsin (hexamer), KcsA (tetramer), EmrE (dimer) and LspA (monomer). In all cases, the detected highest oligomeric form exactly matches with the expected complex. Therefore, we think that our strategy is indeed suitable to analyze the biological relevant complexes in its native stoichiometry. However, for the dissociated lower order complexes, it cannot be ruled out that some of them may already exist in addition within the membrane as well. These would be observable as lower smaller complex with two scaffold proteins under low laser conditions.
