This hyperactivity is caused, at least in part, by decreased Kv7.2/3 (KCNQ2/3) potassium currents. However, the biophysical mechanisms underlying resilience to tinnitus, which is observed in noise-exposed mice that do not develop tinnitus (non-tinnitus mice), remain unknown. Our results show that noise exposure induces, on average, a reduction in KCNQ2/3 channel activity in fusiform cells in noise-exposed mice by 4 days after exposure. Tinnitus is developed in mice that do not compensate for this reduction within the next 3 days. Resilience to tinnitus is developed in mice that show a re-emergence of KCNQ2/3 channel activity and a reduction in HCN channel activity. Our results highlight KCNQ2/3 and HCN channels as potential targets for designing novel therapeutics that may promote resilience to tinnitus."

Previous work by the same group revealed that in mice with tinnitus a group of neurons in the brainstem called \u2018fusiform cells\u2019 are overly active. These cells receive direct input from the ear, and their hyperactivity is largely due to ion channels called KCNQ2/3 channels being less active. These channels allow for potassium ions to flow across the membrane and thereby control the activity of fusiform cells."

This recovery triggers a reduction in the activity of another type of ion channel, known as the HCN channel. The combined flexibility of KCNQ and HCN channels prevents tinnitus-associated hyperactivity in the fusiform cells."

Although the development of tinnitus is strongly correlated with acoustic trauma and noise-induced hearing loss, the absence of tinnitus after exposure to loud sounds\u2014resilience to tinnitus\u2014has been observed in a significant percentage of the population both in humans and in animal models (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yankaskas, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zeng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Many studies have investigated the plasticity mechanisms underlying susceptibility to tinnitus; however, much less is known about the resilience mechanisms. Elucidating the resilience mechanisms could be vital for both developing pharmacological interventions to prevent and treat tinnitus, and understanding the mechanisms that differentiate pathogenic plasticity that leads to tinnitus from homeostatic plasticity that prevents the induction of tinnitus."

Namely, although all noise-exposed animals show similar shifts in their hearing thresholds, only a portion of them display DCN hyperactivity and develop tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib45\">Longenecker and Galazyuk, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Koehler and Shore, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Longenecker et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, fusiform cell hyperactivity in tinnitus mice is associated with reduced KCNQ2/3 currents at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, due to a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of KCNQ2/3 channel opening (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). This reduction, along with decreased synaptic inhibition and increased synaptic excitation, leads to DCN hyperactivity (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Middleton et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pilati et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zeng et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, non-tinnitus mice do not show fusiform cell hyperactivity after sound exposure and express normal levels of KCNQ2/3 currents (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Nonetheless, knowledge of the biophysical mechanisms associated with resilience to tinnitus is still in its infancy."

We evaluated fusiform cell intrinsic excitability in control, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice. We then extended this analysis by pharmacologically and biophysically isolating the ion channels whose noise-induced plasticity was associated with fusiform cell spontaneous firing rates and tinnitus or non-tinnitus behavior. Finally, we manipulated channel activity in vivo and tested the effects of these manipulations on the induction of tinnitus. Our results highlight the importance of KCNQ2/3 and HCN channels in the resilience to tinnitus and illuminate therapeutic paths that may enhance resilience for tinnitus prevention."

According to this model, behavioral evidence of tinnitus is evaluated based on the inability of tinnitus mice to detect a silent sound gap in a continuous background sound, because their tinnitus \u2018fills in the gap\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib69\">Turner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Longenecker and Galazyuk, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>, but see <a href=\"#bib29\">Hickox and Liberman, 2014</a> and \u2018Discussion\u2019). When a silent gap is introduced in a constant background sound before a startle stimulus (gap trial), normal mice show reduced startle amplitude compared to their response to a startle stimulus preceded by the same background sound but without any gap (no-gap trial; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> top left, diagram showing gap and no-gap trials; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> top middle, gray and black, representative startle responses from a sham-exposed, control mouse). Noise-exposed mice that do not detect the silent gap show similar startle amplitudes in gap and no-gap trials and are considered tinnitus mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> top middle, gray and green, representative startle responses from a tinnitus mouse). Noise-exposed mice that detect the silent gap show reduced startle amplitudes in gap trials and are considered non-tinnitus mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> top right, gray and blue, representative startle responses from a non-tinnitus mouse). To quantify the gap detection ability of control and noise-exposed mice, we calculated the gap startle ratio before and after exposure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Gap startle ratio is the maximum startle amplitude in gap trials divided by the maximum startle amplitude in no-gap trials. Moreover, to investigate the frequency specificity of noise-induced tinnitus, we quantified the gap startle ratio for background sounds with different frequencies (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Our results showed that 7 days after noise exposure, 52.4% (11/21) of the noise-exposed mice exhibited a significant gap detection deficit at high-frequency (20\u201332 kHz) but not at low-frequency (10\u201316 kHz) background sounds. This deficit is indicated by an increase in gap startle ratios and is consistent with behavioral evidence of high-frequency tinnitus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> middle; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

                                "text": "Increases in gap startle ratios in tinnitus mice are not consistent with noise-induced impairments in temporal processing or noise-induced inability to hear the background sound, because prepulse inhibition, PPI, was similar among control, tinnitus, and non-tinnitus mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> bottom left, diagram showing startle-only and prepulse trials; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> bottom middle and right, representative startle responses from control, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, summary graphs of PPI ratio; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). PPI ratio reflects the inhibition of startle response by a preceding non-startling sound of similar intensity as the background sound used in gap detection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Moreover, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice displayed similar hearing thresholds before and after noise-exposure, as evidenced by their similar auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In response to acoustic stimuli, ABRs reflect the synchronous activity of auditory brainstem nuclei arising from the auditory nerve (wave I) to the inferior colliculus, IC (wave V, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similar ABR thresholds may be accompanied with hidden differences in suprathreshold amplitudes of wave I. Because these differences could reflect differential degeneration of the auditory nerve (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Furman et al., 2013</a>), we compared the wave I amplitude of ABRs in response to suprathreshold sounds between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice, before and after noise exposure. Whereas wave I amplitudes were reduced after noise-exposure for all noise-exposed mice, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice showed no differences in wave I amplitude, suggesting no difference in the damage of afferent nerve terminals between these two groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that neither differential noise-induced hearing threshold shifts nor differential auditory nerve damage can explain the behavioral differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice."

                                "text": "Next we explored whether behavioral differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice are due to differential intrinsic plasticity in DCN fusiform cells, which are the first targets of the auditory nerve in the central nervous system. Tinnitus mice present reduced KCNQ2/3 channel activity and increased spontaneous firing rates in DCN fusiform cells 7 days after noise exposure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, non-tinnitus mice are associated with normal KCNQ2/3 channel activity and normal spontaneous firing rates of fusiform cell (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). These findings suggest that in resilient, non-tinnitus mice either there is no transient reduction in KCNQ2/3 channel activity post noise exposure or that KCNQ2/3 channel activity is transiently reduced but recovers by 7 days post noise exposure. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured KCNQ2/3 current amplitudes in fusiform cells from noise-exposed mice 4 days post noise exposure. Because fusiform cells from DCN regions that represent high, but not low, frequency sounds are involved in tinnitus-related biophysical changes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>), all in vitro electrophysiological recordings were conducted on fusiform cells from high-frequency DCN regions (\u226520 kHz, dorsal part). To quantify KCNQ2/3 currents, we held fusiform cells at \u221230 mV for 5 s and then stepped the voltage to \u221250 mV for 1 s to unmask the slow deactivation of KCNQ2/3 channels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consistent with previous measurements of KCNQ2/3 currents in fusiform cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>), this protocol revealed a slowly deactivating current, which was significantly reduced by XE991 application (10 \u03bcM, a specific KCNQ channel blocker; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Because KCNQ2/3 heteromeric channels mediate the KCNQ currents in fusiform cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>), the XE991-sensitive component of these recordings represents the KCNQ2/3 current amplitude. 4 days noise-exposed mice showed a significant reduction in KCNQ2/3 current amplitude (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A Boltzmann fit of the KCNQ2/3 conductance\u2013voltage (G\u2013V) function showed that the G<sub>max</sub> of KCNQ2/3 currents was not different between 4 days sham- and 4 days noise-exposed mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a>), but the V<sub>1/2</sub> was shifted to more depolarized potentials in the 4 days noise-exposed mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). These results suggest that the reduction of KCNQ2/3 currents in 4 days noise-exposed mice is due, at least in part, to a depolarizing shift in the V<sub>1/2</sub> of KCNQ2/3 channels, which is mechanistically similar to the reduction of KCNQ2/3 currents in tinnitus mice when assessed 7 days after noise exposure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>)."

Moreover, previous findings showed that in vivo pharmacological activation of KCNQ currents with either KCNQ2-5 or KCNQ2/3 channel activators, retigabine or SF0034, respectively (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tatulian et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kalappa et al., 2015</a>), prevented the development of tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kalappa et al., 2015</a>). The ability of KCNQ channel activators to prevent the development of tinnitus is probably occurring through the reversal of the pathogenic reduction of KCNQ2/3 channel activity and the promotion of the natural resilience to tinnitus. However, in those experiments KCNQ channel activators were administered 30 min after noise exposure and then twice a day for an additional 5 days. Here, we tested whether retigabine application initiated at day 4, instead of 30 min after noise exposure, is sufficient to reduce the incidence of tinnitus at day 7. Application of retigabine at day 4 significantly reduced the percentage of mice that developed tinnitus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), suggesting that the recovery of KCNQ2/3 currents between day 4 and 7 is crucial for tinnitus resilience. Taken together, our results suggest that experience-dependent bidirectional plasticity of KCNQ2/3 channel activity is associated with the vulnerability and resilience to noise-induced tinnitus: experience-dependent depression in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is important for vulnerability, while experience-dependent recovery in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is important for resilience to tinnitus."

However, it is not known whether fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice are biophysically similar to the fusiform cells from control mice, or they have undergone homeostatic plasticity in other channels, which could further contribute to tinnitus resilience. To answer this question, we compared the biophysical properties between fusiform cells from control and non-tinnitus mice 7 days after sham or noise exposure. We found that although control mice and non-tinnitus mice show similar non-tinnitus behavior (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), similar fusiform cell spontaneous firing rates (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>), similar levels of KCNQ2/3 channel activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>), and similar spike parameters (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), non-tinnitus mice are biophysically distinct from control mice. When we blocked fusiform cell spontaneous firing activity with tetrodotoxin (0.5 \u03bcM, a specific sodium channel blocker), we found that fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice showed more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Because fusiform cell RMP is similar between control and tinnitus mice (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>), this finding suggests specific changes in subthreshold ionic conductance(s) occurring only in non-tinnitus mice. Moreover, when we used small current steps to evaluate the onset and steady state input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we found that onset R<sub>in</sub> was not different among control, tinnitus, and non-tinnitus mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, non-tinnitus mice displayed a significantly increased steady-state R<sub>in</sub>, which was revealed later in the voltage response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Together, our results revealed that fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice exhibit a decrease in a slowly activating and deactivating depolarizing conductance that is open at subthreshold potentials. These results indicate that although control and non-tinnitus mice show similar non-tinnitus behavior, non-tinnitus mice are biophysically distinct from control mice. Importantly, these results highlight the involvement of homeostatic plasticity of additional, non-KCNQ, ionic conductances in underlying resilience to tinnitus."

We therefore hypothesized that a decrease in HCN channel activity mediates the hyperpolarized RMP and the increased steady-state R<sub>in</sub> in non-tinnitus mice. To test this hypothesis, we injected hyperpolarizing current to activate HCN channels. HCN channel activation led to a characteristic rebound in the membrane voltage (voltage sag) that was sensitive to the specific HCN channel blocker ZD7288 (10 \u03bcM; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, red: before ZD7288; black: after ZD7288). We quantified HCN channel activity by measuring the ZD7288-sensitive sag ratio, which is the difference between the peak voltage response (V<sub>peak</sub>) and steady-state voltage response (V<sub>ss</sub>), normalized to the V<sub>peak</sub> (Sag ratio = (V<sub>peak</sub>\u2212V<sub>ss</sub>)/V<sub>peak</sub>*100%). Consistent with our hypothesis, fusiform cells from non-tinnitus mice showed significantly reduced HCN channel activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To confirm whether the reduction in HCN channel activity was responsible for the non-tinnitus-specific intrinsic properties, we evaluated the effect of ZD7288 on steady-state R<sub>in</sub> and RMP.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured HCN channel activity 4 days after noise exposure. Our results revealed that although noise-exposed mice showed significantly reduced KCNQ2/3 currents in fusiform cells 4 days after noise exposure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), HCN channel activity was not different between sham-exposed and noise-exposed mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of retigabine on HCN current amplitude (intraperitoneal [IP] injections, 10 mg/kg 30 min post exposure then twice daily for 5 days; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that fusiform cells from retigabine-injected mice, which showed reduced incidence of tinnitus and reduced spontaneous firing rate of fusiform cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,C,D</a>), displayed reduced HCN channel activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). For some mice, we used flupirtine, another KCNQ channel activator (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mackie and Byron, 2008</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Moreover, application of KCNQ channel activators did not affect ABR thresholds, wave I amplitude, or PPI ratios (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that these activators do not affect either noise-induced hearing threshold shifts or auditory nerve damage. These results are consistent with recent studies showing that application of retigabine does not have any effect on hearing thresholds (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sheppard et al., 2015</a>). However, application of retigabine reduced hearing loss in an animal model of sodium salicylate-induced sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sheppard et al., 2015</a>). This is probably due to the fact that different mechanisms mediate sodium salicylate- and noise-induced hearing loss. Taken together, our results suggest that increases in KCNQ2/3 channel activity promote a decrease in fusiform cell HCN channel activity and resilience to tinnitus."

Despite this inherent limitation for studying mechanisms underlying tinnitus perception, deficits in the gap-prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (gap detection) is the most widely used behavioral test for assessing behavioral evidence of tinnitus in animals (<a href=\"#bib26\">Galazyuk and Hebert, 2015</a>). Research based on this behavioral assay has revealed important findings for the mechanisms underlying tinnitus, including neuronal hyperactivity, increased neuronal bursting activity, increased neuronal synchrony, degradation of frequency tonotopy, reduced GABAergic/glycinergic inhibition, enhanced GABAergic tonic inhibition, enhanced glutamatergic excitation, and changes in the biophysical properties of KCNQ channels (<a href=\"#bib21\">Engineer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Middleton et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zeng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kalappa et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sametsky et al., 2015</a>).

However, the interpretation that tinnitus \u2018fills in\u2019 the gap in the background sound that precedes the startle stimulus is not compatible with a recent study, which showed that gap detection deficits in noise-exposed mice were evident only when the gap was placed immediately, but not 80 ms, before the startle stimulus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hickox and Liberman, 2014</a>). If tinnitus just \u2018fills in\u2019 the gap, then gap detection deficits in tinnitus animals are expected to be independent of where the silent gap is placed. Moreover, although human studies revealed gap detection deficits in tinnitus sufferers, which are consistent with the use of the gap detection in animal studies, the frequency of the tinnitus percept did not fully match the frequency of the background sound where gap detection deficits were observed (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fournier and Hebert, 2013</a>). This lack of correspondence in frequency is also inconsistent with the \u2018fill in\u2019 theory. Other human studies, which used higher-level cognitive tasks but not the acoustic reflex for assessing gap detection, did not reveal gap detection deficits in tinnitus sufferers (<a href=\"#bib13\">Campolo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Boyen et al., 2015</a>). Taken together, we propose that although caution should be taken when interpreting gap detection deficits, the gap-prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex is a useful behavioral assay for elucidating tinnitus mechanisms."

Disorders that are characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability, such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and tinnitus are linked to genetic or experience-dependent reductions in KCNQ2/3 channel activity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biervert et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dedek et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kullmann, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wuttke et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Pharmacological activation of KCNQ channels by retigabine, an FDA approved anti-epileptic drug that activates KCNQ2-5, or by SF0034, a potent KCNQ2/3 activator, prevent seizures, neuropathic pain and the development of tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gunthorpe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kalappa et al., 2015</a>).

However, such KCNQ2/3-mediated resilience mechanisms have not been observed in hyperexcitability-related disorders. Here, we report that natural, non-pharmacologically driven recovery in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is linked with the resilience to noise-induced tinnitus. This novel finding suggests a temporal window during which endogenous, intrinsic mechanisms can restore KCNQ2/3 channel activity and lead to tinnitus resilience. Elucidation of these mechanisms will unmask previously unknown plasticity mechanisms of KCNQ2/3 channel activity, and lead to new targets for drug development towards enhancing resilience to noise-induced tinnitus in humans."

Because of their voltage-dependent properties and their reversal potential at \u221230 mV, HCN channels not only depolarize the RMP, but also reduce membrane resistance and therefore stabilize the membrane voltage by opposing its alterations in response to synaptic inputs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pape, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Biel et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, changes in HCN channel activity affect intrinsic and synaptic excitability in opposing directions. This differential influence of HCN channels on synaptic and intrinsic neuronal excitability has implicated HCN plasticity in the vulnerability and resilience to several neurological disorders characterized by abnormal synaptic or intrinsic excitability, such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, depression, and Parkinson\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chaplan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Biel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Emery et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Friedman et al., 2014</a>). Although future studies are needed to test the potential causal relationship between reduction of HCN channel activity in fusiform cell and the resilience to tinnitus, our results show that reduction of HCN channel activity is associated with resilience to tinnitus and with normal levels of fusiform cell spontaneous firing activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>). We suggest that reduced HCN channel activity in non-tinnitus mice prevents fusiform cell hyperactivity and contributes to tinnitus resilience by hyperpolarizing the RMP of fusiform cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>). Moreover, decreased HCN channel activity increased the steady-state R<sub>in</sub> of fusiform cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C and 5D</a>), which is expected to enhance responsiveness of fusiform cells to synaptic inputs. Therefore, reduction of HCN channel activity in fusiform cells may contribute to enhanced evoked activity and potentially to noise-induced hyperacusis\u2014the perception of moderate-level sounds as intolerably loud."

Therefore, we propose that decreases in spontaneous firing that may be caused by the enhancement in KCNQ2/3 channel activity lead to changes in intracellular calcium, which, in turn, may trigger a homeostatic mechanism that decreases HCN currents in an effort to normalize spontaneous spike rates.

Therefore, we propose that manipulations that reduce HCN2 channel activity may serve as potential therapeutic path for preventing the development of tinnitus."

However, at 4 days after noise exposure, fusiform cells show reduced KCNQ2/3 currents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) but without hyperactivity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This lack of association between reduced KCNQ2/3 channel activity and neuronal hyperactivity can be explained by the hyperpolarized RMP of fusiform cells 4 days after noise exposure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Because various levels of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (K<sub>ir</sub>) set the diverse RMP of fusiform cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leao et al., 2012</a>), we suggest that noise-induced increases in K<sub>ir</sub>s may mediate this hyperpolarization of RMP and hence resilience to tinnitus. We conclude that reduction in KCNQ2/3 channel activity is a robust mechanism for triggering tinnitus, but its pathogenic effect is gated by the RMP of fusiform cells. Therefore, besides targeting KCNQ2/3 channel activators for preventing tinnitus, manipulations that hyperpolarize the fusiform cell RMP may also provide additional therapeutic approaches."

Moreover, simultaneous pharmacological enhancement of KCNQ2/3 and reduction of HCN channel activity is expected to act synergistically in stabilizing spontaneous firing rates in fusiform cells. This synergistic effect may in turn reduce the required concentration for each individual drug to exert its effect and therefore may lead to increased potency and reduced toxicity."

Briefly, the gap detection testing consists of two types of trials, gap trials and no-gap trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> top left). In gap trials, a sound gap was embedded in a narrow bandpass background sound (1 kHz bandwidth centered at 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 kHz presented at 70 dB), which was followed by the startle stimulus (20 ms white noise burst at 104 dB); a 50-ms sound gap was introduced 130 ms before the startle stimulus. No-gap trials were the same as gap trials, but that no gap was introduced in the background sound. Gap trials and no-gap trials were presented as paired stimuli for the same background sound frequency, and were delivered in an alternating manner. The startle response represents the waveform of the downward pressing force that the mouse applies onto the platform in response to the startle stimulus. The ability of a mouse to detect sound gap was quantified by the gap startle ratio, which is the ratio of the peak-to-peak value of the startle waveform (amplitude in Arbitrary Unit, AU) in gap trials over the peak-to-peak value of the startle waveform of the paired no-gap trials."

Each round of testing included 72 pairs of gap and no-gap trials for gap detection (6 background sound frequencies, 12 pairs for each frequency) and 30 pairs of prepulse and startle-only trials for PPI (6 prepulse sound frequencies, 5 pairs for each frequency). Gap startle and PPI ratios were analyzed separately. Maximum absolute amplitude of the startle response and root mean square of baseline movement preceding the startle response (RMS baseline) were measured with a Labview-based recording system. Mean and standard deviation of RMS baseline of gap, no-gap, prepulse, and startle-only trials were measured to assess the variability of baseline movement. Trials with RMS baseline amplitude above or below the mean \u00b1 2.5 standard deviations were eliminated. When a trial was eliminated, its paired trial was also eliminated. For gap detection trials of the same background frequency, gap startle ratios were sorted in an ascending manner. To control for variability of gap startle ratios tested with the same frequency, ratios that showed an increase of more than 0.5 from the preceding value were excluded; the following values were also excluded. If more than 5 ratios were excluded within a frequency, the gap startle ratio for this frequency was not used. For background and prepulse sound of the same testing frequency, individual gap startle and PPI ratios were averaged and generated the average ratio for each round of testing. Average gap startle and PPI ratios of each frequency were then averaged across the three rounds of pre-exposure and post-exposure testing to generate the final ratio value. According to previous established criteria, gap startle ratios that were bigger than 0.9 before sham or noise exposure, or bigger than 1.1 after exposure were excluded (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, PPI ratios that were bigger than 1 before or after exposure were excluded (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Changes in gap startle ratio before and after exposure (\u0394 gap startle ratio) were calculated by subtracting the post-exposure ratio from the pre-exposure ratio for each testing frequency. The probability distribution of \u0394 gap startle ratios from all testing frequencies of sham-exposed mice was fitted with a Gaussian distribution, which permitted the calculation of the mean (\u03bc) and the standard deviation (\u03b4) of the probability distribution (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), as described previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>).

Mice that presented \u0394 gap startle ratio higher than threshold value in at least one tested frequency were considered tinnitus mice (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). To determine whether \u0394 gap startle ratios from 4 days noise-exposed mice were different from \u0394 gap startle ratios from 4 days sham-exposed mice, we calculated the fraction of \u0394 gap startle ratios that are above thresholds in 4 days sham- and noise-exposed mice, with thresholds ranging from 1 to \u22121 with 0.02 increments (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

                                "text": "For whole-cell voltage and current clamp experiments, pipettes (3\u20135 \u039c\u03a9) were filled with a K<sup>+</sup>-based internal solution containing (in mM): 113 K-gluconate, 4.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.6 H<sub>2</sub>0, 14 Tris-phosphocreatine, 9 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, 10 Sucrose, pH 7.3, and 300 mOsmol. Liquid junction potential of \u221211 mV was corrected. Access resistance was monitored throughout the experiment from the size and shape of the capacitive transient in response to a 5-mV depolarization step. Recordings with access resistance larger than 15 M\u03a9 were eliminated. Recordings were performed with Clampex 10.2 and Multiclamp 700B amplifier interfaced with Digidata 1440A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). For whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, fast, slow capacitive currents as well as series resistance (Rs) were compensated (70%, bandwidth 15 kHz). In voltage clamp ramp experiments, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> was removed from ACSF. External CsCl<sub>2</sub> (1 mM) and CdCl<sub>2</sub> (200 \u03bcM) were used to block hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN, Ih channel) and calcium channels, respectively. All recording protocols, except for the gap-free recording in current clamp, were applied below 0.1 Hz to eliminate potential short-term plasticity effects. Spike parameters were analyzed from spontaneous spikes in whole-cell, voltage-follower mode recordings (current clamp, at I = 0; synaptic transmission was pharmacologically blocked). To assess spike properties, 20 consecutive spontaneous spikes were aligned at the negative peak and averaged. Spike threshold is the membrane potential at which the depolarization slope exceeds 10 V/s. Spike amplitude is the voltage difference between the spike threshold and the peak voltage of the spike. Depolarization and hyperpolarization slope indicate the maximum positive slope during the depolarization and minimum negative slope during hyperpolarization phase of the spike. Half height width is the width of the spike when voltage equals to (spike threshold + half of spike amplitude). Fast afterhyperpolarization (fAHP) is the voltage difference between spike threshold and negative peak of the spike. Resting membrane potential (RMP) was measured with whole-cell, voltage-follower mode recordings (current clamp, at I = 0) 5 min after TTX (0.5 \u03bcM) application. ZD7288 was applied after TTX for evaluating its effect on RMP. Input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was measured in current clamp mode through current injection (\u221260 pA\u201360 pA, 20 pA step size, 2 s). Onset R<sub>in</sub> is the slope of the current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) relationship of the average membrane voltage response of the initial 100 ms starting from the peak of the voltage response. Steady-state R<sub>in</sub> was calculated similarly to the onset R<sub>in</sub>, but the last 250 ms of the voltage response were used. To quantify KCNQ2/3 currents, we measured the XE991-sensitive tail current amplitude in response to a voltage step to \u221250 mV from a holding potential of \u221230 mV, described in detail previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). To measure HCN channel activity, we injected bias current to maintain the membrane potential at \u221275 mV. A hyperpolarizing current step (\u2212550 pA, 2 s) was then used to activate HCN channels. The biggest membrane potential change from \u221275 mV (V<sub>peak</sub>), and the membrane potential change at the end of hyperpolarizing current (V<sub>ss</sub>) was used to calculate the sag ratio: Sag ratio = (V<sub>peak</sub>\u2212V<sub>ss</sub>)/V<sub>peak</sub> \u00d7 100% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Sag ratio before and after ZD7288 (15 min application) was subtracted and generated the ZD7288-sensitive sag ratio. In voltage-clamp ramp experiments, XE991-sensitive KCNQ currents elicited by slow voltage ramp (10 mV/s) were converted to conductance (G, nS) according to Ohm's law: G = I/(V\u2212V<sub>r</sub>). I (pA) is the current amplitude at the membrane potential V (mV), and V<sub>r</sub> is the reversal potential of potassium [\u221285.5 mV; (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leao et al., 2012</a>)]. Conductance\u2013voltage curves were then fitted with Boltzmann function to describe the voltage dependence of KCNQ activation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D,E</a>)."

The basis of this work is that all noise-exposed animals show shifts in hearing threshold, but only a proportion of them show increased spontaneous firing rates in fusiform cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Previously, Li, Choi, and Tzounopoulos (PNAS, 2013) showed that KCNQ2/3 (M) currents are reduced in DCN fusiform cells of mice exhibiting signs of tinnitus seven days after intense noise exposure but not in noise-exposed asymptomatic mice. A clever behavioral task is used to separate whether mice can detect a silent gap in background noise preceding a startle stimulus. \u201cTinnitus\u201d mice are defined as those that cannot detect a silent gap without apparent differences in noise-induced hearing loss as measured by a prepulse inhibition (PPI) protocol."

This suggests that KCNQ2/3 currents return to pre-noise exposure levels in tinnitus-resistant mice between four and seven days after noise exposure, providing a possible molecular explanation for why some noise-exposed mice develop tinnitus while others do not. In addition, the authors also report that HCN currents and resting membrane potentials are reduced in tinnitus-resistant mice seven days after noise exposure, but not in tinnitus mice."

It seems important to know if the differences between \u201ctinnitus\u201d and \u201cnon-tinnitus\u201d mice results from differences in the extent of noise damage to hair cells, or differences in the response of the DCN to comparable damage, i.e. do responses to noise-exposure reflect different plastic responses of the DCN to the same injury, or differences in the extent of the upstream injury. For example, could the protective effect of KCNQ activation result from protection of the cochlea and the plasticity differences observed reflect a uniform response to different extents of damage? At present, this distinction seems to depend solely on the PPI measurement. The selectivity of deficits in Gap startle ratio vs. paired pulse inhibition are helpful and important, but the conclusions in the subsection \u201cMouse model of tinnitus allows for behavioral separation of noise-exposed mice with either vulnerability or resilience to tinnitus\u201d seem too strong. The authors claim their results rule out impairments in temporal processing or ability to hear background noise. Selective deficits in temporal processing of e.g. offset responses could explain the results, and not relate to tinnitus. Caveats of the model should be made clear. One possible resolution would be to perform DPOAEs or ABRs in a group of animals in which they also assess \u201ctinnitus\u201d versus \u201cnon-tinnitus\u201d DCN phenotype, following e.g.: Kujawa, S. G., & Liberman, M. C. (2009), Adding insult to injury: cochlear nerve degeneration after \u201ctemporary\u201d noise-induced hearing loss, The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(45), 14077-14085."

It seems important to know if the differences between \u201ctinnitus\u201d and \u201cnon-tinnitus\u201d mice results from differences in the extent of noise damage to hair cells, or differences in the response of the DCN to comparable damage, i.e. do responses to noise-exposure reflect different plastic responses of the DCN to the same injury, or differences in the extent of the upstream injury. For example, could the protective effect of KCNQ activation result from protection of the cochlea and the plasticity differences observed reflect a uniform response to different extents of damage? At present, this distinction seems to depend solely on the PPI measurement. The selectivity of deficits in Gap startle ratio vs. paired pulse inhibition are helpful and important, but the conclusions in the subsection \u201cMouse model of tinnitus allows for behavioral separation of noise-exposed mice with either vulnerability or resilience to tinnitus\u201d seem too strong. The authors claim their results rule out impairments in temporal processing or ability to hear background noise. Selective deficits in temporal processing of e.g. offset responses could explain the results, and not relate to tinnitus. Caveats of the model should be made clear. One possible resolution would be to perform DPOAEs or ABRs in a group of animals in which they also assess \u201ctinnitus\u201d versus \u201cnon-tinnitus\u201d DCN phenotype, following e.g.: Kujawa, S. G., &amp; Liberman, M. C. (2009), Adding insult to injury: cochlear nerve degeneration after \u201ctemporary\u201d noise-induced hearing loss, The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(45), 14077-14085</i>."

As suggested by the reviewers, to address these issues, we performed auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements, analysis of hearing thresholds and analysis of wave I amplitude of the ABR. Please note that we had already performed these measurements in the same animals included in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, and therefore these results match the behavioral gap detection and PPI experiments included in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Briefly, consistent with our PPI results, tinnitus and non -tinnitus mice displayed similar hearing thresholds before and after noise-exposure, as evidenced by similar ABR thresholds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, B</a>). Because similar ABR thresholds may not reveal differences in suprathreshold amplitudes of wave I, which would reflect differential degeneration of the auditory nerve (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>, J. of Neurosci.; <a href=\"#bib25\">Furman et al., 2013</a>, J. of Neurophys.), we compared the amplitude of the wave I in response to suprathreshold sounds between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice before and after noise exposure. Whereas wave I amplitudes were reduced after noise-exposure for all noise-exposed mice, tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice showed no differences in wave I amplitude, suggesting an indistinguishable damage of afferent nerve terminals between these two groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that neither differential noise- induced hearing threshold shifts nor differential auditory nerve damage can explain the behavioral differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice. We included these data in the new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and edited the text accordingly."

Given the subjective nature of tinnitus perception, there is not any objective behavioral paradigm in either mice or humans that provides objective evidence of tinnitus. Despite these inherent limitations of studying tinnitus perception, the gap detection paradigm has been used by a large number of leading tinnitus neuroscientists including Drs. Caspary (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sametsky et al., 2015</a>, J. of Neurosci.), Kilgard (<a href=\"#bib21\">Engineer et al., 2011</a>, Nature), Shore (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koehler and Shore, 2013</a>, J. of Neurosci.), to mention a few. There are several review articles discussing advantages and disadvantages in using this behavioral paradigm, which are outside the scope of this study. Importantly, this paradigm has revealed extremely important findings for the neurobiology and treatment of tinnitus. In several cases, these findings have also led to ongoing clinical trials. For example the Kilgard study on the role of vagus nerve stimulation paired with tones for treating tinnitus was based on this paradigm (<a href=\"#bib21\">Engineer et al., 2011</a>, Nature), and is currently under clinical trial. Our studies, also based on the gap detection paradigm (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>, PNAS; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kalappa et al., 2015</a>, Journal of Neuroscience), have revealed novel KCNQ2/3 channel activators for the treatment of tinnitus and epilepsy and are moving toward clinical trials. We therefore believe that the gap detection paradigm is a useful behavioral assay for elucidating tinnitus mechanisms."

The threshold used to assign mice to tinnitus group affects the outcome of the experiment, but it is established for every different behavioral experiment by using objective quantitative criteria. Particularly, changes in gap startle ratio before and after exposure (\u0394 gap startle ratio) were calculated by subtracting the post-exposure ratio from the pre-exposure ratio for each testing frequency. The probability distribution of \u0394 gap startle ratios from all testing frequencies of sham-exposed mice was fitted with a Gaussian distribution, which permitted the calculation of the mean (\u00b5) and the standard deviation (\u03b4) of the probability distribution (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), as described previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>, PNAS).
