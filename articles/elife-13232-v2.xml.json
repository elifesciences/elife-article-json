Previous studies of thermosensitive yeast COPI mutants yielded the surprising conclusion that COPI was dispensable both for the secretion of certain proteins and for Golgi cisternal maturation. To revisit these issues, we optimized the anchor-away method, which allows peripheral membrane proteins such as COPI to be sequestered rapidly by adding rapamycin. Video fluorescence microscopy revealed that COPI inactivation causes an early Golgi protein to remain in place while late Golgi proteins undergo cycles of arrival and departure. These dynamics generate partially functional hybrid Golgi structures that contain both early and late Golgi proteins, explaining how secretion can persist when COPI has been inactivated. Our findings suggest that cisternal maturation involves a COPI-dependent pathway that recycles early Golgi proteins, followed by multiple COPI-independent pathways that recycle late Golgi proteins."

The yeast were genetically engineered so that COPI activity was effectively shut down in the presence of a drug called rapamycin. The experiments show that COPI is involved in the early stages of remodeling the Golgi compartments, but not the later stages. This finding supports the emerging view of the Golgi as a self-organizing cellular machine, and it provides a framework for uncovering the engineering principles that underlie the secretory pathway."

During vesicle formation, COPI polymerizes to form a curved lattice that captures specific cargoes, including p24 family proteins and certain SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Beck et al., 2009</a>). COPI can be divided into the B subcomplex, which consists of \u03b1-, \u03b2\u2019- and \u03b5-COP, and the F subcomplex, which consists of \u03b2-, \u03b4-, \u03b3-, and \u03b6-COP (<a href=\"#bib72\">Lowe and Kreis, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Gaynor et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Lee and Goldberg, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Jackson, 2014</a>).

Some transmembrane ER proteins contain cytosolically-oriented C-terminal KKxx-type signals, which are recognized by COPI for retrieval to the ER (<a href=\"#bib26\">Cosson and Letourneur, 1997</a>). COPI also retrieves transmembrane ER proteins that associate with the Rer1 recycling factor, as well as transmembrane ER proteins that contain arginine-based sorting signals (<a href=\"#bib114\">Sato et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Michelsen et al., 2007</a>). Finally, COPI plays a role in retrieving the KDEL receptor (<a href=\"#bib91\">Orci et al., 1997</a>), which binds escaped luminal ER proteins. Retrograde COPI vesicles are captured at the ER by the Dsl1 tethering complex in a process that involves recognition of the coat (<a href=\"#bib106\">Ren et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib145\">Zink et al., 2009</a>)."

Initially the proposal was that COPI vesicles carry secretory cargoes forward from one Golgi cisterna to the next in a \u201cvesicle shuttle\u201d (<a href=\"#bib73\">Malhotra et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Orci et al., 1989</a>). After the discovery of COPI-mediated Golgi-to-ER recycling, the vesicle shuttle model was extended by proposing that COPI vesicles act as bidirectional carriers in the ER-Golgi system (<a href=\"#bib97\">Pelham, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Rothman, 1996</a>). However, the idea that COPI vesicles carry secretory cargoes from one cisterna to the next faced the problem that some secretory cargoes are much larger than COPI vesicles. Examples include the cell-surface scales that are secreted by certain algae, and procollagen bundles in mammalian fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib66\">Leblond, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Becker et al., 1995</a>)."

Thus, entire cisternae could act as forward carriers for secretory cargoes. COPI vesicles have been proposed to recycle resident Golgi proteins within the organelle (<a href=\"#bib103\">Rabouille and Klumperman, 2005</a>). Consistent with this idea, resident Golgi proteins have been detected in mammalian COPI vesicles (<a href=\"#bib77\">Mart\u00ednez-Men\u00e1rguez et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Malsam et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Gilchrist et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Pellett et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Eckert et al., 2014</a>)\u2014although conflicting results have been reported in other studies (<a href=\"#bib92\">Orci et al., 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Cosson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Kweon et al., 2004</a>)\u2014and the localization of some yeast and plant Golgi proteins has been shown to involve COPI (<a href=\"#bib132\">Todorow et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib133\">Tu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib138\">Woo et al., 2015</a> ). Early versions of the cisternal maturation model postulated that COPI vesicles move in a directed fashion from older to younger cisternae (<a href=\"#bib49\">Glick et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</a>). However, no mechanism for such directed movement has yet emerged, suggesting instead that COPI vesicles \u201cpercolate\u201d bidirectionally between different cisternae (<a href=\"#bib93\">Orci et al., 2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Day et al., 2013</a>). Regardless of the specific traffic pattern of COPI vesicles within the Golgi, the result is thought to be a net retrograde movement of resident Golgi proteins as the cisternae mature (<a href=\"#bib50\">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Day et al., 2013</a>)."

Surprisingly, when COPI function was disrupted in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> using thermosensitive mutant COPI subunits, secretion was reportedly inhibited for some proteins but not others (<a href=\"#bib45\">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</a>). Equally surprising results were obtained when a strain with a thermosensitive mutant COPI subunit was examined by video fluorescence microscopy.

After COPI inactivation, the Golgi remained partially functional, indicating that recycling of early Golgi proteins is dispensable for secretion.

However, an earlier genetic study hinted that different yeast COPI subunits might act in distinct cellular pathways (<a href=\"#bib44\">Gabriely et al., 2007</a>). To examine the in vivo distribution of COPI, we used fluorescence microscopy to visualize several COPI subunits in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Gaynor et al., 1998</a>). The tagged subunits were Sec26 (\u03b2-COP), which is part of the F subcomplex, together with either the Sec21 (\u03b3-COP) subunit of the F subcomplex or the Ret1 (\u03b1-COP) subunit of the B subcomplex. Gene replacement was used to tag Sec26 with GFP, and then to tag Sec21 or Ret1 with mCherry. In both cases the colocalization at punctate structures was essentially complete (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

By contrast, when Sec21 was tagged with FRB, rapamycin completely blocked growth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

With a strain expressing OM45-FKBPx2 and Sec21-FRB, growth was only partially inhibited by rapamycin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A likely explanation is that binding of FRB to FKBP-rapamycin is readily reversible (<a href=\"#bib7\">Banaszynski et al., 2005</a>). If so, then why is the ribosomal anchor more effective than the mitochondrial anchor? We believe the answer is that ribosomes are present throughout the cytoplasm whereas mitochondria have a more restricted location. After dissociating from an Rpl13A-FKBPx2 anchor, Sec21-FRB will quickly be captured again by encountering another ribosome, whereas after dissociating from an OM45-FKBPx2 anchor, Sec21-FRB may have time to function at the Golgi before encountering another mitochondrion."

We also tried constructing a strain that expressed Rpl13A-FKBPx4 and Sec21-FRBx2, but growth was slow, perhaps because the functional affinity of the interaction was high enough to compromise COPI even in the absence of rapamycin (data not shown). In conclusion, growth assays indicate that effective anchoring can be achieved using either Sec21-FRB with a ribosomal Rpl13A-FKBPx2 anchor, or Sec21-FRBx2 with a mitochondrial OM45-FKBPx4 anchor."

We analyzed cells that contained GFP-Vrg4 as an early Golgi marker and Ret1-mCherry as a COPI marker, plus a blue fluorescent marker for the mitochondrial matrix (<a href=\"#bib87\">Murley et al., 2013</a>).

To test this prediction, we used a construct encoding the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the ER protein Sec71 fused to GFP (<a href=\"#bib115\">Sato et al., 2003</a>). Sec71TMD-GFP localizes to the ER with the aid of the retrieval receptor Rer1 (<a href=\"#bib115\">Sato et al., 2003</a>), which recycles from the Golgi to the ER in a COPI-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib18\">Boehm et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Sato et al., 2001</a>). Control experiments confirmed that Sec71TMD-GFP was in the ER as indicated by nuclear envelope fluorescence plus additional fluorescence from peripheral ER structures (<a href=\"#bib115\">Sato et al., 2003</a>). When Sec71TMD-GFP was expressed using an integrating vector in a wild-type strain, a bright ER signal was seen in essentially all of the cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). By contrast, in an <i>rer1\u25b3</i> mutant strain, the Sec71TMD-GFP signal in the ER was faint (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The <i>rer1\u25b3</i> strain showed a vacuolar lumen signal as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib115\">Sato et al., 2003</a>), although the strength of this signal varied between cells, probably because older cells had degraded more mislocalized Sec71TMD-GFP molecules and had therefore accumulated more GFP in the vacuole.

In a control strain that contained the mitochondrial OM45-FKBPx4 anchor, addition of rapamycin had no effect on the amount of Sec71TMD-GFP in the ER, as indicated by the fluorescence signal from the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, when the OM45-FKBPx4 strain also contained Sec21-FRBx2 for anchoring COPI, addition of rapamycin caused progressive depletion of Sec71TMD-GFP from the ER (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As previously observed (<a href=\"#bib71\">Losev et al., 2006</a>), early and late cisternae appeared as distinct puncta in the absence of rapamycin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In a strain carrying the OM45-FKBPx4 anchor and wild-type Sec21, addition of rapamycin had no effect on this pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, in a strain carrying OM45-FKBPx4 plus Sec21-FRBx2, addition of rapamycin for 10\u00a0min to anchor COPI caused a dramatic change: the labeled structures were fewer in number and often larger, and many of them showed colocalization of the early and late Golgi markers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The green and red fluorescence patterns were typically not identical, suggesting that the early and late Golgi markers were associated but partially segregated. This altered distribution of Golgi markers remained largely unchanged after prolonged treatment with rapamycin, except that after 30\u00a0min, some of the GFP-Vrg4 began to appear at the vacuolar membrane and plasma membrane (data not shown). A similar conversion of separate to partially overlapping localizations of early and late Golgi markers was seen when a ribosomal anchor was used instead of a mitochondrial anchor (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), or when the early Golgi marker was the Cog1 subunit of the COG vesicle tethering complex (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib136\">Willett et al., 2013</a>).

We previously showed that in unperturbed cells expressing GFP-Vrg4 and Sec7-DsRed, a cisterna labels for ~1\u20133 min with the green early Golgi marker, then loses green fluorescence while acquiring red fluorescence, then labels for ~1\u20133 min with the red late Golgi marker, then loses red fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib71\">Losev et al., 2006</a>). The same maturation dynamics for GFP-Vrg4 and Sec7-DsRed were seen when a strain expressing the OM45-FKBPx4 anchor plus Sec21-FRBx2 was imaged in the absence of rapamycin (data not shown). By contrast, after the same strain had been incubated with rapamycin for 10\u00a0min to inactivate COPI, Golgi dynamics were markedly altered as described below. Rapamycin-driven tethering to mitochondria probably facilitated this analysis by making the Golgi structures less mobile and easier to track."

First, when the early and late Golgi markers were both present in a hybrid structure, the two markers remained closely associated even though the shape of the structure fluctuated rapidly. Second, in many of the hybrid Golgi structures, the Sec7-DsRed marker disappeared and then subsequently returned while the GFP-Vrg4 marker persisted the entire time. An example from <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a> is the Golgi structure marked by an arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The dynamics of this structure are illustrated in <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, which was generated by cropping the movie frames and then manually erasing the fluorescence of nearby structures at each time point. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> shows representative frames from <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a> together with a quantitation of the green and red fluorescence intensities for the entire 15-min movie. The red signal lasted for ~4.5\u00a0min, then completely disappeared, then returned for ~7\u2009min, then briefly disappeared before beginning to increase once again. A similar pattern was seen with the structure marked by the arrow in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, although this structure could be tracked reliably for only ~8.5\u00a0min, as illustrated in <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>. Representative frames from <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a> are shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>. In this case, the red signal disappeared for ~2\u00a0min before returning even stronger than before. More generally, although the kinetics varied for different Golgi structures, many of them showed persistent GFP-Vrg4 labeling with alternating high and low levels of Sec7-DsRed labeling. Thus, Sec7-DsRed continued to recycle within the Golgi after COPI inactivation."

A late Golgi transmembrane protein that may recycle within the Golgi is the processing protease Kex2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Fuller et al., 1988</a>). It has been proposed that Kex2 traffics between the Golgi and prevacuolar endosomes (<a href=\"#bib123\">Sipos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">De et al., 2013</a>), but Kex2 has no known role at prevacuolar endosomes, and the following two results suggest that the major recycling pathway for Kex2 is actually within the Golgi."

The marker for prevacuolar endosomes was Vps8, a subunit of the CORVET tether (<a href=\"#bib6\">Arlt et al., 2015</a>). Late Golgi compartments and prevacuolar endosomes are clearly distinct because in projected confocal images, Sec7-mCherry and Vps8-GFP showed no colocalization apart from a background level that likely represents chance overlap after projection (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Arlt et al., 2015</a>). As a control, we examined Vps10, a vacuolar hydrolase receptor that cycles between the late Golgi and prevacuolar endosomes and localizes to both compartments (<a href=\"#bib75\">Marcusson et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Cooper and Stevens, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Chi et al., 2014</a>). Vps10-GFP was present in a subset of the late Golgi structures labeled with Sec7-mCherry and in almost all of the prevacuolar endosomes labeled with Vps8-mCherry (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). By contrast, Kex2-GFP colocalized strongly with Sec7-mCherry but showed very little colocalization with Vps8-mCherry (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In some cells, prevacuolar endosomes did contain detectable Kex2-GFP, but this green signal was weak (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that Kex2 resides in the Golgi, and that cycling through prevacuolar endosomes represents at most a minor pathway for Kex2 trafficking."

                                "text": "Second, we used 4D confocal microscopy to compare the dynamics of Kex2-GFP and Sec7-mCherry, and to determine why the colocalization of these two markers is substantial but incomplete (<a href=\"#bib42\">Franzusoff et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Redding et al., 1991</a>). It was recently reported that Kex2 departs from Golgi cisternae somewhat earlier than Sec7 (<a href=\"#bib81\">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</a>). We confirmed and extended that result by showing that Kex2-GFP both arrived and departed slightly before Sec7-mCherry, with the two kinetic traces typically offset by 5\u201320 s (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Thus, a green spot that lacks red fluorescence could represent a Golgi cisterna that has acquired Kex2-GFP and will soon acquire Sec7-mCherry. Alternatively, a green spot that lacks red fluorescence could represent a non-Golgi compartment that contains Kex2-GFP and will never contain Sec7-mCherry. To determine the relative abundance of these two classes of Kex2-GFP-labeled structures, we analyzed <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a> and identified the green spots that lacked red fluorescence and that could be reliably tracked for at least 30 s after their initial appearance. A total of 26 such structures were detected. As shown in <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>, all 26 structures subsequently acquired Sec7-mCherry. Additional Kex2-GFP-labeled structures that could not be tracked for the full 30 s also acquired Sec7-mCherry (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, most or all of the structures that label strongly with Kex2-GFP are late Golgi cisternae. The straightforward interpretation of these data is that Kex2 recycles within the Golgi, with kinetics slightly offset from those of Sec7."

The molecular basis of the thermosensitivity is typically unknown, creating uncertainty about whether the mutant protein has been completely inactivated by the temperature shift. Moreover, a thermosensitive mutation may have detrimental effects even at the permissive temperature, in which case cellular functions will be compromised before the experiment begins. Both of these issues have been encountered with thermosensitive COPI mutants. For example, some of the commonly used COPI mutants show variable and relatively weak phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</a>). That issue was addressed by isolating the strong <i>sec21-3</i> mutation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</a>), but in our hands, Golgi morphology was perturbed in <i>sec21-3</i> cells even at the permissive temperature.

Better results were obtained with the ribosomal Rpl13A-FKBPx2 anchor (<a href=\"#bib55\">Haruki et al., 2008</a>). We also generated a mitochondrial OM45-FKBPx4 anchor, which is effective in combination with an FRBx2 tag. Control experiments indicated that these versions of the anchor-away system allow COPI to be inactivated quickly and reliably, and can therefore serve to complement thermosensitive mutants for studying COPI function. COPII can also be inactivated with the anchor-away system, although the response is slightly different than for COPI, indicating that this system needs to be tested for each component that is being inactivated."

We propose that when COPI is inactivated, the cell replenishes ER-to-Golgi SNAREs through new protein synthesis. Other components such as ER export receptors will also be replenished, but at varying rates depending on their synthesis kinetics. According to this model, COPI inactivation will have the following effects on ER export. (a) COPII vesicle production will be slowed but not halted. (b) For a given secretory protein, the rate of ER export will depend on how rapidly the cognate ER export receptor is replenished and/or how efficiently the protein is packaged into COPII vesicles in the absence of an ER export receptor."

Insight into this puzzle came from fluorescence microscopy. Soon after COPI is inactivated, early and late Golgi proteins change from marking separate compartments to associating with one another in hybrid Golgi structures. These hybrid structures are very dynamic, and we suspect that the compartments containing early and late Golgi markers exchange material, although our analysis cannot determine whether this exchange involves transient fusion events or other types of transport intermediates. In any case, the hybrid Golgi structures have early Golgi character, so secretory proteins can presumably reach these structures in COPII vesicles, and the hybrid Golgi structures show relatively normal cycling of late Golgi components, so secretory proteins can presumably depart to the cell surface in transport carriers. Compared to the unperturbed Golgi, the hybrid Golgi structures may yield altered glycosylation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</a>) but they are functional for membrane traffic.

Under normal conditions, early Golgi proteins depart while late Golgi proteins arrive, and then late Golgi proteins depart in turn.

As predicted, after COPI inactivation, Golgi structures acquired Sec7-DsRed while failing to lose GFP-Vrg4. This result provides the first direct evidence that COPI plays a role in cisternal maturation. Specifically, we conclude that COPI helps to drive cisternal maturation by recycling early Golgi proteins such as Vrg4 from maturing cisternae. Vrg4 could recycle to younger cisternae either by intra-Golgi traffic, or by Golgi-to-ER traffic followed by delivery to newly forming cisternae. To evaluate these possibilities, we note that when COPII was inactivated by anchoring to mitochondria, GFP-Vrg4 showed no ER accumulation of the type that would be expected if this protein frequently returned to the ER. The data therefore suggest that COPI recycles Vrg4 within the Golgi."

By fluorescence microscopy, Kex2 and Sec7 show substantial but incomplete overlap. The existence of structures that label with either Kex2 alone or Sec7 alone can now be explained, by our work plus a recent study (<a href=\"#bib81\">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</a>), as being due to an offset in the kinetic behaviors of these two proteins during cisternal maturation. Kex2 arrives at a Golgi cisterna ~5\u201320 s before Sec7 and then departs ~5\u201320 s before Sec7. Thus, Kex2 apparently recycles within the Golgi somewhat ahead of Sec7. Our interpretation argues against the view that Kex2 resembles Vps10 in cycling between the Golgi and prevacuolar endosomes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abazeed et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">De et al., 2013</a>). Although we occasionally see Kex2-GFP in prevacuolar endosomes, this pool is very small, probably because Kex2 trafficking to prevacuolar endosomes reflects either a secondary recycling pathway or a degradation pathway. The proposed recycling of Kex2 within the Golgi merits further exploration. Meanwhile, we found that COPI inactivation did not prevent recycling of Kex2. This result, together with the finding that COPI is concentrated at the early Golgi, suggests that intra-Golgi recycling of late Golgi transmembrane proteins is independent of COPI."

Yeast AP-1 has been implicated in the late Golgi localization of multiple proteins including Tlg1, Drs2, Chs3, and Pin2 (<a href=\"#bib134\">Valdivia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Foote and Nothwehr, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Liu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barfield et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Myers and Payne, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Ritz et al., 2014</a>). One study provided evidence that AP-1 also plays a role in Kex2 localization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abazeed and Fuller, 2008</a>). Those data have been thought to reflect a recycling pathway from early endosomes, but yeast AP-1 localizes to the late Golgi (<a href=\"#bib30\">Daboussi et al., 2012</a>), supporting the alternative view that AP-1 mediates recycling from older to younger cisternae at a late stage in Golgi maturation (<a href=\"#bib134\">Valdivia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Liu et al., 2008</a>). We speculate that Kex2 recycling involves AP-1, which might act in conjunction with the co-adaptor Ent5 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Costaguta et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Copic et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Daboussi et al., 2012</a>).

Although Golgi compartmentation is broadly conserved, and is thought to provide fine control of glycan assembly while keeping secretory cargoes in the organelle long enough for complete processing (<a href=\"#bib128\">Stanley, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Ruiz-May et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Day et al., 2013</a>), some organisms such as microsporidia forgo Golgi compartmentation and rely instead on a fused Golgi network (<a href=\"#bib15\">Beznoussenko et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib131\">Takvorian et al., 2013</a>). Yet COPI components are present in microsporidia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Beznoussenko et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Mowbrey and Dacks, 2009</a>), perhaps because an efficient secretory pathway always requires Golgi-to-ER recycling, even with a non-compartmentalized Golgi. In this view, Golgi-to-ER recycling is the core function of COPI, and many eukaryotes have adapted COPI for the additional purpose of maintaining separate Golgi compartments through cisternal maturation."

Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <i>eLife</i>. While the reviewers lauded the high quality of your study, the consensus view was that the advances that it presents do not carry the significance required to merit publication in <i>eLife</i>.

The authors have optimized the anchor-away technique as a means to rapidly inactivate COPI function in yeast cells in order to assess the consequences to the maturation of Golgi cisternae and to secretion. They report that the transition from an early cisterna, marked by GFP-Vrg4, to a late cisterna, marked by Sec7-GFP, fails upon inactivation of COPI. In contrast, a maturation event monitored by Kex2-GFP dynamics is not affected, leading the authors to conclude that COPI is required solely for recycling of early Golgi proteins."

Science, 2008; Tu et al. 2012) implicated a role for COPI in Golgi localization of multiple early/medial Golgi residents in yeast cells via recycling through the ER. Although this paper more directly visualizes a role for COPI for recycling of an early Golgi resident (Vrg4), the advance presented here is modest and questions regarding the role of COPI recycling pathway remain to be addressed. Does COPI direct Vrg4 to the ER, or to an earlier Golgi compartment? Related, Rizzo et al. (2013) provided evidence that an artificial Golgi resident based on mannosidase II (MAN-FM) recycles via COPI vesicles/tubules from the trans Golgi cisterna of HeLa cells. Is Vrg4 recognized by COPI?"

Further, I don't find the argument that Kex2 recycles within the Golgi (rather than from endosomes to the Golgi) to be sufficiently substantiated."

Using this technique, they find that secretion is strongly inhibited, although to different extents for different proteins, and that the maturation process and the organization of the Golgi are markedly altered. In control cells, early cisternae lose their residents to newly forming cis elements and simultaneously acquire trans Golgi markers, which they later loose, presumably during formation of secretory post Golgi carriers. In cells where COPI is inactivated by the anchoring away approach, early and late Golgi residents merge (partially) into a hybrid compartment, where they behave differently: the cis residents become unable to cycle and remain stably in this compartment (suggesting that they normally cycle through COPI) while trans residents can still cycle on and off the hybrid Golgi body though with delayed kinetics (suggesting that they cycle via a COPI- independent mechanism)."

This hybrid compartment can still absorb input from the ER and release secretory material towards the surface, albeit at slow rates."

The anchoring method, as noted by the authors, results in the adhesion of the whole Golgi cisternae to the mitochondria, rather than in the 'removal' of the COPI machinery from Golgi cisternae. The results of this are hard to predict and may not always be congruent with the specific inactivation of the concerned proteins. It is conceivable that the strong block in recycling of the cis-Golgi residents might be due to extensive proximity/adhesion between Golgi and mitochondrial membrane, rather than to a specific block of the COPI function. This possibility undermines the author's central conclusions about the role of COPI in the recycling of cis residents and should be appropriately discussed or addressed experimentally. Some relevant questions and considerations and some possible approaches are suggested below:"

Kex2 remains present while Sec7 appears at that compartment, and Kex2 then leaves the compartment before the Sec7 signal completely disappears. However, in COPI-inactivated cells there are two major differences: First, the morphology of the compartments are quite different, with early and late markers showing partial colocalization to larger \"hybrid\" compartments. Second, in mutant cells maturation is altered so that compartments labeled with an early marker (Vrg4) persist for a longer time while later markers/cargos (Sec7 and Kex2) appear to cycle in and out of the \"hyrbrid\" compartment."

Although cell growth is blocked by anchoring COPI, given the resolution of the growth curve data it is a formal possibility that partial COPI activity remains, and growth may not halt until after 1 or 2 more cell divisions. This might affect the interpretation of the data (especially the secretion phenotype), if partial COPI activity remains. The authors imply that because the sec21-3 mutant displays an identical secretion phenotype to the anchor-away COPI phenotype, it is likely that both methods result in complete inactivation of COPI. However, I think the authors need to demonstrate that the Golgi-ER COPI trafficking pathway is completely blocked by anchor-away inactivation of COPI. There are various \"retrieval assays\" in the literature. Another option would be to test by microscopy whether a protein that normally cycles between the ER and Golgi (i.e. a p24 protein or other cycling ER cargo receptor) is now exclusively found in the Golgi."

This would be a fairly radical idea, and would upend the current model that AP-1 traffics Kex2 from the Golgi to endosomes, and then Kex2 is retrieved from endosomes back to the Golgi by other machinery. Yet the only data provided specifically in support of this new model is the statement \"our video microscopy revealed that most and perhaps all of the Kex2-labeled compartments acquire Sec7, suggesting that Kex2 recycles from older to younger cisternae within the Golgi\". I disagree with both the data and interpretations contained in this statement. First, by watching their videos it appears that there are a few smaller Kex2 structures that may disappear without acquiring Sec7. Second, if we assume the first part of the statement is correct, this observation is consistent with Kex2 being retrieved from endosomes (where it may reside for only a few seconds), via vesicles, to Golgi compartments that have not yet acquired Sec7. To my knowledge, the precise Golgi compartment that fuses with endosomally-derived vesicles has not been firmly established in yeast, but the Nakano lab found that Ypt6 precedes Sec7 at the Golgi (PNAS 2013). As Ypt6 (together with the GARP complex) is primarily responsible for tethering/fusing vesicles from endosomes, this suggests Kex2 retrieval from endosomes to the Golgi occurs at a stage of Golgi maturation just prior to acquisition of Sec7. Therefore, it seems unfounded to propose a role for AP-1 in recycling cargos from late Golgi to early Golgi compartments."

It is puzzling to me that in the sec21-3 mutant (permissive temperature) GFP-Vrg4 transits the Golgi and is sorted to the vacuole, but it remains in place (in the hybrid compartment) in anchor away cells. The reason may lie in incomplete inactivation of COPI in the sec21-3 mutant (the figure shows permissive temperature), but difference in outcome is striking and begs resolution. The only way that I can think of that might meaningfully address this would be to compare results with 'inert' anchor away targets. What, for example, happens when if FRB is appended to a Golgi resident (e.g., Vrg4), so that the cisterna is addressed to the mitochondrion, but COPI is not manipulated? Despite this shortcoming, I think that in its present form the manuscript makes an important contribution to the field, even though the message, as summarized in the title, may be open to continuing debate."

Moreover, they find that trans-Golgi residents (Sec7 and Kex2) partially merge with these stabilized cis cisternae, forming hybrid cis/trans Golgi bodies; and also that these trans markers cycle on and off the hybrid structures (though with somewhat delayed kinetics). This suggests that these markers cycle via a COPI-independent mechanism."

However, the stabilization of the cis Golgi it is not the only possible outcome of COPI inactivation, under the maturation model. One might imagine, for instance, that if COPI were inactivated in a different way, e.g., by rapid degradation, this might cause cis markers to move forward along with cargo proteins to reach the vacuole or the plasma membrane. This is actually what happens when the COPI-bound adaptor Vps74 is removed: the Golgi enzymes leave the Golgi and move to the vacuole (Tu-Banfield). This apparent discrepancy might disconcert the reader.

However, the observation that the hybrid compartment can still absorb input from the ER and release secretory material towards the surface, albeit at slow rates, is difficult to reconcile with the maturation model. Since the recycling of cis markers is inhibited, and the formation of a new cis cisterna (a necessary step in the cisternal maturation mechanism) requires such recycling, a logical suggestion deriving from these data would be that the hybrid Golgi incorporates cargo and membrane from the ER by a mechanism different from cisternal maturation. In my view, these results are consistent with the idea that the main intra-Golgi transport mechanism is cisternal maturation, but they also suggest the existence of secondary mechanisms that are used by some protein classes, and/or of backup mechanisms used by the system when maturation fails. Again, I feel that, in order to avoid confusing the reader in a field that is already rich in controversies, the authors should discuss these issues, which, incidentally, are referred to also in the Introduction."

Although cell growth is blocked by anchoring COPI, given the resolution of the growth curve data it is a formal possibility that partial COPI activity remains, and growth may not halt until after 1 or 2 more cell divisions. This might affect the interpretation of the data (especially the secretion phenotype), if partial COPI activity remains. The authors imply that because the sec21-3 mutant displays an identical secretion phenotype to the anchor-away COPI phenotype, it is likely that both methods result in complete inactivation of COPI. However, I think the authors need to demonstrate that the Golgi-ER COPI trafficking pathway is completely blocked by anchor-away inactivation of COPI. There are various \"retrieval assays\" in the literature. Another option would be to test by microscopy whether a protein that normally cycles between the ER and Golgi (i.e. a p24 protein or other cycling ER cargo receptor) is now exclusively found in the Golgi.</i> "

Yet the only data provided specifically in support of this new model is the statement \"our video microscopy revealed that most and perhaps all of the Kex2-labeled compartments acquire Sec7, suggesting that Kex2 recycles from older to younger cisternae within the Golgi\". I disagree with both the data and interpretations contained in this statement. First, by watching their videos it appears that there are a few smaller Kex2 structures that may disappear without acquiring Sec7. Second, if we assume the first part of the statement is correct, this observation is consistent with Kex2 being retrieved from endosomes (where it may reside for only a few seconds), via vesicles, to Golgi compartments that have not yet acquired Sec7. To my knowledge, the precise Golgi compartment that fuses with endosomally-derived vesicles has not been firmly established in yeast, but the Nakano lab found that Ypt6 precedes Sec7 at the Golgi (PNAS 2013). As Ypt6 (together with the GARP complex) is primarily responsible for tethering/fusing vesicles from endosomes, this suggests Kex2 retrieval from endosomes to the Golgi occurs at a stage of Golgi maturation just prior to acquisition of Sec7.

It is puzzling to me that in the sec21-3 mutant (permissive temperature) GFP-Vrg4 transits the Golgi and is sorted to the vacuole, but it remains in place (in the hybrid compartment) in anchor away cells. The reason may lie in incomplete inactivation of COPI in the sec21-3 mutant (the figure shows permissive temperature), but difference in outcome is striking and begs resolution. The only way that I can think of that might meaningfully address this would be to compare results with 'inert' anchor away targets. What, for example, happens when if FRB is appended to a Golgi resident (e.g., Vrg4), so that the cisterna is addressed to the mitochondrion, but COPI is not manipulated? Despite this shortcoming, I think that in its present form the manuscript makes an important contribution to the field, even though the message, as summarized in the title, may be open to continuing debate.</i> As described above, we now state that GFP-Vrg4 accumulates in post-Golgi compartments after prolonged treatment with rapamycin."

Evidence that COPI is required for maintaining the localization of Golgi residents (via Vps74/Golph3) has been available for some time (e.g., Tu and Banfield), but these previous observations are compatible both with the stable cisternae model and the cisternal maturation model. Thus, while not unexpected, these results are an important step towards establishing the molecular mechanism of cisternal maturation, and in principle deserve publication in a major journal such as eLife. They also raise the following questions and comments. The stabilization of cis Golgi markers in cis cisternae probably results from the specific type of COPI inactivation that is induced by the anchoring-away approach, which causes COPI to remain bound to the cis Golgi and so possibly to retain cis markers in the cis cisterna. However, the stabilization of the cis Golgi it is not the only possible outcome of COPI inactivation, under the maturation model. One might imagine, for instance, that if COPI were inactivated in a different way, e.g., by rapid degradation, this might cause cis markers to move forward along with cargo proteins to reach the vacuole or the plasma membrane. This is actually what happens when the COPI-bound adaptor Vps74 is removed: the Golgi enzymes leave the Golgi and move to the vacuole (Tu-Banfield). This apparent discrepancy might disconcert the reader. I therefore feel that the above point should be discussed, even though it does not in my view undermine the conclusion that COPI is needed for cis Golgi maturation.</i> "

However, the observation that the hybrid compartment can still absorb input from the ER and release secretory material towards the surface, albeit at slow rates, is difficult to reconcile with the maturation model. Since the recycling of cis markers is inhibited, and the formation of a new cis cisterna (a necessary step in the cisternal maturation mechanism) requires such recycling, a logical suggestion deriving from these data would be that the hybrid Golgi incorporates cargo and membrane from the ER by a mechanism different from cisternal maturation. In my view, these results are consistent with the idea that the main intra-Golgi transport mechanism is cisternal maturation, but they also suggest the existence of secondary mechanisms that are used by some protein classes, and/or of backup mechanisms used by the system when maturation fails. Again, I feel that, in order to avoid confusing the reader in a field that is already rich in controversies, the authors should discuss these issues, which, incidentally, are referred to also in the Introduction.</i> "

Furthermore, they have clarified the itinerary of Kex2. Therefore, I am in support of publication. My only remaining concern is a relatively minor one, which I would expect could be addressed through small changes in the text: Can the authors clarify in the text which of the studies cited in the Discussion on (tenth paragraph) demonstrated that AP-1 was involved in Kex2 trafficking and describe the Kex2-localization phenotype(s) seen previously by others in AP-1 mutant strains? In other words, what is the existing evidence in the literature that led to the model of AP-1 functioning in Kex2 traffic between the Golgi and endosomes? Furthermore, can the authors briefly discuss the established role of AP-1 in mammalian cells (i.e., papers from Bonifacino and other labs), and whether the authors think AP-1 has similar or different functions in yeast? I think explicitly addressing these points will help readers to better understand the insights from the current data in light of previous studies.</i> "
