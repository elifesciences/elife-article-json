Intriguingly, the ApoE receptor LRP4 and APP are also required for normal formation and function of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In this study, we show that APP interacts with LRP4, an obligate co-receptor for muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Agrin, a ligand for LRP4, also binds to APP and co-operatively enhances the interaction of APP with LRP4. In cultured myotubes, APP synergistically increases agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. Deletion of the transmembrane domain of LRP4 (LRP4 ECD) results in growth retardation of the NMJ, and these defects are markedly enhanced in APP<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>;LRP4<sup>ECD/ECD</sup> mice. Double mutant NMJs are significantly reduced in size and number, resulting in perinatal lethality. Our findings reveal novel roles for APP in regulating neuromuscular synapse formation through hetero-oligomeric interaction with LRP4 and agrin and thereby provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern NMJ formation and maintenance."

Intriguingly, the ApoE receptor LRP4 and APP are also required for normal formation and function of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In this study, we show that APP interacts with LRP4, an obligate co-receptor for muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Agrin, a ligand for LRP4, also binds to APP and co-operatively enhances the interaction of APP with LRP4. In cultured myotubes, APP synergistically increases agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. Deletion of the transmembrane domain of LRP4 (LRP4 ECD) results in growth retardation of the NMJ, and these defects are markedly enhanced in APP<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>;LRP4<sup>ECD/ECD</sup> mice. Double mutant NMJs are significantly reduced in size and number, resulting in perinatal lethality. Our findings reveal novel roles for APP in regulating neuromuscular synapse formation through hetero-oligomeric interaction with LRP4 and agrin and thereby provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern NMJ formation and maintenance."

This latter interaction leads to the formation of a complex between LRP4 and amyloid precursor protein that robustly promotes the formation of the neuromuscular junction. Mutations that remove the part of LRP4 that anchors it to the cell membrane weaken this complex and thus reduce the development of neuromuscular junctions in mice, especially if the animals also lack amyloid precursor protein."

Impaired cholinergic neurotransmission has been implicated in AD and this forms the conceptual basis for the therapeutic use of cholinesterase inhibitors. Both APP and LRP4 are required for normal NMJ formation, and the LRP4 ligand agrin is abundantly expressed in the CNS (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burgess et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">O\u2019Connor et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Stone and Nikolics, 1995</a>). Furthermore, MuSK localizes to excitatory synapses (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ksiazek et al., 2007</a>) and has been shown to mediate cholinergic responses, synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Garcia-Osta et al., 2006</a>), while agrin was found to regulate synaptogenesis (<a href=\"#bib44\">McCroskery et al., 2009</a>) and prevent synapse loss in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ksiazek et al., 2007</a>). These intriguing similarities between MuSK, agrin and ApoE receptors in synaptic maintenance and function prompted us to explore the NMJ as a model system on which potentially novel functional interactions between APP and ApoE receptors could be investigated. We found that LRP4 and APP physically bind to each other and that APP can also bind agrin. Ligation of LRP4 by immobilized APP can activate MuSK in the absence of neural agrin. Simultaneous and stoichiometric interaction of the three proteins favors the formation of a hetero-oligomeric complex, which may serve to focus the formation of the NMJ at the surface of the myotube."

We therefore generated three mutant <i>Lrp4</i> alleles in mice to test which domains of LRP4 are required for NMJ development. Consistent with the previous report that mice with point mutations in <i>Lrp4</i> die at birth (<a href=\"#bib59\">Weatherbee et al., 2006</a>), mice carrying a novel <i>Lrp4</i> null allele, which we generated by deleting exon 1 of murine <i>Lrp4</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), also die perinatally from a complete failure to form NMJs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). By contrast, mice carrying an <i>Lrp4</i> allele encoding a truncated receptor consisting of only the extracellular domain (ECD), but lacking the transmembrane segment and intracellular domain (ICD), are viable (<a href=\"#bib32\">Johnson et al., 2005</a>), indicating that at least partially functional NMJs must form and that thus neither membrane anchoring of the LRP4 ECD nor its ICD is absolutely required for the formation of the NMJ (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dietrich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gomez and Burden, 2011</a>). To further test this hypothesis, we first set out to determine to what extent membrane anchoring of the LRP4 receptor is required for NMJ formation. We examined NMJs of <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> mice, in which we introduced a stop codon immediately before the transmembrane segment. This results in the expression of LRP4 with the extracellular domain, but without the transmembrane domain or the intracellular domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Johnson et al., 2005</a>)."

However, several ApoE receptors have also been reported to interact directly or indirectly with APP (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kounnas et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ulery et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pietrzik et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hoe et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pietrzik and Jaeger, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marzolo and Bu, 2009</a>), and APP itself has been shown to participate in NMJ development (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). Taken together, these findings suggested that LRP4 might act synergistically with APP to regulate NMJ development and maintenance. To test this hypothesis, we bred <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> mice with <i>App</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice to generate <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> and <i>App</i> double mutant mice. We found that postnatal survival of compound mutant mice was markedly reduced when three wild-type <i>Lrp4</i> and <i>App</i> alleles were deleted (e.g., <i>Lrp4</i><sup>+/ECD</sup><i>App</i><sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> or <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup><i>App</i><sup>+/\u2013</sup>) and that the survival of double mutant mice (<i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup><i>App</i><sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup>) was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Because of this accelerated loss of the compound double mutant animals before weaning, we analyzed the NMJ in E18.5 embryos rather than in adults, as normal Mendelian distribution was observed at E18.5 in these mice (data not shown). As has been reported earlier (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2005</a>), normal size of AChR clusters was observed at the NMJ of <i>App</i><sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, d\u2013f, compared to wild type in subpanels a\u2013c, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> embryos, AChR cluster size was similar to wild-type muscles, but AChR density was decreased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, in <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup><i>App</i><sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> double mutant embryos, both the density and the size of AChR clusters were significantly reduced compared to wild-type, <i>App</i><sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> or <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> single mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, nerve terminal sprouting was markedly increased in the double mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,j\u2013l</a>). The significant reduction in the synaptic area of individual double mutant NMJs compared to wild type and <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> is also apparent in the three-dimensional rendition of individual synapses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,m\u2013o</a>). Similar findings were obtained in <i>Lrp4</i><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> mice lacking the amyloid precursor protein family member APLP2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which cooperates with APP in the development of the NMJ (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2005</a>)."

To test, whether APP and LRP4 interact directly, analogous to the interactions of APP with LRP1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kounnas et al., 1995</a>) and Apoer2 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hoe et al., 2005</a>), we performed a binding analysis using recombinant APP and LRP4 fusion proteins. The LRP4 ligand-binding domain (LBD) was fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the APP ECD was fused to the constant Fc region of human IgG. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows that specific, ectodomain-dependent interaction of both fusion proteins does indeed occur. To further corroborate these findings, we performed a cellular aggregation analysis in which we transiently co-transfected 293 cells with GFP and full length APP, or RFP and full length LRP4 plasmids, respectively. Equal numbers of red, green or both types of fluorescent cells were mixed, and the number of aggregates was scored (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Significantly more and larger aggregates formed in the presence of APP and LRP4 than in control experiments in which cells were only transfected with GFP, RFP, APP+GFP, and LRP4+RFP, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, note approximately equal numbers of APP and LRP4 expressing cells in the aggregates in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Although homophilic interaction of APP has been reported (<a href=\"#bib51\">Soba et al., 2005</a>), no increase in the number of large clusters was detected in wells containing only APP or LRP4 expressing cells, indicating a higher affinity of APP for LRP4 than for itself."

To test for this possibility, we exposed isolated myotubes to recombinant dimeric APP-Fc or RAP-Fc, an ER chaperone that binds the extracellular domains of ApoE receptors, that is LDL receptor family members (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fisher et al., 2006</a>) including LRP4 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ohazama et al., 2008</a>), with high affinity and thereby prevents the binding of most cognate ligands to this class of receptors (<a href=\"#bib28\">Herz et al., 1991</a>). To facilitate MuSK ligation, the Fc fusion proteins were immobilized on protein A beads and beads were incubated with isolated myotubes. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> shows that APP-Fc beads, but not RAP-Fc beads, significantly increased AChR clustering in the absence of exogenous neuronal agrin. When the same experiment was performed in the presence of a low concentration of agrin (0.1 ng/ml), again only APP-Fc, but not RAP-Fc, significantly increased AChR clustering. These results indicate that APP and agrin function synergistically through LRP4 to stimulate AChR clustering and NMJ formation. Interestingly, soluble APP-Fc not bound to beads was also able to promote AChR clustering, suggesting that focal clustering of APP on opposing beads is not required, but that the interaction of APP, either in a dimeric (APP-Fc) or monomeric (APP-FLAG) form (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), with the myotube surface is sufficient to induce initial clustering. The soluble LRP4-ligand binding domain (MBP-LRP4) was also capable of inducing clustering, alone or together with the APP-ectodomain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Moreover, the failure of RAP-Fc to induce AChR clustering suggests that LRP4 dimerization alone is not sufficient, but that possibly the formation of an extracellular scaffold (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bromann et al., 2004</a>) through interactions with other surface proteins, which can be mediated by APP and LRP4 ECD, is required."

RAP-Fc was used as a control and had no effect, whereas APP-Fc alone also dose-dependently increased MuSK phosphorylation, although not as effectively as agrin (2.4, 3.2 and 4.3-fold over baseline at 1\u00d7, 10\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 molar concentrations, respectively, compared to 0.1 nM agrin alone).

To test this hypothesis, we determined whether APP, LRP4 and MuSK form a stable complex in muscle in vivo. Wild-type embryonic muscle proteins were precipitated with antibodies against LRP4, as well as Apoer2 and LRP1, two other LDL receptor family members that are expressed in muscle and are known to interact with APP. Remarkably, only LRP4 co-precipitated with APP and with MuSK, indicating that these three proteins are already present in muscle in a preformed stable complex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>)."

To this end, LRP4-Fc, APP-Fc and RAP-Fc fusion proteins were prepared and incubated with a fixed concentration of agrin (100 ng/ml). LRP4-Fc efficiently bound agrin at much lower concentrations than was required to achieve comparable binding to APP-Fc (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), while RAP-Fc did not interact with agrin at all. To test whether the ability of APP to bind agrin, albeit at much lower affinity than LPR4, translates into a cooperative enhancement of the interaction of APP with LRP4, we incubated a fixed concentration of APP-Fc (100 ng/ml) with a fixed amount of LRP4-MBP (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of agrin. As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, agrin dose-dependently enhanced the interaction of LRP4 with APP at 10 ng/ml (1.3-fold) up to an optimal concentration ratio of 30 ng/ml (threefold higher binding than in the absence of agrin). Higher concentrations of agrin potently inhibited the interaction of LRP4 with APP to 60% of baseline at 100 ng/ml and 10% at 300 ng/ml, respectively. At 1000 ng/ml, which equates to an approximately 15-fold molar excess of agrin, LRP4 binding to APP was completely abolished. This finding suggests that LRP4 and APP may bind agrin through different epitopes. Independent binding of different agrin molecules to LRP4 and APP may thus induce steric inhibition, which prevents the formation of the favored hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of LRP4, APP, agrin and, on the surface of the myotube, MuSK."

Genetic epistasis experiments show that LRP4 and APP functionally interact to regulate NMJ development and maintenance. APP may accomplish this through several independent mechanisms: first, APP interacts directly with LRP4 and thereby is capable of activating MuSK (at a low level and independent of agrin) by ligating and clustering LRP4. Second, APP can also directly bind to agrin, albeit at lower affinity than LRP4. However, agrin cooperatively increases the stoichiometric interaction of APP with LRP4, which may serve to focus MuSK activation and thereby prevent aberrant AChR clustering. Third, APP and its homologues, which are expressed pre- and post-synaptically (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2005</a>), bind homomerically and heteromerically to each other (<a href=\"#bib51\">Soba et al., 2005</a>), thereby generating or strengthening attachment sites for nerve terminals (<a href=\"#bib53\">Torroja et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akaaboune et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Soba et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). By interacting simultaneously with LRP4 and agrin, APP and potentially APP-like proteins such as APLP2, which also participates in NMJ formation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2005</a>), would further serve to recruit all components necessary for AChR clustering into an area of maximal density, thereby ensuring that AChR clustering is restricted in vivo to the site of nerve contact. A rendition of this model is shown in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>."

APP\u2013LRP4 interaction in the absence of agrin may be able to activate MuSK signaling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) at low levels to promote AChR clustering on the muscle fiber membrane, raising the possibility that nerve and muscle-derived APP and APLP2 homo- or heterodimerization may be able to cooperatively promote AChR clustering in the absence of agrin, which provides a potential mechanism for the earlier observation that initial AChR clustering is independent of agrin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yang et al., 2001</a>). Neural agrin (red) enhances the APP\u2013LRP4 interaction and strongly activates MuSK (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7C and 8C</a>), which is consistent with the role of agrin in the stabilization and maintenance of NMJs. Cooperative binding of APP and agrin to LRP4 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) would further strengthen LRP4\u2013APP interaction on muscles, promoting synaptic differentiation and postnatal maintenance of NMJs (solid line with arrow in muscle fiber cytoplasm). By contrast, muscle agrin (gray), which cannot activate MuSK, would compete with decreasing concentrations of diffusible neural agrin at increasing distance from the NMJ and thus keep AChR clustering outside the nerve contact site suppressed. (<b>B</b>) Loss of the LRP4 membrane anchor results in a secreted ectodomain that remains partially functional through bivalent interactions with MuSK (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kim et al., 2008b</a>) and APP, resulting in reduced signaling (dashed line with arrow) and thus a hypomorphic NMJ developmental defect compatible with embryonic NMJ formation, but impaired postnatal maturation and maintenance of the NMJ."

The secreted LRP4 ectodomain that is encoded by our LRP4 ECD allele is presumably retained at the cell surface by simultaneous interactions with APP (possibly also APLPs), MuSK and agrin, but at levels that are insufficient to sustain the signal strength required for postnatal expansion of the synapse (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). Also supporting this model is the finding that initial AChR clustering is independent of neuronal agrin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yang et al., 2001</a>) and that rudimentary NMJs form in agrin-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gautam et al., 1996</a>), which suggested the existence of a second nerve derived organizing signal. By contrast, NMJs completely fail to form in <i>Musk</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">DeChiara et al., 1996</a>) and <i>Lrp4</i> (<a href=\"#bib59\">Weatherbee et al., 2006</a>) knockout mice, indicating an absolute requirement for MuSK and LRP4. Our finding that APP-Fc, but not RAP-Fc, can interact with LRP4 and induce MuSK phosphorylation at low level independent of agrin is consistent with both observations. Interestingly, however, and in contrast to our results with LRP4, the intracellular domain of APP appears to be required for normal NMJ development (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2010</a>). This suggests a role of these highly conserved C-terminal sequences in either signaling with APP serving as a co-receptor in the MuSK signaling complex, or a role in regulating the trafficking of all or part of the components of this complex."

In their study, Bromann and colleagues further showed that immobilized, but not soluble, agrin is able to aggregate MuSK and promote AChR clustering independent of MuSK\u2019s kinase activity, suggesting that MuSK scaffolding plays an important role in AChR clustering. Our findings show that APP is independently capable of promoting AChR clustering, and that it further enhances clustering in the presence of agrin. Moreover, agrin potentiates the interaction of APP with LRP4. Thus, it is conceivable that APP cooperates with agrin and LRP4 to establish such an extracellular scaffold to promote MuSK aggregation and AChR clustering. AChR clustering can also be mediated by a variety of agrin independent mechanisms, including treatment with neuraminidase and VVA lectin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin and Sanes, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grow et al., 1999a</a>,<a href=\"#bib24\">b</a>) and by defucosylation of muscle agrin, which unmask its ability to induce MuSK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2008a</a>)."

The reduced signal strength that results in impaired NMJ size and number can be explained by the inevitable reduction of LRP4 ectodomain at the NMJ and relative dilution of secreted ECD throughout the muscle surface and the interstitial space (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>).

In doing so, muscle agrin would serve to potently suppress the formation of aberrant signaling complexes by blocking LRP4 and APP family proteins with the inactive form.

Furthermore, they raise interesting new questions about the interplay of agrin, MuSK, APP and LRP4 in the CNS where all these proteins are also expressed. There they might, in principle, work together in an analogous or similar manner to regulate synaptogenesis and promote neuronal survival. LRP4 belongs to an evolutionarily conserved class of ApoE receptors with essential functions in the regulation of neurotransmission at glutamatergic synapses (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herz and Chen, 2006</a>). We have recently shown that ApoE in an AD-associated, isoform-specific manner impairs ApoE receptor recycling at central synapses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2010b</a>) and that this impairs the ability of ApoE receptor-dependent signals to prevent \u03b2-amyloid induced synaptic suppression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Durakoglugil et al., 2009</a>). The findings we have reported here, together with those by Wang et al., who have proposed that perturbed APP synaptic adhesion activity may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and AD pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), reaffirm the NMJ as a versatile and useful experimental model system on which the cell biology of ApoE, APP and ApoE receptor trafficking and its pathobiology at peripheral and central synapses can be investigated."

Muscles were minced into small pieces before enzymatic digestion for 45 min at 37\u00b0C in HBSS supplemented with 2 mg/ml of Type II collagenase (Worthington) and 0.4 mg/ml of DNAse l (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). Dissociated muscle cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 5 min, resuspended in culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum and 1% chick embryo extracts), and filtered through a Cell Strainer with diameter of 100 \u00b5m (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA). Cells were then seeded on a 100-mm culture dish and incubated in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 2 hr in order to attach and remove fibroblasts. Suspended myoblasts were collected by centrifugation at 2000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 5 min and seeded on 8-well plastic chamber slides (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). After growing cells in the culture medium until approximately 90% confluence, the culture medium was replaced with differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum), and this medium was changed every day for 3 days to fuse myoblasts into myotubes for the AChR clustering assay as described."

Ideally it should be shown in vivo that LRP4 without the LBD cannot rescue, but LRP4 wt can rescue the null phenotypes. At the very least, in vitro studies should be performed to see if APP-induced AChR clustering and MuSK activation requires the LBD. Moreover, description of this domain should be included in the Results rather than within the Methods. This domain, aa 27\u2013349, has been shown to interact with MuSK.

Because of the redundancy of APP and APLP2, we will need to study agrin/APP/APLP2 triple mutant mice to properly evaluate the effect. Due to the time required for this extensive breeding we have not obtained the triple mutant mice. However, we have evaluated the implication of APP and APLP2 in the prepatterning of AChR clusters in E14.5 APP/APLP2 double mutant muscle. As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, AChRs are clustered along the central region of E14.5 APP/APLP2 double mutant muscle. Intriguingly, individual AChR clusters appear less robust compared with those in the wild type, APP null or APLP2 null muscles. These results demonstrate that prepatterned AChR clustering can occur in the absence of APP and APLP2."

It is interesting that the results published by Steven Burden\u02bcs group (Yumoto, et al., Nature 2012) and Mei Lin\u02bcs group (Wu, et al., Neuron 2012) have shown that LRP4 expressed in non-muscle cells can induce presynaptic differentiation by aggregating presynaptic markers such as synapsin and SV2. Furthermore, studies from Lin Mei\u02bcs group (Wu et al., Neuron, 2012) have shown that muscle specific deletion of LRP4 impairs both pre and postsynaptic development of the NMJ and that LRP4 in motor neurons is necessary for presynaptic differentiation of motor axons. It is tempting to speculate that APP, APLP2, or both, may serve as the neuronal ligand for LRP4 in inducing presynaptic differentiation. However, in vivo evidence indicates that APP/APLP2 is unlikely to be the major player in inducing presynaptic differentiation, because presynaptic differentiation is only mildly affected in neuronal specific deletion of APP/APLP2 (Wang et al., J Neuroscience 2009)."

We agree that in a future study one might address whether the interaction of LRP4, APP, agrin and MuSK can also be regulated by the various signal modulators (Wise, Dkk, Sost) that we have previously shown to bind to LRP4. Incidentally, Wise, Dkk and Sost all interact with the homologous \u03b2-propeller domain in LRP5/6.
