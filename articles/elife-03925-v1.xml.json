We analyzed national survey data from children aged 6\u201359 months in four sub-Saharan African countries over an 18-month time period, to determine the risk of <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. parasitemia (n=8390) and <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> HRP-2 (<i>Pf</i>HRP-2)-related antigenemia (n=6121) following vitamin A supplementation and standard vaccination. Bacille Calmette Guerin-vaccinated children were more likely to be <i>Pf</i>HRP-2 positive (relative risk [RR]=4.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.00\u20138.28). No association was identified with parasitemia. Measles and polio vaccination were not associated with malaria. Children receiving vitamin A were less likely to present with parasitemia (RR=0.46, 95% CI=0.39\u20130.54) and antigenemia (RR=0.23, 95% CI=0.17\u20130.29). Future studies focusing on climate seasonality, placental malaria and HIV are needed to characterize better the association between vitamin A and malaria infection in different settings."

We analyzed national survey data from children aged 6\u201359 months in four sub-Saharan African countries over an 18-month time period, to determine the risk of <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. parasitemia (n=8390) and <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> HRP-2 (<i>Pf</i>HRP-2)-related antigenemia (n=6121) following vitamin A supplementation and standard vaccination. Bacille Calmette Guerin-vaccinated children were more likely to be <i>Pf</i>HRP-2 positive (relative risk [RR]=4.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.00\u20138.28). No association was identified with parasitemia. Measles and polio vaccination were not associated with malaria. Children receiving vitamin A were less likely to present with parasitemia (RR=0.46, 95% CI=0.39\u20130.54) and antigenemia (RR=0.23, 95% CI=0.17\u20130.29). Future studies focusing on climate seasonality, placental malaria and HIV are needed to characterize better the association between vitamin A and malaria infection in different settings."

A vaccine that fully prevents it has not yet been discovered. Most cases of malaria occur among children living in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where many receive routine vaccinations designed to prevent other diseases; for example, 75% of children in sub-Saharan Africa receive measles vaccines. Many also receive vitamin A supplements, which have been linked not only to the protection of a child's vision, but also to a lower risk of death and an improved ability to fight off infections."

In particular, early evidence from murine models indicates that injection with live strains of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine may confer sterilizing protection against <i>Plasmodium</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 1976</a>). However, this effect seems to depend on several factors including route of administration (intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular vs intravenous), type of immunogen used (killed vs live attenuated), vaccine schedule in relation to malaria exposure (before vs after infection), mouse strain, sex, and <i>Plasmodium</i> species tested (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Smrkovski and Strickland, 1978</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">Smrkovski, 1981</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Murphy, 1981</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">Matsumoto et al., 2000</a>). Conversely, the risk of malaria infection has been thought to increase during downregulation in cellular immunity (including interleukin-12, interferon-gamma, T cells) and T helper (Th) 2 cell upregulation following measles infection and/or immunization (<a href=\"#bib12\">Desai et al., 2005</a>).

Vitamin A is thought to act as a regulator of pro-inflammatory response genes (e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha) and phagocytotic clearance (e.g. cluster of differentiation 36 [CD36]) of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>-infected erythrocytes, by way of its active metabolite, retinoic acid (<a href=\"#bib42\">SanJoaquin and Molyneux, 2009</a>). Less certain is its impact on malaria infection. While vitamin A did not appear to modulate the risk of parasitemia in a clinical trial study of Ghanaian children (<a href=\"#bib5\">Binka et al., 1995</a>) and Tanzanian children previously hospitalized with pneumonia (<a href=\"#bib52\">Villamor et al., 2003</a>), a cluster randomized intervention trial for breastfeeding in Uganda observed a sixfold decrease in the adjusted risk of malaria infection among children receiving vitamin A (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nankabirwa et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, concern has been raised by an apparent increase in levels of parasitemia within mouse models, when combining vitamin A supplements with DTP vaccination; an effect thought to be stronger among female mice (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jorgensen et al., 2011</a>). The underlying mechanisms of these effects are unclear, although it has been theorized that vitamin A may act as adjuvant to DTP, which is postulated to cause detrimental effects (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jorgensen et al., 2011</a>)."

Although HIV testing was not conducted among children, the mothers of 2540 subjects were tested for HIV. Twenty-four (0.94%) were seropositive, suggesting that the potential for vertical transmission might be low. There were no significant differences in seropositivity across countries."

Still, it contradicts suggestions that when combined with DTP (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jorgensen et al., 2011</a>), vitamin A may increase the risk of malaria infection. Not only did we identify a protective association between vitamin A and malaria in a study population with high immunization coverage for BCG, DTP, and poliomyelitis, we also found in unadjusted models that DTP did not modify vitamin A's association with malaria. We found no indication of an elevated gender effect for either DTP or vitamin A, although the latter seemed to be more protective among children living in communities with higher allele frequencies for X-linked G6PDd. It is unclear how vitamin A could interact with G6PD to influence the risk of malaria infection; the only literature discussion regarding vitamin A and G6PD is limited to animal findings on adipose and lipogenic activities (<a href=\"#bib19\">Higueret et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arana et al., 2008</a>). However, G6PDd is independently related to risk reductions in malaria, a driving factor in the high prevalence of G6PDd across Africa (<a href=\"#bib21\">Howes et al., 2013</a>). G6PDd is also expressed more often in boys than girls due to the X-linked nature of the gene (<a href=\"#bib21\">Howes et al., 2013</a>). All of the epidemiological evidence to support the detrimental gender-based effects from vitamin A and DTP on child mortality comes from Guinea Bissau (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Benn et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib2a\">B2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fisker et al., 2013</a>).

Although our models adjusted for factors that could explain study population differences between blood film and antigenemia models, to address this issue further we ran a sensitivity analysis using blood film data including/excluding Mozambique. This analysis showed that when Mozambique data were excluded from blood film analysis, the magnitude of protective vitamin A effects in both blood film and antigenemia models were nearly identical. Blood films and antigenemia readings are used to identify two different outcomes (i.e. blood films test for <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. while antigenemia test for one particular type of <i>Plasmodium</i> [<i>P. falciparum</i>])<i>.</i> However, due to geography, blood films were likely to be detecting <i>P. falciparum</i> due to geography (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gething et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2012</a>). This would explain the similar results identified between blood film and antigenemia results when excluding Mozambique data from our analysis. We have chosen to present data in this paper that includes Mozambique because these results provide more conservative estimates of vitamin A effects when using blood films.

Moreover, because of the observational nature of our study design, high-quality randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of vitamin A in preventing malaria, particularly among children exposed to placental malaria. This includes further clarification regarding optimal dosages and the time sequence in which vitamin A is administered in relation to other vaccines, as well as more accurate measures with regard to HbS and G6PDd allele frequency. In particular, our study only considered information regarding the last recorded dose of vitamin A supplement rather than a child's history of supplementation. Given that vitamin A is fat soluble and can be stored in the liver for long periods of time (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blomhoff, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tanumihardjo, 2011</a>), additional research is needed to examine whether regular supplementation has an impact on increased protection."

Foremost among these concerns is the time lag between rainfall and vegetation response, as dormant vegetation does not immediately become green following the return of seasonal rains (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nicholson et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Davenport and Nicholson, 1993</a>). This issue will create a temporal offset between EVI and rainfall that may complicate the interpretation of the results of this research. However, this concern will be partially mitigated by a similarly lagged response to rainfall in populations of vector species responsible for spreading <i>Plasmodium</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mbogo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Galardo et al., 2009</a>). Another concern when using EVI as a proxy for rainfall relates to non-uniform responses of vegetation to rainfall that reflect long-term moisture conditions (via land cover) rather than seasonal oscillations (<a href=\"#bib49\">Townshend and Justice, 1986</a>). This issue is most apparent when comparing dry season EVI values in grasslands to those in forests, as forests tend to retain more green vegetation (and thus have higher EVI values) even when dry due to deeper root systems, etc. A second aspect of EVI linked to land cover differences is the speed at which vegetation responds to rainfall, as plants in drier ecosystems have evolved to respond more quickly to infrequent rain events (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ogle and Reynolds, 2004</a>). For this research, differing responses to land cover are accounted for by deriving unique EVI curves for each survey cluster location, thus creating relative metrics based on only localized (i.e. per-cell) EVI values rather than regional summaries that contain responses of multiple land cover types."

To address this issue, we adjusted a subgroup of models for maternal HIV status. While the protective association between vitamin A and malaria remained, the low prevalence of maternal HIV in our study population (and hence low statistical power) makes it difficult to rule out potential vitamin A\u2013HIV interactions. Further research is needed to evaluate potential interactions between vitamin A, HIV and malaria infection."

By utilizing MODIS data from sensors located on both the Aqua and Terra satellite platforms, the temporal resolution of the final EVI dataset was increased to 8 days, or 46 grids (i.e. rasters or images) per year.

Due to cloud cover, which was particularly problematic in forested regions of equatorial west Africa, a cloud-filling algorithm was applied to each EVI grid to create a spatially complete dataset (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Weiss et al., 2014</a>).

Thick blood smears were prepared by trained technicians for all children, and sent for gold standard testing of malaria to the Centre National de Recherche et de Formation sur le Paludisme (Burkina Faso), Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00f5es em Sa\u00fade de Manhi\u00e7a (Mozambique), TRAC/Plus Malaria Unit in Kigali (Rwanda) and Department of Parasitology at the Universit\u00e9 Cheikh Anta Diop (Senegal). Internal quality control was conducted using standard laboratory protocol and procedures, including having slides randomly read by different laboratory technicians or the chief technician/supervisor for internal quality control measures. External quality control (Mozambique only) included selecting samples by a computerized system developed by ICF Macro and sending them for external quality control testing at the Muraz Center (Bobo-Dioulasso)."

To test for linear trends, covariates were included as continuous terms in the regression model. We adjusted models for continuous variables of age and wealth index score, and categorical variables of gender (boy vs girl), malaria treatment during previous week (yes vs no), ownership of bed net (yes vs no), proportion of household members under 5 years old using bed net during previous night (none, all, some, or no bed net), indoor household insecticide spraying (yes vs no), malaria transmission season (dry vs wet), community setting (urban vs rural), mother's highest educational level (none, incomplete primary, complete primary, incomplete secondary, complete secondary, post-secondary), and access to antenatal care during last pregnancy (yes vs no).

HIV tests for adults were anonymous, with survey data only being linked to test results after respondent identifiers were deleted from the database. Although HIV test results were not available to study participants, patients were offered cards enabling them to obtain free HIV testing and counselling at Voluntary Testing Centers. The Institutional Review Board of ICF Macro reviewed and approved the MEASURE Demographic and Health Surveys Project Phase III, in compliance with United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulation 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46 for \u2018Protection of Human Subjects\u2019 research. Protocols for blood specimen collection, HIV and malaria testing were also approved by ICF Macro International Institutional Review Board (IRB) [all countries] in compliance with U.S. DHHS regulation 45 CFR 46 for \u2018Protection of Human Subjects\u2019 research, National Ethics Committees [Burkina Faso, Rwanda and Senegal] and U.S. Centers for Disease Control [Rwanda only]. For Senegal, supervisory visits were also organized by the National Ethics Committee to ensure field compliance with ethical regulations. Geographical waypoints were randomly displaced to ensure confidentiality [Urban PSU: positional error of 0\u20132 km; and, Rural PSU: positional error of 0\u20135 km (99% of clusters), or 0\u201310 km error (1% of clusters)]. DHS provided anonymized data to study authors. As a secondary analysis of publically available de-identified data, the study was determined exempt from ethics review by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health IRB Office according to U.S. DHHS regulation 45 CFR 46.102 for non-human subject research."

The authors conclude that BCG vaccination did not influence malaria parasitemia but did increase P\u0192HRP2 antigenemia, while vitamin A supplementation reduced the prevalence of both parasitemia and antigenemia. The BCG effect on antigenemia was thought to be due to an increase in false positivity due to Chagas disease or <i>Schistosomiasis</i>. Due to the low malaria burden in two of the four countries, the study is driven by data from Burkina Faso and Mozambique. If confirmed, the findings are of importance to the many children living in high malaria infection zones\u2014with potential policy impact."
