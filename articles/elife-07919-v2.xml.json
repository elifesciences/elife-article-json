We analyzed inhibitory synaptic events induced by cortical, fast-spiking (FS) basket cells which innervate dendritic shafts and spines as well as pyramidal cell somata. Serial electron micrograph (EMg) reconstructions showed that somatic synapses were larger than dendritic contacts. Simulations with precise anatomical and physiological data reveal functional differences between different innervation styles. FS cell soma-targeting synapses initiate a strong, global inhibition, those on shafts inhibit more restricted dendritic zones, while synapses on spines may mediate a strictly local veto. Thus, FS cell synapses of different sizes and sites provide functionally diverse forms of pyramidal cell inhibition."

We analyzed inhibitory synaptic events induced by cortical, fast-spiking (FS) basket cells which innervate dendritic shafts and spines as well as pyramidal cell somata. Serial electron micrograph (EMg) reconstructions showed that somatic synapses were larger than dendritic contacts. Simulations with precise anatomical and physiological data reveal functional differences between different innervation styles. FS cell soma-targeting synapses initiate a strong, global inhibition, those on shafts inhibit more restricted dendritic zones, while synapses on spines may mediate a strictly local veto. Thus, FS cell synapses of different sizes and sites provide functionally diverse forms of pyramidal cell inhibition."

To send information around these circuits, neurons \u2018fire\u2019 electrical signals along their length. These trigger the release of chemicals across a structure\u2014known as the synapse\u2014that forms a connection with a neighboring cell. Different types of neurons affect their neighbors in different ways. For example, signals from a pyramidal cell make it more likely that the next cell in the circuit will fire, whereas a signal sent by an inhibitory interneuron has the opposite effect. Pyramidal cells and interneurons make up the circuits in the brain's outer layer\u2014the cortex."

Each consists of a cable-like axon that can efficiently transmit electrical signals, and a cell body that contains the nucleus. The cell body bears numerous short branches called dendrites, which are in turn covered in bump-like protrusions called spines. Synapses typically form between the end of one cell's axon and a dendrite on another cell. However, synapses can also form between the end of an axon and an individual dendritic spine, or the end of an axon and a cell body."

However, Kubota et al. have now combined electron microscopy with electrode recordings of the activity of pairs of connected cells to show that the size and ability of inhibitory synapses to inhibit signaling varies depending on their location. Specifically, inhibitory synapses that form with the cell bodies of pyramidal cells are larger and inhibit signaling more strongly than those that form with dendrites, which are in turn larger and more inhibitory than those on dendritic spines."

It will also help when modeling disorders in which inhibitory networks are disrupted, such as schizophrenia and depression."

Inhibitory circuits regulate cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kubota et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kubota, 2014</a>), development and plasticity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hensch, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Donato et al., 2013</a>). Perturbed inhibitory function is associated with pathologies including epilepsy, autism and schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gonzalez-Burgos et al., 2010</a>). However, mechanisms controlling inhibitory synaptic actions are incompletely understood. For instance, inhibitory synapses target multiple membrane domains of pyramidal cells: soma, axon initial segment, dendritic shafts and spines (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kisvarday et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Szabadics et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kubota et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>). Contacts at these different sites produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) with different properties (<a href=\"#bib46\">Miles et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Xue et al., 2014</a>)."

Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) are significantly smaller in neurons of Disc1 mice, a genetic model of depression, and may underlie reduced low-gamma oscillations in the frontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sauer et al., 2015</a>). GABA receptors on spine heads are thought to control local synaptic excitation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chiu et al., 2013</a>). However the structural basis for these effects remains unclear. Modeling studies assume that somatic, dendritic shaft and spine inhibition is mediated by pre-synaptic elements of identical size and strength (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gidon and Segev, 2012</a>). In contrast, excitatory synaptic terminals vary in size and their strength is correlated with terminal size (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holderith et al., 2012</a>). We therefore examined this point for cortical inhibition by correlating structural and functional properties of synapses of FS basket cells on layer V (L5) pyramidal cells of rat frontal cortex. Physiological and anatomical data from paired recordings let us simulate the dendro-somatic conduction of the effects of inhibitory synapses made on different membrane sites on pyramidal cells. We show that synapses made by FS basket cells on the soma and on dendritic shafts and spines have dramatically different functional effects."

We investigated connections between FS basket cells and CCS pyramidal cells, identified by injecting a fluorescent retrograde tracer into the contralateral striatum (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). IPSCs were evoked in postsynaptic CCS pyramidal cell soma by single APs in FS basket cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). With pyramidal cell membrane potential maintained at \u221265 mV, IPSCs reversed on average at \u221252.5 mV (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), providing a mean driving force of 12.5 mV. After recording and biocytin-filling, axonal and dendritic morphology and the number and distribution of possible synaptic contacts from each coupled pair were analyzed (n = 10) using <i>Neurolucida</i> software (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E,G\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D,F\u2013I</a>). Paired recordings were made from neighboring cells (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, inter-somatic distance: 44.5 \u00b1 23.7 \u00b5m, 20.6\u201366.6 \u00b5m, n = 10). There was typically a large overlap of the basal dendrites of postsynaptic pyramidal cells and the axonal arbor of presynaptic FS basket cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In three cell pairs, FS basket cell axons established putative synaptic contacts on the soma and dendrites of a postsynaptic CCS pyramidal cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, upper three lines). In seven pairs, synaptic contacts were located exclusively on dendrites at various distances from the soma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, lower 7 lines). The number of putative synaptic contacts was 5\u201314 (8.2 \u00b1 4.8, 10 pairs). Most light microscopic contacts were made where FS basket cell axons crossed basal pyramidal cell dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E,H,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Marlin and Carter, 2014</a>). The distance from the soma to dendritic contacts was 5.8\u2013208.4 \u00b5m with a mean value of 82.5 \u00b1 50.0 \u00b5m. Peak IPSC amplitude was larger in pairs with putative somatic contacts than those when contacts were exclusively dendritic (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Transmission never failed for pairs with somatic contacts but failures occurred with dendritic contacts (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Mean IPSC amplitude, from pairs with only dendritic contacts, was reduced at increasing distances from the soma to the nearest contact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). IPSCs were not detected in two pairs, where light microscopy (LM) suggested 7 and 9 contacts were made at distances further than 33 \u00b5m from the soma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, lower 2 lines). In each case the pyramidal cell elicited large EPSC in the interneurons (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

At larger synaptic junctions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into presynaptic terminals is greater, transmitter release probability is increased (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holderith et al., 2012</a>) and the number of postsynaptic receptors is larger (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nusser et al., 1997</a>). We tested this relation for inhibitory transmission by comparing summed synaptic junction area with maximal IPSC amplitude for pairs CS56 and CS55. Maximal IPSCs (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>) were assumed to occur when all somatic and proximal dendritic terminals (&lt;33 \u00b5m) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013E</a>) released transmitter. The unit electrical charge was calculated as the maximum charge divided by the summed junction area of S1\u2013S4: 326.1 fC/0.95 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>, or, 343.3 fC \u00b5m<sup>\u22122</sup> for pair CS56, and S1\u2013S13, D1\u2013D4, Sp1\u2013Sp4: 1057.8 fC/3.011 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>, or 351.3 fC \u00b5m<sup>\u22122</sup> for pair CS55 (<a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>). This parameter was similar for the two connections, suggesting that currents are well correlated with synaptic junction area. Thus at these inhibitory synapses, conductance can be calculated from junctional area based on the unit IPSC electric charge using morphologically realistic CS56 postsynaptic pyramidal model cell based on our measurement of the cell dimensions (see \u2018Materials and method\u2019, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

We asked how these differences in synaptic site and junctional size affect function in simulations based on our measurements of synaptic currents and dimensions. IPSC propagation was examined on an electrotonic simulation of the pyramidal cell from pair CS56. Injecting a 0.11 nS current on the spine head of Sp1 (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) resulted in a strong 0.78 mV hyperpolarization of the spine, but only 0.12 mV was transmitted to the basal dendrite and 0.07 mV to the soma (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C,K</a>). The peak synaptic current was 1.27 pA at the spine head, and 0.81 pA at the soma (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). At noise levels of \u223c10 pA (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), a spine-head IPSC would not be detected at the soma. The spine neck effectively isolated the spine head from the dendritic shaft (neck length, 0.5 \u00b5m; diameter, 0.07 \u00b5m; volume, 0.043 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>; resistance, 500 M\u03a9 [<a href=\"#bib19\">Harnett et al., 2012</a>]). Thus spine inhibition did not change nearby dendritic shaft or somatic potential (<a href=\"#bib1\">Araya et al., 2006</a>). In contrast, injecting a 0.21 nS synaptic current on the dendritic shaft (D1) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) caused a hyperpolarization of 0.23 mV on the shaft and 0.13 mV at the soma (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,F,K</a>). The spine head Sp1 was hyperpolarized without attenuation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harnett et al., 2012</a>), while the D1 synapse reached only 30% of the Sp1 synapse peak membrane potential. The peak synaptic current was 2.45 pA at the spine head, and 1.55 pA at the soma (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Injecting a synaptic waveform of 0.71 nS at the soma (S1) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) hyperpolarized that site by 0.48 mV (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,H</a>) resulting in an IPSC of 8.29 pA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>), in the range of background noise. Simultaneous activation of somatic contacts S1\u2013S4 resulted in a hyperpolarization of 1.33 mV, corresponding to a somatic current of 22.67 pA, (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I,J</a>) similar to IPSP amplitudes from paired recordings of FS basket cells to hippocampal pyramidal cells (0.5\u20133 mV) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Buhl et al., 1994</a>) and our own data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Thus for a similar driving force, proximal inhibitory synapses produce larger somatic hyperpolarizations than distal ones (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>)."

We modeled the Sp1 spine to ask how spine-head IPSCs affect these excitatory thalamic signals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gulledge et al., 2012</a>). Excitatory synaptic events (0.2 nS) were greatly reduced by a coincident spine-head IPSC (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>). Excitation of the spine-head site depolarized the pyramidal cell soma by 0.12 mV. Simulated release from four somatic inhibitory synaptic sites hyperpolarized the soma by 1.33 mV. Thus inhibition from clustered somatic synapses of one FS basket cell effectively suppressed dendro-somatic conduction of inputs from \u223c11 excitatory spine synapses. If release probability depends on terminal size (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holderith et al., 2012</a>), then GABA may be infrequently liberated from smaller inhibitory terminals made by FS basket cells at dendritic sites. Since inhibitory synapses from a single cell usually contact different, distant dendrites, resulting hyperpolarizations may sum poorly (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Even so, summation of integrated dendritic signals during inhibitory cell firing at frequencies of 40\u201350 Hz (<a href=\"#bib23\">Isomura et al., 2009</a>) together with GABAergic shunting effects (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gidon and Segev, 2012</a>) may permit FS cell synapses to suppress excitatory inputs on innervated dendritic branches (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cossart et al., 2001</a>).

These distinct effects depend on differences in junctional size. Local spine or shaft potential changes are small and locally restricted. In contrast, somatic inhibitory currents are large, and summation of events from several somatic terminals produces a global control of pyramidal cell excitation. Somatic junctions have large areas, suggesting high release probability (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holderith et al., 2012</a>) and typically contact multiple sites (<a href=\"#bib3\">Buhl et al., 1994</a>). This enhances the likelihood of simultaneous release as FS cells fire repetitively at 30\u201350 Hz during motor behaviors in vivo (<a href=\"#bib23\">Isomura et al., 2009</a>). Some FS basket cell connections with pyramidal cells involved exclusively dendritic sites while others consisted of both peri-somatic and proximal dendritic contacts. Spines receiving inhibitory synapses are typically large (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kubota et al., 2007</a>) and their thalamic excitatory inputs presumably express both NMDA and AMPA receptors (<a href=\"#bib44\">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kubota et al., 2007</a>).

The veto by inhibitory synapses terminating on spines may be especially important for such plastic changes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Pyramidal cell dendritic spines are tuned to distinct modalities and spines with similar preferences may not cluster together on the same dendritic branch but averaged across a neuron biased towards the orientation tuning of the cell\u2019s output (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Inhibitory synapses on dendritic shafts may then inhibit tuned/untuned excitatory inputs on the same but not different dendritic branches and so efficiently and specifically adjust pyramidal cell activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marlin and Carter, 2014</a>). Our data shows dendritic IPSCs may exert strictly local effects. Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> reversal potential at distal dendrite/spine synapses may normally be close to the local resting membrane potential. However this small driving force would be increased by depolarization due to dendritic EPSPs. IPSPs will then reduce EPSP amplitude at the soma even if they do not propagate somatically.

Since postsynaptic target size is related to input resistance and synaptic junction area to the number of post-synaptic receptors (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nusser et al., 1997</a>), alterations in synaptic dimensions may govern the size of GABAergic currents. The dependence of synaptic terminal areas on postsynaptic dendritic cross sectional areas would tend to maintain a constant ratio of synaptic conductance to post-synaptic input resistance. Thus, presynaptic interneuron actions are efficiently regulated to provide an appropriate hyperpolarization of their post-synaptic target (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</a>)."

At inhibitory synapses, currents are also correlated with release probability, docking site number and receptor number (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nusser et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pulido et al., 2015</a>). Synaptic junctional area should then govern IPSC amplitudes. Surprisingly unit IPSCs from recordings in this work were quite similar, suggesting that the inhibitory synaptic current is well correlated with synaptic junction area. Larger synapses may generate larger IPSCs, due to multiple release sites or higher numbers of post-synaptic receptors. The presence of multiple release sites at some synaptic junctions has been shown by anatomy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holderith et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nakamura et al., 2015</a>) or estimated from neurophysiological data (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nakamura et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pulido et al., 2015</a>). Clusters of the Cav2.1 Ca-channels in large synaptic junctions have been correlated with estimates of the number of vesicular docking sites. GABA release from multiple sites in a large synapse could saturate post-synaptic receptors and initiate large synaptic currents of similar amplitude, as at single-terminal synaptic connections made by molecular layer interneurons of the cerebellum. In contrast, the IPSCs examined here were mediated by multiple synaptic contacts of FS basket cells on L5 CCS pyramidal cells. IPSC amplitude fluctuations presumably reflected variations and failures in release from different terminals."

Projecting to a specified zone, an axon could make contacts nonspecifically with any available target neuron (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fino and Yuste, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Packer and Yuste, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Packer et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively synaptic contacts may be established preferentially with specific neuronal subtypes or target domains, such as soma, axon or dendrites (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>). Target preference may depend on an activity dependent control of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input size in order to maintain E/I balance (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xue et al., 2014</a>). Our data show FS basket cells may form synaptic contacts with the perisomatic region of post-synaptic pyramidal cells or with their proximal dendritic shafts and spines. Inhibitory synaptic junctional area was matched to the synaptic site\u2014it was larger at somatic than dendritic sites and larger at synapses made with shafts than at those made with dendritic spines. Molecular cues to recognize a somatic or dendritic innervation site may include chemoattractive and cell adhesion molecules. Such mechanisms are involved in a segregation of dendritic spine inhibitory inputs and distinct sources of afferent excitation. Spines innervated by FS basket cell terminals also receive excitatory synapses from thalamus, but never recurrent cortical pyramidal cell inputs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kubota et al., 2007</a>). Both activity dependent chemoattractant factors (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yee et al., 1999</a>) and cell adhesion molecules of the protocadherin family (<a href=\"#bib45\">Meguro et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yagi, 2015</a>) have been linked to this specificity.

Quantitative 3-D EM reconstructions provide an exact basis to assign different weights to inhibitory synapses that contact different sites.

Rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame and the skull on the injection hemisphere was partially removed and the cortex, hippocampus and fimbria caudal to the striatum were suctioned to prevent the spilling of dye into the cortex during injection. Cholera toxin subunit B conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (CTB-555; C34776, Invitrogen, NY) was used as the retrograde tracer (0.2% dissolved in distilled water). Injection site was determined by using stereotaxic coordinates (0.8 mm posterior to bregma, 2.5 mm lateral to the midline, depth 4 mm) and a glass pipette (tip diameter is around 100 micron) filled with CTB-555 was inserted to the striatum obliquely. Injection (80\u2013100 nl) was performed using positive pressure from a pneumatic pico-pump (PV-820, World Precision Instrument, Sarasota, FL).

Postsynaptic current amplitude was measured as the difference between the peak current, measured from a 1.5 ms window centered at the peak, and the average baseline current, measured in a 4 ms window preceding the presynaptic AP. The decay time constant was obtained by fitting the decay phase of postsynaptic current with a double exponential equation.

On average 100 traces (range 50\u2013150) were analyzed for each experiment. Postsynaptic currents smaller than 2 times the noise level were discarded as failures, and the amplitudes of the remaining postsynaptic currents were analyzed.

Both reviewers praised the novelty and importance of the data. Therefore, only few minor comments have been raised which I am attaching below. One reviewer was concerned about the mechanisms which may underlie the decision whether a dendritic or a perisomatic synapse is formed by PV cells. Since distance is an important determinant in this decision process, the reviewer wondered how the PV cell may know how distant its axon is located in relation to the soma. Furthermore, the density of the provided information is very high. The second reviewer was therefore asking for improvement in the presentation of the data to thereby allow a better readability of the manuscript."

The authors are experts in their field and therefore performed the reconstruction as well as paired recordings and computational analysis on the attenuation and deceleration of IPSCs from the location of their origin to the somatic recording site, quite well. My main concern is related to the question of how does the neuron now whether it should form a perisomatic or dendritic synapses. One possibility could be that certain molecular mechanisms are involved. Alternatively, the overall effect of this form of distance-dependent synapse location on the somato-dendritic domain of target cells may simply depend on postnatal development.

The authors report that the scaled inhibitory responses on the three cellular compartments of pyramidal neurons are correlated with the terminal size. The study supports the notion that the findings reveal a general principle according to which the junctional area of inhibitory synapses is correlated to the postsynaptic target size. Furthermore, based on simulations the question is addressed how differences in junctional and synaptic size affect function. The computational data support the notion that functional differences can be accounted for by differences in junctional size. Whether the rule according to which terminal size is related to synaptic efficacy is present also for other types of inhibitoy neurons remains to be seen. At least for fast-spiking interneuron synapses onto pyramidal cells, the authors convincingly show that there is a clear relation between size and efficacy of synaptic terminals."
