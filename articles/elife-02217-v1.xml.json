Kinesin-5 motors crosslink adjacent microtubules to drive or constrain their sliding apart, but the structural basis of their organization is unknown. In this study, we report the atomic structure of the bipolar assembly (BASS) domain that directs four Kinesin-5 subunits to form a bipolar minifilament. BASS is a novel 26-nm four-helix bundle, consisting of two anti-parallel coiled-coils at its center, stabilized by alternating hydrophobic and ionic four-helical interfaces, which based on mutagenesis experiments, are critical for tetramerization. Strikingly, N-terminal BASS helices bend as they emerge from the central bundle, swapping partner helices, to form dimeric parallel coiled-coils at both ends, which are offset by 90\u00b0. We propose that BASS is a mechanically stable, plectonemically-coiled junction, transmitting forces between Kinesin-5 motor dimers during microtubule sliding."

Kinesin-5 motors crosslink adjacent microtubules to drive or constrain their sliding apart, but the structural basis of their organization is unknown. In this study, we report the atomic structure of the bipolar assembly (BASS) domain that directs four Kinesin-5 subunits to form a bipolar minifilament. BASS is a novel 26-nm four-helix bundle, consisting of two anti-parallel coiled-coils at its center, stabilized by alternating hydrophobic and ionic four-helical interfaces, which based on mutagenesis experiments, are critical for tetramerization. Strikingly, N-terminal BASS helices bend as they emerge from the central bundle, swapping partner helices, to form dimeric parallel coiled-coils at both ends, which are offset by 90\u00b0. We propose that BASS is a mechanically stable, plectonemically-coiled junction, transmitting forces between Kinesin-5 motor dimers during microtubule sliding."

This process depends upon the action of a bipolar, macromolecular machine, the mitotic spindle, which uses dynamic microtubules (MTs) plus multiple kinesin and dynein motors to generate the piconewton-scale forces required for mitotic movements (<a href=\"#bib23\">Loughlin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goshima and Scholey, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Walczak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">McIntosh et al., 2012</a>). Of these, the MT-based motor, Kinesin-5 plays a key role, being essential for the assembly of bipolar spindles in most eukaryotic cells and driving or constraining the rate of spindle elongation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Enos and Morris, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sawin et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Saunders et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brust-Mascher et al., 2009</a>). Purified, native Kinesin-5 is a \u2018slow\u2019, plus-end-directed, bipolar, homotetrameric motor capable of using pairs of N-terminal motor domains at opposite ends of a central rod to crosslink MTs into bundles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cole et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kashina et al., 1996a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">1996b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gordon and Roof, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, single Kinesin-5 holoenzymes can crosslink and slide adjacent MTs, displaying a threefold preference for MTs in the antiparallel vs the parallel orientation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hentrich and Surrey, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kapitein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Weinger et al., 2011</a>). Together, these data support the hypothesis that Kinesin-5 functions via a \u2018sliding filament\u2019 mechanism, crosslinking adjacent MTs into bundles throughout the spindle (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sharp et al., 1999</a>), and exerting outward or braking forces on antiparallel MTs to coordinate bipolar spindle assembly and to drive or constrain poleward flux and anaphase B spindle elongation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Valentine et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kaseda et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Scholey, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012</a>). In this model, the assembly of four Kinesin-5 polypeptides into a bipolar, tetrameric minifilament is crucial, but the molecular basis of this arrangement, which is, so far as we know, unique among MT-based motor proteins, remains unclear."

A characteristic feature of kinesin motors is the presence of a pair of adjacent motor domains capable of hydrolyzing ATP to walk in a hand-over-hand fashion along a MT track, thereby generating force and motion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vale and Milligan, 2000</a>). The adjacent motor domains are oriented by a parallel, \u03b1-helical coiled-coil rod that is capable of transmitting forces generated by the pairs of motor domains at one end of the rod to the associated cargo at the other end. The striking bipolar organization of Kinesin-5 family motor proteins means that the cargo for each motile unit (i.e., the pair of motor domains stepping along a MT protofilament) is another motile unit located at the opposite end of the bipolar minifilament. Therefore, the central rod must be able to transmit forces between pairs of motor domains located at its opposite ends in order to drive or constrain MT\u2013MT crosslinking and sliding within the mitotic spindle, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. Moreover, because the homotetrameric architecture of Kinesin-5 appears to be required for MT\u2013MT crosslinking and for normal mitosis and cell division (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hildebrandt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tao et al., 2006</a>), it is plausible to think that the disruption of its bipolar, oligomeric state could inhibit the rapid divisions of proliferating cancer cells, thereby providing a strategy for cancer therapy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Owens, 2013</a>). Therefore, understanding how Kinesin-5 adopts its bipolar architecture is an important problem whose solution could lead to medical applications in addition to advancing our understanding of the basic mechanisms of motor protein function and mitosis."

It is likely that the ability of this domain to organize four Kinesin-5 subunits into a bipolar minifilament and to transfer forces between pairs of motor domains situated at opposite ends of a 60-nm rod is essential for Kinesin-5 activity and mitotic cell viability (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hildebrandt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tao et al., 2006</a>). To better understand how the BASS domain promotes the assembly of Kinesin-5 into bipolar tetramers, we determined its structure using X-ray crystallography and validated the structure using structure-based mutational analysis. Instead of the expected antiparallel arrangement of two side-by-side parallel coiled-coils proposed previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kashina et al., 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>), we find that the BASS domain has a novel four-helix bundle structure, which very likely has important implications for its mechanism of action within the spindle."

This BASS tetramer formed hexagonal (P6<sub>4</sub>22) crystals, which were used to determine its structure to 2.6-\u00c5 resolution using X-ray crystallography with the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method from selenomethionine-and mercury-derived crystals (Materials and methods; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

It consists of a 220-\u00c5-long central bundle that is visible by EM and matches fairly well to other anti-parallel four-helix bundles, where helical axes are separated by equal distances (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, panel III) but then transitions to an asymmetric diamond-shaped bundle near its ends, where C-terminal helical axes become displaced and N-terminal helical axes are closer mediated by helical bends, termed elbows (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The diamond shape helical organization at the poles brings the N-terminal ends of the helices at each pole into close juxtaposition so they emerge as parallel coiled-coil dimers, which were not resolved by EM (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>), with a 90\u00b0 rotational offset with respect to each other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This 26-nm BASS domain lies at the center of the rigid 60-nm Kinesin-5 central rod and can direct the assembly of four KLP61F subunits into a bipolar Kinesin-5 tetramer with pairs of N-terminal motor domains on each end capable of processive hand-over-hand motility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; see discussion in section entitled \u2018Model for the Kinesin-5 minifilament\u2019 below). The unique anti-parallel BASS organization presented here is structurally novel as it does not match the initial predictions of an anti-parallel arrangement of parallel coiled-coils across the central helical rod region (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kashina et al., 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>), yet it is entirely consistent with all previous data on the BASS domain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>). The BASS structure may be representative of a new class of force-pliable four-helical anti-parallel junctions capable of orienting two dimeric coiled-coils in opposite directions."

                                "text": "Alternating hydrophobic and ionic interfaces specify the assembly of the four BASS monomers to form a rigid central bundle. Dimeric anti-parallel coiled-coils are stabilized by complementary hydrophobic residues between <i>a</i> and <i>d</i> positions of the heptad repeat that are guided by salt bridges in the <i>e</i> and <i>g</i> positions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). The tetrameric central bundle displays a precise and unusual pattern of alternating hydrophobic and ionic interfaces between the four helices, not previously observed in other anti-parallel coiled-coil bundles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 5, 6</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ernst and Brunger, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yadav et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fujiwara and Minor, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Neculai et al.</a>. This pattern can be clearly observed by electrostatic surface representation of the BASS tetramer (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Each interface occupies approximately three alpha-helical turns on each helix within the bundle, starting at the center with interface A of the BASS tetramer and symmetrically extending toward both ends with paired interfaces B\u2013F (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2 and 3</a>). The hydrophobic central interface (A) is bracketed by an ionic interface (B), another hydrophobic interface (C), and finally another ionic interface (D) positioned at the \u2018elbows\u2019 marking the transition between anti-parallel four-helix bundle and parallel coiled-coils at the ends (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Interface A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, panel IV) is composed of Met729, 730 and 733 from two helices and Leu725 and 726 from the anti-parallel helix. In other Kinesin-5 orthologs, conservative substitutions of the cluster of methionine residues to other bulky hydrophobic residues are universally observed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Interface B lies outside interface A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, panel III), and consists of salt bridges between Arg716 and Glu715 within a single chain, and Glu715/Glu722 and Arg740 residues of anti-parallel helices. Lys737 also engages the conserved Asp723 residues of the non-partner anti-parallel helices. Arg740 and Glu722 are highly conserved and are present in other species at equivalent positions or 3\u20134 residues apart positioning them on the same side of the helices in the bundle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These ionic interfaces are solution-accessible and contain visible electron density for several ordered water and cryoprotectant molecules. On the edges of interface B, hydrophobic heptad interfaces stabilize each BASS anti-parallel dimer, involving conserved Leu725 and 718 engaging the conserved Ile736. Next, the hydrophobic interface C is composed of Leu705, 708, and 712 in two helices engaging Met747, Leu751, and Met754 in anti-parallel helices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, panel II). At the edge of interface C, complementary salt bridges are observed between Glu704 and 711 with His750 of the non-partner anti-parallel helices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, panel II). Interface D lies at the elbow region, and involves two Arg761 residues engaging both Asp701 residues of the anti-parallel subunits at the center of the bundle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, panel I). In total, these seven unique interfaces in the central bundle provide highly precise environments to form the tetramer (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Such a precise pattern of alternating complementary interfaces was not observed in other four-helical bundles, and is likely to be specifically required for the precise architecture of the Kinesin-5 bipolar minifilament. It may serve to mechanically stabilize the central rod\u2019s organization while transmitting forces between the two pairs of N-terminal motor domains at opposite ends of the tetramer. Moreover, the ionic interfaces B and D are open molecular pockets that are critical for specifying Kinesin-5 organization and are accessible to small molecules, such as the cryoprotectants observed in our structure. These pockets provide a new potential target site for small molecules that, instead of inhibiting the activity of the conserved kinesin superfamily motor domain in the manner of monastrol and related inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maliga et al., 2002</a>), may interfere with Kinesin-5 oligomerization by disrupting these salt bridges to inhibit Kinesin-5 biopolar tetrameric assembly and function during mitosis."

                                "text": "A second striking and unexpected feature revealed by the BASS tetramer structure is the transition from this anti-parallel four-helix central bundle to an asymmetric diamond-shaped four-helix bundle near its ends (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 4, 6</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). This transition promotes a swap in helical organizations, from anti-parallel coiled-coil dimers in the central bundle to parallel coiled-coil dimers at its ends. The swap transition is promoted by two helical \u2018elbows\u2019 in which Pro699 and Gly693 bend the helices by 10\u00b0 which ultimately bring the N-terminal helices at each pole into close proximity, emerging as parallel coiled-coils associating directly through heptad residue packing on opposite ends with a 90\u00b0 rotational offset around the filament axis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 4 and 6</a>). Near the ends of the bundle, two interfaces mediate these helical swaps: a hydrophobic interface (E) and a di-tyrosine interface (F) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">video 3</a>). Interface E (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, panel III) maintains a 45\u00b0 rotated anti-parallel four-helix bundle organization via Met687, Leu691, Leu694 of two helices packing with Met768 and Ile772 of the anti-parallel helices in a four-helix hydrophobic packing interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, panel II and V). Within interface F, C-terminal helices are positioned further away from center of the bundle axis, due to two Tyr residues whose rings undergo end-to-end hydrogen bonding between their hydroxyl groups. Two His683 residues of the N-terminal helices stack their imidazole rings against Tyr775 residues through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions to stabilize their end-on orientations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, panel II). Bulky residues Tyr775 or His683 are conserved suggesting that this motif is retained with some modifications in all Kinesin-5 orthologs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Beyond interface F, the N-terminal helices swap organization to form parallel coiled-coils between residues 670\u2013640 stabilized by hydrophobic <i>a</i> and <i>d</i> heptad packing interaction (pCC interface). Two heptad interactions are observed between the two N-terminal helices, with two half heptads at each N- and C-terminal end. Ile651, His658 and Met665 form the \u2018d\u2019 positions, and Asn655, Leu662, and Phe669 form the \u2018a\u2019 positions in these heptads. Phe669-Phe669 residues pack using \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the C-termini to form parallel coiled-coil structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>, panel I). In Kinesin-5 sequence alignments, the last two heptads contain a Phe residue in either <i>a</i> or <i>d</i> position, which is likely to stabilize the reorganization at the tips of the N-terminal parallel coiled-coil structures via benzyl\u2013benzyl ring interactions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This suggests that the N-termini of full-length Kinesin-5 extending beyond the boundaries of the BASS tetramer likely form continuous parallel coiled-coils."

As expected (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>), wild-type BASS forms a monodisperse tetramer based on gel filtration chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 8B</a>). Mutations that target residues within various hydrophobic and ionic interfaces in the BASS central bundle cause defects in BASS oligomerization, observed as a shift in the protein\u2019s elution profile from tetramers (broken vertical line) to monomers (solid line) or an intermediate, presumptively dimeric species (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2 and 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Strikingly, single Arg740 and Arg761 residue mutations in interfaces B and D of BASS cause potent defects in specifying BASS tetramers producing a mixture of dimer and tetramer species (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u2013I</a>). In contrast, mutagenesis of the region where helix-swapping forms parallel coiled-coils at the ends of the BASS domain (Phe669Glu BASS mutant) remained tetrameric (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2 and 3</a>). Mutagenesis of multiple interfaces across the tetramer, for example interfaces A and F (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J\u2013K</a>); interfaces, A, F and the parallel coiled-coil swap regions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>); and interfaces A, B, C, D, F and the swap region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8M</a>) enhanced the disruptive effects of the single mutants and produced monomeric BASS species (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2 and 3</a>). Our mutational analysis validates the proposed BASS tetrameric organization revealed by the structure by demonstrating the critical roles of the alternating interfaces in forming and stabilizing the BASS tetramer and further suggests that both hydrophobic and ionic interfaces have cumulative guiding roles in selectively organizing the BASS tetramer fold and stabilizing the Kinesin-5 tetramer minifilaments. The strong defects observed for single Arg BASS mutants (Arg740 and 761) suggest that small molecules that interfere with these ionic interactions in BASS interfaces B and D can disrupt Kinesin-5 minifilament assembly and may inactivate Kinesin-5 sliding motility."

Our model was built by superimposing dimeric parallel coiled-coils at the bipolar ends of the BASS tetramer structure (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) and indicates that; (i) the rigid tetrameric fold of the Kinesin-5 BASS domain into bipolar tetramers dictates long-range strict structural and functional assembly of helical coiled-coils N-terminal to BASS with the helical section C-terminal to BASS (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We modeled the Kinesin-5 motor and tail domain to lie at the ends of the central rod, consistent with EM and with them both binding MTs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</a>). The anti-parallel organization of BASS dimers likely produces head-to-tail junctions at the bipolar ends of Kinesin-5 coupling two dimeric kinesin heads with the conserved C-terminal tails, by traversing in the opposite orientation within the central rod filament; and (ii) The Kinesin-5 sequences C-terminal to BASS may not be fully helical nor form coiled-coil structures because their length is shorter than the length of the N-terminal-to-BASS domain coiled-coils (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 9</a>). Moreover, while the overall model length matches that seen by EM, the rod itself is longer than that observed, similar to the Kinesin-1 rod (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>). Further high-resolution structural studies of the longer regions of the Kinesin-5 rod filament lying outside the BASS and motor domains (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bodey et al., 2009</a>) will be required to further refine the full Kinesin-5 bipolar tetramer model."

The structure explains how Kinesin-5 assembles into bipolar, homotetrameric minifilaments, but what are the biological implications of the BASS domain structure? Our main findings are that; (i) the central bundle of the BASS tetramer is a novel anti-parallel coiled-coil four-helix bundle, which is held together by a unique and alternating arrangement of hydrophobic and ionic interfaces; and (ii) helical bends, at the outer ends of the central bundle promote transitions into parallel coiled-coils, which are offset by 90\u00b0 around the filament axis with respect to each other. One significant consequence of this structure is that the BASS tetramer orchestrates a parallel organization and rotational offset of the pairs of motor domains at each end of a Kinesin-5 minifilament resembling the organization of the two motor domains comprising the motile end of the unipolar Kinesin-1 motor. This organization may be important in allowing the adjacent motor domains on either end of a Kinesin-5 minifilament to step processively in a hand-over-hand fashion along each MT (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vale and Milligan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Valentine et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kaseda et al., 2009</a>), thus enabling the Kinesin-5 tetramer to slide MTs outward or to constrain their sliding apart within the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kapitein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hentrich and Surrey, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Weinger et al. 2011</a>). A second consequence is that the four helices of the BASS domain are highly intertwined, in a manner reminiscent of the plectonemic coiling of the two polynucleotide chains of a DNA double helix, far more so than the simple association of two anti-parallel side-by-side dimeric coiled-coils proposed previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kashina et al., 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2013</a>). The resulting heavily intertwined four-helix bundle is likely to be torsionally stiff, and this may be crucial in setting the 90\u00b0 offset between the two dimeric ends of the BASS structure. This offset could in turn contribute to the motor\u2019s observed threefold preference for crosslinking anti-parallel vs parallel MTs (<a href=\"#bib43\">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</a>) but further work is required to test this idea. We hypothesize that the nature of the bundling of the BASS domain is critical for the Kinesin-5-mediated sliding filament mechanism because it functionally links the pairs of motor domains located at opposite ends of the Kinesin-5 minifilament by transmitting forces and possibly allowing allosteric signaling between them (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Thus, we propose that the alternating pattern of interfaces revealed by the BASS structure serves not only to specify the assembly of Kinesin-5 subunits into bipolar tetramers, but also to increase central rod stability during force transmission in a manner that facilitates its ability to push apart or to restrain the sliding apart of cross-linked MTs. Measuring the magnitude of forces that the rod can transmit or withstand would be a useful test of this idea, but this is currently not technically feasible. Finally, we note that we have obtained no convincing evidence for the assembly of Kinesin-5 tetramers into higher order oligomers, and the extensive inter-twining of its four chain makes it\u2019s dissociation into, for example, dimers during force transmission unlikely. Thus it seems reasonable to propose that the Kinesin-5 bipolar tetramer represents the functional unit of Kinesin-5 activity, consistent with motility assays (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kapitein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Weinger et al., 2011</a>)."

The bipolar organization of Kinesin-5 resembles that of the bipolar class 2 myosin filament that drives the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction, cytokinesis and other forms of motility in non-muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huxley, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Turbedsky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Billington et al., 2013</a>). However, whereas varying numbers of myosin-2 motors can assemble into filaments of variable length, all capable of pulling actin filaments inward, we propose that the unique structure of the BASS domain allows it to organize four Kinesin-5 subunits into stable, mechanically robust bipolar tetramers of uniform length, that represent functional units capable of bearing both compressive and tensile forces as they slide cross-linked MTs outward, or resist their outward sliding. Finally, we speculate that our structure may enable the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting the ionic interfaces within the BASS central bundle, leading to the disruption of Kinesin-5 tetramer assembly and inhibiting its function in rapidly proliferating cancer cells, thereby providing a possible avenue towards therapeutic intervention (<a href=\"#bib28\">Owens, 2013</a>)."

Multiple crystallization conditions were identified; however, 0.1\u20130.2 \u00b5m hexagonal-shaped crystals were obtained and refined using 4\u20136% (+/\u2212) 2-Methyl-2, 4-pentanediol (MPD), 100 mM MES pH 6\u20136.5. Crystals appeared in 1 week and grew to maximal size in 3 weeks. SeMet BASS protein also formed hexagonal crystals using similar conditions to native BASS. For cryo-protection, native- and SeMet BASS crystals were transferred to solutions with higher MPD concentrations or rapidly immersed in Paratone oil before freezing in liquid nitrogen by looping in nylon loops. 1 mM Mercury (II) nitrate was added to drop solutions containing native crystals to produce mercury-substituted crystals, which were cryo-frozen as described above. X-ray diffraction was screened using 96-position cassettes using robotic auto-mounting system at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) using either 14-1 or 12-2 beamlines. More than 150 native and 80 SeMet BASS crystals were screened."

                                "text": "BASS native X-ray diffraction data were anisotropic at best, diffracting to 3.1 \u00c5 in one direction and 2.6 \u00c5 in the other directions. X-ray diffraction data were indexed with program imosfilm and scaled with Scala (<a href=\"#bib30\">Project, 1994</a>), combined with ellipsoidal truncation and anisotropic scaling, which included 84% completeness in the overall resolution shells. We used 2.6 \u00c5 as the high-resolution cut-off to avoid excessive loss of completeness. Selenium edge X-ray diffraction data set was collected at 0.9792 \u00c5 wavelength. The diffraction was also anisotropic (minimum Bragg spacing 2.9 \u00c5, and 3.1 \u00c5 in the weakest, intermediate, and strongest diffracting directions). We used 2.9 \u00c5 as the high-resolution cut-off with 92% completeness in the overall resolution shells. The data set was not adequate to provide phase information directly, due to high number of Met at the hexagonal sixfold axis. Phase information was initially determined using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) method, using a 3.8 \u00c5 Mercury diffraction data set collected at the Mercury anomalous edge at 1.007 \u00c5 wavelength, with the program SHELEXD (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sheldrick 2010</a>). Five heavy atom sites were identified and refined with SHELEXD. Initial BASS electron density was used to build backbone density for short helical segments, which were then combined with the heavy atom sites to further refine phases in PHENIX suite (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2002</a>). Selenium substructures were obtained by running Phaser (<a href=\"#bib25\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) in its MR-SAD mode with phases from BASS-Hg poly-alanine model. These phases were subjected to automatic density modification with solvent flattening and histogram matching as implemented in PHENIX. Automatic chain tracing with the program RESOLVE yielded several helical fragments. Manual tracing in the program COOT was used to fill the gaps (<a href=\"#bib8\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>). For the native BASS, phase was obtained by rigid body refinement using SeMet BASS as the initial model. Model building was carried out using COOT. The selenomethionine and native BASS data were refined using PHENIX program to <i>R</i><sub>free</sub>/<i>R</i><sub>work</sub> (0.27/0.24) and 0.25/0.22, respectively. The stereochemical quality of the models was assessed using the program PROCHECK and MolProbity. The native BASS model includes two chains with density observed for residues 640\u2013791 and 660\u2013795 for the two chains. The final selenomethionine BASS model, described here, includes two BASS subunits, including residues 640\u2013802 and 648\u2013802 of the two chains. Residues 803\u2013843 were disordered and not observed in the BASS structures. All structural rendering figures were generated using UCSFchimera (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The Kinesin-5 model was built using a combination of COOT, O and PyMOL programs (<a href=\"#bib7\">DeLano, 2002</a>). We reasoned that the BASS domain is asymmetrically positioned in a phylogenetically conserved position within the Kinesin-5 primary sequence, 280 residues C-terminal to the motor domain and 120 residues N-terminal to the tail domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Sequences between the BASS and motor domains (KLP61F residues 361\u2013640) are likely helical with a high coiled-coil propensity, as measured by PAIRCOILS2, whereas sequences C-terminal to the BASS domain but upstream of the tail (residues 796\u2013922) are predicted to form short helical segments, but with very low coiled-coil prediction scores (data not shown). To construct a model of the rigid Kinesin-5 central rod region, we overlaid a canonical parallel coiled-coil structure (tropomyosin; PDB ID 1C1G) onto the extreme N-termini of the BASS tetramer structure, where it has transitioned to a parallel coiled-coil conformation (C-alpha r.m.s.d. = 1.4 \u00c5 for 14 residues overlaid per chain). We extended each parallel coiled-coil region by 230 residues to form a 79-nm long rod."

What kind of load on the coiled-coil stalk do the authors envision? I would think that the sketch in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> is highly schematic or do they envision lateral bending as important? Is there any evidence for that? A simple possibility would be that the stalk is always extensionally stressed. Compression seems unlikely because buckling would not need much force. Clearly a motor can push filaments apart in any direction while it is itself under extensional stress. In this vein, as far as the load on the motor goes, it does not make sense to distinguish between \u201cinward pulling\u201d and \u201coutward pushing\u201d. The difference between those two modes only affects the filaments that are being pushed or pulled, not the motors that could in both cases be either under compression or extension."
