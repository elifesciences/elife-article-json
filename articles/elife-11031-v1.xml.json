Motivated by qualitative observations and quantitative perturbations of crawling in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae, we construct a minimal integrative mathematical model for its locomotion. Our model couples the excitation-inhibition circuits in the nervous system to force production in the muscles and body movement in a frictional environment, thence linking neural dynamics to body mechanics via sensory feedback in a heterogeneous environment. Our results explain the basic observed phenomenology of crawling with and without proprioception, and elucidate the stabilizing role that proprioception plays in producing a robust crawling phenotype in the presence of biological perturbations. More generally, our approach allows us to make testable predictions on the effect of changing body-environment interactions on crawling, and serves as a step in the development of hierarchical models linking cellular processes to behavior."

Motivated by qualitative observations and quantitative perturbations of crawling in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae, we construct a minimal integrative mathematical model for its locomotion. Our model couples the excitation-inhibition circuits in the nervous system to force production in the muscles and body movement in a frictional environment, thence linking neural dynamics to body mechanics via sensory feedback in a heterogeneous environment. Our results explain the basic observed phenomenology of crawling with and without proprioception, and elucidate the stabilizing role that proprioception plays in producing a robust crawling phenotype in the presence of biological perturbations. More generally, our approach allows us to make testable predictions on the effect of changing body-environment interactions on crawling, and serves as a step in the development of hierarchical models linking cellular processes to behavior."

However, most studies focus on rhythmic gait and its maintenance in an organism driven by the presence of a central pattern generator (CPG) that drives coordinated motor activity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marder and Bucher, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ijspeert, 2008</a>). While the existence of a CPG has been validated in a variety of organisms (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marder and Bucher, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grillner, 2006</a>) and exploited in artificial systems (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ijspeert, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Boxerbaum et al., 2012</a>), growing evidence suggests that sensory feedback plays an important role in maintaining robust and stable locomotion. Indeed recent studies on <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boyle et al., 2012</a>) focusing on local sensory feedback and proprioception show that these modalities suffice to modulate the locomotory pattern and explain gait transitions associated with undulatory swimming and crawling, without the need for a central pattern generator. This has led to recent attempts to include proprioceptive coupling and build an integrative theory of locomotion in examples such as anguilliform swimming in fish (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ekeberg, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ekeberg and Grillner, 1999</a>), swimming in leech (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cang and Friesen, 2002</a>), walking in insects (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kukillaya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Proctor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Proctor and Holmes, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Holmes et al., 2006</a>) and humanoids (<a href=\"#bib45\">Verdaasdonk et al., 2009</a>). However, the complexity of the brain-body-environment coupling in these organismal systems has been a substantial impediment in the use of models to make testable predictions on the biological mechanisms regulating locomotion."

                        "text": "Here, we consider the rectilinear crawling behavior of a model organism, the larva of the fruit fly, <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), which has increasingly become the focus of molecular, cellular, genetic and behavioral studies using a variety of experimental probes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Suster and Bate, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fox et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Crisp et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lahiri et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Inada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Berni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Crisp et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fushiki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gjorgjieva et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Itakura et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pulver et al., 2015</a>). The larva is a soft bodied cylindrical organism about 4 mm in length and about\u00a0800\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0in diameter in the third instar stage. It moves in a manner similar to other long soft-bodied creatures such as earthworms and leeches by exploiting the peristaltic propagation of muscular relaxation and contraction waves along their bodies to induce forward locomotion, or crawling (<a href=\"#bib42\">Trueman, 1975</a>); despite biomechanical differences between these different organisms, the crawling gait seems to be a convergent strategy across species. The dynamical process that triggers, coordinates and maintains the propagation of such waves has attracted the attention of researchers for a century (<a href=\"#bib15\">Garrey, 1915</a>). Early experimental efforts tried to understand the macroscopic mechanics of soft bodied animal locomotion (<a href=\"#bib42\">Trueman, 1975</a>) by focusing on one of the underlying subsystems: body mechanics, muscular force production and neural dynamics. More recently, there is a growing realization that the coupling between the nervous system, the body and the substrate in the presence of sensory feedback plays a major role in development and maintenance of\u00a0crawling gaits, and perhaps even in evolution (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chiel et al., 2009</a>). For example, the locomotory behavior of <i>Manduca sexta</i> larvae, an organism where proprioceptive sensing displays a wide range of behaviors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Simon and Trimmer, 2009</a>), is known to be dependent on substrate stiffness that modulates the role of external stimuli and on body deformation rate (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin and Trimmer, 2010</a>). In the <i>D. melanogaster</i> larva, there is strong evidence that proprioception plays as important a role as the CPG in generating coordinated motion. Eliminating proprioception with genetic (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>) and optogenetic (<a href=\"#bib23\">Inada et al., 2011</a>) methods leads to qualitative changes in the crawling gait: peristaltic waves have a period that is \u22484 times longer or may even stop propagating (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2007</a>), and body segments contract \u22482 times more (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>). Experiments that block sensory input in the embryo show that crawling behavior still develops in the larva, but with longer peristaltic wave periods (<a href=\"#bib41\">Suster and Bate, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fushiki et al., 2013</a>), providing further evidence for the importance of proprioception. Together, the classical and modern studies on locomotory physiology and the modern studies on the molecular and cellular subsystems in the larva suggest that it is an excellent biophysical testbed for an integrative theory that spans multiple scales."

This leads to the prediction that there should be much more variability in crawling metrics among individuals with silenced or weakened proprioception. Furthermore, we predict that larvae could use the strength of CPG coupling as a means of controlling the speed of gait. Finally, we show that changing the frictional interactions of the organism with the substrate should yield observable effects on the efficiency of locomotion."

Each unit has a neural controller made of excitation-inhibition circuits in the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC), which governs the reaction time of excitation in the neural controller. The excitatory neurons act also as motor neurons, and drive a muscle within the segment, which exerts a contractile force to the segment when activated. Crawling occurs on a substrate when the force rises above a threshold controlled by friction.

One of them feeds the excitatory neurons in the next anterior segment and propagates the neural activity. The other signal feeds to the inhibitory neurons in the same segment, leading to the inhibition of excitatory neurons that then causes contraction to be stopped. This model of proprioception is consistent with the 'mission accomplished' model of proprioception, proposed in\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>). 2) A neural channel that is mediated by excitatory neurons in adjacent segments that are coupled from posterior to anterior direction."

At the beginning of each crawling cycle, it has been observed that the head and the tail of a larva move concurrently in a motion called the 'visceral piston phase' of crawling (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Simon et al., 2010</a>), because the gut moves with the head and the tail, in advance of the surrounding body tissues. We model this behavior by forcing the displacement of head and tail segments to be the same. Once the peristaltic wave reaches the head, it propagates to the tail through assumed long range neural and proprioceptive couplings of T2 and A8 segments, and a new wave is initiated."

The mechanism underlying the tail-head coordination during the visceral piston phase is unknown, however the observation that the gut moves together with the head and the tail (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>), is consistent with the suggestion that the gut mechanically couples the head and the tail and leads to visceral piston-like action as seen in other organisms such as the <i>Manduca sexta</i> larvae (<a href=\"#bib39\">Simon et al., 2010</a>). We chose to minimally implement this coupling by linking the head and the tail with a rod, i.e. an infinitely stiff spring, thus enforcing a 'periodic' boundary condition that leads to concurrent head-tail movement. Softening the spring will introduce a small temporal delay and allows for changes in the length of the larva during peristalsis, but does not change the qualitative nature of our results. Our model ignores the frictional interactions of the gut with the body segments, however in the absence of experimental data to guide modeling such interactions, we choose to keep our model minimal. Another mechanism for enforcing such periodic boundary condition could be synchronized neural drive at the head and the tail segments, which requires more elaborate models that we explore in the Appendix 1."

We see that head and tail segments move together in the visceral piston phase (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Simon et al., 2010</a>), followed by a peristaltic wave with neural activity leading in phase, followed by muscular and contraction activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), propagating from posterior to anterior segments. Crawling can be stopped by shutting down the activity of excitatory neurons in the most posterior segment by an inhibitory input (see also section 3.1.2)."

Specifically, during forward crawling, period-positive median segmental interneurons (PMSIs) were found to be activated slightly later than the motor neurons in the same segment (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>) and their optogenetic activation leads to inhibition of motor neuron activity locally, arresting peristaltic crawling. These observations match nicely with the dynamics of the inhibitory neurons in our model, which are activated slightly later than the excitatory neurons in the same segment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Further, increasing their activity above what is normally seen during normal crawling led to the local arrest of crawling.

To understand these further, we investigate the propagation delays through both the neural and proprioceptive channels. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, we plot three quantities: 1) the time it takes for excitatory neurons in neighboring segments to cross <math id=\"inf155\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></math> (threshold to activate muscular forces) in the presence of proprioception (blue line), which quantifies segment-to-segment signal propagation delay, 2) the time for supra-threshold activation of excitatory neurons without proprioception (dashed red line), which quantifies the propagation delay through the neural channel, and 3) the time it takes for the excitatory population in a segment to cross <math id=\"inf156\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></math> and the turning on of proprioceptive signal in that population (black line), which quantifies the propagation delay through the proprioceptive channel. We see that segment-to-segment signal propagation in the full model follows the faster channel, while in the proprioception silenced model it always follows the neural channel. Proprioceptive propagation delay becomes comparable to neural propagation delay around <math id=\"inf157\"><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2248</mo><mn>0.65</mn></mrow></math>, the threshold when the metrics of crawling with and without proprioception cross-over.

Above this threshold, neural propagation is faster, but proprioception still has a stabilizing effect in this regime because of its inhibitory effect on the neural activity in the moving segment, neutralizing strong excitation. Furthermore, the proprioceptive channel gets slower beyond the cross-over point: it takes longer for a segment to contract to the proprioceptive threshold point. This is consistent with decreased peak contraction and increased number of simultaneously moving segments."

Thus we see an effect on neural propagation due to a change in the mechanical interaction with the substrate, clearly showing how we cannot ignore the triad of nervous system-body-substrate in continuous conversation with each other. The speed of the larva (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) also follows an interesting trend; with decreasing friction, speed first increases due to larger step sizes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), even though the frequency of peristaltic waves decreases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), but eventually saturates. Peak contraction of segments increase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) with decreased friction. These effects on behavior are clear testable predictions of our model."

This suggestion is supported by experiments in stick insects, which show that slow, steady-walking is mainly coordinated by local proprioceptive signals but faster motion is driven by increased neural coupling between legs (<a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00fcschges, 2012</a>)."

Improvements, some of which are already pointed out, will be necessary to describe forward crawling as more experiments become available. For example, in a very recent experiment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Itakura et al., 2015</a>), a new class of pre-motor inhibitory neurons, Glutamatergic Ventro-Lateral Interneurons (GVLIs), were identified (glutamate inhibits larva motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rohrbough and Broadie, 2002</a>)), which ceased locomotion in the same segment when optogenetically activated. During unperturbed peristaltic wave propagation, GVLIs\u2019 activation lagged motor neurons by several segments, suggesting that GVLIs provide a contraction termination signal when the wave reaches anterior segments. In contrast, inhibitory neurons of our model get activated slightly later than the excitatory neurons in the same segment, and receive proprioceptive input only from the same segment. Therefore, our current model does not take into account the role of GLVIs in locomotion. Some other points of improvement could be moving beyond linear mechanics, taking into account different muscles, introducing dynamics for stretch receptors, incorporating observations on PMSI\u2019s (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>), including further specialized neuron types and accompanying connectivity profiles in a segment of the VNC, introducing possible long range intersegmental neural and proprioceptive connections, and using more sophisticated parameter fitting procedures."

Backward crawling, for instance, could be achieved by a separate neural circuit running from anterior-to-posterior, perhaps similar to that in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haspel et al., 2010</a>), or by introducing anterior to posterior neural coupling between individual segments as in the model of <a href=\"#bib16\">Gjorgjieva et al. (2013)</a>. Additional extensions of the body mechanics to account for bending by differential movement of hemisegments, and a bilateral VNC, similar to that in (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gjorgjieva et al., 2013</a>), allowing for propagation of neural excitation in opposite directions in different hemisegments will allow us to account for turning, and thus the larger behavioral repertoire of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>)."

On the other hand, Trimmer and colleagues are developing a soft platform to build artificial crawlers, see for example (<a href=\"#bib44\">Umedachi et al., 2013</a>) and (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2013</a>) for a review of current attempts. Our model can then be exploited to merge soft robotics and proprioception to create novel biomimetic crawlers with an electromechanical circuit implementing force production and proprioception in a soft gel."

First is a mechanical coupling between head and tail, mediated by an infinitely stiff spring, which models the visceral piston-like action of the gut. Such coupling is important for reproducing the experimental observation that head and tail move together and provides a simple, passive mechanism for extending the head segment. Second is the input to <math id=\"inf165\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>10</mn></msub></math> of tail segment from the stretch receptors and and the excitatory neurons in segment T2. Such input is responsible for reinitiating a crawling wave and sustain crawling gait without a CPG-like, periodic external drive. This kind of coupling needs to be mediated by neural fibers running across the VNC. Experimentally, interneurons that extend their axons across multiple VNC segments have been observed in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schmid et al., 1999</a>)."

Mathematical details of the model are given below, but first we briefly discuss its main properties."

To build a working model, first, an extensile muscular force, <math id=\"inf169\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>, should be included at the head segment for it to stretch, which would be implemented by a complex combination of circumferential and longitudinal muscular forces. Second, a neural circuit that controls this new muscle need to be introduced with a neural connection that synchronizes head-tail movements. Such circuit needs to stop the muscular activity when extension is beyond a threshold and therefore needs to be complemented by a receptor that gets activated with stretch, as opposed to receptors that gets activated with contraction in other segments."

These pulses could be generated by two separate, synchronized, local oscillators in the VNC, or a common input that feeds both segments. Both cases still require neural fibers that traverse the VNC: in the former case to initialize oscillators simultaneously, and in the latter case to carry the input itself. Such model produces sustained crawling, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig7\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 1B</a>. Not being constrained by a stiff gut, the total length of the larva oscillates around its stationary value, with a periodicity around <math id=\"inf170\"><mrow><mn>150</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>E</mi></msub></mrow></math> and changes reaching about 10% of larval length at peaks. The extensile forcing and stretch activated proprioception in the head segment breaks the symmetry between segment and thus causes uneven contraction, muscular forcing and neural activity across segments. An interesting observation is the extended activation of <math id=\"inf171\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> compared to other inhibitory neurons. <math id=\"inf172\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> activates in the begining of the crawling cycle with a proprioceptive input due to head stretching. Such input is alive until the crawling cycle propagates from the tail to T2 and the stretch is dampened."

In recent years, the neural network underlying crawling in the larva has been investigated by numerous labs. Theorists have started integrating experimental data in quantitative models, as was done in pioneering work by Gjorgjieva et al. 2013. The present manuscript offers a detailed model of the dynamics produced by the neuro-mechanical coupling of larval segments. The model is minimally complex, which makes it elegant and powerful. Using this model, the authors explore the influence of proprioceptive inputs and body-substrate friction on quantitative aspects crawling behavior. Many behavioral observations are reproduced. Remarkably, the authors propose a set of experimentally testable predictions. The strength of the manuscript is the novelty and the elegance of the model, its ability to account for a number of experimental observed phenomena, and its clear experimental predictions."

Given that this paper targets an audience of biologists, an effort should be made to create a more intuitive understanding of the math behind the model. To help this issue, we suggest that the authors add a model overview section, preceding the current modeling section, that explains the physics and the biology of the model in a way that is accessible to a biologist, but without equations. Such a section would have to be written so that a reader who wants to struggle through the equations will have read the overview and therefore have a good intuitive understanding of what the model consists of/model assumptions etc., whereas a reader who chooses to skip the technical section can still fully follow the Results and Discussion of the paper. Particularly indicate how the parameters of the model pertain to specific interactions perhaps in reference to an expanded <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Given that the model contains a large number of parameters more effort must be made to explain how the different parameters were fitted to the model. It is important to discuss the limitations inherent in the assumptions of the model (i.e. obvious discrepancies with/simplifications of the biological process) and in the future how might these limitations be overcome?"

Although the conclusions of both studies do not fully overlap, the authors should discuss more thoroughly how their findings compare to those of Gjorgjieva et al. One striking difference is related to the necessary involvement of a CPG to drive peristalsis. The authors demonstrate that peristalsis can emerge from a pure neuro-mechanical coupling between neighboring segments. This result should be highlighted in the context of the CPG-centric view prevailing in the field. Perhaps part of the discussion found in supplementary information should be moved to the main text? The authors should also emphasize the fundamental differences between a CPG-based and pure neuro-mechanical coupling model."

These are in general clearly stated, but some of these lack justification (and references to the neurobiological evidence). For example, the proprioceptive coupling is only from the nearby segment (contraction of segment i+1 feeds into the neural activation of segment i). Furthermore, such coupling is subject to a highly nonlinear activation function (effectively a threshold), and is fast (the very strong nonlinearity is somewhat reminiscent of other models, e.g. in <i>C. elegans</i>, Bryden 2008, Boyle 2012) begging the question is such strong nonlinearity strictly necessary for the model to work and does this render the dynamics of each segment as effectively binary, up to the capacitive filtering?"

While this is stated, much more detail needs to be given to explain what elements of the previous model framework are built on, and what elements of the current model and results are novel (e.g. are the results in sections 3.2.1 new?). Specifically, the previous model seems to focus on the passive and active body model and a minimal control system consisting of nearest-neighbor inter-segmental proprioceptive and diffusive coupling. There, the rhythmic pattern was generated by an oscillator in the head. This model now adds neuronal detail (pattern generating neuronal populations in each segment along the VNC). Thus in this model, some patterns can be propagated along the body even in the absence of ascending (proprioceptive) or descending (brain) control, and the proprioception is then superimposed (with a demonstrated stabilizing effect). This offers an excellent framework to study the interplay between central and peripheral control in this system. It would be helpful to the readers if any differences from the previous model (regarding the biomechanics/proprioception) and head oscillator were highlighted and justified. Where there are none, this should also be stated."

In my view, this mathematical description of the loss-of-function is incorrect. The effect of halo-rhodopsin should be described as a dramatic reduction in the activity of the excitatory interneurons (possibly through a large increase in the value of Ei in equation 1). This perturbation might have different consequences on the network dynamics. In particular, it might explain why the authors still predict muscular contractions upon activation of halo-rhodospin, which seems incompatible with the inhibition of the motorneurons."

In section 3.1.1, the length of the larva is assumed to be 0.7mm. Did the authors intend to write 7mm?

One would expect neurons detecting segmental contraction to be silent for low contraction, and saturate after some point. 2) It is true that the gain of the sigmoid in our model is large (1000), and it renders the proprioceptive signal to be binary. We can lower this gain from 1000 to 5 (which is still pretty steep), with little qualitative and quantitative change in sustained crawling. Below 5, the model stops producing sustained crawling. We do not want to draw strong conclusions from this observation and \u201cpredict\u201d the necessity of a strong nonlinearity for crawling, because there are many other parameters to adjust which may allow gains below 5 possible."

The current paper aims to model larval crawling: It has neural coupling between segments because the larva is able to crawl without proprioception (Hughes and Thomas, 2007). Other main differences are: 1) Our current model does not need a start signal at the beginning of each wave as in the old model, but restarts a wave by the neural coupling between T2 and A8, 2) In the current model, friction is set to zero when muscular forces exceed a threshold, modeling lifting of the body from the ground. In the old model, friction changed by direction of motion. 3) The dynamics of neurons in the old model (phase oscillators) were different than the current one and there was only one population of neurons. 4) The proprioception only activated the next segment but did not inhibit the current segment. 5) The old model was actually numerically solved in the continuum limit assuming a large number of segments, whereas here we solve the model with discrete segments.

In my view, this mathematical description of the loss-of-function is incorrect. The effect of halo-rhodopsin should be described as a dramatic reduction in the activity of the excitatory interneurons (possibly through a large increase in the value of Ei in equation 1). This perturbation might have different consequences on the network dynamics. In particular, it might explain why the authors still predict muscular contractions upon activation of halo-rhodospin, which seems incompatible with the inhibition of the motorneurons.</i>"

Boyle and his colleagues have also shown that proprioception stabilizes crawling and makes it more robust against external perturbation. Furthermore, old studies by Niebur and Erd\u00f6s in the 90s have already started to emphasize the role of sensory feedback in gait generation.

As the reviewer would appreciate, it is not guaranteed that results obtained from other gaits are going to automatically generalize to all gaits, due to differences in mechanics, neural control and the interactions with the environment. The model that we present for crawling is novel and simple. Second, we study the crawling gait in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae. As we discuss in the introduction, D. <i>melanogaster</i> is an excellent system because of especially the genetic and optogenetic tools that can be used to perturb neural and proprioceptive systems and see their effects on crawling. In the paper we reproduce many of these experiments. We don\u2019t think any of the models cited by the reviewer have been subject to such detailed testing, except maybe that of Boyle et al. Further, we emphasize and predict how changes in friction can affect the gait, something that has not been considered in <i>D. melanogaster</i> literature. To summarize, the strength of our approach comes from the model system and the gait we study: we propose a simple and novel model for the crawling gait, our model reproduces many of perturbation experiments in <i>D. melanogaster</i> larvae and it produces clear, testable predictions."
