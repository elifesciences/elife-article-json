Researchers have detected rhythmic movements in the fetus that are related to breathing, which supports the idea that the nervous system circuits needed for breathing are still being established and refined shortly before birth. Neurons in a part of the brain called the brainstem control the muscles that generate the movements required for breathing. These neurons are organized into groups, with each group forming an independent network that can carry information in the form of electrical signals. However, it is not clear how these networks form and operate before birth."

Early on in development, pacemaker neurons play an essential role in generating rhythms in the other neurons. However, in older embryos, the connections between each neuron in the breathing network become more important. Further work is now needed to map out the exact sequence of events in embryos that allow mice to breathe as soon as they are born. This could help us to develop therapies for human babies that are born with breathing difficulties."

Considerable data accumulated over the last decades from both invertebrate and vertebrate models have established the general mechanistic principle that rhythmogenesis relies on an interplay between intrinsic neuronal membrane properties and intercellular synaptic connectivity. Two main processes that may operate in varying combinations underlie motor rhythm generation: (i) the CPG network in question contains endogenously oscillatory neurons, so-called pacemakers, which drive the wider circuit cell population, and/or (ii), the rhythm emerges from the pattern of synaptic connections within the network. In addition to these intrinsic rhythmogenic mechanisms, the dynamics of network function can be conferred by extrinsic neuromodulatory actions. By acting on the membrane properties of constitutive neurons or their synaptic interconnections, modulators can ensure the operational plasticity that enables network motor output to remain adapted to organismal needs and changing environmental conditions (for reviews, see <a href=\"#bib15\">Harris-Warrick, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Marder, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Marder et al., 2014</a>)."

Respiratory movements are driven by rhythmic motor activity generated by neuronal circuits located in the brainstem. The respiratory rhythm generator is composed of two interacting CPG circuits distributed bilaterally in the ventral part of the medulla. The first is the parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG; <a href=\"#bib24\">Onimaru and Homma, 2003</a>) that appears to generate preinspiratory activity in neonates in vitro, active expiration in adults and plays a prominent role in central chemosensitivity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</a>). The second network is the preB\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC; <a href=\"#bib33\">Smith et al., 1991</a>) which has now been established to be both sufficient and necessary for generating the inspiratory phase of respiration (<a href=\"#bib33\">Smith et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gray et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">McKay et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Tan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>).

To date, a leading hypothesis, inscribed in the 'group pacemaker hypothesis', proposes that the rodent postnatal respiratory rhythm derives from an interaction between membrane properties (including pacemaker cellular properties) and synaptic coupling (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rekling and Feldman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Feldman and Del Negro, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>)."

Already at early embryonic stages, glutamatergic synaptic signaling is required for preB\u00f6tC network output (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wallen-Mackenzie et al., 2006</a>), although the presence of embryonic inspiratory neurons endowed with intrinsic bursting properties has only been inferred (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bouvier et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the presence and biophysical characteristics of pacemaker neurons in mouse embryonic preB\u00f6tC circuitry in order to understand their development and contribution to respiratory network activity in the critical period immediately prior to birth."

For this, slices were previously incubated en bloc with the Calcium Green 1-AM indicator, allowing fluorescence fluctuations due to somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes resulting from spontaneous impulse burst generation to be monitored (see Materials and methods). Initially, rhythmic fluorescent changes in cells occurring in phase with the population electrical activity allowed the localization of inspiratory neuron somata (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We identified an endogenous pacemaker neuron by its ability to produce spontaneous membrane potential oscillation and rhythmic action potential burst discharge even in synaptic isolation from its network partners (<a href=\"#bib16\">Koshiya and Smith, 1999</a>). Accordingly, neurons expressing fluorescence fluctuations in time with fictive inspiration in control conditions were classified as pacemakers if they remained rhythmically active during subsequent exposure to a cocktail of agents known to block chemical synaptic transmission in the preB\u00f6tC network (see Material and methods). Under such conditions of synaptic blockade, network electrical activity ceased as did rhythmic fluorescent changes in most of the previously identified inspiratory neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, black traces). However, a small proportion of monitored cells continued to express spontaneous fluorescence fluctuations at unrelated frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, red traces). These specific neurons were therefore considered to be pacemaker cells and were targeted for patch-clamp recording."

In a first group (n = 23), the cells expressed long-lasting plateau-like DPs with action potentials occurring at the beginning of the plateau followed by a depolarization block during which the neuron remained at a depolarized membrane potential without further spike generation prior to a spontaneous return to resting potential (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The mean amplitude of such square-wave DPs was 30.5 \u00b1 6.6 mV (343 burst cycles measured from 12 neurons; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D<sub>1</sub></a>, left) and their mean duration was 2.9 \u00b1 0.1s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D<sub>1</sub></a>, right). The mean membrane potential of these neurons measured between their DPs was \u221252.7 \u00b1 0.7 mV. In a second group (n = 45), the pacemaker neurons generated short-lasting oscillatory DPs and associated bursts with depolarizing amplitude and duration means of 12.8 \u00b1 3.8 mV and 0.79 \u00b1 0.01\u2009s, respectively (1296 bursts measured from 23 neurons; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B, D<sub>2</sub></a>). Their mean membrane potential between bursts was \u221249.2 \u00b1 0.5 mV. In the third group (n = 16), cells expressed a mixture of long- and short-lasting DPs, which overall had amplitude and duration means of 14.5 \u00b1 7.5 mV and 1.74 \u00b1 0.08\u2009s, respectively (739 bursts measured from 15 neurons; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C, D<sub>3</sub></a>). The mean inter-burst membrane potential of the mixed phenotype was \u221249.1 \u00b1 0.7 mV. The durations of the drive potentials were statistically different between the three groups (Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D<sub>4</sub></a>, right), while the mean DP amplitude of plateauing pacemakers was significantly larger compared to the amplitudes of two other types (p&lt; 0.001), which themselves were not significantly different (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D<sub>4</sub></a>, left). However, for the mixed pacemaker phenotype, when we discriminated between the two types of bursting (light green bars in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D<sub>4</sub></a>), the mean values for both DP amplitude and duration were comparable to those of the separate plateauing and oscillatory bursters. Moreover, as evident in the DP amplitude vs duration relationship of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> (which note was plotted exclusively from measurements of long-term single cell recordings; see Material and methods), the values for the mixed phenotype were bimodally distributed, with its shorter bursts lying in the range for oscillatory only pacemaker neurons and its longer bursts overlapping values for plateauing only cells. Finally, the mean resting membrane potential values were statistically different between both\u00a0plateauing and oscillatory neurons (t-test, p&lt;0.001) and between plateauing and mixed pacemaker cells (t-test, p&lt;0.002). Thus, together these data show that the respiratory network at embryonic stages between E16.5 and E18.5 already contains a subpopulation of pacemaker neurons and that these cells are endowed with heterogeneous burst-generating intrinsic properties."

Note that since to our knowledge none of these two drugs are fully washable, we applied FFA and Ril alone, or in combination, but never sequentially on a given slice. Out of the 10 embryonic preB\u00f6tC neurons identified as plateauing pacemakers, the bursting activity of 8 of these was completely blocked in the presence of 50 \u00b5M FFA applied either alone (n = 4; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right panel) or in co-application with 10 \u00b5M Ril, which by itself was ineffective in blocking bursting activity (n = 4, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, left panel). For the remaining two\u00a0plateauing cells, bursting activity was blocked in the presence of Ril alone (n = 2).

It should be noted here that we were unable to use complementary FFA application in these imaging experiments because the <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> blocker\u2019s effect on overall cell calcium signaling leads to a reduction of any initially detectable fluorescent changes, thereby preventing unequivocal interpretation. Of 32 pacemaker neurons identified at E16.5, 19 were sensitive to Ril exposure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, left histogram) indicating that the preB\u00f6tC pacemaker population contains significant proportions (ratio 60:40) of both <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> and presumed <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> at this earlier embryonic age. In contrast, at E18.5, pacemaker neurons were found to be predominantly sensitive to Ril (22/27 neurons; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, right), indicating that <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> is now the effective rhythmogenic mechanism in the majority of the pacemaker population at this older stage. The proportions of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>- and <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>-dependent pacemaker types found at the two developmental stages examined, despite not being statistically different in our imaging data (chi-square, p= 0.1), nevertheless, expressed a tendency that corresponded to our findings from patch-clamp recordings (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Therefore, altogether these data support the conclusion that at E16.5 both types of pacemakers (riluzole sensitive <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>-dependent and riluzole-insensitive <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>-dependent) are present in comparable proportions, while 2\u00a0days later in prenatal development, the same preB\u00f6tC cell subset is mainly comprised of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>-dependent pacemaker neurons."

One possibility is that <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>-dependent pacemakers progressively switch to an <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>-dependence as their membrane properties mature, thus involving a modification in the balance between the two conductances at the single cell level. Another alternative possibility is that <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>-dependent pacemaker neurons disappear progressively with embryo maturation and are replaced by a distinct <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>-dependent pacemaker population that emerges over the same period. To directly test the former possibility (also see below), a computational approach was used to assess the outcome of changing the proportion of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> distribution on the discharge of a previously reported model inspiratory neuron (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Toporikova et al., 2015</a>). In a first trial, the total persistent sodium conductance (<i>g</i><sub>NaP</sub>) of the artificial cell's membrane was held constant at 2.5 nS while the total conductance for <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> channels (<i>g</i><sub>CAN</sub>) was made variable. With <i>g</i><sub>CAN</sub> at 2.5 nS, the model neuron produced repetitive, long-duration oscillations and burst discharge events (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) that strongly resembled the plateau-like rhythmic activity recorded from biological pacemaker neurons (c.f., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In contrast, when <i>g</i><sub>CAN</sub> was reduced to 0 nS, higher frequency short-lasting bursts were now produced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) in a manner that was strikingly similar to the oscillatory pacemaker phenotype observed in vitro\u00a0(c.f., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). On the other hand, a hybrid model activity pattern (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) that closely resembled the mixed biological pacemaker phenotype (c.f., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) was observed when <i>g</i><sub>CAN</sub> was set at an intermediate conductance value of 1 nS."

To assess this possibility, we examined how overall network rhythm generation is affected by blockade of either <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> or <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>, or both, at the two studied embryonic ages. Using transverse brainstem slice preparations, we recorded network electrical activity in control conditions and in the presence of Ril or/and FFA. In these experiments, where entire network activity was monitored, we used riluzole at 20 \u00b5M to ensure blockade of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> throughout the network. It should be noted, however, that very similar results were obtained with Ril applied at 10\u00a0\u00b5M. At E16.5, application of 50 \u00b5M FFA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, left panel) or 20 \u00b5M Ril (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, right panel) significantly decreased the frequency of the ongoing spontaneous inspiratory rhythm by 46 \u00b1 9% (<i>t</i>-test, p= 0.006) and 89.7 \u00b1 5% (Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.001), respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, left histogram bars). Unexpectedly, however, the same drug treatments performed at E18.5 had no significant effect (<i>t</i>-test, p= 0.1 and 0.4 for FFA and Ril treatments, respectively), with the frequencies of the ongoing preB\u00f6tC rhythms in each case remaining unchanged under either FFA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, left middle trace) or Ril (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, right middle trace) application (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, left bars). Furthermore, when the drugs were applied concomitantly, rhythmic preB\u00f6tC activity was fully blocked at E16.5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, lower traces; 7B, right histogram bars; Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.001), but rhythmic activity persisted at E18.5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, lower traces) albeit at a significantly reduced cycle frequency (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, right bars; Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.01). Finally, to confirm that the effects involving FFA were not due to target actions other than on <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guinamard et al., 2013</a>), we performed a series of equivalent experiments using 10 \u00b5M 9-phenanthrol instead of 50 \u00b5M FFA: comparable results at E16.5 (i.e., a frequency decrease (by 39 \u00b1 15%; <i>t</i>-test, p= 0.05) when applied alone and full blockade of rhythmic activity when co-applied with Riluzole; n = 3) and E18.5 (no significant effect on frequency when applied alone (<i>t</i>-test, p= 0.1) and persistence of rhythmic activity but at a lower frequency (63 \u00b1 2%; <i>t</i>-test, p&lt;0.001) when co-applied with Riluzole; n = 6) were obtained (data not shown). To ensure that the apparent reduced sensitivity of the network rhythm at E18.5 to blockers was not due to decrease in their diffusion into the older tissue, we repeated these experiments using 300 \u00b5m instead of 450 \u00b5m\u00a0slices. However, the finding that the expression of rhythmic activity persisted in such thinner preparations in the presence of FFA + Ril, albeit at a lower frequency compared to control conditions (51.2 \u00b1 15%; n = 6; Mann-Whitney test, p <i>=</i> 0.02) argues against this possibility. Altogether, these data therefore show that at E16.5, inspiratory network rhythmogenesis requires co-activation of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>, whereas later at E18.5, blockade of either conductance fails to fully prevent the generation of rhythmic activity. This in turn indicates that a developmental change has indeed occurred in the mechanistic basis for respiratory network rhythm generation, which evidently is linked to a less predominant role played by endogenous pacemaker neurons at the older embryonic stage."

Second, these different pacemaker phenotypes are not invariably represented within the embryonic network during the prenatal period, but their relative proportions change as prenatal development progresses.

Furthermore, a proportion of pacemaker neurons express bursting activity that arises from both mechanisms, indicative of an intermediary pacemaker phenotype. We also found that in the embryonic network, the two main pacemaker mechanisms produce a depolarizing potential drive with distinctly different durations and cycle frequencies - <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> is prevalent in generating long and slowly repeating plateau-like activity, while <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> tends to underlie shorter and more rapid burst discharge - thus indicating that the pacemaker subtypes are distinguishable according to both the conductance mechanisms responsible for the initiation of their bursts as well as for burst termination. Burst terminating mechanisms have not yet been fully identified in neonatal inspiratory network neurons, but it has been suggested that Na- and ATP-dependent outward currents play a key role (<a href=\"#bib17\">Krey et al., 2010</a>) together with <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> inactivation/deactivation processes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Del Negro et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Del Negro et al., 2005</a>) and the activation of voltage- and calcium-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductances (<a href=\"#bib3\">Butera et al., 1999</a>). Additionally, we observed that plateau-like inspiratory pacemaker bursting is considerably more prevalent at earlier embryonic ages (representing ~50% of the total pacemaker population) but is then largely superseded by faster, short-duration oscillatory bursting as development progresses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the shape, duration and regularity of inspiratory pacemaker bursts occurring at E18.5, and in contrast to the considerably slower, yet robust, plateauing activity expressed at E16.5, more closely resemble the discharge patterns expressed by preB\u00f6tC pacemakers in the neonatal animal (cf., <a href=\"#bib29\">Pena et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Del Negro et al., 2005</a>). It is likely, therefore, that together with developmental changes in the balance of membrane conductances engaged in initiating burst-driving potentials (see below), the conductance mechanisms required for their appropriate cycle-by-cycle termination in the postnatal respiratory network are also being established and refined at late embryonic stages."

                                "text": "What role does the embryonic pacemaker neuron subpopulation play in respiratory network rhythmogenesis? Two observations in the present study are relevant to this question. First, pharmacological attenuation of <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> at E16.5 completely blocked rhythmic preB\u00f6tC network activity, whereas the same treatment of slices at E18.5 reduced, but failed to completely suppress ongoing network activity. Notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of inspiratory network neurons, including pacemakers and non-pacemakers alike, possess both NaP and CAN conductances (<a href=\"#bib4\">Del Negro et al., 2011</a>) and are therefore affected by our drug treatments, these findings indicate that a fundamental developmental change had occurred whereby network rhythmogenesis has shifted from an obligatory pacemaker-driven mechanism to one in which pacemaker neurons were no longer uniquely essential. Second, as shown by in vitro experimental data, the strength of excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission is significantly stronger throughout the preB\u00f6tC circuitry of E18.5 compared to E16.5 slices. On this basis, therefore, we propose that at earlier embryonic stages, pacemaker neurons play an essential role in network rhythm generation but that later in the prenatal period, the contribution of glutamatergic synaptic interactions becomes increasingly important so that nearer the time of birth, both cellular pacemaker properties and synaptic excitation are critical to network rhythmogenesis. Interestingly, such a developmental plasticity occurring in the late embryo embodies essential features of both the 'pacemaker neuron' (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pena et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ramirez et al., 2011</a>) and 'group-pacemaker' hypotheses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rekling and Feldman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pena et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Feldman and Del Negro, 2006</a>) that have been proposed to account for respiratory rhythm generation in the early postnatal rodent (for review, see <a href=\"#bib8\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>)."

The composition of this population, both in terms of pacemaker subtypes and their implication in overall network rhythmogenesis undergo significant maturational changes during the prenatal period. As yet, we have not been able to establish a direct link between these two transitional processes, nor has our data allowed us to determine the specific contribution that each pacemaker subtype makes to inspiratory network output as a whole. However, our in vitro results from differential pharmacology lead to the conclusion that the pacemaker cell subpopulation is exclusively responsible for network rhythmogenesis at earlier embryonic stages, but then assumes a cooperative role with recurrent synaptic excitation throughout the wider network immediately prior to birth. A better understanding of such prenatal developmental processes could in turn provide relevant insights into clinical aspects of early post-natal respiratory disorders."

Embryos were excised from the uterine horns and their individual uterine bags, and prior to experimental use, were either placed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, see below) that was continuously supplemented with oxygen at a temperature not exceeding 24\u00b0C for E16.5 embryos or were manually stimulated to activate spontaneous breathing behavior and then kept under a warm heating light for E18.5 embryos. Slice preparations were dissected in cold oxygenated aCSF composed of (in mM): 120 NaCl, 8 KCl, 1.26 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 21 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.58 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 glucose, pH 7.4. In a first step, the hindbrain was isolated from the embryo's body by a rostral section made at the level of the rhombencephalon and a caudal section made at the level of the first cervical roots. The isolated hindbrain was then placed in a low melting point agar block and carefully oriented to enable serial transverse sectioning in a rostral-to-caudal direction using a vibratome (Leica, Germany). A 450-\u00b5m-thick slice, with its anterior limit set 250\u2013300 \u00b5m caudal to the more caudal extension of the facial nucleus, was isolated. Other anatomical landmarks, such as the wide opening of the fourth ventricule, the presence of the inferior olive, the nucleus ambiguus and the hypoglossal nucleus were also used to determine the appropriate sectioning axis (as also referred to in newborn mice by <a href=\"#bib32\">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2011</a>). Such slice preparations encompass the region containing a significant portion of the preB\u00f6tC network capable of spontaneously generating fictive rhythmic inspiratory activity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Toporikova et al., 2015</a>) are devoid of the more rostral B\u00f6tzinger complex and contain only the most rostral region of the more caudal rVRG. On this basis, therefore, all neuronal populations examined were considered to be integral components of the preB\u00f6tzinger network. Slices were then transferred to a recording chamber, rostral surface upwards, and continuously superfused with oxygenated aCSF at a temperature of 30\u00b0C. Preparations were allowed to recover from the slicing procedure and subsequent calcium indicator loading (see below) for 20\u201330\u2009min before any recording sessions commenced."

This work is supported by computational modeling of individual pacemaker neurons and the preB\u00f6tC network. They demonstrate the existence of heterogeneous pacemaker oscillatory properties relying on distinct combinations of burst-generating INaP and ICAN conductances. The respective proportion of the different inspiratory pacemaker subtypes changes during prenatal development. They provide evidence that network rhythmogenesis switches from a purely INaP/ICAN-dependent mechanism at E16.5 to a combined pacemaker/network driven process at E18.5. The results have important implication for the maturation of the respiratory inspiratory pacemaker network across mammals and may potential impact our understanding of early postnatal failures of respiratory drive. The approach is novel: extending studies to the embryo to understand the post-natal developmental trajectory. The data are important contributions and will be of wide interest. There are 4 major concerns, however, that must be addressed by the authors before publication in <i>eLife</i>."

More raw data should be provided of voltage recordings and voltage-clamp records. Details of biophysical measurements should be provided, in tabular form if necessary, on passive properties (input resistance and capacitance) and active currents (current dynamics). Necessary details of the experimental procedures were not always provided, e.g. when FFA and Ril were given sequentially (e.g., Results section, subsection \u201cMembrane conductance underlying the different discharge patterns\u201d: \"Ril alone\"), how was washout of the first drug assured so the second blocker's effect could be assessed independently? More detailed quantification and statistics are needed for the groupings. For example, when the authors say \"bursting activity of 10 of these was completely blocked\" we would like to know the definition and measurement method for a burst or its duration or existence. Moreover, claiming block may seem reasonable from the typical traces provided, but the conclusion remains subjective unless documented quantitatively. While the study deals with the neural system's maturation, embryonic ages of the preps were not always clear. Since this part is fundamental to the rest of study, it could be documented less anecdotally and more quantitatively and rigorously."

These two observations are, however, independent of each other and the causality remains an open question. The cells that were imaged and/or patch-clamped were near the upper surface of the slice where the blockers had ready access. The vast majority of the rhythmogenic population might have been left unaffected, especially in the 450 \u00b5m thick slice that can capture a large rostrocaudal substrate in a fetus brainstem. Given, theoretically, 10% of the cross-connected population is sufficient to be pacemakers for the population to produce rhythm (Butera et al. 1999b), a relatively large population unaffected by the blocker may be sufficient to maintain the rhythm such as ones shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Since preB\u00f6tC inspiratory pacemaker neurons' contralaterally projecting axons take a rostrally arched course (Koizumi et al. 2013), those pacemakers near the rostral cut-end affected with the blockers might have had lost recurrent connections to a half of the rhythmogenic population (thus loss of their cellular rhythm could have less impact on the rhythm inside slice). The main impact of this diffusion issue in the context of this study is that one of major conclusions is the rhythm at E18.5 is no longer dependent on pacemaker properties. Given that diffusion of drugs through brain tissue decreases as it matures, it is possible that the persistence of rhythm at E18.5 reflects that Ril and FFA did not diffuse through the entire slice. These possibilities should be addressed forthrightly; either by new analysis, a clever but relatively quick set of experiments designed to show that diffusion of drugs is not a problem, or simply qualifying their conclusions with appropriate caveats in Discussion."

The problem comes with the mixed cells. Here the verbal and quantitative descriptions and the cloud discrimination break down requested above. This is because average data cannot capture the bimodal nature of the distributions. The text is inadequate on this point because it reports averages and SD for the bimodal data. The authors should recognize explicitly the bimodal nature and try to separate the modes using the data from the burst and plateau cells. This would then allow a more rigorous description of the mixed activity state and can give an estimate of the proportion of bursts and plateaus on average at least."

More detailed quantification and statistics are needed for the groupings. For example, when the authors say () \"bursting activity of 10 of these was completely blocked\" we would like to know the definition and measurement method for a burst or its duration or existence. Moreover, claiming block may seem reasonable from the typical traces provided, but the conclusion remains subjective unless documented quantitatively. While the study deals with the neural system's maturation, embryonic ages of the preps were not always clear. Since this part is fundamental to the rest of study, it could be documented less anecdotally and more quantitatively and rigorously.</i> "

These two observations are, however, independent of each other and the causality remains an open question. The cells that were imaged and/or patch-clamped were near the upper surface of the slice where the blockers had ready access. The vast majority of the rhythmogenic population might have been left unaffected, especially in the 450 \u00b5m thick slice that can capture a large rostrocaudal substrate in a fetus brainstem. Given, theoretically, 10% of the cross-connected population is sufficient to be pacemakers for the population to produce rhythm (Butera et al. 1999b), a relatively large population unaffected by the blocker may be sufficient to maintain the rhythm such as ones shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Since preB\u00f6tC inspiratory pacemaker neurons' contralaterally projecting axons take a rostrally arched course (Koizumi et al. 2013), those pacemakers near the rostral cut-end affected with the blockers might have had lost recurrent connections to a half of the rhythmogenic population (thus loss of their cellular rhythm could have less impact on the rhythm inside slice). The main impact of this diffusion issue in the context of this study is that one of major conclusions is the rhythm at E18.5 is no longer dependent on pacemaker properties. Given that diffusion of drugs through brain tissue decreases as it matures, it is possible that the persistence of rhythm at E18.5 reflects that Ril and FFA did not diffuse through the entire slice. These possibilities should be addressed forthrightly; either by new analysis, a clever but relatively quick set of experiments designed to show that diffusion of drugs is not a problem, or simply qualifying their conclusions with appropriate caveats in Discussion.</i> "

It should be noted that they are thinner than slices generally used in similar exogenous drug treatment studies on newborn rodents. Nonetheless, we feel confident that the drugs used in our study are reaching a significant portion of the E18.5 inspiratory network. Firstly, when CNQX or our cocktail of synaptic blockers is superfused, all preB\u00f6tC rhythmic activity ceases (when monitored either with calcium imaging or macroelectrode electrophysiological recordings). Second, in a direct test for a potential diffusion problem raised by the reviewer, we performed a new series of experiments in which FFA and Riluzole were applied to a thinner (300\u00b5m) E18.5 slice preparations. In each case (n=6) we found results closely comparable to those obtained with 450\u00b5m thick slices: 1) FFA alone failed to block inspiratory rhythmic activity, and 2), rhythmic activity continued under co-application of Ril + FFA, albeit at a lower frequency than in control conditions (similar to the data presented in the article's <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These experiments therefore strongly suggest that our reported data showing the persistence of a rhythmogenic capability under Ril + FFA at E18.5 are not simply due to a failure of the drugs to reach deeper lying neuronal populations in our slices."

This is because average data cannot capture the bimodal nature of the distributions. The text is inadequate on this point because it reports averages and SD for the bimodal data.
