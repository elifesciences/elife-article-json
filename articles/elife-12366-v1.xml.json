(2014) recently published the most complete description of the mouse mesoscale connectome acquired to date. Here we give an in-depth characterization of this connectome and propose a generative network model which utilizes two elemental organizational principles: proximal attachment \u2012 outgoing connections are more likely to attach to nearby nodes than to distant ones, and source growth \u2012 nodes with many outgoing connections are likely to form new outgoing connections. We show that this model captures essential principles governing network organization at the mesoscale level in the mouse brain and is consistent with biologically plausible developmental processes."

(2014) recently published the most complete description of the mouse mesoscale connectome acquired to date. Here we give an in-depth characterization of this connectome and propose a generative network model which utilizes two elemental organizational principles: proximal attachment \u2012 outgoing connections are more likely to attach to nearby nodes than to distant ones, and source growth \u2012 nodes with many outgoing connections are likely to form new outgoing connections. We show that this model captures essential principles governing network organization at the mesoscale level in the mouse brain and is consistent with biologically plausible developmental processes."

This organizational principle has been able to\u00a0capture a range of properties observed in the\u00a0cortex, including the distribution of connection lengths (<a href=\"#bib32\">Song et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kaiser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ercsey-Ravasz et al., 2013</a>), the inverse relationship between degree and clustering coefficient (<a href=\"#bib40\">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Song et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Betzel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Mitra, 2014</a>), and the relative frequency of three-node motifs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ercsey-Ravasz et al., 2013</a>).

However, the homophilic rules employed by Betzel et al. also do not lend themselves to straightforward biophysical interpretations.

We show that this simple model, parameterized only by a length constant and the number of nodes and edges, can capture directed, undirected, and spatial properties of the mouse connectome. This work supports the existing literature on the importance of spatial embedding and provides strong evidence that SG is a major phenomenological rule that shapes connectivity patterns in the mouse brain. Lastly, we propose biological mechanisms that might account for these two generative principles."

While the small-world network exhibits a clustering coefficient distribution similar to that of the connectome (<a href=\"#bib27\">Oh et al., 2014</a>), as well as an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and degree, these similarities are superficial: inspecting <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a> reveals that the small-world network\u2019s degree distribution is much more homogeneous. While the scale-free network partly captures the connectome\u2019s degree distribution, its nodes have a much lower clustering coefficient, and there is a weaker relation between these two metrics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). The degree-controlled random model shows that shuffling the connectome\u2019s edges yields a graph resembling the scale-free network (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>).

We found that the mouse connectome has a reciprocity coefficient of 0.13, which is high compared to that expected from chance (0.03). Reciprocal edges in the connectome are on average shorter than nonreciprocal edges (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>; <i>t</i>(8818) = 13.25, p <i>&lt;</i>&lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>, independent samples t-test; Cohen\u2019s d = 0.47). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>, the reciprocity coefficient of our model networks decreases with increasing length constant, approximately matching that of the mouse connectome (0.13) when <i>L</i> = 0.725\u2009mm for both the SGPA and TAPA models. However, fitting the length constant to reciprocity (e.g. in the SGPA model) underestimates the physical edge lengths of the connectome (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c to d</a>). Using a larger length constant improved the fit to the reciprocal and nonreciprocal edge length distributions (not shown), but reduced the model\u2019s reciprocity."

A network grown solely with the PA rule and a random degree-controlled network both showed a joint clustering-degree distribution that differed from the connectome\u2019s, again suggesting that both topological and geometric rules are important when modeling the connectome. The inset in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a> quantifies this by showing that the SGPA model\u2019s fitted power law relationship between clustering coefficient and degree is the most similar to the connectome. Additionally, this increased clustering is spatially localized: In the connectome, there is a negative correlation between a node\u2019s clustering coefficient and its mean edge length. That is, nodes with short average edge lengths tend to be highly clustered (<i>\u03c1</i>\u00a0= -0.238, p &lt; 10<sup>-6</sup>, Spearman rank correlation). A similar, but stronger relationship occurs in the SGPA model (median <i>\u03c1</i>\u00a0= -0.482, p &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>, Spearman rank correlation)."

To examine the role played by each node in the context of the entire network, we calculated distributions of nodal efficiency. A node\u2019s nodal efficiency is defined as the mean inverse directed shortest path length between itself and all other nodes in the network and quantifies the ease with which that node can theoretically transmit information to all other nodes (see 'Materials and methods'). As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>, there was a close match between the nodal efficiency distributions for the connectome and the SGPA model (with <i>L</i> = 0.725\u2009mm): both exhibited an approximately normal distribution, save for a small selection of nodes with zero-valued nodal efficiency (corresponding to nodes with no outgoing connections). A degree-controlled random graph also showed approximately normally distributed nodal efficiency distributions, but the mean of the distribution was slightly higher than either the SGPA model or the mouse connectome. In contrast, the purely geometric PA model showed a sharply peaked nodal efficiency distribution, similar to what one would expect for a directed Erdos-Renyi graph (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

These studies typically explore the structure of undirected networks, so for our analyses we converted the directed SGPA model to an undirected one by ignoring directionality of edges (see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods'). We then simulated a lesioning (or percolation) process to compare the undirected SGPA model and other standard undirected models to the mouse connectome. When nodes (and the edges connected to them) were removed in order of decreasing degree (i.e. targeted attack), the SGPA model\u2019s global efficiency (akin to nodal efficiency; see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods') and largest (giant) component size both decreased in a manner more similar to the mouse connectome than any standard graph (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a> shows that the mouse connectome disintegrates the fastest, and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a> shows that the global efficiency falls more rapidly in the connectome than any model.

To test if our lesioning results were a product of connection density (which is itself determined by degree distribution), rather than connectivity patterns specific to each model, we also investigated the connection density throughout the lesioning process (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). We found that, throughout the lesioning process, the connectome\u2019s connection density was similar to that of all models except the small world network (and necessarily matched the degree-controlled random graph). We also found that while global efficiency and connection density were correlated, their specific relationship depended on the model (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Interestingly, the way these two variables were related in the connectome most resembled how they were related in the SGPA model, relative to all the others. This shows that the results in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> are not simply due to differences in degree distribution and the dependence of global efficiency on connection density. Therefore, we propose that these lesioning results expose differences in higher order connectivity structure between the connectome and the examined models.

Through anatomical tracing experiments using genetically identical mice registered to a common reference frame, this dataset permitted a graph theoretic analysis of whole-brain connectivity. We first showed that the connectome\u2019s lower degree nodes are more clustered \u2012 a relationship absent in the standard random graphs used in the literature. We then demonstrated that in-degree is approximately normally distributed and out-degree is approximately exponentially distributed in the connectome; because in- and out-degree were uncorrelated, this meant that nodes with more total connections tended to have a higher percentage of outgoing connections. Additionally, we found that reciprocal edges were shorter than nonreciprocal edges on average and that the proportion of reciprocal edges was substantially higher in the connectome than that expected by chance. Finally, we developed a directed generative network model based on two simple rules: SG and PA. This directed model captures many (but not all) spatial and graph theoretic properties of the mouse connectome and provides important biological insights into the organizational principles governing neural connectivity at the mesoscale, which we discuss later."

Functional segregation asserts that the brain carries out specialized computations in anatomically localized and highly interconnected regions. As high clustering coefficient is thought to indicate potential for participation in this sort of computational unit (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</a>), our finding that nodes with a small number of neighbors tend to be highly clustered suggests that these nodes are candidates for specialized processing. However, functional data would be required to validate this conjecture since high clustering coefficient does not necessarily imply grouping of nodes into specialized clusters. Functional integration predicts that some high-degree \u201chub\u201d brain regions consolidate the results of these specialized computations for higher function (e.g. as in behavior and perception) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Friston, 2002</a>). Surprisingly, connections associated with such hub nodes were primarily outgoing in the directed connectome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Assuming again that anatomical connectivity is indicative of functional relationships, our results suggest that hubs play a stronger role in distribution, rather than integration, of information. However, these ideas are not necessarily contradictory \u2012 it is possible that many brain regions are involved in both integration and distribution to varying extents. In fact, the proportion in-degree distribution roughly resembles a uniform distribution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggesting a continuum of these properties rather than discrete categories."

For example, <a href=\"#bib15\">Kaiser et al. (2009)</a> noted that if axonal outgrowth occurs in a straight line and the axon attaches to the first node it physically encounters, then the probability of connecting to a target neuron depends exponentially on the target\u2019s distance from the source neuron (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kaiser et al., 2009</a>). Previous research has also shown that some chemical gradients responsible for axon guidance decay exponentially with distance (<a href=\"#bib25\">Murray, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Isbister et al., 2003</a>) and have been modeled as such (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mortimer et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, <a href=\"#bib31\">Rubinov et al. (2015)</a>, recently reported that distance-dependent inter-areal connection strengths in the mouse connectome were best captured by a power law. We explored a purely geometric model based on PA and found that while this model induces clustering between low-degree nodes, it fails to account for the broad degree distribution of the connectome. This motivated the exploration of two mathematically symmetric generative models that included an additional topological rule: target attraction proximal attachment (TAPA) and source growth proximal attachment (SGPA)."

To explore whether source selection based specifically on out-degree was a necessary property, we also examined a network grown with source selection probability proportional to the <i>total</i> degree raised to a power. While this model also exhibited many of the connectome\u2019s properties, it makes predictions that are not observed in the connectome (e.g. it predicts that the number of incoming and outgoing connections should be correlated; <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>); the model itself also requires an additional parameter.

Many generative schemes proposed previously, such as the homophilic rules by <a href=\"#bib4\">Betzel et al.

Found throughout both the central and peripheral nervous systems, these proteins are typically secreted by a target (postsynaptic) neuron at functional synapses, endocytosed by a source (presynaptic) neuron, and retrogradely transported to the source neuron\u2019s soma, where they trigger the above-mentioned processes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Huang and Reichardt, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Korsching, 1993</a>). Because neurotrophins are available in limited quantities, they are hypothesized to cause competitive interactions among growing neuronal populations (<a href=\"#bib38\">van Ooyen and Willshaw, 1999</a>). Indeed, such an interaction resembles the way in which a single source node is probabilistically selected for each edge addition in the SGPA model (as opposed to allowing all nodes to generate outgoing connections simultaneously). Most importantly, since populations that maintain many functional outgoing connections will tend to receive more neurotrophins, they should on average be more fit for survival and new connection generation, and their existing connections should be more likely to branch. This would in turn increase their probability of establishing new connections to novel targets. Such a biological mechanism would lead to the \u201crich-get-richer\u201d phenomenon for outgoing connections that was fundamental in modeling the network properties of the mouse connectome."

The SGPA model provides an alternative because the in- and out-degree distributions are driven by different rules. In-degree is approximately Gaussian because of the central limit theorem (connections are random in the sense that they only depend on distance and not degree or other topological properties), and out-degree is approximately exponential, owing to the SG process. If in- and out-degree are independent, as they are in our model and seem to be in the connectome, the distribution of their sum (i.e. of total degree) will be the convolution of the two individual distributions. Thus, we would expect the distribution over undirected degree (which is approximately the sum of in- and out-degree, the approximation arising since we do not count reciprocal edges twice) to approach the convolution of a Gaussian and an exponential, that\u00a0is, an exponentially modified Gaussian (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Additionally, the SGPA model is able to capture the low-degree portion of the distribution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) unlike the scale-free graph.

Our choice to instantiate all the nodes at the start of the network\u2019s generation is somewhat biologically implausible. This is different from the Barabasi-Albert algorithm used to generate scale-free graphs where, aside from an initial group of nodes, all the nodes are added sequentially over time. However, a version of our SPGA model in which nodes <i>are</i> added one-by-one (see 'Materials and methods') yielded a qualitatively similar network (see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The only notable differences were that the youngest nodes had an extremely low degree and a clustering coefficient of either zero or one, and that there was a positive correlation between in- and out-degree. This deviation from the properties observed in the mouse connectome could potentially be corrected by \u201cpruning\u201d the final network or by modifying the probability of generating new connections as the final nodes are added."

All the simulations we explored, however, yielded comparable results when run with node coordinates determined by the centroids of brain regions in the connectome. One interesting feature of the SGPA model is that it predicts that edge lengths should be significantly shorter than those observed in the connectome. This is a consequence of fitting the length constant to the connectome\u2019s reciprocity. A more satisfactory fit to the edge length distribution can be obtained by using a larger length constant, but this substantially reduces the reciprocity and degrades the inverse relationship observed between clustering and degree (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Equivalently, we can scale the dimensions of the model, which allows us to match the reciprocity and the edge length distribution but not the inter-nodal distance distribution. Thus, our model is unable to account for both the edge length distribution and the reciprocity of the connectome while also maintaining the appropriate dimensionality."

Dynamically changing the physical scale of the model (e.g. to simulate physical growth) is another promising avenue for future work which some have begun to explore (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ozik et al., 2004</a>), and may account for our inability to capture the edge length distribution in the connectome.

The directed degree-controlled random was generated in a similar way, except both the in- and out-degree distributions were held nearly fixed (\u201cnearly\u201d because the algorithm often converts a small number of edges to self- or double-connections, which are ignored in our analysis; however, these only represent about 5% of all connections). These standard graphs are similar to those used in <a href=\"#bib27\">Oh et al. (2014)</a>. The directed Erdos-Renyi graph was generated using NetworkX, with an edge probability of 0.0487, which on average yielded the number of directed edges present in the mouse connectome."

Edges were added until the number of (undirected) edges matched that of the connectome (K=7804). The directed PA algorithm was identical, except that directionality of edges was retained. For the graphs incorporating topological rules (i.e. SGPA and TAPA), the growth algorithm was initialized by instantiating <i>n</i> nodes with no edges connecting them, except for one self-connection per node to prevent zero-valued connection probabilities for nodes with no outgoing or incoming edges (for SGPA and TAPA, respectively). However, these self-connections were ignored when calculating all metrics for the final graph. In all the graphs we generated (except for node-by-node SGPA), we matched <i>n</i> and <i>K</i> to the number of nodes and directed edges, respectively, in the empirical connectome (<i>n</i> = 426, <i>K\u00a0</i>= 8820)."

From the methods, it seems that there are no connections between the two hemispheres in the mouse connectome, that means there are two components with 213 nodes each (subheading \u201cEmpirical connectivity graph\u201d). For the generated networks, on the other hand, the there is a giant component that contains almost all of the 426 network nodes. This difference will influence the calculation of the characteristic path length and of the global efficiency and might therefore influence the robustness results presented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Moreover, they will also affect the higher modularity in the mouse connectome as the relative proportion of edges that exists within each hemisphere (component) will be higher than the edge density with the giant component of the generated networks. There are several ways how this could be fixed: one might assume connections between hemispheres within the mouse connectome but this is difficult if there is no experimental data to back this up. Or one might use generated networks that consists of 213 nodes and then duplicate that network (like the mirroring for the mouse) to generate a network with 426 nodes and two dis-connected components. In that way, both types of networks would have the same starting configuration."

We have elected to keep this network undirected as the in- and out-degree distributions will necessarily look the same for a purely geometric model (both approximately Gaussian). A key insight here is that the degree distribution of the purely geometric model is too narrow to capture the joint clustering-degree distribution of the connectome. This limitation indicates that geometric rules alone cannot capture the connectome\u2019s connectivity properties and provides a natural transition to the next part of the manuscript where we explore the directed structure of the connectome and geometric-topological models."

First, we added a mathematically symmetric version of the SGPA model (TAPA), which incorporates both geometric and topological properties. The in- and out-degree distributions remained inverted from the true distribution although the connectome\u2019s reciprocity was more closely emulated. Second, we explored a model in which outgoing connection probability depends on total degree, rather than out-degree. With this model, some qualitative properties of the brain were recoverable only once connection probability was raised to the power<math id=\"inf105\"><mrow> <mtext>\u03b3</mtext></mrow></math>. However, this model had a reliable correlation between in- and out-degree, which we do not observe in the connectome or in the SGPA model. We feel this provides additional evidence that the SGPA model captures nuanced features of the generative algorithm of the mouse connectome \u2012 namely, that the growth process depends specifically on out-degree. Finally, we would like to point out that the original (and revised) manuscript did indeed explore a generalization of SGPA in which nodes were added one-by-one to the graph, rather than initialized all at once, and this graph showed similar properties to both SGPA and the connectome."

Any model attempting to emulate the connectome must have generative rules that operate differently on incoming and outgoing connections. Therefore, we believe that it is only worthwhile to test more complicated models that can, at least in principle, incorporate this property. This rules out all undirected models, such as those proposed by Betzel et al. (2015) and Vertes et al. (2012), as well as directed models in which incoming and outgoing connection probabilities are not treated differently. Directed generalizations of other popular undirected graphs hypothesized to account for brain connectivity might prove useful in this domain, but we believe that the in-depth exploration needed to properly evaluate them is beyond the scope of this work."

From the methods, it seems that there are no connections between the two hemispheres in the mouse connectome, that means there are two components with 213 nodes each (subheading \u201cEmpirical connectivity graph\u201d). For the generated networks, on the other hand, the there is a giant component that contains almost all of the 426 network nodes. This difference will influence the calculation of the characteristic path length and of the global efficiency and might therefore influence the robustness results presented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Moreover, they will also affect the higher modularity in the mouse connectome as the relative proportion of edges that exists within each hemisphere (component) will be higher than the edge density with the giant component of the generated networks. There are several ways how this could be fixed: one might assume connections between hemispheres within the mouse connectome but this is difficult if there is no experimental data to back this up. Or one might use generated networks that consists of 213 nodes and then duplicate that network (like the mirroring for the mouse) to generate a network with 426 nodes and two dis-connected components. In that way, both types of networks would have the same starting configuration.</i> "

                    "text": "We apologize for the confusion here. During the experiments used to generate the mouse connectome, the viral tracer was indeed only injected into brain regions within a single hemisphere. The two-photon tomography system, however, imaged both hemispheres when recording the projections extending from the injected regions. That is, the mouse connectome dataset does contain interhemispheric connections. When mirroring the connectome across the sagittal midline, this results in a network comprised of a single component connecting all 426 nodes. To remedy this confusion, we have added additional explanation to the Methods section concerning the experimental procedures used in Oh et al., 2014."
