However, their role in GPCR-operated Erk1/2 activation differs between GPCRs and the underlying mechanism remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that activation of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, which engage Erk1/2 pathway via a \u03b2-arrestin-dependent mechanism, promotes MEK-dependent \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup>, a necessary step for Erk recruitment to the receptor/\u03b2-arrestin complex and Erk activation. Likewise, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation is involved in \u03b2-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 stimulation elicited by other GPCRs such as \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic, FSH and CXCR4 receptors, but does not affect the \u03b2-arrestin-independent Erk1/2 activation by 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor. Collectively, these data show that \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> underlies \u03b2-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 activation by GPCRs."

However, their role in GPCR-operated Erk1/2 activation differs between GPCRs and the underlying mechanism remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that activation of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, which engage Erk1/2 pathway via a \u03b2-arrestin-dependent mechanism, promotes MEK-dependent \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup>, a necessary step for Erk recruitment to the receptor/\u03b2-arrestin complex and Erk activation. Likewise, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation is involved in \u03b2-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 stimulation elicited by other GPCRs such as \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic, FSH and CXCR4 receptors, but does not affect the \u03b2-arrestin-independent Erk1/2 activation by 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor. Collectively, these data show that \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> underlies \u03b2-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 activation by GPCRs."

                        "text": "Arrestins were initially named on the basis of their ability to turn-off the coupling of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to G proteins and thereby inhibit G protein-dependent GPCR signaling. Over the last decade, it has become evident that \u03b2-arrestins are also important signal transducers and that a number of biological functions exerted by GPCRs are mediated by \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lefkowitz and Shenoy, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Latapy and Beaulieu, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beaulieu et al., 2007</a>). \u03b2-arrestins act as multifunctional scaffolds that recruit multiple signaling molecules, such as the core Extracellular signal-regulated kinase Erk1/2 signaling module, composed of Raf1, MAP kinase kinase MEK1 and MAP kinases Erk1/2, a process leading to Erk1/2 activation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">DeFea et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luttrell et al., 2001</a>). Typically, most GPCRs induce temporally distinct and spatially segregated G protein-dependent and \u03b2-arrestin-dependent activation of Erk: G protein-mediated Erk activation is rapid and transient, reaching a maximal level within a few minutes and is followed by translocation of activated Erk into the nucleus to promote gene transcription and cell proliferation. In contrast, \u03b2-arrestin-mediated Erk1/2 activation is slower in onset, requiring 5\u201310 min to reach maximal level, persists more than 1\u00a0hr and mainly occurs in the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shenoy et al., 2006</a>). However, Erk1/2 signaling elicited by certain GPCRs does not fit this classic bimodal activation pattern: for example, the activation of Erk1/2 pathway by 5HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors is entirely dependent on \u03b2-arrestins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Labasque et al., 2008</a>), whereas the engagement of this pathway by the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor does not require \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barthet et al., 2007</a>). In addition, some GPCRs such as \u00b5-opioid receptor induce \u03b2-arrestin-dependent activation of Erk1/2 that translocate to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zheng et al., 2008</a>)."
                    },

                        "text": "Accumulating evidence indicates that \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to GPCRs and engagement of \u03b2-arrestin-mediated signaling depend on both receptor conformational state and a complex pattern of receptor phosphorylation elicited by GPCR kinases (GRKs) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shukla et al., 2011</a>). This phosphorylation barcode is translated into specific \u03b2-arrestin conformations that dictate selective signaling and the nature of \u03b2-arrestin intracellular functions. Another mechanism that might underlie \u03b2-arrestin dependency of receptor-operated signaling is the phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestins themselves. Several phosphorylated residues have been identified in the \u03b2-arrestin sequences, including Ser<sup>412</sup> for \u03b2-arrestin1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lin et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barthet et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 1999</a>) and Thr<sup>276</sup>, Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> for \u03b2-arrestin2 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Paradis et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2002</a>). These phosphorylation events affect GPCR internalization and/or sequestration and, consequently, steady-state level of GPCR cell-surface expression: phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestin1 at Ser<sup>412</sup> by Erk1/2 as well as the phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestin2 at both Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> reduce their ability to induce internalization of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lin et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2002</a>), whereas phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestin2 at Ser<sup>14</sup> and Thr<sup>276</sup> promotes intracellular sequestration of CXCR4 receptor (<a href=\"#bib30\">Paradis et al., 2015</a>). These results indicate that \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylation exerts contrasting effects on GPCR trafficking that may depend on the nature of the phosphorylated residue(s) and of the GPCR. Another phosphorylated site (Ser<sup>178</sup>) was identified in rat/mouse \u03b2-arrestin2 and its phosphorylation state affects endosomal trafficking of various GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Khoury et al., 2014</a>). However, this serine residue is not conserved in other species including human, suggesting different regulations of endosomal GPCR trafficking between species. Additional phosphorylated residues have been found on \u03b2-arrestin2 in large-scale phosphoproteomics screens, but their functional relevance remains to be established (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pighi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ballif et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vill\u00e9n et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Choudhary et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2009</a>). In contrast to its role in GPCR trafficking, the influence of \u03b2-arrestin phosphorylation on GPCR-operated \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling such as Erk1/2 activation remains unexplored."

We identified several previously described as well as novel phosphorylated residues on \u03b2-arrestin2, while only one phosphorylated site was found on \u03b2-arrestin1. Of these, only phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup> exhibited a strong increase upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation. Furthermore, Thr<sup>383</sup> was poorly phosphorylated in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor and its phosphorylation was only slightly enhanced by agonist treatment. These findings prompted functional studies to evaluate the influence of this phosphorylation event in Erk1/2 phosphorylation elicited by stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and other GPCRs known to engage Erk signaling in a \u03b2-arrestin-dependent manner, in comparison with 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation, which induces Erk1/2 activation through a \u03b2-arrestin-independent mechanism."

GPS search also suggested that Thr<sup>383</sup> is a potential site for phosphorylation by MAP2K1 (MEK1, GPS score 6.0). Numerous studies have shown that \u03b2-arrestins associated with a GPCR can interact with different signaling proteins including c-Src and several proteins of the Erk signaling module (Raf/MEK/Erk), and that these interactions depend on \u03b2-arrestin conformational state (<a href=\"#bib44\">Xiao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2003</a>)."

                                "text": "In line with these findings, we have recently modeled the complex between a GPCR, \u03b2-arrestin2, c-Src and the Erk module from the 3D structure of each partner, using the Protein-Protein cOmplexes 3D structure pRediction (PRIOR) docking algorithm, and validated experimentally the previously unknown interaction regions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bourquard et al., 2015</a>). This model predicts that the unfolded C-terminal part of \u03b2-arrestin comprising Thr<sup>383</sup> is located in the vicinity of the MEK active site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), indicating a possible role of MEK bound to \u03b2-arrestin2 in its phosphorylation. Based on this model, we hypothesized that the mechanism of \u03b2-arrestin-dependent activation of Erk consists in the following steps: (i) Raf and MEK assemble to \u03b2-arrestin2 bound to agonist-stimulated receptor, resulting in MEK activation, (ii) MEK phosphorylates \u03b2-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup>, resulting in a large conformational change of the \u03b2-arrestin2 region comprising residues 350\u2013393, (iii) the receptor C-terminus associates with \u03b2-arrestin2 using the region previously occupied by the 383\u2013393 \u03b2-strand within the \u03b2-arrestin2 C-terminal tail and (iv) Erk binds to the complex and can be activated by MEK (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, pretreatment of cells with the MEK pharmacological inhibitor U0126 (5 \u00b5M) abolished Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Expression of a MEK1 dominant-negative inhibitor (MEK1DN) also strongly reduced Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> for controls showing strong MEK inhibition induced by both approaches, as assessed by monitoring phosphorylation of Erk1/2). In contrast, pretreating cells with FR180204 (10 \u00b5M), a selective pharmacological inhibitor of Erk1/2, did not affect Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The ability of FR180204 treatment to inhibit Erk1/2 activity without affecting MEK activity in our experimental conditions was assessed by monitoring phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and their substrate Elk1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Collectively, these results identify MEK as the major kinase involved in phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup> upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation. To further confirm the ability of MEK to directly phosphorylate this residue, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified active MEK1 and YFP-\u03b2-arrestin2 purified from transfected HEK-293 cells as substrate, followed by Western blotting using the anti-phospho-Thr<sup>383</sup>\u03b2-arrestin2 antibody. MEK1 induced a strong elevation in the immunoreactive signal that was abolished by adding U0126 in the incubation medium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). As expected, no increase in immunoreactive signal was observed in experiments using YFP-Thr<sup>383</sup>Ala \u03b2-arrestin2 mutant as substrate, thus validating the specificity of the antibody for \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylated at Thr<sup>383</sup>.

To explore the impact of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation on conformational changes of \u03b2-arrestin2 induced by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor activation <i>vs.</i> 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor activation, we used an optimized intramolecular BRET biosensor consisting of \u03b2-arrestin2 sandwiched between the <i>Renilla</i> green fluorescent protein (RGFP) and the <i>Renilla</i> luciferase variant Rluc8 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kamal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Charest et al., 2005</a>). When \u03b2-arrestin2 conformation changes, the distance between Rluc8 and RGFP increases or decreases leading to a BRET signal decrease or increase. Treating cells coexpressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and WT RLuc8-\u03b2-arrestin2-RGFP with 5-HT increased the BRET signal. No BRET increase was detected upon agonist exposure in cells coexpressing the receptor and T<sup>383</sup>A RLuc8-\u03b2-arrestin2-RGFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Mutation of Thr<sup>383</sup> into aspartate in RLuc8-\u03b2-arrestin2-RGFP also resulted in an increase in BRET signal to a level similar to the one measured in cells expressing the wild type probe and exposed to 5-HT, and 5-HT treatment did not further enhance this elevated BRET signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, substitution of Thr<sup>383</sup> by alanine or aspartate did not affect the increase in RLuc8-\u03b2-arrestin2-RGFP BRET signal induced by 5-HT treatment in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Collectively, these results indicate that \u03b2-arrestin2 conformational change elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation, but not 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation, depends on Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation."

Consequently, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation status might affect Erk1/2 recruitment. In fact, our model predicts that Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation should induce a movement of the \u03b2-arrestin2 C-terminal region away from the complex leaving space for further recruitment of Erk (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To explore this possibility, we compared the ability of wild type and Thr<sup>383</sup>Ala and Thr<sup>383</sup>Asp \u03b2-arrestin2 to recruit Erk1/2 upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation by co-immunoprecipitation. Treating 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor-expressing cells with 5-HT increased the amount of Erk1/2 co-immunoprecipitated with \u03b2-arrestin2, an effect abolished by mutating Thr<sup>383</sup> into Ala (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). In contrast, mutation of Thr<sup>383</sup> into aspartate increased Erk1/2 recruitment by \u03b2-arrestin2 even in the absence of the agonist and receptor stimulation did not induce any additional effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Further supporting a role of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation by MEK, treatment of cells with U0126 prevented recruitment of Erk1,2 by \u03b2-arrestin2 induced by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1</a>). 5-HT did not promote Erk1/2 recruitment by \u03b2-arrestin2 in cells coexpressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor and either wild type or mutated forms of \u03b2-arrestin2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

We also explored the influence on their phosphorylation status of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, two model GPCRs that engage the Erk1/2 pathway through \u03b2-arrestin-dependent and independent mechanisms, respectively. We identified one phosphorylated site on \u03b2-arrestin1 and six on \u03b2-arrestin2, including three previously identified residues (Ser<sup>178</sup>, Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup>) and three new sites (Ser<sup>194</sup>, Ser<sup>267/268</sup> and Ser<sup>281</sup>). Two of the \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylated sites identified (Ser<sup>194</sup>, Ser<sup>267/268</sup>) are conserved in \u03b2-arrestin1, but we did not detect the corresponding phosphorylated peptides in \u03b2-arrestin1. Although MS/MS does not allow exhaustive identification of peptides present in complex samples, it is unlikely that our analyses, which covered about of 85% of the sequence of both arrestins, missed these phosphorylated residues on \u03b2-arrestin1 or any other robustly phosphorylated residues on both arrestins. Therefore, our results corroborate previous findings which identified much more phosphorylated residues on \u03b2-arrestin2 than on \u03b2-arrestin1 and suggest that \u03b2-arrestin2 is phosphorylated at higher stoichiometry, compared with \u03b2-arrestin1. Our analyses did not detect, even in 5-HT-treated cells, another site conserved between both \u03b2-arrestins (Ser<sup>276</sup>) that was previously reported as being phosphorylated by recombinant active Erk1 in an in vitro phosphorylation assay followed by MS/MS analysis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Paradis et al., 2015</a>). This suggests that in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> or 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor, the level of Erk1/2 activity and/or the molecular environment of this serine residue do not allow its phosphorylation at high stoichiometry."

In silico search of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in \u03b2-arrestin2 sequence identified Thr<sup>383</sup> as a strong consensus for phosphorylation by CK2, consistent with previous findings which showed that Thr<sup>383</sup> is phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2002</a>), and by MEK. Our results indicate that MEK rather than CK2 is involved in Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation in living HEK-293 cells, consistent with our docking model of the receptor/\u03b2-arrestin2/MEK complex, which predicts that the unfolded C-terminal part of \u03b2-arrestin comprising Thr<sup>383</sup> is located in the vicinity of MEK active site."

This result corroborates previous observations indicating that the sole substitution of Thr<sup>383</sup> to aspartate or alanine does not affect isoproterenol-induced \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor internalization (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lin et al., 2002</a>). In fact, only the double substitution of Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> to aspartate inhibited agonist-induced receptor internalization, an effect reflecting the reduced ability of this double \u03b2-arrestin mutant to bind to clathrin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lin et al., 2002</a>). It is likely that the phosphorylation stoichiometry of Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> in our experimental conditions, including cells exposed to 5-HT, does not allow such a regulation. Moreover, previous studies showed that \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor stimulation decreases rather than enhances the phosphorylation of these residues (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2002</a>). Accordingly, these studies and our results suggest that \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> might only have a minor influence on GPCR trafficking. In contrast, expressing Thr<sup>276</sup>Ala or Ser<sup>14</sup>Ala \u03b2-arrestin2 mutants in \u03b2-arrestin1/2 knockout cells fails to restore agonist-induced CXCR4 receptor sequestration while expressing a \u03b2-arrestin2 mutant harboring an aspartate at these positions is sufficient to decrease cell surface localization in the absence of agonist (<a href=\"#bib30\">Paradis et al., 2015</a>). This suggests that Thr<sup>276</sup> and/or Ser<sup>14</sup> phosphorylation rather than Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation might be critical for agonist-induced intracellular sequestration of some GPCRs."

Nonetheless, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation dependency of \u03b2-arrestin2 conformational changes seems to also depend on the nature of the GPCR it associates with, as the increase in intramolecular BRET signal measured upon 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation was not affected by substituting Thr<sup>383</sup> by alanine or by aspartate."

Based on the current experimental results and our previously validated docking model (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bourquard et al., 2015</a>), we propose a molecular mechanism which might explain the role of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation in recruitment and activation of Erk at the activated \u03b2-arrestin. In the crystal structures of both \u03b2-arrestin1 (PDB 1G4R) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2001</a>) and \u03b2-arrestin2 (PDB 3P2D) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhan et al., 2011</a>), the segment of the C-terminal tail comprising residues 385\u2013393 folds as a \u03b2-strand, which associates with the first N-terminal \u03b2-strand. The crystal structure of \u03b2-arrestin1 in complex with a C-terminal peptide of the V2 receptor (PDB 4JQI) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shukla et al., 2013</a>), also shows that the C-terminal peptide of the receptor occupies the same location as the 385\u2013393 segment of the inactive \u03b2-arrestin. Consequently, a drastic conformational change of the 385\u2013393 \u03b2-arrestin segment is necessary for the correct association of \u03b2-arrestin with the receptor. Furthermore, our previously reported docking model shows that the C-terminal region of the receptor is sandwiched between \u03b2-arrestin and Erk, and thus has to associate with \u03b2-arrestin before its association with Erk (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bourquard et al., 2015</a>). Finally, although Thr<sup>383</sup> is not present in the different structures of \u03b2-arrestins, the position of Asp<sup>385</sup> shows that Thr<sup>383</sup> is located in the vicinity of \u03b2-arrestin-bound MEK\u2019s active site, where it can be phosphorylated. In our model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>), Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation by MEK takes place within the ligand-dependent receptor/\u03b2-arrestin/Raf/MEK complex. We propose that this phosphorylation triggers the conformational change of the 350\u2013393 region, allowing the interaction of \u03b2-arrestin with the receptor C-terminal domain, the subsequent binding of Erk to the complex and its activation by MEK."

Actually, the sustained Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by agonist stimulation of these receptors was strongly reduced in cells expressing the Thr<sup>383</sup>Ala \u03b2-arrestin2 mutant. In contrast, substitution of Thr<sup>383</sup> by aspartate increased the basal level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylated \u03b2-arrestin2 can recruit and subsequently activate Erk1/2 in absence of receptor stimulation. As expected, 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor-operated Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which is \u03b2-arrestin-independent, was not affected by substituting Thr<sup>383</sup> by alanine. This result is consistent with the low Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation level measured in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, compared with cells expressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, and suggests that Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation might be a key molecular event governing \u03b2-arrestin dependency of Erk1/2 pathway engagement by GPCRs."

This underscores the potentially high influence of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation upon various \u03b2-arrestin2 functions related or not to GPCRs, while the phosphorylation of other residues (Ser<sup>14</sup> and Thr<sup>276</sup>) might govern steady state level of GPCR cell-surface expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Paradis et al., 2015</a>). This also indicates that \u03b2-arrestin2 can integrate upstream signals not only <i>via</i> its conformational changes upon association with receptors but also through a complex phosphorylation pattern that dictates downstream signaling events and the associated physiological functions."

Kinase reaction was started by adding 5 \u00b5L ATP (250 \u00b5M) and was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer. \u03b2-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> was analyzed by Western blotting using the purified anti-phospho-Thr<sup>383</sup>-\u03b2-arrestin2 antibody. For radioactive kinase assay, 10 \u00b5l of purified fractions containing\u00a0~1 \u00b5g YFP-\u03b2-arrestin2 or 1 \u00b5g of non-activated, purified GST-tagged Erk2 (Sigma Aldrich) were incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C in 5 \u00b5L kinase buffer in presence of active MEK1 and [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP (50 \u00b5M, 2 \u00b5Ci/nmol). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. Radioactive bands corresponding to \u03b2-arrestin2 and Erk2 were excised and radioactivity was measured by \u03b2-scintillation counting."

The authors propose that MEK promotes the phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup> and that this is necessary for recruitment of ERK to the receptor complex and its subsequent activation. The findings are potentially very interesting and reveal a novel signaling mechanism for the activation of ERK MAPK downstream of GPCRs. However, further experiments are required to confirm the proposed model and it is a concern that all the experiments rely on the ectopic expression of \u03b2-arrestin2 and GPCRs in cells."

This model is based on (i) the fact that this region in inactive \u03b2-arrestin2 interacts with the N-terminal region and has to be displaced for the interaction of this N-terminal region of \u03b2-arrestin with the receptor C-tail, (ii) our experimentally validated docking model which shows that in the receptor/\u03b2-arrestin/Raf/MEK/Erk complex, the receptor C-tail is sandwiched between \u03b2-arrestin and Erk and, consequently, that the conformational change has to take place before interaction with Erk and (iii) our experiments indicating that Erk is not recruited to the complex in absence of this phosphorylation. This is of course only a model. Though different hypotheses could be formulated, this model led us to make the hypothesis and then to validate that MEK is responsible for Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation, and it accounts for all the existing knowledge. We have largely modified the Discussion (fifth paragraph) to better distinguish the elements that are demonstrated and those which remain hypothetical."
