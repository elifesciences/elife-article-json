Previous work has established plasticity in brain slices and suggested plausible sites of behavioral learning. We now reveal what actually happens in the cerebellum during short-term learning. We monitor the expression of plasticity in the simple-spike firing of cerebellar Purkinje cells during trial-over-trial learning in smooth pursuit eye movements of monkeys. Our findings imply that: 1) a single complex-spike response driven by one instruction for learning causes short-term plasticity in a Purkinje cell\u2019s mossy fiber/parallel-fiber input pathways; 2) complex-spike responses and simple-spike firing rate are correlated across the Purkinje cell population; and 3) simple-spike firing rate at the time of an instruction for learning modulates the probability of a complex-spike response, possibly through a disynaptic feedback pathway to the inferior olive. These mechanisms may participate in long-term motor learning."

In the examples in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, the small rightward deflection of horizontal eye velocity (arrowhead) in the red trace (\u2018n-1\u2019 trial) was learned as the result of a rightward instruction in the prior trial (\u2018n-2\u2019, not shown); the leftward deflection in the blue trace (\u2018n\u2019 trial) was learned as the result of the leftward instruction on the \u2018n-1\u2019 trial. Because the eye velocity responses start before the instruction, they must be related to the instruction in the prior trial, rather than to that in the current trial."

However, the analysis described so far stops short of assessing how strongly simple-spike firing affects CS probability, and therefore also does not give insight into the possible strength of the proposed modulation. To assess the strength of the relationship, we next used simple-spike firing as the independent variable and assessed its impact on the probability of a CS response for each Purkinje cell. To do so, we created distributions of simple-spike firing rate in each trial averaged across the analysis interval (light pink shading on traces in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>).

A \u20181-0\u2019 pair, for example, meant that the instruction trial contained a CS response to the instruction and the test trial did not.

We can see the effect of same-trial facilitation by comparing pairs of trials that had the same CS response on the instruction trial, to hold trial-over-trial plasticity constant, but different CS responses on the test trial. For example, the simple-spike firing rate was the same in both trials of the pair when neither included a CS response (\u20180-0\u2019), so the trial-over-trial change in firing rate was almost flat (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, blue trace). When only the test trial included a CS response (\u20180-1\u2019, yellow trace), simple-spike firing rate was higher in the test trial and the trial-over-trial change in simple-spike firing rate was more positive. The same effect appears when a CS response always occurred in the instruction trial. The simple-spike firing rate was higher in test trials that contained a CS response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, \u20181-1\u2019, green trace), and the trial-over-trial change in firing rate was more positive, compared to pairs that did not contain a CS response in the test trial (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, \u20181-0\u2019, red trace)."

As we have noted elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib28\">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</a>), the fact that the learned eye velocities track the trial-over-trial changes in simple-spike firing rate implies that the CS responses are highly correlated across the Purkinje cell population. If the CS responses occurred with independent probabilities in different Purkinje cells, then the average across the population of Purkinje cells would be independent of the pattern of CS responses in the different pairs of trials. The learned eye velocity would be present for all pairs, and would not differ according to the pattern of CS responses."

The predictions for trial-over-trial changes in simple-spike firing rate broke down if we eliminated either CS-linked plasticity (\u2018NO plast\u2019) or same-trial facilitation (\u2018NO SStoCS\u2019). Trial-over-trial depression of simple-spike firing rate was fairly normal for all other configurations of the model, and also did not depend strongly on whether the response of an inferior olive neuron to the instruction was controlled by 1, 20, or all 1000 model Purkinje cells (\u2018F1\u2019, \u2018F20\u2019, \u2018F1000\u2019). Trial-over-trial changes in eye velocity were quite sensitive to the presence of neuron\u2013neuron correlations in the simple-spike firing rate and the CS responses across the population of Purkinje cells.

CS-linked trial-over-trial depression of simple-spike firing was demonstrated before (<a href=\"#bib28\">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</a>), and we have verified here that trial-over-trial depression results partly from single-trial plasticity. The present paper demonstrates CS-related same-trial facilitation of simple-spike firing rate during learning, and <a href=\"#bib32\">Miall et al. (1998)</a> showed the same phenomenon during quiescence. <a href=\"#bib27\">Medina and Lisberger (2007)</a> provided evidence for moderate neuron\u2013neuron correlations in simple-spike firing rate within the population of floccular Purkinje cells, and a number of papers have outlined the case for synchrony across the climbing-fiber inputs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Llinas et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Welsh et al., 1995</a>). Thus, our measurements have created a hypothesis for the operation of the cerebellar microcircuit during behavioral learning that is validated by experimental data and computer simulations. Still, we are aware that other models also could reproduce our data. For example, the probability of a CS and the simple-spike firing rate at the time of the instruction could be subject to top-down influences in parallel, a situation that would not require a pathway from Purkinje cells to the inferior olive, and might alter the implications for what happens in the cerebellum during motor learning."

One implication is caution in assuming that trial-over-trial depression is due to CS-linked plasticity. Indeed, our analysis indicates that CS-linked plasticity is responsible for only half of trial-over-trial depression. The other half of trial-over-trial depression on \u20181-0\u2019 pairs of trials is related to the tendency for simple-spike firing rate to be higher on trials with a CS. A second implication concerns a possible role in learning. If simple-spike firing rate acts through inhibitory neurons in the deep cerebellar nucleus to modulate the response of inferior olive neurons to a given instruction, then a learned response in the cerebellum could modulate its own instructive inputs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schweighofer, et al., 2013</a>). There are two inhibitory synapses in the pathway from Purkinje cells to the inferior olive (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">D\u2019Angelo, 2010</a>), so higher (lower) simple-spike firing could cause a higher (lower) probability of CS responses, in agreement with the data of <a href=\"#bib32\">Miall et al. (1998)</a> during quiescence and with our data during learning. Importantly, the climbing fiber axons from the inferior olive to the cerebellum and the pathway from the deep cerebellar nucleus back to the inferior olive both cross the midline, so that Purkinje cells can control their own climbing-fiber inputs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ruigrok, 1997</a>)."

(3) Past learning inhibits future learning, presumably by causing a learned decrease in the simple-spike responses of Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</a>) that could reduce the probability of the CS responses that would instruct learning.

Still, we are aware that there are multiple possible explanations for the observation that past learning inhibits future learning in pursuit eye movements. Thus, our data add support for, but do not obligate the conclusion that Purkinje cells modulate their own climbing-fiber inputs."

Consider a sequence of trials that delivers the same instruction on 50 consecutive trials. A CS response on trial \u20181\u2019 leads to a properly-timed depression of simple-spike firing on trial \u20182\u2019. Because of the decreased simple-spike firing, there is a lower probability of a CS response on trial \u20182\u2019. On trial \u20183\u2019, the random variation in simple-spike firing rate leads to some trials with the same or higher firing than trial \u20181\u2019 and a higher probability of a CS response to the instruction; other trials have lower simple-spike firing rate and a lower probability of a CS response. Finally, our analysis predicts that by trial \u201850\u2019, sustained learning has depressed simple-spike firing rate substantially (<a href=\"#bib28\">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</a>), so that the probability of a CS response is below control values and further learning is limited in the cerebellar cortex. Additional learning might become possible at a later time if some of the changes in the cerebellar cortex are transferred to the deep cerebellar nucleus, allowing a relaxation of the depression in the cerebellar cortex."

We expect that future work will provide positive evidence of specific roles during learning for other forms of plasticity and other brain sites of learning.

For each trial, we calculated the weakly correlated firing rates of the population of model Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>), and subtracted 5 spikes/s to implement plasticity if a CS had occurred for that Purkinje cell on the prior trial. Next, we computed the CS responses on the current trial for each model Purkinje cell (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equations 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#equ4\">4</a>). CS-caused plasticity decayed by 2.5 spikes/s on each of the next two trials. The simple-spike firing rate for a given Purkinje cell was represented as a scalar. Thus, the results of analysis of the model outputs also were scalars that were meant to represent the mean simple-spike firing rate across the analysis interval in our data. To create figures that were easy to compare with the actual data, we used those scalars as gain factors for time-varying traces from the data. There did not seem to be any reason to simulate either neural or behavioral responses on a millisecond time case within each trial, so time is represented in our model only in terms of the progression from trial-to-trial in a learning block."
