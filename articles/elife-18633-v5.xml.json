Although most integrins contain \u03b21, canonical activation mechanisms are based on studies of the platelet integrin, \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Its inactive conformation is characterized by the association of the \u03b1IIb transmembrane and cytosolic domain (TM/CT) with a tilted \u03b23 TM/CT that leads to activation when disrupted. We show significant structural differences between \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT in bicelles. Moreover, the \u2018snorkeling\u2019 lysine at the TM/CT interface of \u03b2 subunits, previously proposed to regulate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation by ion pairing with nearby lipids, plays opposite roles in \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin function and in neither case is responsible for TM tilt. A range of affinities from almost no interaction to the relatively high avidity that characterizes \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is seen between various \u03b1 subunits and \u03b21 TM/CTs. The \u03b1IIb\u03b23-based canonical model for the roles of the TM/CT in integrin activation and function clearly does not extend to all mammalian integrins."

Although most integrins contain \u03b21, canonical activation mechanisms are based on studies of the platelet integrin, \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Its inactive conformation is characterized by the association of the \u03b1IIb transmembrane and cytosolic domain (TM/CT) with a tilted \u03b23 TM/CT that leads to activation when disrupted. We show significant structural differences between \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT in bicelles. Moreover, the \u2018snorkeling\u2019 lysine at the TM/CT interface of \u03b2 subunits, previously proposed to regulate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation by ion pairing with nearby lipids, plays opposite roles in \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin function and in neither case is responsible for TM tilt. A range of affinities from almost no interaction to the relatively high avidity that characterizes \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is seen between various \u03b1 subunits and \u03b21 TM/CTs. The \u03b1IIb\u03b23-based canonical model for the roles of the TM/CT in integrin activation and function clearly does not extend to all mammalian integrins."

The paradigm for regulation of integrin affinity is set by the platelet-specific integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 found in the inactive state under normal conditions and activated to mediate platelet adhesion to fibrinogen following injury (<a href=\"#bib58\">Xiao et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coller and Shattil, 2008</a>). In the low affinity \u2018inactive\u2019 state integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 has a bent conformation that is stabilized by an outer clasp involving contacts between \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 located near the middle and ectoplasmic ends of their TMs and an inner clasp involving \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 contacts located in the cytosolic juxtamembrane domains, the latter of which includes a critical salt bridge. Within the inactive state heterodimer, the \u03b1IIb transmembrane helix is thought be reasonably well-aligned with the bilayer, while the long TM helix of \u03b23 is thought to have a pronounced (25\u00b0) tilt angle that is required to maintain simultaneous formation of the outer and inner clasps (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhu et al., 2009</a>)."

Following platelet activation, integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is converted to a high affinity state that is mediated by the binding of intracellular cytoplasmic proteins to the CT of \u03b23. The best studied of these interactions is the binding of the cytoskeletal protein talin to the \u03b2 CT. Talin is a key regulator of integrin activation and is comprised of head and rod domains. The head has an atypical FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain containing four subdomains: F0-F3. F3 contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) signature that binds to the NPxY motif shared by both integrin \u03b21 and \u03b23 CT, while F0-F2 enhances binding through favorable electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids in the vicinity of the integrin on the membrane surface (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Saltel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anthis et al., 2010</a>). This leads to a reduction of the tilt angle of the \u03b23 TM and destabilization of the inner membrane clasp between the \u03b23 and \u03b1IIb subunits, promoting dissociation of the transmembrane domains and integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ye et al., 2014</a>). Whether kindlins, a second FERM domain containing protein family with key roles in integrin activation, also contribute to the TM dissociation is an area of active investigation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ye et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Theodosiou et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Moretti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lefort et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Montanez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Moser et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2009b</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2008</a>)."

While there is evidence that the fibronectin \u03b15\u03b21 integrin may resemble \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Takagi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Luo et al., 2004</a>), it is unclear whether all the 12 possible \u03b1\u03b21 integrin combinations are activated similarly to \u03b1IIb\u03b23, or whether there is mechanistic heterogeneity underlying their various adhesive functions. That the paradigm of integrin activation established by \u03b1IIb\u03b23 might extend to \u03b21 integrins is suggested by fairly high sequence homology between the \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin TMs and CTs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In addition, the putative snorkeling lysine K752 of \u03b21 integrin was shown to regulate activation of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 in the same manner as proposed for K716 of \u03b23 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, disruption of the inner membrane clasp in \u03b21 integrin did not cause any phenotype in knockin mice, nor did it alter integrin activation as assessed by activation-dependent antibodies or cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin (<a href=\"#bib14\">Czuchra et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, contrary to the canonical model, ligand (i.e. collagen) binding to the integrins \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 has been reported to occur in the absence of integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abair et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nissinen et al., 2012</a>). Thus, our understanding of the role of the TM interactions between \u03b1 and \u03b21 integrin subunits in regulating integrin activation and function remains incomplete."

We wished to assess whether this mechanistic component of integrin regulation is conserved in \u03b21 integrins, specifically for the collagen binding integrins \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21. Integrin \u03b21-K752 corresponds to \u03b23-K716 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We therefore generated populations of integrin \u03b21 null renal collecting duct (CD) polarized epithelial cells expressing comparable levels of human integrin \u03b21-WT, \u03b21-K752R and \u03b21-K752E. The CD cells were sorted for equal levels of expression of \u03b21 integrin and endogenous integrin \u03b11 or \u03b12 subunits. The different cell populations were then subjected to adhesion on collagens I or IV, which are the preferred ligands for integrins \u03b12\u03b21 and \u03b11\u03b21, respectively. The \u03b21-K752R mutation (which maintained the positive amino acid charge) did not significantly change CD cell adhesion to collagen I (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) in the absence or presence of an integrin \u03b11 blocking antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Similar results were found over a concentration range of collagen I from 0.125\u201320 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown). However, under the same conditions, CD cells expressing the \u03b21-K752E mutation (which changed the amino acid charge from positive to negative) exhibited little adhesion to collagen I in the absence or presence of an integrin \u03b11 blocking antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Comparable results were found for CD cell adhesion to collagen IV (0.25 \u03bcg/ml) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) in the presence or absence of an integrin \u03b12 blocking antibody as well as over a concentration of collagen IV from 0.0625\u201310 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown). Due to the severe collagen adhesion defect of CD cells expressing the K752E-\u03b21 mutant, we investigated the effect of this mutation on cell spreading on collagen I and collagen IV over short periods of time. CD cells expressing the \u03b21-K752E mutation spread significantly less on collagen I than CD cells expressing wild type \u03b21 integrin at 15, 30 and 45 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>). Similar results were seen when the cells were plated on collagen IV, although the difference was no longer statistically different at 45 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and F</a>). These results were completely contrary to expectations based on the activating nature of the K716E-\u03b23 mutation described for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>)."

The intensity of 12G10/AIIB2 antibody binding was significantly less in the \u03b21-K752E mutant compared to WT CD cells. This difference was no longer present when the cells were adhered in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which is known to artificially activate integrins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G and H</a>). Thus, reversing the basic charge of the snorkeling lysine near the TM domain of the \u03b21 integrin significantly decreased integrin \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21-dependent adhesion to and spreading on collagens by polarized CD epithelial cells. In addition, it resulted in a lower affinity state of \u03b21 integrin in the context of CD cells adherent on collagen I."

D6PC/DMPC bicelles yielded the most optimal \u03b21 TM/CT spectrum in terms of the total number of peaks, evidence for conformational homogeneity, and the relative intensities of peaks from the TM to those of peaks from the cytosolic domain. The second experiment employed bicelle conditions that matched those used in critical prior studies of the isolated TM of the platelet integrin \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 heterodimer and constituent monomers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lau et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2009</a>): 0.3 mM (0.34 mol%) integrin TM/CT, 20% q\u00a0=\u00a00.3 D6PC/POPC/POPS bicelles (where POPC:POPS\u00a0=\u00a02:1 mol:mol) in a buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4.

While peaks have previously been assigned for the isolated \u03b23 TM (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2009</a>), this is not the case for the combined TM/CT in bicelles. We therefore completed assignments for this protein as well (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For both the \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT the assigned chemical shifts have been deposited into the BMRB database (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ulrich et al., 2008</a>) (access codes: 26623 and 26624). Using the CA, CO, and CB chemical shifts for the assigned resonances, the secondary structures of both the \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin TM/CT were determined using chemical shift index and TALOS-N analyses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For \u03b21, there is an \u03b1-helix extending from the N-terminal I732 at the beginning of the TM to K765 located in the cytosol, roughly eight sites beyond the end of the TM. For the \u03b23 TM/CT, this helix also starts at the beginning of the TM (at I693), but extends roughly 16 residues into the cytosol, terminating only at A737. Beyond the TM/CT helix, the remaining intracellular domains of both integrin \u03b21 and integrin \u03b23 are unstructured. The degree to which the TM helix of the \u03b23 integrin extends further into the CT relative to \u03b21 (nine residues longer for \u03b23) is striking. The stability of this helix was probed by examining backbone amide/water hydrogen exchange rates using the CLEANEX-PM NMR experiment (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hwang et al., 1998</a>) and by measuring backbone amide <sup>15</sup>N NMR relaxation rates. Results from these experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) show that the transmembrane helix is rigid and, not surprisingly, exchange-resistant. The CT segments identified as helical by analysis of the chemical shifts are seen to exhibit a gradient of low exchange/low motion to significantly higher exchange and motion going from the end of the TM to the end of the chemical-shift identified CT helical segments. There is also a modest spike in exchange and motion observed at the TM/CT interface. These data are consistent both with the notion that the CT helices are prone to significant fraying and also that there is a modest degree of hinge motion at the TM/CT helix interface. It is very clear from the topological analysis presented in the following sections that the CT helix is extended away from the membrane into the cytosol and that any hinge motions at the TM/CT interface are not of sufficient magnitude to enable significant interactions of the CT helix with the membrane surface."

The same results were obtained when the lipophilic paramagnetic probe 16-DSA was used (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "The fact that the \u03b21-K752E mutation did not impact the membrane topology/tilt for the \u03b21 subunit was surprising in light of a previous study that presented Mn(II)-EDDA (polar) probe accessibility data showing that the \u03b23-K716E mutation induced a major change in membrane topology, at least for the isolated integrin \u03b23 TM (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, a pronounced tilt of the TM for the WT \u03b23 protein was reported to be largely reversed by the K-&gt;E mutation to yield a TM that is much more closely aligned with the bilayer normal. It was proposed in that work that the tilt of the \u03b23 TM is stabilized by a \u2018snorkeling\u2019 interaction between the side chain amino moiety of the membrane-buried K716 site and oxyanions in the nearby lipid head groups (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Because of the surprising discord between the \u03b21 results of this work versus the prior \u03b23 results we repeated the Mn(II)-EDDA probe experiment for the isolated \u03b23 TM using the same methods as originally used by Kim, Schmidt, et al (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, our \u03b23-WT vs. \u03b23-K716E results are very similar to the previously reported results. Use of the hydrophilic Gd-DTPA probe led to a similar result as for Mn-EDDA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), yielding results consistent with a major change in tilt for the TM domain due to the \u03b23-K716E mutation. However, a discordant result was obtained when the lipophilic 16-DSA was used as the paramagnetic probe (note that an apolar probe was not employed in the previous study (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>) of the isolated \u03b23 TM): for 16-DSA, little difference was observed between the membrane topology and tilt of \u03b23-WT and the \u03b23-K716E mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This led us to recall literature showing that chelate probes such as Mn(II)-EDDA and Gd(III)-DTPA sometimes have an exposed ligand site that can transiently associate with anions such as Glu and Asp side chain carboxylates (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hocking et al., 2013</a>). To test this possibility, we repeated the Gd(III)-DTPA probe experiment under conditions in which excess (10 mM) free EDTA was added to the solution to cap any free ligand sites in Gd(III)-DTPA, thereby suppressing any direct binding of protein carboxyl sides to the open ligand site in the lanthanide ion chelate. Under these conditions the \u03b23-WT and \u03b23-K716E mutant exhibited the same probe accessibility patterns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), fully consistent with the 16-DSA results. These results indicate that the previously reported differences seen for the isolated \u03b23 TM using Mn(II)-EDDA reflected an experimental artifact based on the tendency of free carboxyl groups in proteins (i.e., the introduced Glu716 side chain carboxyl) to transiently serve as ligands to available metal ion coordination sites in chelate complexes."

To quantitate the impact of the \u03b23-K716E and \u03b21-K752E mutations on heterodimer formation NMR was used to monitor titrations in which WT and mutant forms of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled integrin \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT were titrated by various unlabeled WT \u03b1 TM/CT subunits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Binding of integrin \u03b15 to either the WT or K752E \u03b21 TM/CT and binding of integrin \u03b1IIb to either WT or K716E \u03b23 resulted in the\u00a0disappearance of the \u03b2 subunit TROSY NMR peaks rather than shifts, indicating \u2018slow exchange\u2019 between free and complexed subunits on the NMR time scale (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For each of these titrations a 1:1 binding model was fitted to the concentration dependence of the disappearance of multiple peaks using a\u00a0global fitting, in which the traces from multiple peaks were simultaneously fit. It can be seen that this approach generated reasonably good fits of the data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). However, traces for a few peaks, such as that of G744 in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, exhibited deviation from ideal 1:1 behavior, most likely because the presence of a second concentration-dependent phenomenon such as non-specific interactions between subunits that also contributed to the observed shifts for such peaks. Eliminating the outliers from the global fitting process did not dramatically change the Kd estimated from the fitting. For example, global fitting of all four traces shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> led to a Kd of 0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 mol%, while a repeat fit minus the G744 outlier data led to a Kd of 0.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 mol%."

Global fitting a 1:1 binding model to the concentration dependence of peaks seen to shift the most in each titration yielded good fits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013H</a>) but revealed that binding did not approach saturation over the concentration range accessible by NMR, such that only lower limits for the Kd could be determined. It is interesting that, for a given concentration, titration with \u03b11 TM/CT generated significantly larger resonance shifts in certain peaks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>) than \u03b12 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G and H</a>). It is also notable the largest shifts seen in the titration of K752E \u03b21 TM/CT by \u03b11 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) are significantly larger than the corresponding \u03b11-induced shifts seen for the WT \u03b21 TM/CT. Finally, it was surprising that the largest shifts seen in titrations of both WT and mutant forms of \u03b21 are for peaks from sites on the distal cytosolic end of the CT. However, the exact interpretation of these observations and whether they are truly significant in terms informing on integrin activation is difficult to assess in light of the fact that heterodimerization in all four cases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013H</a>) was too weak to quantify."

CD cells with equal surface expression of the \u03b15, \u03b21 and \u03b21-K752E mutation were generated. Both the wild type and \u03b21K752E CD cells adhered equally to fibronectin (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). As these cells express integrin \u03b1v, the same experiment was carried out in the presence of an integrin \u03b1v blocking antibody. Under these conditions CD cell adhesion was decreased, albeit less than the adhesion defect observed with the CD cells adhering to collagen I or IV. No differences in cell adhesion were seen when the cells adhered to fibronectin in the presence of an anti-\u03b21 antibody, suggesting that the \u03b21-K752E mutation decreased integrin \u03b15\u03b21-dependent adhesion of CD cells to fibronectin. When we assessed the spreading of these cells on fibronectin over different time periods, we observed a consistent but non-significant decrease in spreading of the \u03b21K752E CD cells at 15-, 30- and 45 min time points (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). We also assessed the relative intensity of 12 G10 compared to AIIB2 on cells plated on fibronectin. Similar to when the cells adhered to collagen I there was decreased intensity of 12 G10 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and D</a>), which correlated with the adhesion and spreading defects.

We probed whether affinity of the interactions of the isolated talin F3 domain with the \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT are altered by the \u03b21-K752E and \u03b23-K716E mutations. NMR was used to monitor titrations of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled integrin TM/CT subunits with unlabeled talin F3 in bicelles containing POPS, an anionic lipid (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). During the course of the titrations it was observed that certain peaks disappeared, indicating that binding between the two proteins is slow on the NMR time scale, as is typical when Kd\u00a0\u2264\u00a0100 \u03bcM. Binding was therefore quantitated based on monitoring the F3 domain concentration-dependence of peak intensity reductions. As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, the talin F3 bound to both \u03b21-WT and \u03b21-K752E TM/CT in POPC/POPS/D6PC bicelles with similar (moderate) affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 \u00b5M and 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 \u00b5M for WT and K752E \u03b21 TM/CT, respectively). In contrast, the \u03b23-K716E mutation results in a 6-fold increase in the K<sub>d</sub> for talin-1 binding from 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 \u00b5M to 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 \u00b5M, suggesting the \u03b23-K716E mutation alters the structure and/or dynamics of bicelle-associated \u03b23 TM/CT to reduce talin-1 F3 binding affinity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). These results indicate that mutation of the snorkeling lysine of \u03b23, but not of \u03b21, significantly reduces the affinity of the talin F3 domain for the isolated integrin subunit. The affinity of F3 for both the \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT is higher by over an order of magnitude than the affinity of F3 for the isolated CT of these integrins in buffer minus either membranes or a membrane-mimetic (K<sub>d</sub> of 490 \u00b5M and 270\u2013600 \u00b5M for \u03b21 and \u03b23, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Saltel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anthis et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that the full affinity of the complex between talin and the integrin \u03b23 CT in membranes containing an anionic lipid (Kd ca. 0.9 \u03bcM) requires the presence of a linked talin F2 domain (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moore et al., 2012</a>)."

We show that the structures of the \u03b21 and \u03b23 CT/TM in bicelles are distinct. Also, the highly conserved \u2018snorkeling\u00a0lysine\u2019 that plays a key role in regulating \u03b1II\u03b23 activation plays an opposite role in \u03b21 integrin function and does not play a role in defining the tilt of either \u03b21 or \u03b23. Very different affinities exist between \u03b21 and some \u03b1 subunits relative to those observed between \u03b1IIb and \u03b23. We therefore conclude that the diverse biophysical properties of \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin TM and CT domains in combination with varying \u03b1 subunit properties result in distinct mechanisms of integrin activation and function."

Consistent with this, \u03b23 tail mutations that resulted in normal integrin activation and talin binding but decreased cell spreading, were recently described (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pinon et al., 2014</a>). A previous study showed that expression of \u03b21-K752L in integrin \u03b21-null fibroblasts did not alter the integrin activation status or the ability of the cells to adhere to fibronectin and laminin-111; however this mutation did inhibit cell spreading and migration (<a href=\"#bib5\">Armulik et al., 2004</a>). The mechanism for the altered integrin \u03b21-K752L-mediated cell function was proposed to be due to altered phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation that impacted FAK-independent integrin signaling without altering integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Armulik et al., 2004</a>). We did not test the effect of a \u03b21-K752L mutation in CD cells. Nevertheless, a possible reason for the differences in integrin activation in cell systems that are null for \u03b21 and those in CHO cells is that in the former, the mutant integrin is transduced into a \u03b21-null CD cell, while in the CHO cell system the mutated \u03b2 integrin is expressed into a cell that already has endogenous integrins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Alternatively, it could simply reflect differences in cell type. Another important point is that the only effect of the mutation of the \u2018snorkeling lysine\u2019 tested in CHO cells was on integrin activation, and not cell functions that rely on ligand-dependent integrin signaling such as adhesion, migration or spreading."

This interaction has been proposed to be a key determinant of the TM tilt that is required for optimal outer and inner clasp interactions between the \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 subunits, which are present only in the inactive state (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). This led us to conduct Mn(II)-induced paramagnetic relaxation NMR experiments (PRE) on WT and \u03b21-K752E to determine whether K752 also promotes tilt of the TM. To our surprise, we observed that \u03b21-WT and \u03b21-K752E integrin exhibit the same PRE patterns, indicating that the tilt of the \u03b21 integrin TM is independent of the charge of residue 752. Paradoxically, we made the exact same observation for the \u03b23-K716E mutation indicating that neither \u03b21 nor \u03b23 integrins form a lysine/phospholipid ion pair critical for promoting TM tilt. Our studies revealed that previously reported PRE results to the contrary had been subject to an experimental artifact, as detailed in the Results section. Hence, the previous work had mistakenly concluded that the different PRE patterns observed for \u03b23-WT and \u03b23-K716E reflected very different membrane topologies for WT and mutant (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Here, we repeated the original experiment, but took pains to eliminate the artifactual interaction, revealing that both WT and the K-to-E mutant forms of both \u03b23 and \u03b21 have membrane topologies that are similar in all four cases. We confirmed these observations by reciprocal NMR PRE experiments using a lipophilic paramagnetic probe. Thus, not only does \u03b21-K752 promote functional output that is opposite to that promoted by \u03b23-K716, but even in the case of \u03b23 the mechanism by which \u03b23-K716 promotes the inactive signaling state must now again be regarded as unknown. Our results are consistent with another study that used a\u00a0biotin maleimide chemical modification of engineered Cys side chains to show that the K716P mutation in \u03b23 did not result in any change in membrane topology (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kurtz et al., 2012</a>)."

Consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anthis et al., 2010</a>), we found that the talin F3 domain binds to the WT \u03b23 TM/CT significantly more tightly than to WT \u03b21 TM/CT (Kd for \u03b23 lower by a factor of 5). Interestingly, the \u03b23-K716E mutation increased Kd for talin binding by a factor of 6, a finding that that does not correlate well with the proposed activation-promoting nature of this mutation. On the other hand, the \u03b21-K752E mutation alters Kd by less than 2-fold and does so in favor of tighter binding. While possible roles for the F0-F2 talin domains in possible coupling between the TM lysine site and talin binding were not tested in this study, at face value these results suggest that the impact of the TM K-to-E mutation on talin binding is not the basis for how this mutation alters integrin function, once again suggesting a mechanism whereby the TM K-to-E mutation alters integrin function by altering integrin-dependent signaling and not activation. It is interesting that talin binds to both integrin TM/CT domains in bicelles more tightly than to CT-only domains in buffer (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anthis et al., 2010</a>). Bicelles most likely promote a more native-like conformational state of the CT in the context of its attached and bicelle-anchored TM than for the isolated CT in solution."

The \u03b21 TM ends after I758 while the \u03b23 TM ends after I721, in reasonably good accord with previous NMR, EPR, and biochemical studies. The TM helix of both \u03b21 and \u03b23 was seen to extend into the cytosol and through the juxtamembrane residues that form the inner clasp, albeit with some fraying. However, unlike \u03b21, where the helix ends with the clasp at K765, the helix in the \u03b23 extends a full 10 residues further into the subunit, ending only at A737 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This result is reminiscent of the observations that a continuous \u03b23 TM/CT extends to D740 as part of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 TM/CT heterodimer in an organic solvent mixture (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2009</a>), while in the corresponding complex for the CT-only heterodimer the \u03b23 helix ends at K738 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vinogradova et al., 2002</a>). A previous cross-linking/computational study of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex in cell membranes also indicated the \u03b23 helix extends from the TM far out into the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhu et al., 2009</a>). Our results are also generally consistent with a previous NMR study of the \u03b23 TM/CT domain in DPC micelles, where an extended CT helix was observed, but was connected to the TM by a flexible linker (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2002</a>). Our data also support the presence of hinge motion centered at the TM/CT interface, although our data suggest that hinge formation is transient, not a stable structural feature. Other NMR or EPR structural studies of the \u03b21 or \u03b23 TM in isolation or of the \u03b1II\u03b23 TM complex did not include the full CT (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lau et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). The combined structural and membrane topological studies of our work also offer clear evidence that, on the average, the CT helix for both \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT extends away from the membrane surface into the aqueous phase. Our results are not consistent with the notion that the CT has significant membrane surface affinity, as suggested based on a previous NMR study of crosslinked \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 CT in DPC micelles (<a href=\"#bib34\">Metcalf et al., 2010</a>)."

Both of these facts hinder the extrapolation of the observations to full length integrins in native membrane conditions. Nevertheless, they do suggest that some of the functional differences between \u03b21 and \u03b23 are linked to the different intrinsic conformational preferences of their CT, which likely impacts their selectivity and affinity in engaging their cytosolic effector proteins. It is interesting to note that while we observed the \u03b23 helix to extend through site A737, in an NMR structure of the complex of the \u03b23 CT with the talin F3 domain the helix terminates at amino acid 732 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wegener et al., 2007</a>), suggesting destabilization of the C terminal end of the helix by talin. Conversely, for bicelle-associated \u03b21 the helix was seen to terminate at K765, while in a crystal structure of the \u03b21 CT with the talin F2F3 domains this helix does not terminate till A773 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anthis et al., 2009</a>). These results suggest that the end of the \u03b23 TM/CT helix is not very stable but is readily disrupted by events such as engagement by talin. This is consistent with the fraying of the CT helix seen in the results of this paper. At the same time the disordered segment C-terminal to the \u03b21 TM/CT helix does have helical propensity that is manifested upon complex formation with talin. The metastability of secondary structure in both \u03b21 and \u03b23 CT seems well suited to enable optimal interactions to cytosolic binding partners."

Based mostly on studies of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin it has been widely assumed that the TM/CT of \u03b2 integrins have an intrinsic affinity for the corresponding domains of their cognate \u03b1 subunits, such that they will form constitutively inactive heterodimers. Many studies have shown the isolated \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 TM associate to form heterodimers in model membranes or as fusion proteins in <i>E. coli</i> or model cell lines (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Berger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Partridge et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schneider and Engelman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schmidt et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lokappa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2009</a>). We observed similar results for heterodimerization of the \u03b15 and \u03b21 TM/CT, an observation consistent with evidence that this particular \u03b21 integrin is activated according to the canonical model (<a href=\"#bib51\">Takagi et al., 2003</a>). In contrast, we found that \u03b11 and \u03b21 as well as \u03b12 and \u03b21 TM/CT interactions were too weak to be quantified in bicelles, even at the high protein concentrations required for NMR spectroscopy. This is surprising in light of studies suggesting that the fusion proteins containing the TM-only domain of these integrin subunits can form heterodimers in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schneider and Engelman, 2004</a>). However, these latter studies were conducted in the absence of the \u03b21, \u03b11, and \u03b12 CT, which almost certainly profoundly impact heterodimerization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Briesewitz et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). Our results suggest that the \u03b11 and \u03b12 CT may actually inhibit formation of \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 TM/CT heterodimers, at least in bicelles. The stark contrast between the collagen \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 integrins and the fibronectin \u03b15\u03b21 integrin suggests that the role of TM/CT domain heterodimerization in regulating integrin function may vary considerably among different \u03b21 integrins, as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nissinen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abair et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bazzoni et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pepinsky et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bodeau et al., 2001</a>)."

Thus \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrins appear to have distinct mechanisms of action wherein different modes of integrin regulation likely occur within the \u03b21 integrin class based on which \u03b1 subunit is involved, as well as which cell type. Such cell type-specific mechanisms of integrin function need to be explored if we are to understand how different integrins function in distinct biological settings."

NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (<a href=\"#bib15\">Delaglio et al., 1995</a>) and analyzed using NMRViewJ (<a href=\"#bib19\">Johnson, 2004</a>). Backbone chemical shift assignments were analyzed using chemical shift index analysis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wishart and Sykes, 1994</a>) and TALOS-N (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shen and Bax, 2013</a>) in order to determine the secondary structure. The TROSY peak assignments of the mutant protein or WT protein under pH 7.4 D6PC/POPC/POPS bicelles conditions were obtained by comparing spectra to the pH 6.5 \u2018reference\u2019 assigned WT spectrum. For some mutants/conditions a 3D TROSY-HNCA was collected and analyzed to assist with confirming and completing assignments."

This is particularly important, as this is the only data that supports a major finding of this paper (constitutive activation of a1B1 and a2B1) and therefore the findings and potential caveats requires further discussion.

This data also does not give any readout on membrane tilt; no effect is seen but it is not clear if this is due to the experiment or the mutant. Without the \u03b1 tail present it is not possible to judge the overall effect of this mutation as the lysine is positioned with the potential to make a number of contacts to phenylalanines on the \u03b1 tail. It is possible that the lysine makes a cation-pi bond to the delocalized electrons of the phenylalanine ring and thus in a more physiologically relevant context the mutant might be more significant. The authors should discuss this point."

The extensive paramagnetic probe data presented in this paper for the non-truncated combined TM/CT domains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) makes it very clear that the cytosolic segments observed to be helical based on TALOS analysis of the NMR backbone chemical shifts for both B1 and B3 are <i>not</i> interacting with the membrane surface, but extend into the aqueous phase. While it is true that monomeric water soluble polypeptides usually do not form stable helices in solution, we argue that the fact that the cytoplasmic domain helices are extensions of highly stable membrane-embedded helices makes them much more stable than they would be as excised peptides in solution. That this is energetically reasonable is supported by crystal structures of many membrane proteins in which TM helices are extended well beyond the membrane. Indeed in the structure of the \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 integrin TM/CT structure determined by the Qin lab (Armulik, Velling and Johansson, 2004) in a water/organic solvent mixture, they observed the beta3 TM helix to extend even further into the cytosol than we do even though it does not make any tertiary structure interactions with the \u03b1 subunit beyond the juxtamembrane clasp. Others also have proposed structures for B3 or for the \u03b1IIb/B3 complex (based on a variety of data or modeling that include an extended B3 helix into the cytosol that is contiguous with the transmembrane domain (c.f. Zhu, Luo, Barth et al. Molecular Cell, 33, 234-249, 2009; Wegener, Partridge et al. Cell 128, 171-182 2007; Anthis, Wegener et al. EMBO J 28, 3623-3632, 2009; Metclaf, Moore et al. PNAS, 107, 22481-22486, 2010). We also emphasize that what is most interesting about results of our studies is the fact that the B1 helix is much shorter than that of B3, extending much less far into the cytosol."
