How cells detect the accumulation of misfolded proteins remains unclear. In this study, we identify a noncanonical interaction between the ATPase domain of the ER chaperone BiP and the luminal domains of the UPR sensors Ire1 and Perk that dissociates when authentic ER unfolded protein C<sub>H</sub>1 binds to the canonical substrate binding domain of BiP. Unlike the interaction between chaperone and substrates, we found that the interaction between BiP and UPR sensors was unaffected by nucleotides. Thus, we discover that BiP is dual functional UPR sensor, sensing unfolded proteins by canonical binding to substrates and transducing this event to noncanonical, signaling interaction to Ire1 and Perk. Our observations implicate BiP as the key component for detecting ER stress and suggest an allosteric mechanism for UPR induction."

Inside this compartment there is a system called the unfolded protein response that detects misfolded proteins and boosts the cell's capacity to re-fold them. As part of this system, two sensor proteins detect when misfolded proteins are present, but it is not clear how they do so. It has been suggested that a chaperone protein called BiP may be able to activate these sensor proteins in order to turn on the unfolded protein response."

The experiments show that both of the sensor proteins can bind to a section of the BiP chaperone called the ATPase domain. However, in the presence of an unfolded protein, BiP stopped interacting with the sensor proteins, which could allow the sensor proteins to activate the unfolded protein response. The experiments also show that BiP must bind to the unfolded protein to activate the unfolded protein response."

The sudden requirement for processing large quantities of secretory proteins can be immense and results in over burdening the folding machinery within the ER, leading to accumulation of misfolded proteins and ER stress (<a href=\"#bib12\">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</a>). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cell signaling system that detects the presence of misfolded proteins within the ER and carries out a varied cellular response to maintain homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Hetz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</a>).

By primarily using biophysical/biochemical techniques, we discover a direct noncanonical interaction between the ATPase domain of BiP to the luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk, clearly indicating a UPR signaling role. This interaction is unaffected by nucleotide binding to BiP. We further show that unfolded protein C<sub>H</sub>1 binds to the canonical BiP substrate binding domain; this relieves the interaction between BiP and luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk. Moreover, our data indicate that this model is consistent in cells. Overall, our observations suggest a novel allosteric model for UPR induction that involves BiP as the key component for detecting ER stress."

To assess the role of BiP in UPR sensing, we first examined whether there was an interaction between the luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk to full-length BiP. Using microscale thermophoresis, we found that both Ire1 and Perk luminal domains bound to BiP with binding affinities of K<sub>d</sub> = 1.33 \u03bcM and 1.92 \u03bcM, respectively, consistent with a typical transient protein\u2013protein interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). To dissect the molecular basis of the interaction between Ire1 and Perk with BiP, we tested if this interaction was mediated by the canonical substrate binding domain, as it is the case for this chaperone, or the ATPase domain. Both BiP's ATPase and substrate binding domains were expressed and purified separately and assessed for their ability to bind to Ire1 and Perk luminal domains. Analysis of binding by thermophoresis revealed that in contrast to full-length BiP, we measured no binding between luminal domains and BiP's substrate binding domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). Surprisingly, we discovered that BiP's ATPase domain bound to both Ire1 and Perk luminal domains with binding affinities of K<sub>d</sub> = 1.97 \u03bcM and 2.05 \u03bcM, which were almost identical to full-length BiP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). These results reveal that BiP binding to the luminal domains of Ire1 or Perk does not involve BiP's substrate binding domain. Rather, the interaction between BiP with Ire1 and Perk luminal domains is entirely mediated by BiP's ATPase domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). Such an interaction with BiP ATPase domain is novel, and suggests that the BiPATPase domain interaction with Ire1 or Perk is distinct from the classical chaperone-substrate interaction, and may serve some key signaling functions that we set out to elucidate. To confirm that the noncanonical interactions detected by microscale thermophoresis were robust, we developed an independent assay. Pull down assays with purified proteins recapitulated our previous results: His<sub>6</sub>-tagged full-length BiP and BiP ATPase domain proteins were able to form an interaction with luminal domain of Ire1 and Perk, while His<sub>6</sub>-tagged BiP substrate binding domain did not bind to Ire1 and Perk luminal domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Thus, we have here recapitulated the interaction between full-length BiP and Ire1 and Perk luminal domains. Moreover, we confirm that Ire1 and Perk luminal domains bind to BiP's ATPase domain."

We designed a range of constructs based upon this classification in order to determine more precisely the interaction site between Ire1 and Perk luminal domains with BiP's ATPase domain (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). One point to note, is that using this assignment (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kimata et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2007</a>) yeast Ire1 luminal domain possesses an extended region I, whilst the equivalent region in human Ire1 is essentially absent. The implication for human Ire1 is that both regions I and II are very close together and map onto the equivalent of yeast region II. Next, we measured the binding affinities for BiP's ATPase domain interacting with human Ire1 and Perk luminal domains comprising of various regions between I and V. We found that binding affinities for region II\u2013IV were essentially the same as those measured for binding to the full-length luminal domain construct region I\u2013V, indicating the core interaction between UPR luminal domains and BiP maps to the luminal domain region II\u2013IV and ATPase domain, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). To reinforce the in vitro data, we assessed whether the interaction between Ire1 luminal domain regions II\u2013IV and BiP occurs in cells. Principally, we conducted a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using an Ire1 region V deletion mutant (Ire1\u0394V; \u0394390\u2013430) with a BiP construct possessing an N-terminal HA-tag, in the absence and presence of ER stress, and then compared with full-length Ire1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In the absence of ER stress, immunoblotting with Ire1-specific antibody clearly indicates the presence of bands that are consistent for both Ire1 \u0394V mutant and full-length protein co-immunoprecipitating with BiP. Upon ER stress, both Ire1 \u0394V mutant and full-length Ire1 protein display a reduced level of interaction with BiP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We also assessed direct binding with BiP ATPase domain to both Ire1 full-length and \u0394V mutant\u2014observing an interaction consistent with in vitro data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These results suggest that BiP interacts with Ire1 region II\u2013IV in cells and that region V is dispensable for this interaction to occur, reinforcing the previous in vitro analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Ire1 luminal domain region II\u2013IV has been suggested to be important for stress sensing in yeast (<a href=\"#bib4\">Credle et al., 2005</a>). Here, we identified region II\u2013IV as the binding site for human BiP-luminal domain protein interaction. This suggests that BiP is likely to be important in mammalian ER stress sensing."

The intrinsically unfolded immunoglobulin constant heavy chain domain (C<sub>H</sub>1), which is disordered in the absence of its cognate binding partner C<sub>L</sub>, is a relevant, ER localized unfolded protein substrate (<a href=\"#bib5\">Feige et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Marcinowski et al., 2011</a>). First, we examined if unfolded protein C<sub>H</sub>1 binds to the luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk. Surprisingly, we measured no interaction between C<sub>H</sub>1 and luminal domains suggesting that Ire1 and Perk luminal domains are not directly involved in detecting unfolded proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). Next, we assessed the interaction of C<sub>H</sub>1 to full-length BiP. As expected (<a href=\"#bib13\">Marcinowski et al., 2011</a>), we found that C<sub>H</sub>1 bound to full-length BiP with a binding affinity of K<sub>d</sub> = 8.7 \u03bcM. To identify what region of BiP, C<sub>H</sub>1 specifically bound to, we used ATPase and substrate binding domain proteins for interaction analysis. As expected for an Hsp70 chaperone (<a href=\"#bib13\">Marcinowski et al., 2011</a>), we found that C<sub>H</sub>1 bound only to the substrate binding domain of BiP with a similar binding affinity to that of full-length BiP, suggesting that BiP's substrate binding domain was solely responsible for binding to C<sub>H</sub>1 unfolded protein."

The addition of C<sub>H</sub>1 to the complex caused complete dissociation of both full-length BiP-Ire1 and full-length BiP-Perk luminal domain complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The dissociation of the BiP-Ire1 and BiP-Perk complexes by C<sub>H</sub>1 reveals that unfolded protein binding to BiP substrate binding domain, causes BiP ATPase domain to dissociate from BiP-luminal domain complex. Thus, when BiP is engaged in a signaling complex with Ire1 or Perk, its substrate binding domain remains available to interact directly with misfolded protein. This interaction dissociates the complex and initiates UPR signaling. To confirm these findings, we incubated C<sub>H</sub>1 with BiP and then subsequently added Ire1 and Perk luminal domains. Consistent with our prediction, we found that BiP engaged with misfolded protein C<sub>H</sub>1, is unable to bind to the luminal domains of Ire1 or Perk (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

It is highly likely that some sort of oligomerisation event occurs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>), preceding from a dimer state, which makes signal propagation more efficient, although exactly how this happens is not clearly understood. To understand luminal domain oligomerisation and how BiP affects this process, if at all; we analyzed the effects of cross linking upon Ire1 luminal domain protein in the absence and presence of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged BiP ATPase domain protein. The BiP ATPase domain interacts directly with Ire1 luminal domain, but perhaps more importantly\u2014for clarity of results\u2014it exists as a monomer both in absence and presence of cross linker. Thus, making the identification of the Ire1-BiP multimer bands an easier task. Upon addition of cross linker, Ire1 luminal domain forms two distinct species: a dimer and tetramer state. When we added BiP ATPase in a 1:1 ratio with Ire1 luminal domain protein, and then subjected the mixture to cross linking, we see a reduction in size of the tetramer band; concomitantly, there appears a band that corresponds to a trimer in size (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Immunoblotting against His<sub>6</sub> peptide reveals that the dimer band in the 1:1 mixture sample contains BiP ATPase; similarly, the trimer band also contains BiP ATPase. The tetramer band is exclusively made up of Ire1 luminal domain protein, and consequently does not show up when immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The data suggest that Ire1 luminal domain dimer and tetramer formation is being impeded by BiP, which binds in a 1:1 hetero dimer and 2:1 hetero trimer interaction, with Ire1. The caveat here is that since full-length BiP may also form dimers, we cannot rule out a 2:2 association between BiP and Ire1. Nonetheless, the data do suggest that BiP may act to impede Ire1 luminal domain dimer and tetramer formation."

An early BiP dependent model describes the central role of BiP in this process (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertolotti et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Liu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Okamura et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ma et al., 2002</a>). In this model, the interaction between luminal domains and BiP represses UPR signaling. Upon ER stress, BiP releases from the sensors, Ire1 and Perk, leading to activation. Experimental evidence for this comes from a series of studies that show an interaction between BiP and Ire1 in unstressed cells that dissociate in response to ER stress (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertolotti et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Liu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Okamura et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ma et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Oikawa et al., 2009</a>). However, there have been a number of issues with this model. It was originally thought that this interaction was regulated by nucleotide binding (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertolotti et al., 2000</a>); thereby, suggesting a chaperone substrate type interaction\u2014a non-productive association for UPR signaling\u2014thus complicating analysis. But perhaps more significantly, the model failed to delineate a precise mechanism of BiP release upon accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to the idea that BiP is competitively titred from luminal domains (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>): a notion that has some weakness, not least because UPR is sensitive in response to ER stress."

Previous studies conducted in cells may have been unable to separate this specific ATPase interaction from the chaperone substrate interaction that may occur due to induction of stress and expression of recombinant protein; a process that would no doubt require some BiP acting in a chaperone capacity, and only by analysis in a clean in vitro system that this becomes apparent."

Surprisingly, we see the previously implicated BiP binding region, Ire1 luminal domain region V, is completely dispensable for association to occur. A key study (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kimata et al., 2004</a>) suggested that this region, an area proximal to the ER membrane, was important for BiP binding and that region V deletion mutants were perfectly able to respond to ER stress, leading to the idea that BiP release was not the principal determinant for Ire1 activity\u2014but acts as a first step, followed by unfolded protein binding to luminal domains in a two step mechanism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kimata et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2007</a>). Structural descriptions of yeast Ire1 luminal domain supported this view (<a href=\"#bib4\">Credle et al., 2005</a>). The formation of a groove upon dimerization that resembles an MHC type fold suggested that unfolded proteins bound to luminal domains directly, bypassing BiP for UPR activation. This model has recently gained prominence (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Promlek et al., 2011</a>); a study showed direct binding of unfolded peptide mimics to yeast Ire1 luminal domain in vitro (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>). The binding of these peptides was observed to cause oligomerisation of luminal domains, with the implication that this leads to UPR activation. In our study, we initially used such peptides to mimic ER stress, observing binding directly to luminal domains, but curiously not to BiP. Moreover, the peptide mimic in our system had no impact upon the noncanonical interaction between BiP ATPase and luminal domains. We noted that certain peptide mimics required addition of a number of charged residues to make it soluble and were derived from non-ER signal peptides. Our attention turned to using C<sub>H</sub>1 substrate, a previously characterized authentic ER unfolded protein (<a href=\"#bib5\">Feige et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Marcinowski et al., 2011</a>). Using this substrate, we measure robust binding to both full-length BiP and to the substrate binding domain, but not to the ATPase domain of BiP. Furthermore, we do not observe an interaction between C<sub>H</sub>1 and luminal domains in vitro. Therefore, the suggestion is that unfolded proteins bind exclusively to BiP's substrate binding domain, a notion that is well accepted for Hsp70 chaperones and for ER isoform BiP (<a href=\"#bib13\">Marcinowski et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2013</a>). Indeed the recent crystal structure of isolated Hsp70 substrate binding domain with unfolded peptide mimics (<a href=\"#bib23\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>) indicates that the substrate binding domain alone is also capable to bind unfolded peptide substrates."

In this model BiP sequesters inactive Ire1. Upon high levels of ER stress, unfolded proteins bind to Ire1 causing the formation of a higher order active complex, which then recruits inactive monomers from BiP in a competitive fashion. Experimental evidence for this comes from differences in activation between wild-type Ire1 and mutant version of Ire1 (Ire1 \u0394V a.k.a Ire1<sub>bipless</sub>) that is unable to bind BiP. The mutant Ire1 was unable to offer any buffering capacity since it was thought to be lacking the BiP binding region, and hence sensitized Ire1 to low unfolded protein load (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>). The idea that Ire1, BiP, and unfolded proteins exist in some dynamic equilibrium is certainty plausible\u2014however, our data suggest that region V is dispensable for BiP binding to occur. Surprisingly, we do not observe C<sub>H</sub>1 unfolded protein directly interacting with luminal domains in any of our assays, thus providing evidence against direct association of unfolded protein\u2014a role that is usually reserved for molecular chaperones. Interestingly, one noticeable feature of least some of the previous UPR models mentioned is that they involve a level of competition between components (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>); our present model suggests an allosteric mechanism at the heart of UPR induction."

After 1 hr incubation in RT and another three washes, blots were visualized by Millipore Luminata Crescendo Western HRP substrate and developed on Amersham Hyperfilm ECL."

All experiments were performed at 25\u00b0C. The sample cell contained BiP, Ire1 or Perk at approximately 40 \u03bcM concentrations and the syringe contained \u2206EspP at approximately 450 \u03bcM concentrations. Heat of dilution, as determined by titrating \u2206EspP into the buffer alone, was subtracted from the raw titration data before analysis. Data were fit by least-squares procedure assuming a one-site binding model using Microcal Origin (version 7.0). K<sub>d</sub> values were averaged over three measurements, standard error values are indicated."

ER stress dissociates BiP from both sensors, triggering dimer/oligomer formation and activation of the cytosolic effector domains of the sensors by trans-autophosphorylation. Dissociation of BiP is thus required to activate IRE1 and/or Perk. In yeast, which have an evolutionarily conserved Ire1, subregion V, juxtaposed to transmembrane domain of Ire1, has been identified as a BiP-binding region (Ref. 13; PLoS Biol. 8, e1000415, 2010), and the BiP binding region of mammalian Perk has also been identified as the membrane proximal, luminal segment (JBC, 277, 18728, 2002). Two groups have reported that the luminal core domain of yeast Ire1 interacts directly with unfolded or misfolded protein in vivo and in vitro (Ref. 14; MBC, 22, 3520, 2011; PNAS, 102, 18773, 2005; Science, 333, 1891, 2011)."

The ATPase domain of BiP, not the substrate domain, is the site of interaction, which is nonetheless independent of nucleotide. Addition of an unfolded protein -- the C<sub>H</sub>1 region of an immunoglobulin -- to full-length BiP eliminates the observed association with the luminal domain of either Ire1 or Perk. Unfolded C<sub>H</sub>1 does not bind the luminal domains themselves, leading to the conclusion that the conformational change in BiP engendered by peptide binding must in some way alter access to the site(s) of luminal-domain binding. The authors have used microscale thermophoresis to determine luminal-domain binding and confirmed the results by pull-down, which has then been used to study the effect of C<sub>H</sub>1 binding. The conclusion, assuming it were to hold up in cells, would be biologically satisfying, with the implication that BiP inhibits Perk and Ire1 signaling unless bound with an unfolded protein. BiP would then be the primary unfolded protein detector, consistent with its known activities, and Perk and Ire1 would be downstream signal transducers."

In yeast Ire1, BiP binding region has been assigned to a subregion V, a region neighboring transmembrane domain of Ire1 by Kimata et al. (2004, J Cell Biol, 167, 445-456; Promlek, 2011, Mol Biol Cell 22, 3520-3532) and another group provided supporting evidence (Ref. 20). Subregion V of mammalian Ire1 has been also reported as a BiP binding region, but this region is longer than the corresponding region in yeast Ire1 (Oikawa et al., ECR, 2009). The deletion of subregion V greatly decreases the basal level of BiP binding, and the deletion of both subregion 1 and 5 increases basal activation level of yeast Ire1 (Kimata et al., 2004, J Cell Biol, 167, 445-456; Ishiwata et al., Genes Cells, 2013). In mammalian Ire1, the deletion of subregion V decreased the amount of Ire1 but increased the basal Ire1 activity (Oikawa et al., ECR, 2009). Subregion V of Perk is also reported as a BiP binding region (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ma et al., 2002</a>, J Biol Chem 277, 18728-18735). These data clearly show that the deletion of subregion V of Ire1 and Perk decreases BiP binding and increases Ire1 basal activity, which is tightly regulated. Furthermore Dr. Walter's group reported that the groove constructed by a dimer of the Ire1 core region directly binds unfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Credle et al., 2005</a>, PNAS, 102, 18773-18784), an idea supported by other reports (Kimata et al., The Journal of Cell Biology, 179, 75-86; Gardner et al., 2011, Science 333, 1891-1894; Promlek, 2011, Mol Biol Cell 22, 3520-3532)."

Because BiP is an ER chaperone that binds many proteins, it is not surprising that BiP interacted with Ire1\u0394V in their experiments. They need to coexpress full length Ire1 and Ire1\u0394V (separately, of course) with full length BiP in the absence or presence of ER stress.

One way to ask this question is to show that BiP mutants deficient in substrate binding retain Ire1/Perk inhibition and hence attenuate Ire1 and Perk activation, even in the presence of unfolded protein (ER stress).

In line with our predictions, the BiP deletion mutant, lacking the substrate binding domain, displays attenuated UPR signaling in comparison to full length BiP.

The difficulty in this experiment is obtaining a result that is clear to interpret, and key to this experiment working was using the ATPase domain of BiP. The ATPase domain interacts with Ire1 exclusively, without the requirement of substrate binding domain. But more importantly, it remained a monomer in presence and absence of cross linker. Thus, making analysis of multimer bands an easier task. The cross link clearly identifies Ire1 as a dimer and tetramer species. Upon addition of BiP, and subsequent immunoblotting, reveals that BiP binds to Ire1 in two possible ratios. The key conclusion here is that the presence of BiP impedes the formation of tetramers by binding to Ire1 monomers and dimers. See section \u201cBiP impedes Ire1 luminal domain tetramer formation\u201d and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."
