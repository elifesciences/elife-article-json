Here, we describe two independent genetic screens for <i>rsc</i> suppressors that yielded mutations in the promoter-focused ISW1a complex, or mutations in the 'basic patch' of histone H4 (an epitope that regulates ISWI activity), strongly supporting RSC-ISW1a antagonism in vivo. RSC and ISW1a largely co-localize, and genomic nucleosome studies using <i>rsc isw1</i> mutant combinations revealed opposing functions: promoters classified with a nucleosome-deficient region (NDR) gain nucleosome occupancy in <i>rsc</i> mutants, but this gain is attenuated in <i>rsc isw1</i> double mutants. Furthermore, promoters lacking NDRs have the highest occupancy of both remodelers, consistent with regulation by nucleosome occupancy, and decreased transcription in <i>rsc</i> mutants. Taken together, we provide the first genetic and genomic evidence for RSC-ISW1a antagonism, and reveal different mechanisms at two different promoter architectures."
