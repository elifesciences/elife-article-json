Yet, elucidating the cellular behaviors that underlie modifications to adult form remains a profound challenge. We use neural crest-derived adult pigmentation of zebrafish and pearl danio to uncover cellular bases for alternative pattern states. We show that stripes in zebrafish require a novel class of thin, fast cellular projection to promote Delta-Notch signaling over long distances from cells of the xanthophore lineage to melanophores. Projections depended on microfilaments and microtubules, exhibited meandering trajectories, and stabilized on target cells to which they delivered membraneous vesicles. By contrast, the uniformly patterned pearl danio lacked such projections, concomitant with Colony stimulating factor 1-dependent changes in xanthophore differentiation that likely curtail signaling available to melanophores. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of cellular communication, roles for differentiation state heterogeneity in pigment cell interactions, and an unanticipated morphogenetic behavior contributing to a striking difference in adult form."

Yet, elucidating the cellular behaviors that underlie modifications to adult form remains a profound challenge. We use neural crest-derived adult pigmentation of zebrafish and pearl danio to uncover cellular bases for alternative pattern states. We show that stripes in zebrafish require a novel class of thin, fast cellular projection to promote Delta-Notch signaling over long distances from cells of the xanthophore lineage to melanophores. Projections depended on microfilaments and microtubules, exhibited meandering trajectories, and stabilized on target cells to which they delivered membraneous vesicles. By contrast, the uniformly patterned pearl danio lacked such projections, concomitant with Colony stimulating factor 1-dependent changes in xanthophore differentiation that likely curtail signaling available to melanophores. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of cellular communication, roles for differentiation state heterogeneity in pigment cell interactions, and an unanticipated morphogenetic behavior contributing to a striking difference in adult form."

We further show that production and targeting of airinemes are differentiation-state dependent. Finally, using interspecific cell transplantation and transgenic manipulations we demonstrate that evolution of the very different, uniform pattern of pearl danio has entailed the loss of long-distance airineme signaling, concomitant with modifications to xanthophore differentiation.

Projections reached as far as 5\u20136 cell diameters and extended and retracted quickly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Incidences of projection formation were not markedly altered in mutants lacking melanophores or iridophores, or in transgenic fish having supernumerary melanophores (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

A good candidate for mediating such interactions is Delta-Notch signaling. In amniotes, Notch promotes melanocyte migration and survival and also regulates differentiation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Moriyama et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schouwey et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aubin-Houzelstein et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kumano et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Pinnix et al., 2009</a>). In zebrafish as well as pearl danio, xanthophores express Delta genes whereas melanophores express Notch genes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamada et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistent with a role for Notch in promoting melanophore migration, we found that expressing the constitutively active Notch1a intracellular domain in melanophores, using a promoter derived from the <i>microphthalmia a (mitfa</i>) gene (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lister et al., 1999</a>), resulted in stripes that were significantly broader than in wild\u00a0type (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Conversely, <i>delta c (dlc</i>) mutants exhibited melanophores ectopically in the interstripe, similar to the <i>aox5</i>:Tet:dnCdc42 phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

(<b>C</b>) Working models for pigment cell interactions and pattern formation in zebrafish (left) and pearl danio (right). In zebrafish, xanthoblasts in stripe regions extend airinemes that signal to melanophores (Xb\u2192M), promoting their clearance from the interstripe during stripe consolidation. Results of this study are consistent with interactions involving xanthoblast airineme dependent Delta (Dlc or possibly Dll4) activation of Notch signaling in melanophores, and the potentiation of Kita-dependent melanophore motility. Nevertheless, these data do not exclude roles for additional modes of Delta\u2013Notch signaling, or the possibilities that airinemes transduce additional signals, or signals that cannot be distinguished from the Delta\u2013Notch pathway using the experimental paradigms here employed. Analyses of mutant zebrafish further support roles for Cx41.8 in contributing to airineme-dependent communication, through modulation of target specificity or xanthophore lineage differentiation. In addition to xanthoblast\u2013melanophore interactions, iridophores have attractive and repulsive effects on melanophores (I\u2192M; I\u22a3M) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Frohnhofer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</a>) and express Csf1, promoting the differentiation of xanthophores (Xb\u2192X) at the interstripe (<a href=\"#bib65\">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</a>). Differentiated xanthophores repel melanophores (X\u22a3M) during normal development (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nakamasu et al., 2009</a>) and are capable of repressing iridophore organization (X\u22a3I) [for details, see: (<a href=\"#bib64\">Patterson et al., 2014</a>)]. In pearl danio, Csf1 is expressed at elevated levels by cells other than iridophores and this drives earlier and broader xanthophore differentiation than in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib64\">Patterson et al., 2014</a>). Precocious, widespread differentiation of xanthophores likely limits directional cues available to melanophores while simultaneously curtailing the potential for airineme signaling, as airineme competent xanthoblasts are depleted. Tissue contexts (lower panels) also show eventual death of some melanophores remaining in the interstripe in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib57\">Parichy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Parichy and Turner, 2003b</a>) and the higher overall incidence of melanophore death in pearl danio (<a href=\"#bib68\">Quigley et al., 2005</a>); iridophores are omitted for clarity.

Genetic analyses have shown that interactions between melanophore and xanthophore lineages are important for stripe formation and maintenance in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib57\">Parichy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Maderspacher and Nusslein-Volhard, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Parichy and Turner, 2003a</a>), whereas laser ablation and in vitro studies suggest that such interactions can occur over both short- and long-range (<a href=\"#bib86\">Takahashi and Kondo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nakamasu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yamanaka and Kondo, 2014</a>). By examining the behaviors of differentiated and undifferentiated cells in their native tissue environment using membrane-targeted fluorophores and high resolution time-lapse imaging, we identified novel interactions, as well as unanticipated differentiation-state dependencies to these interactions. Our data suggest a model in which xanthoblasts sparsely populating prospective stripe regions, but not xanthophores of the interstripe, extend Delta+ airinemes that contact melanophores, promoting Notch signaling and melanophore consolidation into stripes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>-left). Airineme-delivered signals could provide directional information, or could simply promote motility, with directionality provided some other way. Indeed, differentiated xanthophores repel melanophores (<a href=\"#bib86\">Takahashi and Kondo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yamanaka and Kondo, 2014</a>), and these effects seem likely to synergize with airineme-mediated interactions to promote stripe consolidation. Additional approaches to testing this model (independent of dnCdc42 activities) should become feasible as mechanisms of airineme production and targeting are elucidated. The adult pattern defects we observed also illustrate how failures in even the subtle initial movements of adult melanophores during interstripe clearance and stripe consolidation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Parichy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Parichy and Turner, 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Takahashi and Kondo, 2008</a>) are amplified by the considerable somatic growth that occurs during pigment pattern formation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parichy et al., 2009</a>)."

Although such models classically envisaged diffusible substances, the same outcomes could, in principle, be achieved in many ways (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamada et al., 2014</a>). Our findings are likely consistent with the current formulation of a Turing model as applied to zebrafish pigment pattern. Nevertheless, our discovery that airineme production and targeting depend on precise states of differentiation reveals a previously unappreciated complexity to these signaling dynamics. Moreover, the nature of interactions seems likely to differ across stages: in adult fish, melanophore processes reach towards interstripe xanthophores, and may allow for long-range Delta\u2013Notch trophic support (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamada et al., 2014</a>); yet, we did not observe long, stable melanophore processes during pattern development (e.g., <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>).

In contrast to actin-based projections (e.g., cytonemes), airinemes required both microfilaments and microtubules, and delivered large, membrane-bound vesicles that persisted on target cells up to several cell diameters away. By analogy with neuronal dendrites, it seems plausible that airinemes participate not only in \u2018forward\u2019 signaling, shown here, but also \u2018reverse\u2019 signaling that could allow cells to sense their environment and regulate differentiation or morphogenesis accordingly (though we could not detect differences in xanthophore differentiation after increasing melanophore abundance or blocking airineme production; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>).

These findings do not exclude roles for additional factors; e.g., melanophore-autonomous differences, or changes in iridophore patterning that may or may not themselves be xanthophore-dependent.

They provide dynamic live imaging of pigment cells in developing zebrafish, leading to the discovery that (mostly) xanthophores exhibit an unusual type of cytoplasmic projection that appears to be involved in stripe consolidation. The authors characterize these projections, which they term airinemes, with regard to their development and composition. Transgenic experiments provide evidence that airinemes are an essential component of a xanthoblast to melanophore signal that promotes melanophore movement and stripe consolidation possibly via a \u03b4-Notch signal. There are also associated changes in melanophore Kit expression. They also show that the pearl danio, which lacks melanophore stripes, also lacks airinemes."

The Notch reporter experiment is interesting but it would be helpful to have some more context. Is the reporter expressed in any other pigment cells? Does the melanophore signal described by the authors stand out relative to other evidence of Notch signaling during pigment cell migration and stripe consolidation. Finally, while the result of the double mutant (dnCdc42; dnSu(H); low levels of dd) is interesting, it doesn't quite reach the level of rigor one would hope for in an epistasis analysis. A stronger experiment would be to show that increased Notch signaling in melanophores could rescue the phenotype of a xanthophore dnCdc42 transgene. Showing that constitutive notch (mitfa&gt;NICD) suppresses aox5&gt;dnCDC42 phenotype of interstripe melanocyte would be more direct (and more rigorous) than the experiments showing synergistic genetic interaction between notch pathway (dnSuH) in mels and CDC42 promoted airinemes in xans. Together, these two experiments would make the point of airinemes acting through Notch rather compelling. This seems like a fairly simple experiment with the available fish stocks already used in study."

The results shown \u2013 stronger phenotype of genetic interactions (dnSuH, dnCDC42) in kit(-/+) than in kit(+/+), together with the evidence that Notch signalling controls kit expression is sufficient to tell us there is a role. The key question is to look for how kit is responsive to Notch signalling. As it stands in the paper kita is a candidate gene/pathway, the level of reduction is not very substantial, and it's not clear exactly how melanophores were purified/enriched (the Methods describes both Percoll purification and micromanipulation) or the degree of enrichment. If RNA-seq information is available on purified melanophores with and without airineme contact, that would add a lot.

We do believe that our several analyses, including a significant reduction in Notch signaling reporter activity in melanophores that results from airineme inhibition, as well as the phenotypes of the <i>dlc</i> mutant and several transgenic lines singly and in combination with one another, together support the notion that Delta-Notch signaling is important for stripe patterning and that airinemes very likely contribute to the transduction of such signals. Nevertheless, our original presentation was not intended to imply that airinemes are the only mechanism by which Delta\u2013Notch signaling occurs between melanophore and xanthophore lineages (e.g., our own prior analyses in collaboration with Shigeru Kondo\u2019s group in Hamada et al. 2014) or that airinemes exclusively transduce such a signal. The working model we presented and its original description were merely intended to represent our best current understanding of the system according to the evidence currently available. To minimize any potential for misunderstanding, we have made these points more explicit in the discussion and legend of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> (corresponding to original Figure 8)."

Nevertheless we did not intend to imply that Dlc becomes specifically concentrated at blebs or in airineme vesicles, merely that such structures could harbor the protein if it happens to already be at the cell surface, and our observations support this view. Indeed, we expect there are many ways in which melanophores could \u201cobtain\u201d a Delta signal from the xanthophore lineage, including the extension of processes from melanophores to xanthophore cell bodies as appears to happen at later stages (Hamada et al. 2014). Although we are interested in whether specific proteins are actively localized at sites of airineme emergence, and we are engaged in work to address this point, we feel this issue is beyond the scope of the present study as our interpretations do not require such a mechanism."
