We previously reported that miR-142 and miR-150 are upregulated in human breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) as compared to the non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that miR-142 efficiently recruits the <i>APC</i> mRNA to an RNA-induced silencing complex, activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in an APC-suppression dependent manner, and activates the expression of miR-150. Enforced expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in normal mouse mammary stem cells resulted in the regeneration of hyperproliferative mammary glands in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous miR-142 effectively suppressed organoid formation by BCSCs and slowed tumor growth initiated by human BCSCs in vivo. These results suggest that in some tumors, miR-142 regulates the properties of BCSCs at least in part by activating the WNT signaling pathway and miR-150 expression."

We previously reported that miR-142 and miR-150 are upregulated in human breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) as compared to the non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that miR-142 efficiently recruits the <i>APC</i> mRNA to an RNA-induced silencing complex, activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in an APC-suppression dependent manner, and activates the expression of miR-150. Enforced expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in normal mouse mammary stem cells resulted in the regeneration of hyperproliferative mammary glands in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous miR-142 effectively suppressed organoid formation by BCSCs and slowed tumor growth initiated by human BCSCs in vivo. These results suggest that in some tumors, miR-142 regulates the properties of BCSCs at least in part by activating the WNT signaling pathway and miR-150 expression."

One of them, miR-142, is known to target a gene called <i>APC</i> that inhibits the renewal of normal stem cells. Mutations in the <i>APC</i> gene have been linked to colon cancer, and scientists have suggested that the mutations inactivate APC in cancer cells to promote unregulated cell growth. Breast tumors rarely have mutations in the <i>APC</i> gene, but Isobe et al. wondered whether microRNAs that target this gene might also promote the growth of these tumor cells."

The immunopurification (IP) of Argonaute (Ago), a central component of the RISC in the human and mouse, followed by microarray analyses (Ago IP/microarray method) makes it possible to isolate any Ago-associated miRNAs and mRNAs without relying on the mechanism of regulation (i.e. mRNA decay or translational suppression), or sequence conservation, enabling a comprehensive identification of the miRNA-target genes in an unbiased manner.

We previously identified a human breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) population (a CD44<sup>+</sup> CD24<sup>\u2212/low</sup> lineage<sup>\u2212</sup> population of human breast cancer cells) that in many human breast tumors is enriched for the ability to drive tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model as compared to the remaining non-tumorigenic cancer cells (NTG cells) within the same breast tumor (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</a>). Comprehensive analyses of the expression profile of 466 miRNAs revealed that 37 miRNAs are differentially expressed between the human BCSCs and NTG cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shimono et al., 2009</a>). Among them, both miR-200c and miR-183 are downregulated in the human BCSCs and suppress the protein expression of the stem cell self-renewal gene, BMI1, and miR-200c suppresses the protein expression of the EMT regulator ZEB1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shimono et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wellner et al., 2009</a>). Enforced expression of miR-200c can strongly suppress the tumor formation driven by human BCSCs and the mammary ducts formation by normal mammary stem cells in vivo, suggesting that miR-200c is a regulator of normal mammary and BCSCs. On the other hand, the expression of miRNAs, such as miR-142, miR-150, and miR-155, are upregulated in human BCSCs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shimono et al., 2009</a>). Among them, miR-155 was originally identified as a product of the oncogenic BIC gene locus in B cell lymphoma (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eis et al., 2005</a>). Abnormal proliferation and myelodysplasia are seen when miR-155 expression is sustained in the blood system (<a href=\"#bib37\">O'Connell et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, miR-155 functions as an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers, including leukemia and breast cancers (<a href=\"#bib14\">Czyzyk-Krzeska and Zhang, 2013</a>). Dysregulation of miR-142 and miR-150 are reported in leukemia, gastric and lung cancers, but their roles in breast cancer or BCSCs are not elucidated. miR-142 is involved in hematopoiesis, immune responses, and T cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Lodish, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ramkissoon et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Visone et al., 2009</a>) and is upregulated in bronchoalveolar stem cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Qian et al., 2008</a>), suggesting it might have a role in the regulation of tissue stem cells. miR-142 is upregulated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lv et al., 2012</a>) but is downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). miR-150 is upregulated in adult T-cell leukemia cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bellon et al., 2009</a>), gastric cancers (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wu et al., 2010</a>), and lung cancers (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>)."

The fact that some cancer cells share the extended self-renewal ability with normal stem cells, and that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is implicated in both stem cell self-renewal and cancer suggests that normal physiological regulators of stem cell functions might be \u2018hijacked\u2019 in cancer (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reya and Clevers, 2005</a>). A variety of putative transcriptional targets of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, such as c-Myc and cyclin D1, are identified (<a href=\"#bib20a\">He et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46a\">Shtutman et al., 1999</a>). Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a component of the destruction complex that destabilizes \u03b2-catenin and suppresses the activity of the canonical WNT signaling pathway. In human colon cancers, mutations in the <i>APC</i> gene are the most commonly known acquired genetic change for the aberrant activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway during the tumor development and progression (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kinzler et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nishisho et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cottrell et al., 1992</a>). In a model for the stepwise progression of the colon tumorigenesis, <i>APC</i> gene mutations play an important role in the initiation step followed by successive mutations in other genes, including K-Ras and p53 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990</a>). During clonal progression, dysregulation of downstream \u03b2-catenin targets, such as c-Myc, can relieve colon cancer cells of their dependence on \u03b2-catenin signaling (<a href=\"#bib53\">van de Wetering et al., 2002</a>). The expression of APC is not limited to the intestine but is widely observed in many other tissues, including lung, liver, kidney, and mammary tissue. However, the role of the suppression of APC and the activation of the canonical WNT signaling in the tumor initiation process of the tissues other than the colon largely remains unknown, because <i>APC</i> mutations are less frequent in tumors originating from these tissues. For example, recent data from the TCGA reveals an \u223c2% incidence of <i>APC</i> mutations in breast cancer (the TCGA Research Network: <a href=\"http://cancergenome.nih.gov/\">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</a>)."

The <i>APC</i> mutations in breast cancers are typically found at sites distinct from the <i>APC</i> mutation cluster region in colorectal cancers and are much more frequently seen in advanced than early stage breast cancers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Furuuchi et al., 2000</a>). On the other hand, APC is targeted by the miRNAs, such as miR-27, miR-155, and miR-142 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wang and Xu, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). These observations suggest that in addition to LOH, promoter methylation, and the <i>APC</i> mutations, miRNAs that target APC may regulate the aberrant activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway for the initiation of human breast cancers, the enhancement of niche independence, and the aberrant proliferation of the human BCSCs."

Upregulation of miR-142 enhanced the canonical WNT signaling pathway and transactivated the expression of miR-150. Both microRNAs had the ability to induce hyperproliferation in mammary tissue.

To explore the possible target mRNAs of miR-142 and miR-150 which were more highly expressed in human BCSCs than in the NTG cells, we performed Ago IP/microarray to comprehensively identify mRNAs that were recruited to Ago by miR-142 and miR-150. Lysates from human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293T cells transfected with or without the precursor for miR-142 or miR-150 were immunopurified using an anti-Ago antibody. Amplified RNAs from the Ago-immunopurified samples were labeled and hybridized to the Human Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide (HEEBO) microarrays (<a href=\"#bib27\">Klapholz-Brown et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hendrickson et al., 2008</a>). We identified dozens of potential targets of miR-142 and miR-150 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1A\u2014source data 1\u20134</a>). The types of miRNA seed match (i.e. the association of target mRNA with the region centered on the nucleotides 2\u20137 of the 5\u2032 region of miRNAs) correlate with the efficiency of mRNA targeting by miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartel, 2009</a>). The efficiency of the miR142-dependent and miR-150-dependent recruitment of specific mRNAs to the RISC complex correlated well with the types of miRNA seed matches: mRNAs with the 8mer match were most efficiently enriched, followed by those with the 7mer-m8, 7mer-1A, and 6mer sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although both miR-142 and miR-150 were predicted to target the <i>APC</i> mRNA by a computer algorithm, the results of the Ago IP/microarray experiments showed that the <i>APC</i> mRNA was efficiently recruited to RISC by miR-142, and that it was hardly recruited to RISC by miR-150 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1A\u2014source data 1\u20134</a>). Among the genes associated with the activity of the WNT signaling pathway, we found that the <i>APC</i> mRNA was strongly recruited to Ago by miR-142 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In the parallel experiments, amplified RNAs from the whole cell lysate from HEK293T cells transfected with or without the miR-142 precursor were labeled and hybridized to the HEEBO microarrays. The results showed that the abundance of the <i>APC</i> mRNA was consistently reduced in the miR-142-transfected HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

To test this possibility, we evaluated the effects of miR-142 on the \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcription of the luciferase gene using cells transfected with a TOPFlash luciferase plasmid, which contained the \u03b2-catenin/TCF binding sites in the promoter region of a luciferase gene. As a control, cells were transfected with an otherwise identical FOPFlash plasmid, in which the \u03b2-catenin/TCF binding sites were mutated. The ratio of the measured luciferase activity of the TOPFlash plasmid to that of the FOPFlash plasmid provides a measure of the activity of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">van de Wetering et al., 1997</a>). HEK293T cells were transfected with the miR-142 precursor and incubated with 20 mM lithium chloride (LiCl) for 6 hr to stimulate the canonical WNT signaling pathway (by inhibiting the activity of the glycogen synthase kinase 3) (<a href=\"#bib54\">van Noort et al., 2002</a>). We found that the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash ratio of the luciferase activities increased by 364% in the miR-142 transfected HEK293T cells compared to that in the control precursor transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In accordance with this result, the elevation of the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash value in the miR-142 transfected cells was observed by the stimulation with Wnt3A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To further confirm that miR-142 activated the canonical WNT signaling pathway by targeting APC, we co-transfected the APC expression plasmid, pCMV-Neo-APC, that contains the complete coding sequence and the partial 3\u2032 UTR sequence of the <i>APC</i> mRNA, along with the TOPFlash or FOPFlash vectors and the miRNA precursors. The miR-142-3p target site within the pCMV-Neo-APC plasmid sequence was mutated to produce the pCMV-APC mutant plasmid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The co-transfection of the control plasmid, pCMV-Neo-Control, or the pCMV-Neo-APC plasmid that contains miR-142-3p targeted sequence within the 3\u2032 UTR region, did not affect the ability of miR-142 to elevate the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash value. On the contrary, co-transfection of pCMV-Neo-APC mutant plasmid significantly suppressed the normalized TOPFlash/FOPFlash value to an intensity comparable to that of the control miRNA precursor transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results suggest that the activation of canonical WNT signaling pathway by miR-142 is mostly mediated by the ability of miR-142 to reduce the protein level of APC."

In this system, the tissue derived stem cells were embedded in Matrigel and cultured in the media that contained a cocktail of the growth factors, including ones that stimulate the WNT signaling pathways. We and others have previously shown that the MLTV-Wnt-1 tumor contains a CSC population (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shackleton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cho et al., 2008</a>). Because miR-142 is upregulated in the BCSCs and stimulates the canonical WNT signaling pathway that is an important regulator of the stem cell properties in mammary tissues, we tested the ability of miR-142 to regulate the organoid formation of BCSCs. The sorted murine mammary CSCs of the MLTV-Wnt-1 tumor were infected with the control lentivirus or the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus that suppressed the expression of miR-142-3p and expressed GFP. The GFP-positive cells infected with the control lentivirus formed round-shaped organoids in 7 days (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, most of the cells infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentiviruses failed to form the round-shaped organoids (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The number of the GFP positive organoids was significantly decreased when the mammary CSCs were infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentivirus (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results suggest that miR-142-3p is an important regulator of the organoid formation ability in murine mammary CSCs."

Because the promoter region of miR-150 contains a potential \u03b2-catenin/TCF transcription factor binding site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), we investigated whether miR-150 expression is regulated by the canonical WNT signaling pathway. HEK293T cells were stimulated with 20 mM LiCl for 7 hr, then crosslinked with formaldehyde, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed either with an antibody against \u03b2-catenin or, as a control, with mouse IgG. The anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody selectively enriched DNA fragments containing the potential \u03b2-catenin/TCF binding site within the promoter of the miR-150 precursor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Then, using semi-quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the expression of miR-142 was able to upregulate the expression of miR-150 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Moreover, inhibition of the canonical WNT signaling pathway using the siRNA against \u03b2-catenin reduced the expression of miR-150 in the miR-142-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We further confirmed that the inhibition of miR-142 in human breast cancer organoids formed by human BCSCs infected with the anti-miR-142-3p-expressing lentiviruses decreased the expression of miR-150 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

Expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in the lentivirus infected cells was confirmed by real-time PCR (data not shown). We infected 5 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> lineage<sup>\u2212</sup> murine mammary epithelial cells with the miR-142 or miR-150-expressing lentivirus and transplanted them into the cleared mammary fat pads of syngeneic mice. Non-infected and control lentivirus infected mammary cells were used as controls. Whole mount mammary tissue analyses and histological analyses were performed 8 weeks after transplantation. Transduction of the lentivirus into the mammary transplants was confirmed by the expression of ZsGreen. Overall, 7 out of 12 transplants with non-infected mammary cells and 7 out of 12 transplants with mammary cells infected with control lentivirus formed a mammary tree, suggesting that lentivirus infection was highly efficient and, by itself, did not perturb engraftment of mammary cells. Whole-mount staining and histological analysis of mammary fat pads injected with the control lentivirus-infected mammary cells showed the outgrowth of a normal-looking mammary tree structure consisting of single layers of myoepithelial and luminal cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). In contrast, mammary cells infected with the miR-142 lentivirus formed disorganized structures with multiple layers of cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Histological analysis revealed that miR-142-expressing mammary cells formed clusters of cells with an abnormal appearance in which the normal mammary structure was disrupted because of the aberrant cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Mammary cells infected with the miR-150-expressing lentivirus formed a hyperplastic mammary tree with extremely increased branching and thick mammary ducts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). Histological analysis of the mammary trees showed that miR-150-expressing mammary cells formed thick hyperplastic ducts with multiple layers of mammary cells, with scattered small cavities among mammary cell layers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). But unlike miR-142-expressing mammary cells, miR-150-expressing mammary cells had a normal cellular appearance. To confirm that both the dysplastic mammary tissue formed by the miR-142-expressing mammary cells and the hyperplastic mammary tissue formed by the miR-150-expressing mammary cells were both hyperproliferative, we immunostained these tissues with an anti-PCNA antibody. We found that the epithelial cells in the miR-142-expressing and miR-150-expressing mammary tissues were positively stained with an anti-PCNA antibody (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In contrast, the mammary tissue regenerated by the control lentivirus transfected mammary cells was rarely stained with an anti-PCNA antibody. The results indicate that the enforced expression of either miR-142 or miR-150 induces hyperproliferation in the mammary tissues and that the phenotype of the miR-142-expressing mammary tissue is more severe and accompanied with abnormal morphology."

Elevated expression of miR-135, which targets the <i>APC</i> mRNA, has been observed in colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas with/without biallelic <i>APC</i> mutations, suggesting that this miRNA could play a primary or synergistic role in activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway during colon cancer development (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nagel et al., 2008</a>). In a model of osteoblast differentiation, miR-27 and miR-142 were shown to regulate APC expression and to positively modulate the canonical WNT signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wang and Xu, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). miR-155 targets APC and inhibition of miR-155 using the anti-miR-155 increases the protein level of APC (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu et al., 2009</a>). It is noteworthy that both miR-142-3p and miR-155 are more highly expressed in the human BCSCs than in the NTG cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shimono et al., 2009</a>). In this study, we show that miR-142 reduced the protein level of APC and enhanced the canonical WNT signaling pathway in normal and malignant mammary epithelium. This is important for the stem cells in the mammary gland (<a href=\"#bib20\">Haegebarth and Clevers, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zeng and Nusse, 2010</a>). The dysregulated WNT signaling can enhance niche independence and promote aberrant proliferation of stem cells. Taken together, upregulation of miR-142, miR-150, and miR-155 may not only be hallmarks of BCSCs but could actually contribute directly to aberrant proliferation of these cells. In this report, we show that miR-150 is a target of miR-142 via its regulation of the canonical WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Notably, miR-150 plays a role in the proliferation induced by miR-142 and the canonical WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Our results suggest that miR-150's regulation of proliferation is downstream of the canonical WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling. In addition, the <i>APC</i> mRNA has a predicted target site for miR-150. We constructed the pGL3 luciferase expression plasmid in which the miR-150 target site within the 3\u2032 UTR of the <i>APC</i> mRNA was cloned downstream of a luciferase minigene and found that the activity of this luciferase plasmid was reduced by 32% when the miR-150 precursor was co-transfected (data not shown). However, the results of the Ago IP/microarray experiments revealed that <i>APC</i> mRNA was much less efficiently recruited to RISC by miR-150 (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1A\u2014source data 3\u20134</a>). Because each miRNA has multiple target genes, we speculate that the presence of many other target genes with higher affinity to the miR-150-containing RISC will perturb the ability of miR-150 to regulate the <i>APC</i> mRNA and that miR-150 has much weaker effect, if any, on the WNT signaling pathway in vivo."

For example, the transcriptional repressors, ZEB1 and ZEB2, which can play a positive role in EMT, suppress transcription of the miR-200a-miR-200b-miR-429 cluster, which in turn represses expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, thereby forming a double negative feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bracken et al., 2008</a>). c-Myc enhances expression of the miR-17-92 cluster, which in turn represses E2F1 expression and thereby suppresses cell-cycle entry (<a href=\"#bib38\">O'Donnell et al., 2005</a>). The tumor suppressor Tp53 regulates expression of miRNAs, including miR-34a, miR-107, and miR-200 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Raver-Shapira et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yamakuchi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chang et al., 2011</a>). Expression of miR-10b, a miRNA that promotes breast cancer cell metastasis by inhibiting HoxD10, is regulated by the transcription factor Twist, a major regulator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2007</a>). We identified a TCF/\u03b2-catenin binding site in the promoter region of miR-150 and showed that miR-142 stimulates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in vivo and elevates the expression of miR-150. It has recently been reported that miR-150 induces proliferation and suppresses apoptosis of breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2013</a>). A simple model to explain the upregulation of miR-142 and miR-150 in human BCSCs is that suppression of the APC protein expression by miR-142 increases the activity of the canonical WNT signaling pathway and thereby enhances the miR-150 expression. We note that our results show that miR-142 upregulates the expression of miR-150 when miR-142 is highly expressed and/or the WNT signaling pathway is strongly stimulated in mammary epithelial cells. Considering that miR-142 is highly expressed in human BCSCs but weakly expressed or undetectable in the stem/progenitor population of the mammary epithelial cells, our result suggests that the upregulation of miR-142 and the increase of the miR-150 expression by miR-142 could be especially relevant in the initiation and/or progression of human breast cancers driven by human BCSCs in vivo."

Mice heterozygous for a germline mutation in <i>Apc</i> (Apc<sup>+/850T</sup>, Apc<sup>Min</sup> mice) spontaneously develop mammary tumors, although at significantly lower frequency than intestinal tumors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moser et al., 1993</a>). Mice heterozygous for a C-terminal truncation mutation, Apc<sup>+/1572T</sup>, develop multifocal mammary tumors with pulmonary metastasis at much higher frequency (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gaspar et al., 2009</a>). MMTV-promoter-Wnt1 transgenic mice develop breast tumors composed of both luminal and myoepithelial component and expanded mammary stem cell pools (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cho et al., 2008</a>). Finally, heterozygous mutation of <i>APC</i> in immature, but not mature, mammary epithelium induces breast tumors (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kuraguchi et al., 2009</a>). These results suggest that activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway in mammary epithelium, by mutation of <i>APC</i>, excessive ectopic WNT expression, and/or stabilization of \u03b2-catenin contribute to mammary tumor initiation in the same way as colon cancer at least in mouse models of the mammary tumors. However, although these mouse models that upregulate the canonical WNT signaling activity induce mammary gland tumors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moser et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gaspar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kuraguchi et al., 2009</a>), <i>APC</i> mutations are less frequently found in human breast cancers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Furuuchi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sarrio et al., 2003</a>). APC is a key tumor suppressor that regulates the canonical WNT signaling pathway and is involved in development and homeostasis of a variety of cells including stem cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reya and Clevers, 2005</a>). In addition, APC has additional important cellular functions, including roles in cell adhesion, migration, organization of actin and microtubule networks, spindle formation, and chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki and Taketo, 2007</a>). Thus, dysregulation of these processes by mutations in the <i>APC</i> gene is frequently implicated in tumor initiation and progression. Our results show that upregulation of miR-142 can significantly enhance the canonical WNT signaling pathway through the suppression of APC including in the mammary cells. Therefore, miR-142, a miRNA frequently upregulated in human BCSCs than in the NTG cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shimono et al., 2009</a>), could provide at least a part of the shared molecular mechanism for aberrant activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway in BCSCs and for the initiation and progression of breast cancers."

SuperScript VILO (Life Technologies) and TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologiies) were used for the mRNA and miRNA measurement experiments, respectively. Then, RT products were amplified with TaqMan PreAmp master Mix (Life Technologies), when necessary. The abundance of each mRNA or miRNA was measured using a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems)."

Briefly, mammary glands from 8- to 14-week old virgin female FVB were digested with collagenase/hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies, Canada). Single cell suspension was obtained by dissociation of the fragments with 0.25% trypsin, and dispase and DNase I (StemCell Technologies). Lineage<sup>\u2212</sup> mammary epithelial cells were obtained after removing the CD45+, Ter119+, and CD31+ cells using the EasySep mouse epithelial cell enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies). The isolated cells were mixed with 5 moi of lentivirus and incubated for 16 hr at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37\u00b0C. Our flow cytometry analysis using the lentivirus-infected mammary cells revealed that \u223c50% of the mammary cells were infected 1 day after infection. Fifty-thousand lentivirus infected cells were injected into cleared mammary fat pad of weaning age FVB/NJ female mouse. After 8 weeks, ZsGreen expression of the transplanted mammary tissue was checked under the fluorescent microscope (Leica DMI 6000 B). Whole-mount mammary tissue was fixed in Carnoy's fixative (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial acetic acid) for 4 hr, and whole-mount staining was performed using carmine alum staining solution. For hematoxylin and eosin staining, the mammary tissue with ZsGreen expression was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained by hematoxylin and eosin staining method. The stained tissue was observed using a microscope (Leica DM 4000 B)."

While reviewers 2 and 3 point out that there are studies on miR-150 that have previously linked it to APC and breast cancer tumor growth, your study investigating the functional role of two up-regulated miRNAs, miR-142 and miR-150, in breast cancer development, is intriguing and would represent a significant advance if substantiated further. Indeed the novelty rests upon showing that miR-142 over-expression regulates miR-150 expression, while miR-150 over-expression enhances canonical WNT signaling, and that this is physiologically relevant to tumor progression <i>in vivo</i>. The manuscript does provide interesting insights into the roles and mechanisms of miRNAs in the mammary gland. The major concern is that despite the attractiveness of your model, the major conclusions are not yet substantiated with sufficient evidence to make a compelling case."

Because APC negatively regulates the canonical WNT signaling, the authors demonstrated, by the reporter assays, that high expression of miR-142 stimulates the WNT pathway. In cultured cells, knocking down miR-142 significantly reduced the organoid formation capacity of BCSCs. Conversely, overexpression of miR-142 causes mammary dysplasia in a transplantation assay.

On the other hand, the authors should also document the knock down efficiency by the means of Northern blotting, qPCR or reporter assays esp. for a knock-down method that is not very well documented."

The authors, at minimum, should compare the levels of overexpressed miR-142 to the elevated miR-142 observed in BCSCs. On the other hand, the authors should also document the knock down efficiency by the means of Northern blotting, qPCR or reporter assays esp. for a knock-down method that is not very well documented</i>."

It would be essential to reconcile this in vivo observation with the proposed mechanism derived from the in vitro study that both sit in the same pathway with miR-142 activating Wnt and miR-150 suppressing APC.

It is not surprising that miR-150 overexpression does not fully recapitulate the effects of miR-142 expression.

The results show that the shRNA knockdown of miR-142 prolongs the time to initial engraftment and inhibits the tumor growth of human breast cancers generated by the transplantation of human breast cancer stem cells. Thus the result is promising, but we need to repeat them to be sure that the results are correct. Because induction of the genes or shRNAs into the breast cancer stem cells are possible by using the lentivirus and the growth of the human breast cancer cells in the mouse xenograft models takes up to three months, we think that it will take three to four months to replicate this experiment."
