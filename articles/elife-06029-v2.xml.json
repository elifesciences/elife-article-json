                    "text": "Most kinesins transport cargoes bound to their C-termini and use N-terminal motor domains to move along microtubules. We report here a novel function for KIF1C: it transports Rab6A-vesicles and can influence Golgi complex organization. These activities correlate with KIF1C's capacity to bind the Golgi protein Rab6A directly, both via its motor domain and C-terminus. Rab6A binding to the motor domain inhibits microtubule interaction in vitro and in cells, decreasing the amount of motile KIF1C. KIF1C depletion slows protein delivery to the cell surface, interferes with vesicle motility, and triggers Golgi fragmentation. KIF1C can protect Golgi membranes from fragmentation in cells lacking an intact microtubule network. Rescue of fragmentation requires sequences that enable KIF1C to bind Rab6A at both ends, but not KIF1C motor function. Rab6A binding to KIF1C's motor domain represents an entirely new mode of regulation for a kinesin motor, and likely has important consequences for KIF1C's cellular functions."

We report here a novel function for KIF1C: it transports Rab6A-vesicles and can influence Golgi complex organization. These activities correlate with KIF1C's capacity to bind the Golgi protein Rab6A directly, both via its motor domain and C-terminus. Rab6A binding to the motor domain inhibits microtubule interaction in vitro and in cells, decreasing the amount of motile KIF1C. KIF1C depletion slows protein delivery to the cell surface, interferes with vesicle motility, and triggers Golgi fragmentation. KIF1C can protect Golgi membranes from fragmentation in cells lacking an intact microtubule network. Rescue of fragmentation requires sequences that enable KIF1C to bind Rab6A at both ends, but not KIF1C motor function. Rab6A binding to KIF1C's motor domain represents an entirely new mode of regulation for a kinesin motor, and likely has important consequences for KIF1C's cellular functions."

Of fundamental interest is how these motor proteins link to specific membrane cargoes and how they are regulated. Rab GTPases represent a family of more than 60 human proteins that mark distinct membrane-bound compartments and function in transport vesicle formation, motility, docking, and fusion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Stenmark, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</a>). Rabs help connect motors to their cargoes, usually via an intermediary linking protein. For example, the Rab27 Slac2 effectors recruit myosin Va (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib10\">Fukuda, 2013</a>), Rab3 effector, DENN/MADD links KIF1\u03b2 and KIF1A to Rab3 on synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib30\">Niwa et al., 2008</a>) and both Rab6 and Rab7 interact with cytoplasmic dynein via the dynactin complex (<a href=\"#bib43\">Short et al., 2002</a>), bicaudal-D (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matanis et al., 2002</a>), or RILP (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jordens et al., 2001</a>) proteins. KIF5B also links to Rab6-containing membranes via the Rab6 effector, bicaudal-D2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Grigoriev et al., 2007</a>). Rab6 binds to myosin II (<a href=\"#bib27\">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2010</a>) and Rab5 GTPase participates indirectly in the recruitment of the plus-end directed kinesin, KIF16B to early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nielsen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hoepfner et al., 2005</a>)."

KIF1C has been reported to be a Golgi-localized, tyrosine phosphorylated protein that interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dorner et al., 1998</a>) and bicaudal-D-related protein 1 (BICDR-1) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schlager et al., 2010</a>). Phosphorylation of a carboxy-terminal serine allows binding to 14-3-3 proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dorner et al., 1999</a>). KIF1C was initially reported to participate in the transport of proteins from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dorner et al., 1998</a>), but subsequent gene disruption in mice yielded animals with no apparent abnormalities, and fibroblasts from these mice showed normal Golgi to ER transport (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nakajima et al., 2002</a>). More recent studies have shown that KIF1C acts to regulate podosome dynamics in macrophages (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kopp et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Efimova et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bhuwania et al., 2014</a>) and is also important in vesicle transport in neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schlager et al., 2010</a>), MHC class II antigen presentation in myeloid cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">del Rio et al., 2012</a>), and \u03b15\u03b21-integrin transport (<a href=\"#bib49\">Theisen et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with these findings, KIF1C was identified in a genome-wide screen for proteins important for VSV-G transport to the cell surface; its depletion also led to fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon as monitored by GM130 localization (<a href=\"#bib44\">Simpson et al., 2012</a>)."

Rab6A binding to the motor domain blocks KIF1C interaction with microtubules and inhibits KIF1C motility. We confirm that depletion of KIF1C leads to fragmentation of the Golgi and show that while both N- and C-terminal Rab6A binding sites are required for KIF1C rescue, KIF1C motor activity is not: neither ATP nor microtubule binding is required. Finally, Rab6A-decorated vesicles are less confined and less directed in cells depleted of KIF1C, consistent with its role as a Rab-regulated motor that aids in intra- and post-Golgi vesicle transport. These data reveal a novel form of motor regulation with unexpected consequences for motor function in Golgi organization."

More detailed studies showed that transiently expressed, full-length myc-KIF1C and GFP-Rab6A could be co-immunoprecipitated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, this interaction may have been indirect as BICDR-1 is both an effector of Rab6A and a KIF1C binding partner (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schlager et al., 2010</a>). Direct and specific binding between Rab6A and KIF1C was tested using purified GST-constructs. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, KIF1C's C-terminal 40 amino acids, termed the C-terminal binding domain (CBD; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), bound to purified His-Rab6A protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>). Binding to His-Rab6A by N-terminally truncated KIF1C was observed only with constructs containing the CBD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Importantly, binding of the CBD required that His-Rab6A be in its active, GTP-bound state, as would be expected for a Rab effector (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>); binding was also Rab6A-specific as neither His-Rab1A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) nor His-Rab9A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) bound this domain strongly.

(Significant amounts of active full-length protein could not be obtained upon expression in bacteria, consistent with work from Hirokawa on KIF1A motor protein [<a href=\"#bib31\">Nitta et al., 2004</a>].) Surprisingly, deletion of the CBD in the context of full-length KIF1C did not abolish binding to GST-Rab6A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Similarly, KIF1C constructs containing the first 500, 400 (data not shown), or 350 amino acid residues comprising only the motor domain (KIF1C-350) bound specifically to GST-Rab6A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left).

KIF1C motor domain binding to Rab6A was specific as no significant binding was seen with either GST-Rab9A or GST-Rab5A proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In concentration-dependent binding analyses, Rab6A was capable of binding up to 25% of in vitro translated KIF1C motor domain, suggesting only a quarter of the molecules synthesized by in vitro translation were active. These experiments yielded an apparent K<sub>D</sub> = 0.23 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), strong for a Rab:effector interaction. These data show that Rab6A binds specifically to KIF1C at both its N- and C-termini."

Instead, we compared motor domain binding for the active, Rab6A hydrolysis-deficient mutant (GST-Rab6A Q72L) vs the inactive, GDP-preferring form (GST-Rab6A T27N) and found strong preference for the active Rab6A mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We also tested Rab discrimination of the motor's nucleotide state: GST-Rab6A showed strong preference for the KIF1C motor domain with AMP-PNP bound, compared with ADP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Thus, Rab6A binds with preference to KIF1C's strong microtubule-binding state. Crystal structures of the KIF1A motor domain with either AMP-PNP or ADP bound indicate a change in the projection angle of loop 10 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006</a>), which as described below, may explain the strong preference of Rab6A for AMP-PNP bound-KIF1C. These data demonstrate that active Rab6A can bind the KIF1C motor domain strongly and directly, without adaptor proteins, with preference for KIF1C in its strong microtubule-binding state."

Consistent with the Rab6A binding capacity of the KIF1C/1A chimera, conversion of KIF1C's loops 6 and 10 into KIF1A sequences yielded a \u2018loop mutant\u2019 protein that showed significantly reduced Rab6A binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). In contrast, conversion of loops 2 and 3, in the N-terminal portion, was of lower consequence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Mutation of either loop 6 or 10 alone did not completely abolish binding, suggesting that both regions form contacts with Rab6A (data not shown). These regions are spatially adjacent in the KIF1A crystal structure and are likely also similarly situated in KIF1C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Importantly, the KIF1C motor domain loop 6/10 mutant that did not bind Rab6A retained its ability to bind microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicative of proper protein folding. Furthermore, microtubule localization was not just from alternate kinesin 3 family \u2018K-loop\u2019 binding, as KIF1C loop 6/10 mutant 350 with further mutations in the K-loop (NRSK or GTKT) were still able to localize to microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

To test if Rab6A interferes with KIF1C motor domain binding to microtubules, in vitro transcribed and translated, radiolabelled, full-length KIF1C was tested for microtubule binding in the presence and absence of purified Rab6A using a microtubule co-sedimentation assay. As a close family member to KIF1A, full-length KIF1C is likely auto-inhibited and is predicted to interact less stably with microtubules (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hammond et al., 2009</a>). Nevertheless, in the presence of His-Rab6A (but not His-Rab33B), the amount of full-length KIF1C bound to microtubules decreased by more than twofold (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Especially dramatic was the ability of His-Rab6A to inhibit binding of the purified KIF1C-355-His motor domain to microtubules: KIF1C motor domain binding to microtubules could be abolished in the presence of increasing concentrations of active His-Rab6A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, His-Rab6A influenced both the AMP-PNP and ADP bound states of KIF1C-355-His; the presence of His-Rab6A increased the K<sub>D</sub> of KIF1C to microtubules by more than 10 fold for both AMP-PNP and ADP states (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). The microtubule affinities observed in the absence of Rab6A (0.46 \u00b5M and 2.1 \u00b5M in AMP-PNP and ADP, respectively) are also very similar to those reported for KIF1A protein (<a href=\"#bib45\">Soppina and Verhey, 2014</a>). Importantly, the specificity of this effect was confirmed by the finding that His-Rab33 did not influence the KIF1C-microtubule interaction significantly (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These data demonstrate a new mode of regulation: Rab6A can regulate the binding of KIF1C to microtubules by direct interaction with the KIF1C motor domain."

The percentage of moving motors also decreased 60% in the presence of Rab6A (from 2.13% to 0.86%; p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Analysis of the population of moving motors yielded no significant differences in the speed or processivity of those motors in the absence of presence of Rab6A (distribution of motors overlapped for both metrics, data not shown) and likely Rab6A only affects microtubule attachment of KIF1C and no other characteristics. In summary, the presence of Rab6A led to both a reduction in the number of motors present on microtubules and a reduction in the percentage of motors that were moving."

                                "text": "To determine if the effects of Rab6A on KIF1C could also be detected in cells, we examined the localization of KIF1C constructs in HeLa cells using methanol fixation, which favors cytoskeletal structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). While both full-length KIF1C and KIF1C-400 were localized on microtubules primarily at the cell periphery, KIF1C-350 localized along microtubules throughout the cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Unlike the KIF1C-350 construct, the KIF1C-400 construct contains the neck linker region that in KIF1A is important for regulating microtubule association and likely dimerization (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hammond et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hirokawa et al., 2009a</a>). Thus, the localization observed is consistent with earlier findings. As KIF1C-350 displayed an easily monitored distribution and was localized to regions capable of maximal contact with Rab6A, we used this construct to examine the consequences of concurrent Rab6A over-expression. KIF1C-350 wild-type or loop mutant proteins were expressed in Vero cells, with or without Rab6A. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, both the KIF1C wild-type and loop mutant constructs localized to microtubules in the absence of Rab6A (top two rows). However, upon Rab6A co-expression, the overall distribution of wild-type KIF1C-350 over microtubules was lost and the staining was also less continuous (row 3, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Moreover, Rab6A only influenced the localization of the wild-type KIF1C and not the loop mutant (row 4, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). These results were quantified using CellProfiler (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carpenter et al., 2006</a>) by determining the Pearson's correlation coefficient as a measure of the colocalization between KIF1C and microtubules (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top). Co-expression of Rab6A significantly reduced the correlation of wild-type KIF1C-350 and microtubules by 33% (p &lt; 0.001) but did not significantly affect the correlation between loop mutant KIF1C and microtubules. Importantly, the overall expression of KIF1C in co-transfected cells did not change in response to Rab6A, as the total intensity of KIF1C, quantified in paraformaldehyde fixed cells to capture the total KIF1C pool, was similar under all transfection conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, bottom). These experiments show that Rab6A influences microtubule association of the KIF1C motor domain in cells."

We tested specifically whether KIF1C participates in protein transport from the Golgi to the cell surface using KIF1C siRNA which led to a greater than 90% depletion 72 hr post-transfection (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Previous work showed that KIF5B participates in this process and suggested that an additional kinesin contributes as well (<a href=\"#bib12\">Grigoriev et al., 2007</a>). The plasma membrane delivery of Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein in HeLa cells was monitored using a cell surface antibody-binding assay. Cells expressing YFP-VSV-G ts045 protein were held at 39\u00b0C to accumulate this temperature-sensitive protein in the ER, post-synthesis. Cells were then incubated at 32\u00b0C to release the block and permit cell surface delivery. VSV-G protein began to appear at the cell surface within 35 min after release of the block in control cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In cells depleted of KIF1C, however, cell surface delivery was significantly slowed (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and resulted in a 4.5-fold decrease in the overall delivery rate. Thus, KIF1C participates in cell surface delivery of proteins from the Golgi complex, consistent with work from other labs."

Speed increases, loss of confinement, and loss of directionality upon KIF1C depletion indicate that the role of KIF1C is most evident when Rab6A vesicles are moving least\u2014KIF1C promotes vesicle directionality. When vesicles are confined, KIF1C helps to maintain that confinement, and when vesicles are stalled, KIF1C prevents backwards motion. An increase in vesicle directionality may be due to precluding the vesicle from binding a faster, less processive motor, or by influencing the tension on the vesicle, thereby changing the activity of other motors on the vesicle, and may come at the expense of overall vesicle speed."

To quantify the degree of Golgi fragmentation, we measured the percent of each cell's Golgi found in large objects (&gt;4.11 \u00b5m\u00b2); a high value would be seen for control cells. As expected, cells treated with KIF1C siRNA alone or rescued with the KIF1C 6/10 loop mutant showed a decrease in large Golgi objects. In contrast, the KIF1C wild-type and K103A constructs efficiently rescued Golgi morphology upon KIF1C depletion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) despite a predominantly cytosolic localization for the K103A construct (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, the motor domain loop mutation did not alter KIF1C localization, as both wild type and loop-mutant proteins localized largely at the cell periphery, indicating that the loop-mutant was well folded and able to migrate in an anterograde direction along microtubules (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Over-expression of both wild-type KIF1C and KIF1C K103A increased the percent of large Golgi objects compared with control siRNA, which suggests that additional KIF1C may increase Golgi compactness. These results show that the sequences comprising the Rab6A binding site within the KIF1C motor domain contribute, in some way, to the maintenance of normal Golgi morphology and that KIF1C influences Golgi morphology, independent of its function as a motor."

These objects were smaller than those scored in siRNA rescue because the over-expression of wild-type KIF1C was not able to fully rescue nocodazole-induced fragmentation, despite a readily apparent rescue phenotype. Nocodazole treatment of control cells, as well as cells expressing KIF1C loop 6/10 or \u0394CBD mutants, resulted in a decrease in the mean percentage of large Golgi objects. In contrast, wild-type KIF1C, K103A, or E170A mutant proteins protected the Golgi from fragmentation, even after nocodazole-triggered, microtubule depolymerization, as seen by the increase in percentage of Golgi detected in large objects. These data demonstrate that KIF1C has the capacity to affect Golgi morphology, independent of its motor stepping and microtubule binding activities."

A number of motors link to membranes via Rab GTPases, but few bind Rabs directly and none, to our knowledge, bind Rabs via their motor domain. We have shown here that Rab6A can bind directly to the KIF1C C-terminus (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.9 \u00b5M), consistent with the role of Rab GTPases as cargo adaptors. Surprisingly, we have also discovered a new mode of motor protein regulation: direct binding of a normally membrane-associated Rab GTPase to the KIF1C motor domain (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.2 \u00b5M). Our results show that Rab6A binds more tightly to the motor domain than to the cargo binding domain in vitro. However, in cells, the situation may be more complex as other proteins and/or KIF1C post-translational modifications may contribute to Rab6A's domain binding preferences."

Indeed, Rab6A led to a greater than 10 fold decrease in the affinity of the motor for microtubules in both AMP-PNP and ADP states. Thus, KIF1C may have a choice: the motor domain can bind either microtubules or Rab6A on membranes with very similar affinities (K<sub>D</sub> 0.46 \u00b5M vs \u223c 0. 2 \u00b5M, respectively). This feature, combined with KIF1C's ability to interact with Rab GTPases via its C-terminus (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.9 \u00b5M), may enable KIF1C to transition from a transport vesicle motor to a protein capable of binding a Rab GTPase at both ends."

Such a mechanism ensures that motor function is coupled to successful cargo engagement. Once on vesicles, additional Rab6A binding to the motor domain binding may regulate the load that other motors on the vesicle experience, by blocking KIF1C engagement with microtubules. This regulation may influence the speed, run length, and directionality of Rab6A vesicles, and may also play a role in KIF1C's confinement of non-moving vesicles."

Such interactions between Rab6, its effectors, and the C-terminus of KIF1C highlight the importance of the linkage between KIF1C and Rab6, all of which may strengthen the overall interaction of this motor with its cargo and provide an additional layer to regulate Rab6\u2013KIF1C interactions. During neuronal development, BCDR-1 decreases significantly (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schlager et al., 2010</a>). The ability of KIF1C to interact with Rab6A GTPase directly (as reported here) or via Rab binding proteins such as BCDR-1 suggests that KIF1C may have both constitutive and development-specific functions."

Multiple binding sites offer the possibility for Rab6A concentration-dependent effects on KIF1C, which will be of interest to explore in future experiments. In principle, KIF1C should be able to sense the concentration of Rab6A on transport vesicles, on the donor compartments from which they derive, or on the acceptor membrane once at their destination and choose between engaging microtubules or additional Rabs. Other adapters, such as BICDR-1, may also play a role in influencing how concentration affects each Rab6A binding site."

This explains the Golgi fragmentation phenotype seen here and previously upon KIF1C depletion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Simpson et al., 2012</a>). Fibroblasts from mice lacking KIF1C did not appear to show a morphological Golgi defect (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nakajima et al., 2002</a>), but such cells likely compensate by expressing other proteins at higher levels and this subtle phenotype may have been missed. Myosin V is a well-characterized example of a motor protein that serves to tether bound cargo near the terminal actin web (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wu et al., 2000</a>). In membrane traffic, tethers hold transport vesicles near their targets to permit engagement of SNARE proteins that mediate vesicle fusion. As KIF1C appears to be able to bind to Rabs directly at both its N- and C-termini, KIF1C might be employed similarly to help hold vesicles near the Golgi during the transition between microtubule based movement and docking at a membrane. The capacity of KIF1C to bind to Rabs at both ends also suggests a possible mechanism for KIF1C's role in maintaining Golgi morphology. Additional work will be needed to confirm these models for KIF1C function."

KIF1C was needed both to confine relatively stationary vesicles and to sustain the momentum of moving vesicles. Rab6A vesicles lacking KIF1C move faster from frame to frame; they also change directions more often than vesicles in control cells. These results suggest that KIF1C has at least two functions: (1) to hold vesicles; (2) to increase transport directionality, which surely requires motor activity. The most visible role for KIF1C is to function as a motor, as seen by the motor's localization primarily at the cell periphery. Rab6A regulation of KIF1C could allow KIF1C to release from microtubules when bound to Rab6A at both ends. On vesicles, this might help to avoid vesicle traffic jams by allowing for backwards motion or adjust vesicle speed by allowing other motors to dominate vesicle motion. By aiding in directional motion and decreasing speed, it is also possible that KIF1C helps vesicles recognize their targets, as slower moving vesicles would have more time for the protein:protein interactions that drive vesicle docking and SNARE-mediated fusion."

Rab6A participates in the motility of post-Golgi, exocytic transport vesicles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Grigoriev et al., 2007</a>) in cooperation with the kinesin motor, KIF5B, and with cytoplasmic dynein via its effector, bicaudal D1 and D2 proteins (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matanis et al., 2002</a>). Depletion of KIF5B did not fully block the motility of Rab6A vesicles in previous work (<a href=\"#bib12\">Grigoriev et al., 2007</a>), thus, KIF1C likely functions in conjunction with these motors to drive Rab6A vesicle motility. The novel regulation by Rab6A of the KIF1C motor domain may allow Rab6A to shift the dynamics between these motors. The conventional KIF5B kinesin might play the primary role in moving Rab6A vesicles, while the interplay between KIF1C and dynein/dynactin might contribute to processivity."

KIF1C may attach to membranes via Rab6A binding at the C-terminus. Once bound to membranes, the motor domain can (1) bind a microtubule for conventional vesicle motility, or (2) bind to another Rab6A molecule on the vesicle to allow other motors to drive vesicle transport, or (3) bind to adjacent Rab6A-containing membranes like the Golgi complex where it can hypothetically, be held. Competition for Rab6A on the vesicle will be high as the absolute number of Rab GTPases on an individual transport vesicle is likely to be small (\u223c10 per vesicle; <a href=\"#bib48\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>) and many effectors, including two domains of KIF1C, will be vying to bind to Rabs. Moreover, as Rab6A is abundant on Golgi mini-stacks, it is in theory, possible that KIF1C could also serve to hold these mini-stacks together to maintain normal Golgi ribbon structure. This KIF1C-driven mechanism could explain how depletion of KIF1C leads to increased Golgi fragmentation that can be rescued by full-length KIF1C independent of motor activity but dependent on Rab6A binding domains. Finally, because the motor domain can potentially choose between Rab6A or microtubules, KIF1C could play a role during transport vesicle formation: when the tip of a newly forming transport vesicle projects away from a Rab6A-enriched membrane surface, the motor could instead latch onto microtubule filaments. KIF1C could then contribute to Rab6A vesicle motility en route to the cell surface. Future experiments will clarify how the Rab GTPase-assisted gymnastics accomplished by KIF1C contribute to membrane traffic within and beyond the Golgi complex."

Samples were visualized using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with a 100\u00d7 1.49 NA APO-TIRF lens and an EMCCD (Andor iXON+; Andor technology, South Windsor, CT).

The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine statistical significance. Samples were visualized in series such that proteins in each condition were on the coverslip for similar amounts of time. Moving motors were defined as those moving &gt;0.12 \u00b5m/s for a distance of &gt;0.2 \u00b5m that were tracked for &gt;0.9 s. In these experiments, a large pool of motors was immobile on microtubules. However, the median life span of this pool was 0.7 s, suggesting that most motors do not accumulate on microtubules but rather bind and release. Importantly, both immobile and motile pools of KIF1C were susceptible to Rab6A action. A small pool of motors (6%) was long-lived (\u00b1 Rab6A); this pool did not increase over the time of these experiments (\u223c15 min). Auto-inhibition likely explains why only 2% of microtubule-bound motors showed motility in these experiments."

They then do in vivo experiments to show effects of KIF1C depletion or certain overexpression experiments on Golgi distribution and vesicle transport. Overall, there is a great deal of work contained in this paper (11 experimental main figures and supplement). However, I have reservations regarding the publication in <i>eLife</i>. First of all, the in vitro effects of the Rab6 on KIF1C microtubule interaction are relatively small (\u223c50%), which makes one wonder about the in vivo relevance. The GDP/GTP selection of Rab6 is also weak (50%; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Also, given that this is a core of the study, I thought that many of these in vitro experiments were not thoroughly documented as described below. I also thought that in vivo experiments did not convincingly establish a role for the Rab6 nucleotide switch on regulating KIF1C motor/microtubule binding function in vivo. Thus, while the data is interesting individually, I did not find that the paper as a whole conveyed a compelling story, or at least at the level required for an <i>eLife</i> publication."

This motor has previously been implicated in organization of the Golgi as its depletion results in Golgi fragmentation. They first show convincingly that the tail and head of KIF1C each have binding sites for Rab6-GTP. Using the knowledge that the head of KIF1A, for which a structure is available, does not bind Rab6, they make chimeras to identify the Rab6 binding region. They find that substitution of loops 6 and 10 from KIF1A into KIF1C abolishes Rab6 binding, but does not compromise microtubule binding of the head domain alone. Next, they report that Rab6 binding to the motor domain blocks both its ability to bind microtubules and in vitro motor motility. Next, they explore the role of KIF1C in vivo and find that siRNA knockdown results in observable differences in confinement, speed and directionality of pEGFP-Rab6A puncta. Next, the transit time of YFG-VSV-G-ts045 from the ER to the cell surface is found to be delayed in KIF1C siRNA cells. Additionally, the ribbon organization of the Golgi is disturbed in KIF1C siRNA cells, a phenotype that can be suppressed by KIF1C expression, and not by the loop 6/10 mutant, but, significantly, can be rescued by a KIF1C mutant that binds Rab6 but not microtubules. In support of this, nocodazole induced dispersion of the Golgi could be partly rescued by over-expression of KIF1C, and to a lesser degree by mutants that cannot bind Rab6."

The biochemical data in the revised paper seem mostly reasonable. However, I have strong reservations about the cell biological data. If KIF1C serves as a Rab6A-dependent, functionally relevant Golgi tether\u2014a protein that can connect vesicles to Golgi stacks or promote association between different Golgi stacks, like the authors suggest\u2014this kinesin must be detectable at the Golgi. However, the paper does not contain a single image showing the Golgi localization of KIF1C, either endogenous or overexpressed. For example, in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, the authors show data indicating that overexpressed KIF1C or KIF1C 103A mutant suppress nocodazole-mediated Golgi dispersion. It would seem that KIF1C should be detectable at the Golgi in these conditions, especially as microtubules are not present and should not compete with Rab6A for binding. In the rebuttal letter, the authors indicate that there are no antibodies that can detect endogenous KIF1C. This statement does not seem accurate, because two papers (Theisen et al., Dev Cell 2012, Efimova et al., J Cell Sci 2014) successfully used KIF1C antibodies from Cytoskeleton to stain endogenous KIF1C (although no specific accumulation of KIF1C at the Golgi seemed to be present in the images in these papers). As an alternative to endogenous staining, a better effort could be made with tagged KIF1C and tag-specific antibodies. Ideally, the authors should show that there is a KIF1C pool at the Golgi, and that this pool is lost when Rab6A is depleted. If no KIF1C can be detected at the Golgi, then the most trivial explanation is that its levels at this membrane organelle are very low, bringing the \u201ctether\u201d model into question."

The data indicating some role of KIF1C in Golgi organization is supported by previous data as well as new data in this study.\u201d Another summarized the discussion with: \u201cThe biochemical analysis of the Rab6 interaction seems to be the higher quality part of the work. The imaging data relies on a rather odd method and I'm not sure I would draw any conclusions from it.

The biochemical data in the revised paper seem mostly reasonable. However, I have strong reservations about the cell biological data. If KIF1C serves as a Rab6A-dependent, functionally relevant Golgi tether\u2014a protein that can connect vesicles to Golgi stacks or promote association between different Golgi stacks, like the authors suggest\u2014this kinesin must be detectable at the Golgi. However, the paper does not contain a single image showing the Golgi localization of KIF1C, either endogenous or overexpressed. For example, in</i> <a href=\"#fig9\"><i>Figure 9</i></a><i>, the authors show data indicating that overexpressed KIF1C or KIF1C 103A mutant suppress nocodazole-mediated Golgi dispersion. It would seem that KIF1C should be detectable at the Golgi in these conditions, especially as microtubules are not present and should not compete with Rab6A for binding. In the rebuttal letter, the authors indicate that there are no antibodies that can detect endogenous KIF1C. This statement does not seem accurate, because two papers (Theisen et al., Dev Cell 2012, Efimova et al., J Cell Sci 2014) successfully used KIF1C antibodies from Cytoskeleton to stain endogenous KIF1C (although no specific accumulation of KIF1C at the Golgi seemed to be present in the images in these papers). As an alternative to endogenous staining, a better effort could be made with tagged KIF1C and tag-specific antibodies. Ideally, the authors should show that there is a KIF1C pool at the Golgi, and that this pool is lost when Rab6A is depleted. If no KIF1C can be detected at the Golgi, then the most trivial explanation is that its levels at this membrane organelle are very low, bringing the</i> \u201c<i>tether</i>\u201d <i>model into question</i>."

Six different cells are shown as examples, and we don\u2019t make any strong conclusions about what is shown there (we disagree with the reviewer who concluded that no contacts were seen; see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). In any case, this helps reduce the number of supplemental figures and hopefully clarifies the presentation. (A referee had asked for a loop mutant KIF1C but such a protein can still bind Rab6 so would not be a good control.)"
