Though corelease of glutamate or GABA with acetylcholine has been reported within the cholinergic system, the full extent is unknown. To explore synaptic signaling of cholinergic forebrain neurons, we activated <i>choline acetyltransferase</i> expressing neurons using channelrhodopsin while recording post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in layer 1 interneurons. Surprisingly, we observed PSCs mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in addition to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Based on PSC latency and pharmacological sensitivity, our results suggest monosynaptic release of both GABA and ACh. Anatomical analysis showed that forebrain cholinergic neurons express the GABA synthetic enzyme <i>Gad2</i> and the vesicular GABA transporter (<i>Slc32a1</i>). We confirmed the direct release of GABA by knocking out <i>Slc32a1</i> from cholinergic neurons. Our results identify GABA as an overlooked fast neurotransmitter utilized throughout the forebrain cholinergic system. GABA/ACh corelease may have major implications for modulation of cortical function by cholinergic neurons."

This assumption led to classifying neuronal subtypes based on released neurotransmitter, a convention which helped predict a neuron's circuit function. However, many neuronal subtypes that release multiple fast neurotransmitters have now been described (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</a>). In some cases, the coreleased neurotransmitters have similar post-synaptic effects, such as inhibition mediated by GABA and glycine from spinal interneurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Jonas et al., 1998</a>). In other instances, the effects of the two neurotransmitters may be different and synergistic. For example, coreleased GABA and glutamate are thought to control the balance of excitation and inhibition in the lateral habenula (<a href=\"#bib27\">Root et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shabel et al., 2014</a>). In neuromodulatory systems, synaptic release of fast neurotransmitters along with slow neuromodulators has emerged as a common theme. In addition to the impact of dopamine, stimulation of dopaminergic terminals from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra compacta activates glutamate-mediated excitatory currents in the nucleus accumbens (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stuber et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tecuapetla et al., 2010</a>) and GABA-mediated inhibitory currents in the striatum (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2014</a>). Likewise, serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe can trigger glutamate-mediated currents in post-synaptic neurons of the ventral tegmentum and nucleus accumbens which contributes to the signaling of reward (<a href=\"#bib15\">Liu et al., 2014</a>)."

Retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) differentially release GABA and acetylcholine (ACh) based on the pattern of light stimulation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). In the central brain, selective activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons results in cholinergic and glutamatergic responses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gras et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Higley et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Nelson et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, the cholinergic projection from habenula excites interpeduncular neurons through glutamate and ACh (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ren et al., 2011</a>). Some evidence suggests that the basal forebrain cholinergic (BFC) system, which provides the major source of ACh to cortex, may corelease GABA. The dorsal-most BFC neurons, which belong to the globus pallidus externus (GP), express molecular markers for GABA synthesis and vesicular packaging and trigger GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor currents in GP and cortex when activated (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tkatch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Saunders et al., 2015</a>). We therefore asked whether GABA corelease was a general feature of forebrain cholinergic neurons."

Recording from layer 1 interneurons, we observed not only the expected excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) mediated by nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs), but an unexpected inhibitory post-synaptic current (IPSC) mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. IPSCs insensitive to nAChR antagonists had onset latencies slightly faster than the nicotinic EPSCs (nEPSCs), and could be directly evoked under pharmacological conditions in which action potentials were blocked, suggesting cholinergic neurons were directly releasing GABA in addition to ACh. Indeed, we found that cholinergic neurons throughout the forebrain commonly coexpressed the GABA synthetic enzyme GAD65 (<i>Gad2</i>), and the vesicular GABA transporter (<i>Slc32a1</i>), indicating that these neurons possess the necessary cell machinery for GABA transmission. Finally, we show that conditional deletion of <i>Slc32a1</i> selectively in cholinergic neurons eliminates monosynaptic IPSCs while leaving nEPSCs intact, confirming the direct release of GABA from cholinergic terminals. These experiments suggest a previously overlooked capability of the cholinergic system to use GABA in synaptic signaling."

In the presence of TTX, IPSCs could be rescued by enhancing ChR2-mediated depolarization with the voltage-gated potassium channel blocker 4AP. Rescued IPSCs were subsequently blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 (n = 5 cells from 4 mice). Moreover, nAChR-resistant \u2018direct\u2019 IPSCs had faster average onsets than both nEPSCs and nAChR-sensitive \u2018indirect\u2019 IPSCs (nEPSCs, 4.0 \u00b1 0.2 ms, n = 41 cells; direct IPSCs, 2.5 \u00b1 0.2, n = 9 cells; indirect IPSCs, 11.8 \u00b1 2.3, n = 19 cells from 9 mice, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>).

We examined if cholinergic neurons expressed GAD67 by immunostaining for ChAT in brain sections from knock-in mice where GFP replaces the first exon of the <i>Gad1</i> gene (<i>Gad1</i><sup><i>GFP</i></sup>). We detected only minor overlap between neurons that stained positive for ChAT and those that expressed GFP in the NB, GP, MS/DBB, or PPN, except for cortical ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneurons, where we observed significant overlap (GFP+/ChAT + neurons: Ctx: 122/136; MS/DBB, 1/573; NB, 0/439; GP, 7/413; PPN, 12/246, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Copackaging in individual vesicles is also the case when the same vesicular transporter loads both neurotransmitters. For example, GABA is packaged in dopaminergic neurons by VMAT2, which also packages dopamine (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, both GABA and glycine packaging in spinal interneurons rely on VGAT (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wojcik et al., 2006</a>). However, corelease from separate pools of synaptic vesicles also occurs. In retinal SACs, release of GABA and ACh can be functionally separated through patterned light stimulation or pharmacology. In <i>Chat</i><sup>+</sup> GP axons in cortex, GABA and ACh appear to be released from distinct vesicular pools which can be located within the same or neighboring pre-synaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib31\">Saunders et al., 2015</a>). Though the precise mechanism by which each forebrain cholinergic population coreleases GABA and ACh remain unclear and further experiments are merited to explore how GABA/ACh cotransmission is regulated, the differences in the proportion of layer 1 interneurons showing ACh and GABA responses suggest some form of segregated release."

In addition, many in vitro pharmacological experiments have shown that ACh receptors can shape the signaling of other neurotransmitter systems, by altering properties of presynaptic release, synaptic plasticity, or the intrinsic excitability of targeted neurons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Picciotto et al., 2012</a>). However, more recent work has focused on the participation of ACh in rapid, wired neurotransmission, acting at tightly apposed synapses (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sarter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Poorthuis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sarter et al., 2014</a>).

First, at the circuit level, GABA release could act in a manner that reinforces the emerging concept that the cholinergic system disinhibits cortical firing. ACh release from basal forebrain neurons excites layer 1 and VIP<sup>+</sup> interneurons, which in turn inhibit local interneurons that target principle neurons of the cortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Letzkus et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Pinto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Depending on the timing and targeted cell types, GABA corelease could conceivably enhance this effect by inhibiting local interneurons, thereby promoting cortical activity. Second, nAChRs can regulate both pre and post-synaptic GABAergic signaling. For example, in hippocampal interneurons, post-synaptic nAChRs are present in inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fabian-Fine et al., 2001</a>) and when activated, reduce GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated IPSCs in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PKC-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wanaverbecq et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang and Berg, 2007</a>). Thus coreleased ACh and GABA could interact to modulate local synaptic signaling. Lastly, experiments poisoning or stimulating the basal forebrain cholinergic system have demonstrated that activity within this projection is necessary and sufficient for plasticity in sensory cortices (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kilgard and Merzenich, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Weinberger, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ramanathan et al., 2009</a>). While ACh alone can induce functional changes in cortical circuits (<a href=\"#bib19\">Metherate and Weinberger, 1990</a>), GABA may also contribute to synaptic rewiring in vivo. Addressing these questions experimentally will benefit from future work to clarify the basic synaptic anatomy and biochemical regulation of ACh/GABA corelease. Given the presence of GABA signaling machinery throughout the distinct forebrain cholinergic systems, corelease likely has a significant and fundamental effect on brain activity and cognition."
