In this study, we compare data from elutriated cells with NB4 cells arrested at comparable phases using serum starvation, hydroxyurea, or RO-3306. While elutriated and arrested cells have similar patterns of DNA content and cyclin expression, a large fraction of the proteome changes detected in arrested cells are found to reflect arrest-specific responses (i.e., starvation, DNA damage, CDK1 inhibition), rather than physiological cell cycle regulation. For example, we show most cells arrested in G2 by CDK1 inhibition express abnormally high levels of replication and origin licensing factors and are likely poised for genome re-replication. The protein data are available in the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" href=\"http://www.peptracker.com/epd/\">http://www.peptracker.com/epd/</ext-link>), an online, searchable resource."

In this study, we compare data from elutriated cells with NB4 cells arrested at comparable phases using serum starvation, hydroxyurea, or RO-3306. While elutriated and arrested cells have similar patterns of DNA content and cyclin expression, a large fraction of the proteome changes detected in arrested cells are found to reflect arrest-specific responses (i.e., starvation, DNA damage, CDK1 inhibition), rather than physiological cell cycle regulation. For example, we show most cells arrested in G2 by CDK1 inhibition express abnormally high levels of replication and origin licensing factors and are likely poised for genome re-replication. The protein data are available in the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" href=\"http://www.peptracker.com/epd/\">http://www.peptracker.com/epd/</ext-link>), an online, searchable resource."

To minimize effects on proteins caused by stress responses that do not reflect physiological regulation specific to cell cycle progression, we used centrifugal elutriation to size-separate asynchronously growing cells into populations differentially enriched in distinct phases of the cell cycle. Based on multiple criteria, including cell size, shape, and proliferation potential, the populations of elutriation-enriched cells were shown to remain within the normal range found for the starting population of non-elutriated, asynchronously growing cells. We concluded, therefore, that the variations in protein abundance measured across the elutriated cell populations predominantly reflect the physiological regulation of gene expression that occurs during the course of a \u2018minimally perturbed\u2019 cell cycle. We also discussed how these data may differ from many previous studies, where alternative strategies to elutriation have been used to isolate cell populations enriched for specific cell cycle phases, mostly based on methods that arrest cells at different stages of cell cycle progression. In particular, the elutriation approach identifies a smaller proportion of genes (\u223c4%) that encode proteins whose abundance is cell cycle regulated than have been reported in previous studies."

Arrest methods have potential advantages, including the ease of reproducibly achieving high synchronicity. However, a major unresolved issue is the extent to which the effects of stress and metabolic perturbation, arising from the treatments used to cause cell cycle arrest, may contribute to any observed changes in protein expression unrelated to physiologically relevant cell cycle changes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shedden and Cooper, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cooper, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cooper et al., 2006</a>)."

Hydroxyurea depletes deoxynucleotide pools thereby slowing replication, and at high doses, arrests cells at the G1/S border (<a href=\"#bib41\">Young and Hodas, 1964</a>). Serum starvation arrests cells in a state with 2N DNA content (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zetterberg et al., 1982</a>). Both arrest procedures have known effects on cellular physiology. In the case of hydroxyurea, high concentrations and prolonged treatment can induce replication stress and DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Saintigny et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alvino et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Petermann et al., 2010</a>). Serum starvation induces reversible cell cycle exit, with cells entering a quiescent state (G0 phase) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pardee, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">O'Farrell, 2011</a>) that is characterized by changes in protein signaling, for example, pRb phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1989</a>), and activation of proteins that inhibit CDK activity, for example, p21 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 2000</a>). Recent studies showed that the G0 state is transiently populated, even in proliferating cells cultured in serum (<a href=\"#bib36\">Spencer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Naetar et al., 2014</a>). This occurs in an apparently stochastic, but p21-dependent, manner (<a href=\"#bib36\">Spencer et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, microarray analyses of serum-starved mouse 3T3 cells show that up to \u223c5% of the probe set changes by \u22651.5-fold (<a href=\"#bib27\">Oki et al., 2014</a>).

In mammalian cells, the role of each kinase in the response to hydroxyurea depends on dosage and cellular context (<a href=\"#bib33\">Saintigny et al., 2001</a>). These four kinases are all detected in this data set with two of them, that is, CHEK2 (Chk2) and ATR, specifically increasing in abundance following hydroxyurea arrest. In contrast, in elutriated cells the abundances of CHEK2 and ATR show only minor changes, that is, less than 1.5-fold, with peak expression in S/G2-phase. These data are consistent with CHEK2/ATR induction as a response to low levels of endogenous replication stress in elutriated cells, but to a much lesser degree than induced by hydroxyurea, suggesting that DNA damage is more extensive in the arrested cells."

Pathway enrichment analysis identified three major pathways that increase upon RO-3306 treatment. Two enriched pathways, that is, G2&amp;M; checkpoint and kinesins, are highly related to gene ontology terms enriched in the elutriated cell data set (mitosis, cell division, kinesins). Closer inspection of the enriched proteins in the G2&amp;M; checkpoint pathway, however, reveals that the majority are involved in DNA replication, such as the MCM DNA helicase (MCM6), the origin recognition complex (ORC1, ORC3, ORC5) and replication factors (RFC3, RFC5). Interestingly, ORC1 was identified in the minimally perturbed data set as a cell cycle regulated protein that peaks in G1-phase.

However, given the low frequency of re-replication detected (\u223c3.3% of cells have &gt;4N DNA content, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), we were surprised to find such a robust accumulation of licensing and replication factors. Another possible explanation is that cells with 4N DNA content express unexpectedly high amounts of origin licensing and replication factors. To test this, we measured by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, the expression of the proteins CDT1 and geminin. Under normal proliferative conditions, the activity of CDT1, which is required for origin licensing, is inhibited in G2 phase by interactions with Geminin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Klotz-Noack et al., 2012</a>). In mock-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), CDT1 protein expression is highest in G1, low in S, and accumulates in G2&amp;M; phase. This pattern is similar to what is seen in elutriated NB4 cells (Figure 8 in <a href=\"#bib23\">Ly et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, upon CDK1 inhibition, G2&amp;M; cells express abnormally high levels of CDT1 protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D</a>) high ratio of CDT1:geminin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) compared with mock treatment. These data suggest that CDK1 activity helps prevent premature licensing in G2. Furthermore, although \u223c97% of the NB4 cells are not undergoing re-replication by 18 hr post RO-3306 treatment, these data show that treated cells have accumulated high levels of origin licensing and replication factors that are not normally observed in cycling G2 cells.

These protein abundance changes may arise, at least in part, as a response to depletion of growth factors, hormones, and lipids, which are all major components of serum. They may also reflect the shift from a proliferative to a quiescent cell state, a process that remains a subject of intense study (<a href=\"#bib36\">Spencer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Naetar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Oki et al., 2014</a>).

These proteome changes affecting chromatin could thus represent a conserved mechanism for modulating global gene expression in response to metabolic stress caused by nutrient deprivation and merit more detailed analysis in the future.

It will therefore be interesting in future to extend this study to identify also proteome changes arising from arrest and release methods and to compare these with the observed proteome changes in elutriated cells. For example, we note that serum starvation has a very acute effect on the proteome, including significant changes in proteins involved in nucleosome composition and epigenetic chromatin remodeling. It will thus be important to characterise in more detail the effects of serum starvation on chromatin structure and to investigate whether, and/or how rapidly, these effects are reversible when serum is restored. In addition to metabolic studies, we note that the MS-based proteomics approach can be used to rapidly screen cells for potential off-target effects of drug treatments, as illustrated here for RO-3306. This provides for a more detailed understanding of mechanisms regulating cell cycle progression and other processes and can also be applied in future to improve studies on cytotoxicity."

This version of MaxQuant includes an integrated search engine, Andromeda (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cox et al., 2011</a>). The database supplied to the search engine for peptide identifications was a UniProt human protein database (\u2018Human Reference Proteome\u2019 retrieved on 17 February 2014) combined with a commonly observed contaminants list. The initial mass tolerance was set to 7 ppm. and MS/MS mass tolerance was 20 ppm. The digestion enzyme was set to trypsin/P with up to 2 missed cleavages. Deamidation, oxidation of methionine and Gln\u2192pyro-Glu were searched as variable modifications. Identification was set to a false discovery rate of 1%. To achieve reliable identifications, all proteins were accepted based on the criteria that the number of forward hits in the database was at least 100-fold higher than the number of reverse database hits, thus resulting in a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Protein isoforms and proteins that cannot be distinguished based on the peptides identified are grouped by MaxQuant and displayed on a single line with multiple UniProt identifiers. The label free quantitation (LFQ) algorithm in MaxQuant was used for protein quantitation. The algorithm has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib44\">Cox 2014</a>). Protein quantitation was performed on unmodified peptides and peptides that have modifications that are known to occur during sample processing (pyro-Glu, deamidation). All resulting MS data were integrated and managed using PepTracker Data Manager, a laboratory information management system (LIMS) that is part of the PepTracker software platform (<a href=\"http://www.PepTracker.com\">http://www.PepTracker.com</a>)."

This step involved removing proteins with less than 2 peptide identifications, and those labeled as either contaminants or reverse hits."

The first method uses p-value and fold change thresholds to identify a set of proteins that reproducibly change in abundance. In this study, a one-way ANOVA was used to calculate the p-value. The protein set that meets the threshold criteria is then compared against the proteome to identify enriched annotations, such as gene ontology terms. The critical thresholds used were a p-value of less than 0.05 and a fold change (between any treatment) greater than or equal to two. Scaled protein abundances were then clustered into 4 clusters using the Ward algorithm (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ward, 1963</a>). Enriched gene ontology annotations were identified using the DAVID web resource. The second method uses threshold-free algorithms to detect enriched gene sets. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) tool (<a href=\"#bib37\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>) was used to find enriched KEGG (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</a>) and Reactome (<a href=\"#bib12\">Croft et al., 2011</a>) pathways.

Since G0/1 cells are likely much smaller and of lower protein content than S or G2 phase cells, it could be that the high abundance of histones in serum starved samples only reflects a higher number of cells. This issue should be addressed or commented upon as appropriate."

We respond below to the specific comments provided by the reviewers, explaining how we have revised the manuscript to address these points. In addition to the points raised by the reviewers, we have also improved the revised manuscript by including an additional figure panel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) documenting the ratio of CDT1:geminin protein expression in cells treated with RO\u20103306.

We also note that these arrest treatments are featured in recent books (e.g., Methods in Molecular Biology) and review papers on synchronization methods. We have explicitly discussed in the revised manuscript the use of other synchronization methods not covered in this study and indicate our intention to address also the proteomic consequences of arrest and release procedures in future studies. However, given the previous and ongoing use of the classic arrest procedures in the cell cycle literature, we feel that it is useful and relevant to provide this analysis of how hydroxyurea and serum starvation affect protein expression at a global level."

We feel this allows for an unbiased and novel analysis of the effects of these arrest treatments that can begin to unravel to what extent changes in protein expression reflect bona fide cell cycle regulation as opposed to effects of metabolic perturbation that do not occur during physiological progression of cells through interphase. Reassuringly, our unbiased proteomic analysis on arrested NB4 cells is highly consistent with previous findings (e.g., effects of serum starvation on metabolism and hydroxyurea on replication stress). We feel this validates the proteomic methodology used here and illustrates how it can be applied in future to characterize the effects of drugs and other treatments on cellular physiology. However, while our data for cells arrested with either serum starvation or hydroxyurea are in general consistent with previous studies, we note that an interesting new finding is that serum starvation also induces changes to chromatin modifiers and chromatin components. As the reviewers point out (below), changes in core histone levels were unexpected. This demonstrates how our unbiased proteomic approach can reveal an unanticipated, and previously undocumented, effect of serum starvation on cells."

RO\u20103306 is a recently developed Cdk1 inhibitor that is now being more widely used to synchronize cells in G2. We agree with the reviewers that our proteomic data on cells treated with RO\u20103306 reveal an important role of Cdk1 in preventing re\u2010replication in G2. To expand and emphasize this point, we have included additional data in the revised manuscript that support this conclusion. Specifically, we have performed additional quantitative measurements of the Cdt1:geminin ratio, which has been shown to be critical for regulating re\u2010replication in G2. We show that this ratio is abnormally high in Cdk1\u2010inhibited G2 cells, compared with control, vehicle\u2010treated cells, consistent with RO\u20103306\u2010induced re\u2010licensing. We have also increased the focus of the study towards the analysis of RO\u20103306 by modifying the Abstract and expanding the relevant section of the Discussion."

In contrast, in arrested cells, which were processed for MS analysis in the same manner as elutriated cells, we observe a significant, reproducible change in core histone proteins."

Additionally, we have revised the Introduction to include a more detailed description of the literature on the physiological effects of hydroxyurea and serum starvation, which we hope will provide better context for readers to interpret the results of our unbiased, system\u2010wide analysis. We trust that these data will be useful to the community and seen as part of an ongoing project to apply state of the art quantitative proteomics methods to systematically characterize the global regulation of the proteome as cells progress through the cell cycle."
