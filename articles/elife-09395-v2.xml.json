In this study, we demonstrate Kirrel3 regulates target-specific synapse formation at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses, which connect dentate granule (DG) neurons to both CA3 and GABAergic neurons. Here, we show Kirrel3 is required for formation of MF filopodia; the structures that give rise to DG-GABA synapses and that regulate feed-forward inhibition of CA3 neurons. Consequently, loss of Kirrel3 robustly increases CA3 neuron activity in developing mice. Alterations in the Kirrel3 gene are repeatedly associated with intellectual disabilities, but the role of Kirrel3 at synapses remained largely unknown. Our findings demonstrate that subtle synaptic changes during development impact circuit function and provide the first insight toward understanding the cellular basis of Kirrel3-dependent neurodevelopmental disorders."

In this study, we demonstrate Kirrel3 regulates target-specific synapse formation at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses, which connect dentate granule (DG) neurons to both CA3 and GABAergic neurons. Here, we show Kirrel3 is required for formation of MF filopodia; the structures that give rise to DG-GABA synapses and that regulate feed-forward inhibition of CA3 neurons. Consequently, loss of Kirrel3 robustly increases CA3 neuron activity in developing mice. Alterations in the Kirrel3 gene are repeatedly associated with intellectual disabilities, but the role of Kirrel3 at synapses remained largely unknown. Our findings demonstrate that subtle synaptic changes during development impact circuit function and provide the first insight toward understanding the cellular basis of Kirrel3-dependent neurodevelopmental disorders."

Therefore, through these two different types of synapses, DG neurons can both increase and decrease the activity of the CA3 neurons. This delicate balance of activity across the two types of DG synapses is very important for the hippocampus to work properly, which is critical for our ability to learn and remember."

Therefore, neurons usually send and receive neural information with different synaptic partners. One way neurons differentially regulate activity among partners is by forming different types of synapses with each partner (<a href=\"#bib36\">Williams et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Emes and Grant, 2012</a>). This kind of synaptic target specificity is exquisitely exemplified by hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses. MF synapses connect glutamatergic dentate granule (DG) neurons to glutamatergic CA3 neurons and GABAergic interneurons (GABA neurons). The main DG-CA3 synapse consists of a giant presynaptic bouton apposed to a multi-headed CA3 spine called a thorny excrescence (TE). In addition, filopodia project from the main bouton and synapse with nearby GABA neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frotscher, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acs\u00e1dy et al., 1998</a>). Filopodial MF synapses mediate feed-forward inhibition of CA3 neurons and are essential for hippocampal function during learning and memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib31\">Torborg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ruediger et al., 2011</a>). Although main bouton and filopodial MF synapses are physically linked, they have different molecular and functional properties (<a href=\"#bib32\">Toth et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">McBain, 2008</a>). This suggests DG neurons utilize specific cues to construct different types of synapses with CA3 and GABA neurons, but the identity of the target-specific cues is unknown."

Kirrel3 protein is enriched in synaptosomes prepared from hippocampal lysates with greatest enrichment at postnatal day (P) 21 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Next, we obtained Kirrel3 knockout mice, which were recently described (<a href=\"#bib25\">Prince et al., 2013</a>) and prepared hippocampal neuron cultures from newborn wild-type and knockout mice. In hippocampal neurons cultured for 14 days in vitro (DIV), Kirrel3 localizes to puncta adjacent to the pre- and post-synaptic markers vGlut1 and MAGUK in wild-type but not knockout neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). This suggests that, like cadherins, Kirrel3 localizes to perisynaptic adhesion zones rather than the synaptic cleft. To determine if Kirrel3 is axonal, dendritic, or both, we analyzed the distribution of surface-expressed FLAG-Kirrel3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) in sparsely transfected neurons using live labeling. Surface FLAG-Kirrel3 is seen as puncta on axons and dendrites of 14DIV neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>).

In developing P14 and adult hippocampi, Kirrel3 mRNA is present in two cell types: (1) DG neurons and (2) scattered cells of the hilus and area CA3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Correspondingly, Kirrel3 protein is present in the molecular and stratum lucidum layers of the hippocampus, containing DG dendrites and axons, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). It is also present in scattered cells of the hilus and area CA3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and faintly in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, which contains axons from entorhinal cortex. No Kirrel3 signal was detected in knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Instead, Kirrel3 knockout mice have farnesylated GFP in frame after exon 1 so they express membrane-associated GFP instead of Kirrel3 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Prince et al., 2013</a>). Examination of GFP expression in knockout mice indicates that again, Kirrel3 is selectively expressed by DG neurons and scattered cells of area CA3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013O</a>). Notably, we never observe GFP expression in CA3 neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>)."

To test this, we co-stained P14 Kirrel3 heterozygous and knockout mice with antibodies against GFP to identify Kirrel3-expressing cells and GABA to identify GABAergic interneurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013S</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We find that nearly all Kirrel3-expressing cells express GABA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2S</a>). Conversely, about 20% of all GABA neurons in area CA3 express Kirrel3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2S</a>). We also co-stained with several common GABA neuron markers and find that two thirds (about 67%) of Kirrel3/GABA neurons express calbindin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2P\u2013S</a>) and these Kirrel3-positive neurons make up about half of all calbindin-positive interneurons. Notably, glutamatergic DG neurons also highly express Kirrel3 and calbindin, providing a shared molecular profile between these neuronal populations. Kirrel3 cell populations are similar in P14 Kirrel3 heterozygous and knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that complete loss of Kirrel3 does not change cell fate or induce cell death of the neurons examined.

To test this, we analyzed MF presynaptic morphology in Kirrel3 wild-type and knockout mice at P14, the peak of MF synaptogenesis. DiI crystals were placed in the DG cell body layer of fixed brains. After 1 week, dye diffuses along DG axons and labels MF presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013G</a>). We discovered Kirrel3 knockout mice have significantly fewer and shorter filopodia than wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013M</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the main bouton area and perimeter are not affected by loss of Kirrel3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J,K</a>). To examine the main synapse in more detail, we analyzed postsynaptic CA3 TE spines by filling CA3 neurons with Alexa568 dye (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N,O</a>). TE spine head density and length are similar between P21 Kirrel3 wild-type and knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P,Q</a>). Thus, Kirrel3 knockout mice have significant morphological defects in MF filopodia but not in pre- or post-synaptic structures of main MF synapses, suggesting that the number of DG synapses onto GABA neurons is reduced in Kirrel3 knockout mice."

Unfortunately, Kirrel3-positive GABA neurons cannot be identified in wild-type mice making it impossible to target them for direct electrophysiological studies at this time. However, reducing DG-GABA synapses in area CA3 is expected to decrease feed-forward inhibition and thereby increase excitation of CA3 neurons after DG stimulation. To test this, we recorded excitatory and inhibitory currents evoked in CA3 neurons after DG stimulation in acute slices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Mice were either removed from the home cage for immediate fixation (no stim) or allowed to explore an enriched environment for 25 min prior to fixation (stim). At this age, basal, unstimulated cFos expression is low regardless of genotype, but with stimulation, P14 knockout mice have a twofold increase in cFos-positive CA3 neurons compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). As a control, mice were recorded and exploration was comparable between genotypes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, the number of cFos-positive neurons did not significantly increase in wild-type mice after stimulation but this is consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib33\">Waters et al., 1997</a>) and likely reflects that at P14 the CA3 is dominated by inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, note wild-type E/I ratio is &lt;1) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Torborg et al., 2010</a>). Because Kirrel3 is expressed by entorhinal cortex axons that innervate the hippocampus, we also generally examined inputs to CA3 and DG neurons by recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). No significant differences between wild-type and Kirrel3 knockout neurons in mEPSC amplitude or frequency were found for either cell type (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To investigate MF synapse maturation under sustained loss of Kirrel3, we analyzed MF morphology in adult (P60\u2013P75) wild-type and knockout mice. Both genotypes have fewer filopodia as adults than at P14 (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), suggesting age-dependent filopodia refinement is Kirrel3-independent. However, while P14 knockout mice have fewer filopodia with a normal main bouton, adult knockout mice have fewer filopodia and a smaller main bouton (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013J</a>). Thus, MF synapse defects worsen with age in Kirrel3 knockout mice. It is possible Kirrel3 is directly required for main bouton maturation or maintenance, but Kirrel3 is not expressed by CA3 neurons. Another possibility is that defects in the main bouton in adult knockout mice result from compensatory mechanisms enacted to dampen the dramatic increase in CA3 neuron excitability during development. To test this, we analyzed cFos expression in adult mice to determine if knockout CA3 neuron activity returns to normal. In support, unstimulated and stimulated cFos expression in CA3 neurons is similar between P60 adult wild-type and knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, our data suggest a model in which a reduction in MF filopodia during development leads to hyper-activation of CA3 neurons that, with time, causes homeostatic mechanisms to decrease the size of the main DG-CA3 MF synapse and return overall CA3 activity levels to a set point. This model remains to be tested in more detail in future studies. Interestingly, a battery of behavioral tests was recently performed on adult Kirrel3 knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Choi et al., 2015</a>). Kirrel3 knockout mice have only mild hyperactivity and a moderate impairment in novel object recognition compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#bib5\">Choi et al., 2015</a>). Our results indicate CA3 neuron activity is significantly impaired in 14-day-old animals but returns to normal by 2 months of age. This may explain why adult Kirrel3 knockout mice have only moderate behavioral impairments and suggests that younger animals may have more severe behavioral problems."

Because Kirrel3 is a homophilic adhesion molecule expressed by DG neurons and calbindin-positive GABA neurons in hippocampal area CA3, our work suggests trans-cellular Kirrel3 interactions may stabilize MF filopodia contact and subsequent synapse formation between Kirrel3-expressing cells. Functionally, we demonstrate Kirrel3 is required to maintain feed-forward inhibition and constrain CA3 neuron activity in young animals. Although a few molecules have been shown to generally affect MF presynapse formation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Danzer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Williams et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lanore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wilke et al., 2012</a>), Kirrel3 is among the first shown to selectively act on MF filopodia and our results provide evidence that main and filopodial MF synapse formation can be uncoupled. The role of calbindin-positive GABA neurons in the hippocampus is little studied, but our findings suggest they may receive a substantial fraction of DG MF input and be a critical component of feed-forward inhibitory circuits regulating CA3 activity."

Our work suggests Kirrel3 loss selectively reduces excitatory synapses made onto inhibitory neurons in hippocampal area CA3. Consequently, CA3 neurons are over-active in young Kirrel3 knockout animals. Altered E/I ratios are hypothesized to underlie neurodevelopmental disorders (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baroncelli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fakhoury, 2015</a>), and our work suggests this may be an important circuit defect of Kirrel3-associated diseases. Interestingly, such a strong imbalance probably would not occur if all synapses were equally impaired. In this way, loss of synaptic specificity molecules can cause widespread circuit dysfunction. There is much evidence that hippocampal circuits are altered in autism and intellectual disabilities, but it is likely not the only brain region affected in these complex neurological disorders (<a href=\"#bib24\">Philip et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zoghbi and Bear, 2012</a>). Kirrel3 is also expressed by specific populations of neurons outside the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lein et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Choi et al., 2015</a>). Thus, Kirrel3 may also regulate formation of other specific types of synapses throughout the brain, which may further contribute to its association with neurodevelopmental disorders."

The authors hypothesize that perturbations of Kirrel3-dependent synapse targeting contributes to intellectual disability, as mutations of Kirrel3 have been associated with neurodevelopment disorders. The studies are well-designed and well-executed. The authors do a good job demonstrating that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, Kirrel3 is a hemophilic adhesion molecule and is present at the onset of synapse development, suggesting a similar role for the molecule in vivo. They provide evidence that other binding partners are not expressed in the same area of the hippocampus. They do a good job using anatomy to narrow their focus to DG and CA3, and provide convincing evidence that the absence of Kirrel3 disrupts the formation of MF filopodia."

In the revised manuscript, we conducted a more thorough and quantitative analysis of the molecular identity of Kirrel3-positive interneurons. Because we still lack a suitable Kirrel3 antibody to routinely identify Kirrel3-expressing cells in wildtype mouse tissue, we conducted our analysis in P14 heterozygous and knockout mice, which have one or two copies respectively of GFP knocked in the Kirrel3 locus. We used GFP to identify Kirrel3-positive cells and made several new discoveries that are detailed in revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>. First, nearly all Kirrel3-positive cells (excluding DG neurons) are in fact GABAergic (over 90%). Second, we included more GABAergic markers and discovered most Kirrel3 GABA neurons (67%) express calbindin-D-28K. A smaller fraction (&lt;20%) is somatostatin positive (the two markers are not always mutually exclusive). There is very little overlap with VIP, parvalbumin, or calretinin. Moreover, \u223c20% of all GABA neurons in area CA3 express Kirrel3. These cell populations are very similar in P14 Kirrel3 heterozygous and knockout mice. This suggests loss of Kirrel3 does not change cell fate or induce cell death of the neurons examined and that wildtype mice likely have similar numbers. The role of calbindin-positive GABA neurons in the hippocampus is little studied but our new results suggest they may receive a substantial portion of DG mossy fiber input and are likely a critical component of feed forward inhibitory circuits that constrain CA3 activity."

We understand this is not an impossible experiment, but we hope the reviewers appreciate it is not trivial and has only been accomplished by a few labs with deep electrophysiology experience. After several months, we obtained some E/I recordings from P40-50 slices, but each time DCG-IV was added to confirm MF axon stimulation the cells were lost. They generally support our conclusion but we excluded them from the manuscript because of our inability to confirm they directly resulted from MF stimulation. Nonetheless, our cFos analysis in adult mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) supports our hypothesis and has led to our working model that will be tested in future studies. We revised the results and discussion to make it clear that the adult compensation effect is still a working model resulting from the many novel findings presented in this Short Report."

Now that we discovered most Kirrel3-GABA neurons express calbindin, we are actively pursuing intersectional viral and transgenic strategies to label Kirrel3-GABA cells in wildtype and knockout mice. However, this is a long-term, on-going project that we hope the reviewers agree is outside the scope of this study."

It tends to be 2-3 times larger than volumes reported by electron microscopy. MF boutons are highly irregular, sometimes hollow, shapes molded to multi-headed thorny excrescence spines. Analyzing these complex shapes by light microscopy in 3D is hampered by the resolution of confocal images in the Z direction and image analysis software tends to recognize these boutons as solid rounded shapes, artificially increasing the volume. In 2D, we can easily draw irregular shapes corresponding to z-projected MF bouton area and perimeter. It is more accurate to model filopodia length in 3D because it requires only quantification of lines. We assume filopodial volumes would also be inaccurate and this was not analyzed. Our values for WT filopodia number and length closely match previously reported values determined by electron microscopy. Regardless, all WT and KO images were similarly analyzed by an experimenter blind to genotype and are comparable."
