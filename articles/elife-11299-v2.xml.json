                    "text": "The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) has been described as signaling either outcome expectancies or value. Previously, we used unblocking to show that lOFC neurons respond to a predictive cue signaling a \u2018valueless\u2019 change in outcome features (McDannald, 2014). However, many lOFC neurons also fired to a cue that simply signaled more reward. Here, we recorded lOFC neurons in a variant of this task in which rats learned about cues that signaled either more (upshift), less (downshift) or the same (blocked) amount of reward. We found that neurons acquired responses specifically to one of the three cues and did not fire to the other two. These results show that, at least early in learning, lOFC neurons fire to valued cues in a way that is more consistent with signaling of the predicted outcome\u2019s features than with signaling of a general, abstract or cached value that is independent of the outcome."

Previously, we used unblocking to show that lOFC neurons respond to a predictive cue signaling a \u2018valueless\u2019 change in outcome features (McDannald, 2014). However, many lOFC neurons also fired to a cue that simply signaled more reward. Here, we recorded lOFC neurons in a variant of this task in which rats learned about cues that signaled either more (upshift), less (downshift) or the same (blocked) amount of reward. We found that neurons acquired responses specifically to one of the three cues and did not fire to the other two. These results show that, at least early in learning, lOFC neurons fire to valued cues in a way that is more consistent with signaling of the predicted outcome\u2019s features than with signaling of a general, abstract or cached value that is independent of the outcome."

Notably, while support for abstract value encoding comes largely from studies employing economic decision-making procedures (<a href=\"#bib41\">Plassmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</a>), it has been suggested that the 'economic' value revealed by these procedures is the same as that underlying well-controlled OFC-dependent behavioral effects such as reinforcer devaluation or sensory preconditioning (<a href=\"#bib38\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>). Notably, in these settings, the role of the OFC (<a href=\"#bib55\">West et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jones et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pickens et al., 2003</a>) cannot be strictly explained by signaling of an abstract or outcome-independent value. Indeed, the behavior that requires OFC reflects a value that is inextricably linked to, or an attribute of, the predicted outcome - the reward in the case of reinforcer devaluation or the primary conditioned stimulus in the case of sensory preconditioning. This implies that OFC allows access to a representation of the outcome through which the value can be inferred or calculated on the fly, at the time the behavior is engaged. Thus, while the aforementioned correlates could reflect the final common calculation, it is equally reasonable that they might reflect the specific associative representations that are activated as part of this calculation. Note this is even true of coding changes with subjective preference (<a href=\"#bib34\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>, supplemental), since the perception of attributes is influenced by valuation or preference (e.g., a nice warm cup of hot chocolate while skiing in the winter versus the same cup at the beach in the summer)."

We did this by pairing a \u2018target\u2019 cue with a rewarding outcome in the presence of a cue that had been previously trained to predict a differently-flavored, but similarly-valued outcome. When this is done, the previously conditioned cue predicts the value that is common to the two outcomes, but does not predict the unique features that distinguish the new outcome (note features are not limited to sensory properties, but might include the outcome timing, location, temperature, size, number, etc.). The target cue acquires associations with the unique features of the new outcome but not with its general value (<a href=\"#bib1\">Burke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rescorla, 1999</a>). Notably such unblocking is dependent on the OFC, whereas value-based unblocking is not (<a href=\"#bib26\">McDannald et al., 2011</a>). In this prior study, we found that OFC neurons responded strongly to this valueless target cue (<a href=\"#bib28\">McDannald et al., 2014</a>). In fact, they responded as strongly to this cue as they did to a control cue that was paired with an additional reward."

After all, if OFC is primarily concerned with representing value or at least with encoding things with biological significance, then why was the neural representation of a cue signaling a valueless change in reward features so similar to the representation of a cue that actually predicted a more valuable reward? Furthermore, we did not find any correlation in the firing of the value-predicting neurons across other cues present in the task that also predicted reward and value. This suggested to us that the neural activity to this cue was likely not only representing value but instead was representing the unique features that led to the value prediction in the case of that cue; e.g., the additional reward."

In this experiment, we have copied the design of the prior study (<a href=\"#bib28\">McDannald et al., 2014</a>), recording OFC neurons during unblocking with two changes. The first change was to replace our reward identity shift with a downward shift in value to directly test whether responses to additional reward in the prior study were related to value, which should be reversed in this condition, or some other aspect of the additional reward, which might be unrelated. The second change was to deliver a single drop of reward rather than multiple drops to minimize differences in features between our reward manipulations. We also shifted the size of the outcome rather than the number because number downshift unblocking results in excitatory behavior while a concentration shift does not (<a href=\"#bib5\">Esber and Holland, 2014</a>). The delay to omitted reward in a number downshift condition reduces the downshift association with the cue. In contrast, in concentration downshift conditions, rats immediately know when they have received a reduced concentration and do not exhibit behavioral excitation. We shifted the size because it is more similar to concentration in terms of when rats learn that they have received the downshifted outcome. This change will enable us to differentiate between the upshifted and downshifted cues behaviorally because the former will lead to excitation and the latter inhibition."

Interestingly, these neurons again exhibited relatively restricted responses, suggesting they were signaling something unique about this manipulation. Furthermore, they were joined by other neural populations that developed similar responses to the cue that predicted less reward and even, to some extent, to the cue that predicted no change in reward. This pattern of activity is not consistent with coding of value <i>independent</i> of outcome features and instead suggests that much of the neural activity in the OFC is tightly linked to the attributes of impending events: value being one such attribute and outcomes being one such event."

One type was a reminder: the initially trained odor was followed by the expected outcome. On the other three trial types (upshift, downshift, blocked), rats were presented with the initially trained odor, followed immediately by one of three novel odors. On blocked trials, the expected medium-sized drop of milk followed the novel odor. This outcome is fully predicted by the initial odor, thus the novel odor should be blocked from acquiring associative significance. On upshift trials, a noticeably larger drop of milk followed the novel odor. Here the value is increased by the additional amount, with minimal changes in features since the reward identity is the same, as is the location and timing of delivery. Thus the novel target odor should enter into associations with the higher value and possibly with the feature of \u2018larger\u2019. On downshift trials, a noticeably smaller drop of milk followed the novel odor. Here the value is decreased by the missing amount, thus the novel odor should enter into associations with the lower value and possibly with the feature of \u2018smaller\u2019. We reasoned that if neurons responding to the upshifted odor cue, apparent value coding neurons in the prior study, were in fact signaling value, then they should show less firing to the blocked cue (which predicts no change in value) and even less to the downshifted cue (which predicts diminished value) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, left). On the other hand, if upshift neurons were signaling the attribute of \u2018larger\u2019, then we might expect them to be tuned to this particular cue, with additional populations showing selectivity to the cues predicting \u2018smaller\u2019 and \u2018no change' (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, right)."

This was evident in the population response, which while highest for the upshifted cue, did not distinguish between the blocked and downshifted cues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Of course, the heterogeneity of response types within such a broad population could obscure a simple value correlate, so next we asked whether a subpopulation of the 60 upshift-responsive neurons might show a linear value correlate. Value-coding was operationally defined as an excitatory response to at least one odor and significantly more activity to the upshift cue than the blocked cue as well as significantly less activity to the downshift cue than the blocked cue. Few neurons exhibited firing that clearly rank ordered the cues according to their value (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2k</a>; 5/60; 8%). Though firing in these neurons did provide a linear value correlate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2p</a>), this proportion was the smallest of the theoretically meaningful patterns that we found and its size was not larger than chance given our analytical approach. We repeated this analysis on all cells regardless of baseline firing rate and without limiting our analysis to odor-responsive cells and found a total of 6 cells, suggesting that our screen had not prevented us from finding value-coding cells."

Indeed this was our largest subgroup. In these cells, we were only able to accurately classify the upshift trial type above chance, and no other trial type, suggesting that these cells only contain information about the upshift cue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2q</a>). Additionally we saw an almost equally large population of neurons that fired similarly to the upshifted and downshifted cues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i</a>; 16/60; 27%). This population was reminiscent of the neurons in our prior study that fired similarly to the two cues predicting changes in the outcome. And finally we found a substantial number of upshift-responsive neurons that were equally responsive to the other two novel odor cues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2j</a>; 10/60; 17%), replicating the finding of salience or novelty encoding in our prior study. Notably, none of these populations showed a relationship between firing to the upshift and downshift cues consistent with value coding across them (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2m-o</a>). Thus, if we disregard the very small number of neurons showing linear coding of value, our results here largely replicated what we observed when unblocking learning by shifting value versus identity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2l</a>). Reducing the feature space by moving to a single bolus of reward and including an explicit bidirectional value shift did not reveal frank value coding in a large proportion of the neurons."

It is not immediately clear why that would be, since rats have been exposed to the different valued rewards in the session, and thus firing in the OFC should scale to reflect the full range that is available (<a href=\"#bib37\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</a>). While this is difficult to rule out, one way to address this is to turn to our alternative account, which is that the firing of these neurons represents the attribute or feature that is predicted by the cue, which is the increase in the size of the reward. If this is what is signaled by these neurons, then one would expect there to be similar populations firing to the cue predicting a decrease in reward size and perhaps to the cue signaling no change. These neurons would not have passed our first screen, since we specifically searched for upshift-responsive neurons. So to capture these, we returned to our original data set and repeated the analysis above, but this time examining firing to the other cues. This approach found cells that exhibited isolated firing to the downshifted cue (n = 16, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a, d, g</a>) and to the blocked cue (n = 16, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b, e, h</a>). These populations were similar to the neurons that showed isolated firing to the upshift cue (n = 19, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c, f, i</a>). The difference in the number of cells that responded to each cue was not significant, chi-squared = 0.353, p = 0.84. In each case, cue-evoked firing developed with training (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3j, k</a>). This impression was confirmed by an ensemble analysis that tested how well these neurons could identify the trial type; this analysis found that classification accuracy by these cells during the odor-sampling period improved significantly from day 1 (n = 20, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3l</a>) to day 2 (n = 29, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3m</a>). Within day 1, classification accuracy was at chance during the odor-sampling period. There was significant correlation between trial number and classification (rho = 0.85, p&lt;0.001) but accuracy did not increase to above chance until day 2, beginning on the first ten-trial window shown and remaining above chance for the majority of trial\u00a0windows. The chance\u00a0decoding in the first day reflects the finding that the responses of these neurons were not stable across these trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3n</a>). Further, high decoding accuracy on the second day suggests that a downstream structure could decode the trial type from these tuned cells. Though the magnitude of the change in firing rate between baseline and the preferred cue is ~2 spikes/second in tuned cells, the high decoding accuracy suggests that the variance in firing plays a significant role in downstream decoding. High decoding accuracy on day 2 suggests that there is low variance in this response, allowing a downstream structure to interpret a relatively small change in firing magnitude."

This change essentially eliminated the blocking of value, without changing any of the other aspects of the task. Accordingly, we found that the rats again showed evidence of learning about the reward predicted by the three cues, spending more time in the fluid well following sampling of the large-predictive odor and less time following sampling of the small-predictive odor, versus the medium-predictive cue, as if expecting more and less reward respectively after sampling these cues (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>)."

This seemed at odds with proposals that the primary or at least a major role of the OFC is to encode the abstract or general value that cues predicting reward acquire (i.e., independent of outcome features). We wondered whether firing to this cue was simply reflecting some unique feature of additional reward (the concept of more, its timing, the unique presence of a third drop) and not the abstract increase in value it represented."

Many prior studies have reported value coding in the OFC (<a href=\"#bib41\">Plassmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McNamee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hare et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Plassmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kahnt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Strait et al., 2014</a>). How do we reconcile our results with these prior reports? A number of possible ways exist to understand this apparent discrepancy. The first is that it represents a species difference. Most of the aforementioned studies have focused on \u2018economic\u2019 value and decision-making. These models are largely applied to humans and monkeys. It is possible that the increased size and complexity of the OFC in primate species has led to the development of this abstract value coding. This is possible, though we believe it is unlikely, since most of the anatomical and functional data across species is roughly similar (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rudebeck and Murray, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wallis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stalnaker, et al., 2015</a>). This is especially true of the importance of the OFC to reinforcer devaluation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gottfried, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Gallagher et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Izquierdo et al., 2004</a>), a function first identified in rodents. To the extent economic value is sensitive to devaluation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Padoa-Schioppa and Schoenbaum, 2015</a>), this suggests that the role of the OFC in contributing to its representation is not unique to primates."

Studies claiming value effects on neural activity in OFC have typically tested in a situation requiring choices between outcomes. This may make value information particularly salient compared to our task where explicit comparisons are not required. We view this as unlikely, since a core requirement of value signaling is automaticity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lebreton et al., 2015</a>). Nevertheless, this does not preclude differences in how this tracked value is represented in neural activity in the OFC. While the OFC may perform the same function between Pavlovian and choice tasks, there may be differences in how each is encoded."

Most of the studies that have identified abstract value correlates in the OFC found them in more medial areas (<a href=\"#bib41\">Plassmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McNamee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hare et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Strait et al., 2014</a>). Further, studies in primates that have tried to distinguish medial versus lateral functions have assigned valuation based functions more to medial areas and functions such as credit assignment and representation of reward identity to more lateral areas (<a href=\"#bib30\">Noonan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2012</a>). It may be that the sort of linear value correlates that we were looking for are to be found in medial OFC. Indeed recent work in humans has shown that OFC represents specific outcome features and that more lateral orbital areas represent those outcomes in a way that is dependent upon prior cues (<a href=\"#bib16\">Klein-Flugge et al., 2013</a>). In this regard, it is worth noting that the lateral part of the OFC is not normally necessary for behaviors in which value independent of outcome features is required. For example, the OFC is not required for simple Pavlovian or instrumental conditioning (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Gallagher et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gremel and Costa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Izquierdo et al., 2004</a>) discrimination learning (<a href=\"#bib13\">Izquierdo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Walton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McDannald et al., 2005</a>), extinction by reward omission (<a href=\"#bib51\">Takahashi et al., 2009</a>), transfer (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</a>), and even perhaps reversal learning (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rudebeck et al., 2013</a>), all of which can be accomplished without reference to specific information about predicted outcomes. Similarly, both blocking and unblocking \u2013 when it can be accounted for by value \u2013 do not require the OFC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Burke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">McDannald et al., 2011</a>). However, the OFC is necessary for superficially similar behaviors (Pavlovian or instrumental responding, discriminations, even learning) when they require knowledge of the outcome features in order to recognize errors or to derive or infer a value (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Gallagher et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gremel and Costa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Izquierdo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">McDannald et al., 2011</a>). This is even true in unblocking, where we have shown that the OFC is required for the development of conditioned responding to a target cue paired with a shift in outcome identity but not to a target cue paired with additional outcome (<a href=\"#bib26\">McDannald et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "A fourth possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between our results and many of these studies lies in the difference in measures. The vast majority of these studies have reported that BOLD signal correlates with abstract value (<a href=\"#bib41\">Plassmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McNamee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hare et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2010</a>). BOLD signal differs from single unit spiking in at least three important ways that are relevant to this question. First, BOLD signal obviously reflects the summed activity of many neurons. Thus it identifies what the global summed processing across a large ensemble is tracking. This might be very different from what is encoded by groups of individual single units. Without knowing more about specific connectivity between neurons within an area, it is impossible to know if one or the other result is more relevant to the function of the area. But at a minimum, this might lead to very different results. The second way these two measures differ is that BOLD signal is more likely to reflect neural processing other than what is output from an area. This is because it reflects energy usage, which is a measure that does not distinguish between local and long distance communication. On the other hand, extracellular recording electrodes are heavily biased to record from large, regular spiking neurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">McCormick et al., 1985</a>), which are likely to be the output neurons, at least of cortical regions. Again this might cause very different signals to be detected using the two methods. Finally the third and related difference between these two measures is that fMRI can be heavily influenced by input to an area (<a href=\"#bib20\">Logothetis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Logothetis and Pfeuffer, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Logothetis and Wandell, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Logothetis, 2008</a>). Again this is because it measures energy usage and thus will be sensitive to the EPSP's (and IPSP's) due to afferent input. Note this is true even if these inputs do not lead to summation and action potential generation at the downstream hillock of a large output neuron (a very energy efficient event). For all these reasons, it is to be expected that fMRI studies and single unit studies may often report divergent findings."

                        "text": "Finally it is worth noting that neuroeconomic value may not be the same sort of value identified in our lexicon as pure, abstract, general or cached (i.e., independent of outcome features). This has been our reading of the original reports (<a href=\"#bib34\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Plassmann et al., 2007</a>). However one of the authors of these studies has suggested more recently that neuroeconomic value is in fact tied closely to and derived from knowledge of the features of the predicted outcome (<a href=\"#bib36\">Padoa-Schioppa and Schoenbaum, 2015</a>). He states unequivocally that the economic value that correlates with firing in the OFC in monkeys is the same value that changes with devaluation and that it is tied inextricably to the identity of the predicted outcome. Indeed devaluation-sensitivity is taken to be an iconic feature of decisions based on economic value (<a href=\"#bib38\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>). Notably, this definition would align our concept of signaling of outcome features with signaling of economic value, since economic value would then be just another attribute of the outcome. Of course, we would not expect it to be shared across outcomes or even necessarily across cues, particularly in a very lightly trained animal such as that in our current study. In this context, we would predict relatively specific representations and relatively little representation of this value across outcomes. This is what we have observed here. It is possible with extended training, such as that in studies reporting large populations of single unit coding value (<a href=\"#bib34\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</a>), that\u00a0the representations generalize as the rewards used become part of a \u2018goods space\u2019 as it is defined in these prior studies. As long as what is being signaled by such activity remains an attribute or feature of the predicted outcome - and sensitive to changes in that feature without further learning - then this would be consistent with our current data."

An odor port was located centrally above a fluid well on a panel in the right wall of each chamber. Above the panel were two lights. To allow rapid delivery of olfactory cues to the odor port, it was connected to an airflow dilution olfactometer. Odors were chosen from compounds obtained from International Flavors and Fragrances (New York, NY). The fluid well was connected to lines controlling the independent delivery of liquid rewards. A computer running a behavioral program written in C++ implemented control of the task. Following implantation with microelectrodes, rats were water deprived by restricting access to 10 min daily. Following two days of water deprivation, rats were shaped, in stages, to hold in the odor port for 1\u00a0s in order to receive a water reward at the well. Each trial started with house light illumination, following which rats had 3 s to enter the odor port. A failure to enter the odor port caused restart of the trial. Rats were required to hold for 1 s in the odor port, and upon exit had 3 s to enter the reward well. Again, failure to hold for 1 s or to make reward well entry within 3 s resulted in restart of the trial. Following shaping, rats were trained until they proficiently responded for the initial odor to receive a medium-sized bolus of a flavored milk solution; this comprised up to 15 sessions, with a maximum of 170 trials per session.

It follows up closely on a paper with an ingenious behavioural manipulation published by the same group in <i>eLife</i> in 2014 (McDannald et al.,) that argued that rat lOFC neuron activity is not easily explained as simply encoding value of a reward outcome but aspects of the association between a stimulus and a reward outcome. Here a further ingenious twist is added by the use of a combination of both upshift and downshift procedures whereby some animals learn that some cues indicate an increase or a decrease in previously experienced reward levels. Some lOFC neurons are preferentially active in response to upshift cues, some to downshift cues, and some to both. Once again the message is that it is difficult to reduce the activity of neurons in this region simple to value encoding."

The argument at the end of the Discussion is, however, difficult to follow and it is very salient because it is the final paragraph of the manuscript and thus seems like the authors' conclusion. It is difficult, for example, to square some of the manuscript's empirical findings with this paragraph. For example, it is difficult to square the prominence of downshift responses reported here in a simple and direct manner with neurons with activity that covaries with value but this seems to be authors' argument."

Given that the value effects that are reported in some previous macaque studies and human neuroimaging studies are not ubiquitous across the ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex doesn't this already mean that are other types of neurons in other parts of the primate ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex some of which may be more similar to the neurons the authors study here? There may be many disadvantages to neuroimaging but one advantage is that it is possible to get a sense of activity across the brain and when an attempt is made to look for both value and cue-outcome association representations in the same study (e.g. Noonan et al., J. Neuroscience, 2011) the results implicate different subdivisions of lOFC and ventromedial prefrontal cortex."

In fact this is one reason why we moved from a number downshift to a size downshift in this experiment. This dichotomy is evident in published work. For example, in Esber and Holland (EJN, 2014), the rats experience concentration and number downshifts. While rats show excitation to the number downshift cue, they do not show excitation to the concentration downshift cue. Dr. Holland\u2019s explanation as we understand it is that excitation may develop in response to a number downshift because the first reward is excitatory; thus, rats go to the well because they will receive the first expected reward. There is a delay before the subsequent reward is omitted, so this has a weaker associative effect on the number downshift cue since several seconds pass between the cue and a reward downshift. However, concentration is not excitatory. When rats first receive a concentration downshifted outcome, they immediately know which outcome they received and that it is worse than the previous outcome. This has a stronger associative effect because there is less delay between the cue and the downshifted outcome. Dr. Holland says that he has found similar effects for changes in size (personal communication); thus the excitatory effect seems to be unique to changes in number of rewards and perhaps only when presented sequentially."

Fluid is dispensed in a fraction of a second, and rats immediately know that they received a smaller outcome. For this reason, we think that size in our design is more like concentration than number based on the immediacy of the outcome following the cue. Consistent with this goal, our rats did not show excitation to the downshifted cue; rather they showed inhibition of behavior \u2013 slower latencies. So we think in our particular case, that this concern does not apply."

Unusually for a rodent neurophysiology study there is a serious attempt to engage with human neuroimaging and macaque neurophysiology data in a sophisticated way. The argument at the end of the Discussion is, however, difficult to follow and it is very salient because it is the final paragraph of the manuscript and thus seems like the authors' conclusion. It is difficult, for example, to square some of the manuscript's empirical findings with this paragraph. For example, it is difficult to square the prominence of downshift responses reported here in a simple and direct manner with neurons with activity that covaries with value but this seems to be authors' argument.</i>"

However, the authors seem to go further and suggest that the neurons they study here and the value neurons reported previously may be one and the same in nature. Given that the value effects that are reported in some previous macaque studies and human neuroimaging studies are not ubiquitous across the ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex doesn't this already mean that are other types of neurons in other parts of the primate ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex some of which may be more similar to the neurons the authors study here? There may be many disadvantages to neuroimaging but one advantage is that it is possible to get a sense of activity across the brain and when an attempt is made to look for both value and cue-outcome association representations in the same study (e.g. Noonan et al., J. Neuroscience, 2011) the results implicate different subdivisions of lOFC and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The section is also little unusual in the way that it attributes views to another author but cites a review written jointly by that person and one of the authors of the current report.

We really only meant to point out that at least one of the proponents of the OFC=value hypothesis \u2013 Camillo Padoa-Schioppa \u2013 has described in writing a definition of value that seems synonymous (to us) with the type of value that would be a specific attribute of the \u201cgoods\u201d. Thus while the data and a how they are described refer to value as independent of the specific features of the learned associations, the writings and the statements this person makes in public are in fact different. In the \u201cdialogue\u201d that we cite, Dr. Padoa-Schioppa in fact states explicitly that the value signaled by OFC neurons is an attribute of the good or outcome. And previously he has written that devaluation is the iconic economic decision\u2026 (we cite both pieces). So we simply wanted to close by pointing out that IF this is what is meant by \u201cneuroeconomic value\u201d, <i>then</i> it is not at odds with our definition or our findings.
