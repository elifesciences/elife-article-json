                    "text": "Bacterial chemotaxis is a paradigm for how environmental signals modulate cellular behavior. Although the network underlying this process has been studied extensively, we do not yet have an end-to-end understanding of chemotaxis. Specifically, how the rotational states of a cell\u2019s flagella cooperatively determine whether the cell \u2018runs\u2019 or \u2018tumbles\u2019 remains poorly characterized. Here, we measure the swimming behavior of individual <i>E. coli</i> cells while simultaneously detecting the rotational states of each flagellum. We find that a simple mathematical expression relates the cell\u2019s run/tumble bias to the number and average rotational state of its flagella. However, due to inter-flagellar correlations, an \u2018effective number\u2019 of flagella\u2014smaller than the actual number\u2014enters into this relation. Data from a chemotaxis mutant and stochastic modeling suggest that fluctuations of the regulator CheY-P are the source of flagellar correlations. A consequence of inter-flagellar correlations is that run/tumble behavior is only weakly dependent on number of flagella."

Although the network underlying this process has been studied extensively, we do not yet have an end-to-end understanding of chemotaxis. Specifically, how the rotational states of a cell\u2019s flagella cooperatively determine whether the cell \u2018runs\u2019 or \u2018tumbles\u2019 remains poorly characterized. Here, we measure the swimming behavior of individual <i>E. coli</i> cells while simultaneously detecting the rotational states of each flagellum. We find that a simple mathematical expression relates the cell\u2019s run/tumble bias to the number and average rotational state of its flagella. However, due to inter-flagellar correlations, an \u2018effective number\u2019 of flagella\u2014smaller than the actual number\u2014enters into this relation. Data from a chemotaxis mutant and stochastic modeling suggest that fluctuations of the regulator CheY-P are the source of flagellar correlations. A consequence of inter-flagellar correlations is that run/tumble behavior is only weakly dependent on number of flagella."

A typical <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell is propelled by a bundle composed of multiple flagella. Each flagellum is controlled by a rotary motor that can switch between clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation. When flagella on a cell rotate CCW, the cell swims along an approximately straight path called a \u2018run\u2019. When some of the flagella rotate CW, the bundle is disrupted causing an abrupt change in direction called a \u2018tumble\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Macnab and Ornston, 1977</a>). <i>E. coli</i> modulates the probability of being in one of these two swimming states in response to its environment, allowing it to navigate chemical, temperature, and light gradients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg and Brown, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berg, 2004</a>). At any point in time, the probability that a flagellar motor rotates CW is determined by the concentration of phosphorylated signaling protein CheY (CheY-P). Coupling CheY phosphorylation to chemicals from the environment allows the cell to bias its random walk and migrate towards more favorable conditions. This biased random walk is called chemotaxis, and serves as a model for understanding how living organisms process information (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg and Brown, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shimizu et al., 2010</a>)."

The relationship between the chemotaxis signaling network and the CCW/CW rotational bias of the individual flagellar motor is now well mapped ([<a href=\"#bib6\">Block et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cluzel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>]; for a review see <a href=\"#bib3\">Berg, 2004</a>), and has also been described using detailed mathematical models (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emonet et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jiang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shimizu et al., 2010</a>). Despite this wealth of knowledge, how the CCW/CW states of individual motors collectively determine the run/tumble swimming behavior of the whole, multi-flagellated cell remains poorly understood. The number of flagella on an individual swimming cell can vary greatly, from one to more than ten (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen-Ben-Lulu et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), yet very few studies are available to indicate how flagellar number affects swimming behavior. The only direct measurements of flagellar dynamics in swimming cells have been limited to short durations (\u223c1 s) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Turner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Darnton et al., 2007</a>). The absence of long-term observations has precluded the development of a detailed mapping between flagellar state and cell swimming behavior. As a result, most theoretical models of bacterial chemotaxis are limited to treating an individual motor, or simply assume that all cells have a single flagellum (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bray et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kalinin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Matthaus et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jiang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Flores et al., 2012</a>).

Using an optical trap to hold a swimming cell (<a href=\"#bib27\">Min et al., 2009</a>) while simultaneously imaging its fluorescently labeled flagella, we relate directly the number and state of each flagellum on a cell to its swimming behavior. Our measurements establish a simple mapping between CCW/CW flagellar rotation and run/tumble bacterial swimming state for cells with arbitrary numbers of flagella. Surprisingly, we find that <i>E. coli</i> cells wild-type for chemotaxis do not strictly comply with the veto model, because the states of individual flagella in the same cell are strongly coupled. Flagella do not switch independently, and as a result, tumbles typically involve many of the flagella on the cell. The behavior of multi-flagellated cells can still be mapped to the simple veto model by renormalizing the flagellar number to a lower effective number of independent flagella. As for the cause of inter-flagella coupling, our data strongly favor a mechanism involving fluctuations of the signaling network rather than direct, physical interactions between flagella. This model is supported by the observation that mutant cells in which flagellar switching is decoupled from the chemotaxis network do obey the simple veto model, as well as by stochastic simulations of the swimming behavior."

The instrument allowed us to measure simultaneously run/tumble behavior and flagellar dynamics in the same cell. The optical trap was used to hold each end of a single cell in place and the light scattered by the cell was utilized to monitor its swimming behavior, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Min et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2012</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), cell runs were identified from oscillatory time signals due to cell body rotation at a frequency of \u223c10 Hz. Cell tumbles were identified as periods of erratic motion during which the flagellar bundle was disrupted (<a href=\"#bib27\">Min et al., 2009</a>). Flagella were fluorescently labeled using the method of <a href=\"#bib39\">Turner et al. (2010)</a>. High speed, epi-fluorescent, stroboscopic imaging (<a href=\"#bib38\">Turner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) was used to resolve individual flagella (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Since the trapped cell remained in the field of view for a prolonged period, flagella were observed through multiple runs and tumbles (typically \u223c5 events), limited by the time until flagella became too dim to discern due to photobleaching (\u223c8 to 40 s). The rotational direction of each flagellum was determined by observing its shape during 100-ms time windows. As shown by <a href=\"#bib13\">Darnton et al. (2007)</a>, flagella may take on different helical waveforms depending on their rotational state. These waveforms, termed \u2018<i>normal</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>semi-coiled</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>curly-1</i>\u2019, and \u2018<i>curly-2</i>\u2019, can be visually identified based on their pitch and wavelength (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). CCW rotating flagella were identified based on the <i>normal</i> conformation, which they have been shown to adopt exclusively (<a href=\"#bib13\">Darnton et al., 2007</a>), while CW rotating flagella were identified by their <i>curly-1</i> or <i>semi-coiled</i> shape. From the identification of CCW and CW intervals, the cell\u2019s mean CW bias was determined by averaging the fraction of time that all the flagella on the cell spent CW (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

The trap signal used to determine runs and tumbles (bottom, scrolling blue curve) measures the position of the cell body in the trap as it rotates. At the beginning of the video (time stamp = 2.4 s), all three flagella are in a bundle and the cell is running. One by one, the flagella switch to CW rotation (2.7\u20133.0 s), which disrupts the bundle and causes the cell to tumble. Flagella can be observed in all three waveforms, <i>normal, semi-coiled,</i> and <i>curly-1</i>.

Specifically, the Sneddon model states that a cell with a minimum of <i>X</i> CCW flagella will run rather than tumble, provided the remaining (<i>N</i><sub><i>flag</i></sub>\u2013<i>X</i>) CW flagella are in the <i>curly-1</i> conformation only (<i>X</i> is a parameter in the model, with possible values in the range [1, <i>N</i><sub><i>flag</i></sub> \u2212 1]).

In agreement with the original observation of <a href=\"#bib38\">Turner et al. (2000)</a>, we found that CW rotation of a single flagellum was indeed sufficient to cause a tumble in multi-flagellated cells (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, samples A, D and E). However, we also observed that more than half of tumbles in multi-flagellated cells (56%, 117/210 events) actually involved multiple CW flagella. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows a representative trace from a wild-type cell with three flagella. There are times during each tumble in the trace where all three flagella are in a CW state. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, the number of CW flagella \u2018participating\u2019 in a tumble (black circles) was significantly larger than would be expected if flagella were independently switching (gray dashed line, obtained from simulations of a cell with independent flagella; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Our results thus suggest that while a single CW flagellum is sufficient to induce a tumble (in agreement with a simple veto model), flagella are also coupled and may thus switch in groups, in a correlated fashion. Further evidence for inter-flagella coupling was obtained by calculating the cross-correlation between pairs of flagella on a given cell. We found a significant correlation between the rotational directions of pairs of flagella on the same cell (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, black data points). This correlation persisted for \u223c1 s, the average duration of a tumble. Our findings are consistent with previous observations by Terasawa et al. on surface-immobilized cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Terasawa et al., 2011</a>). There, correlations between individual motors on the same cell were detected by monitoring beads attached to flagellar stubs, as opposed to complete flagella on swimming cells in our present work."

Terasawa et al. observed that mutant cells, in which the concentration of CheY-P was decoupled from the chemotaxis network, displayed no correlations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Terasawa et al., 2011</a>). This led us to likewise investigate the behavior of a strain, PM87, expressing a constitutively-active CheY (CheY<sup>D13K</sup> [<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon et al., 1998</a>], denoted CheY*, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>). The protein was exogenously expressed, with the expression level chosen such that the population-averaged tumble bias matched that of wild-type cells (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A representative trace from a CheY* cell with three flagella is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> (see also <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Upon inspection, flagellar switching appears far less correlated than in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, compare black and gray data points). Comparing 54 wild-type and 24 CheY* cells with the same mean CW biases (0.11 \u00b1 0.07 vs 0.11 \u00b1 0.07, mean \u00b1 SD) we found that, on average, fewer CW rotating flagella participated in tumbles in the CheY* strain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, open circles). Moreover, the number of participating flagella in the CheY* strain closely matched the expectation for cells with independently switching flagella (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, dashed line). (This number deviates from unity and trends upwards with number of flagella simply because of the finite probability that two tumbles overlap by chance.) Our results indicate that when the signal for flagellar motors to switch their rotational state is decoupled from the chemotaxis network, the motors switch independently. Based on our interpretation of the wild-type data, we thus expect CheY* cells to adhere to the simple veto model. As shown in the plot of <i>\u03b7</i> in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> (open circles), CheY* cells indeed match the veto model closely (<i>\u03b7</i> = \u22120.08 \u00b1 0.15, mean \u00b1 SEM). The existence of correlations between flagella states in wild-type cells may thus explain why cells with multiple flagella deviate from the veto model."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> (solid lines), using the flagellar number as a fitting parameter (now denoted <i>N</i><sub><i>eff</i></sub>) indeed allows for a good match for the wild-type data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85). In this revised equation, <i>N</i><sub><i>eff</i></sub> can be thought of as the \u2018effective\u2019 number of independent flagella on a cell, which captures the fact that flagella in wild-type cells switch in a correlated manner. Consistent with this picture, the effective number of flagella <i>N</i><sub><i>eff</i></sub> is consistently smaller than the actual flagellar number <i>N</i><sub><i>flag</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, black circles; <i>N</i><sub><i>eff</i></sub> can be approximated by <i>N</i><sub><i>eff</i></sub> = 1.27 \u00d7 <i>N</i><sub><i>flag</i></sub><sup>0.5</sup>, see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

What is the source of these flagellar correlations? The absence of correlations in the CheY* strain and its adherence to a simple veto model provide an important clue to understanding the mechanism of inter-flagellar coupling. In wild-type cells, CheY-P levels are subject to phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation reactions by chemotaxis network components and are believed to fluctuate in time (<a href=\"#bib23\">Korobkova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sneddon et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, in the mutant strain, CheY* levels are decoupled from the network and are thus expected to be constant over the timescales of interest (<a href=\"#bib23\">Korobkova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Min et al., 2009</a>). Terasawa et al. proposed that fluctuations in CheY-P levels may thus provide a mechanism by which the CW biases of multiple flagella on a cell can be coupled (<a href=\"#bib36\">Terasawa et al., 2011</a>). To test whether such a mechanism could account for the different features of bacterial swimming observed in our study, we performed simulations of whole-cell swimming driven by the chemotaxis network. In particular, we investigated how fluctuations in CheY-P concentration could produce differences in inter-flagellar correlations between wild-type and CheY* cells and consequent differences in their respective mappings of CW bias to tumble bias."

For wild-type cells, we incorporated fluctuations in CheY-P concentration using the approach of <a href=\"#bib33\">Sneddon et al. (2012)</a>. The model was constrained using transition rates between flagella waveforms that were directly extracted from our experiments (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Tables 3 and 4</a>). We found that, consistently, simulations with CheY-P fluctuations were able to duplicate the observed wild-type behavior, while simulations without fluctuations matched CheY* data and the predictions of the \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 veto model. Specifically, using only two parameters\u2014the amplitude and the characteristic timescale for CheY-P fluctuations (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)\u2014as fitting parameters, our simulations simultaneously reproduced (i) the relation between flagellar number and flagellar participation in tumbles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>); (ii) temporal correlations between flagella (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>); (iii) the effective number of flagella in multi-flagellated wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>); and (iv) the degree of deviation from the veto model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

By imaging many individual tumbles (<i>N</i> = 203 in wild-type cells), we are able to describe in great detail the underlying structure of a tumbling event. For instance, we can follow the sequence of flagellar waveforms that occurs when motors switch from CCW to CW rotation and back to CCW. <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> shows the distribution of possible sequences of flagellar waveforms during tumbles. In particular, the sequence of states from <i>normal</i> to <i>semi-coiled</i> to <i>curly-1</i> that we observed was described by <a href=\"#bib13\">Darnton et al. (2007)</a> as a \u2018canonical tumble\u2019. Although we cannot rule out that runs and tumbles in the optical trap are different in some ways than those in free swimming cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Min et al., 2009</a>), our results are in qualitative agreement with these previous observations."

In a multi-flagellated wild-type cell, a single CW flagellum (either <i>semi-coiled</i> or <i>curly-1</i>) is sufficient to induce a tumble, in agreement with the simple veto model (<a href=\"#bib38\">Turner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Darnton et al., 2007</a>). However, the number of CW flagella during a tumble typically exceeds that expected from a cell with independently switching flagella (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The high fraction of CW flagella during tumbles in wild-type cells is in qualitative agreement with previous measurements by <a href=\"#bib38\">Turner et al. (2000)</a>, who observed that a majority of tumbles involved multiple flagella leaving the bundle. Our measurements using the CheY* strain provide an important piece of evidence linking inter-flagellar coupling to the chemotaxis network. We propose that fluctuations in the concentration of CheY-P are at the heart of wild-type <i>E. coli</i> behavior. In our theoretical analysis, the existence of temporal fluctuations was sufficient to explain all of our data. Stochastic simulations with and without CheY-P fluctuations (representing wild-type and CheY* cells, respectively) reproduced all of the observed differences between our two strains. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> summarizes how CheY-P fluctuations could lead to correlated flagellar switching. A well-known feature of the chemotaxis network is the sigmoidal relation between CW bias and CheY-P concentration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cluzel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Yuan and Berg, 2013</a>). A consequence of this non-linearity is that the probability of CW rotation is highly sensitive, and can respond dramatically to fluctuations in CheY-P levels, provided their amplitude is sufficiently large. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, when CheY-P concentration is high, the cell experiences a near-100% probability of CW rotation and multiple motors switch CW at approximately the same time. In contrast, when CheY-P concentration is low, the probability of any motor rotating CW is essentially zero. This mechanism can explain the elevated number of CW flagella involved in tumbles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and correlation between flagella states (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). By contrast, in simulations where CheY-P level was held constant, flagellar switching was not as correlated and the majority of tumbles involved only a single CW flagellum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

Fluctuations in CheY-P have been inferred from experimental observations of CW bias in tethered-bead assays (<a href=\"#bib22\">Korobkova et al., 2004</a>). However, the fluctuations described in that study are different in their time scale and amplitude from what we found required to produce the observed correlations in flagellar rotational direction (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Future investigation will be essential to resolving this issue and will likely have to involve direct measurements of CheY-P temporal dynamics in individual cells. Such measurements are challenging, but the development of intra-cellular fluorescence sensors for kinase activity in the network (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</a>) provides a promising approach."

(2011)</a> (and in the present work), <a href=\"#bib18\">Hu and Tu (2013)</a> proposed that hydrodynamic interactions between nearby flagella could also generate correlations in their rotational direction. One consequence of their model is that the flagellar switching rates in a cell with a single flagellum will be different than those in multi-flagellated cells. However, this prediction is not borne out by our data. In our experiments, the number of flagella per cell did not have a significant effect on the switching rates between CCW and CW states, nor on the switching rates between different flagellar waveforms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). While we cannot rule out the presence of hydrodynamic interactions between flagella, these must satisfy the strict requirement that switching rates remain independent of flagellar number. In light of these constraints, we believe a mechanism in which chemotaxis network fluctuations engender inter-flagella correlations to be more plausible. For cells with <i>N</i><sub><i>flag</i></sub> &gt; 4, we note that both strains appear to deviate from the generalized veto model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). It is possible that hydrodynamic effects must be taken in consideration in cells with many flagella. Hydrodynamic coupling in the Hu model leads to a lower <i>N</i><sub><i>eff</i></sub>, in the direction of the deviation. Alternatively, a mechanism as described by <a href=\"#bib33\">Sneddon et al. (2012)</a>, in which cells with many flagella can run while some of its flagella rotate CW in the <i>curly-1</i> state, could lead to a similar deviation (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Finally, we must consider the possibility that the apparent deviation is due to systematic experimental error, since it is more difficult to determine visually the state of each flagellum on cells with many flagella."

We hypothesize that this phenomenon may confer evolutionary advantages, in light of the large fluctuations in flagellar numbers within a cell population (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). If cells with many flagella did not behave like cells with fewer flagella, then they would spend the majority of their time tumbling, a behavior that would inhibit chemotaxis. <i>E. coli</i> thus appears to have developed a mechanism to achieve similar tumble biases with a wide range of flagellar number."

The instrument design is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. The optical trap was constructed following a previously described design (<a href=\"#bib12\">Comstock et al., 2011</a>). A 5-W, 1064-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (BL-106C, Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, California) was used to produce two optical traps via timesharing, by intermittently deflecting the laser with an acousto-optic deflector, AOD (DTD-274HD6, IntraAction, Bellwood, Illinois). The separation between the two traps was controlled by modulating the two deflection angles of the beams emanating from the acousto-optic deflector via the RF signal frequency driving the AOD. The IR beams were tightly focused to generate two optical traps by a 60\u00d7, water-immersion (1.2 NA) microscope objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). An identical objective lens collected transmitted light for position detection and bright-field imaging, as described in <a href=\"#bib27\">Min et al. (2009)</a>. The flow chamber was positioned between the two objective lenses and was moveable relative to the two traps in all directions by a motorized three-axis translational stage (ESP301; Newport, Irvine, California). Cell motion was detected directly by the optical traps themselves, using back-focal plane interferometry, in which trap light scattered by an object relays the object\u2019s position relative to the trap in all three directions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gittes and Schmidt, 1998</a>). All devices and timing were controlled using custom LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, Texas) code (<a href=\"#bib12\">Comstock et al., 2011</a>)."

The beam size at the sample plane was approximately 20 microns in diameter. To obtain clear images of the flagella as they rotated at angular frequencies \u223c100 Hz, it was necessary to take short exposures (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To this end, we used stroboscopic illumination similarly to previous experiments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Darnton et al., 2007</a>). This was achieved by intermittently deflecting the 532-nm laser beam with a second acousto-optic modulator (AOM-802AF1, IntraAction), so as to generate short-duration excitation pulses (20 \u00b5s). The EMCCD recorded 128 \u00d7 128-pixel images (\u223c10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m) synchronized with each excitation pulse (see timing in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, images <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Additionally, we pulsed the IR trapping laser out of phase with the fluorescence excitation at a rate of 16 kHz, a technique which has been shown to significantly reduce photo-bleaching, with minimal consequence to the trapping (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Comstock et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The results were high speed movies showing sharp images of all the flagella on a cell as it runs and tumbles for many seconds (typically &gt;10 s), along with synchronous signal traces from the optical traps. Fluorescence movies were saved using Solis software (Andor), and subsequently analyzed manually using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts). When played back in slow-motion, flagella could be reliably counted by eye during tumbles."

The flow channel pattern was cut out from Nescofilm (Karlan, Phoenix, Arizona) using a laser engraver (Versa Laser, Scottsdale, Arizona) and placed between two coverslips, one of which had custom-drilled holes (0.05-inch diameter) for inlets and outlets. The Nescofilm flow channel pattern was bonded to coverslips by melting on a hot plate for 4 min. The completed flow chamber was inserted into a custom metal frame where inlet and outlet tubing (ABW00001; Tygon, Saint-Gobain, Paris, France) were screwed on for a tight seal. The two channels of the flow chamber were continuously injected with appropriate buffers using a syringe pump (PHD2000; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts) at a linear speed of 30 \u03bcm/s, which is approximately equal to the swimming speed of a healthy cell. The upper channel was injected with TMB (see above), while the bottom channel contained cells in TMB. Cells were trapped in the bottom channel and then moved into the upper channel for observation by displacing the motorized flow chamber relative to the traps."
