TGF\u03b2 superfamily signaling is an inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, with elevated activity in aged skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, we find reduced expression of <i>Smad4</i>, the downstream cofactor for canonical TGF\u03b2 superfamily signaling, and the target <i>Id1</i> in aged SCs and MPs during regeneration. Specific deletion of Smad4 in adult mouse SCs led to increased propensity for terminal myogenic commitment connected to impaired proliferative potential. Furthermore, SC-specific Smad4 disruption compromised adult skeletal muscle regeneration. Finally, loss of Smad4 in aged SCs did not promote aged skeletal muscle regeneration. Therefore, SC-specific reduction of Smad4 is a feature of aged regenerating skeletal muscle and Smad4 is a critical regulator of SC and MP amplification during skeletal muscle regeneration."

TGF\u03b2 superfamily signaling is an inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, with elevated activity in aged skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, we find reduced expression of <i>Smad4</i>, the downstream cofactor for canonical TGF\u03b2 superfamily signaling, and the target <i>Id1</i> in aged SCs and MPs during regeneration. Specific deletion of Smad4 in adult mouse SCs led to increased propensity for terminal myogenic commitment connected to impaired proliferative potential. Furthermore, SC-specific Smad4 disruption compromised adult skeletal muscle regeneration. Finally, loss of Smad4 in aged SCs did not promote aged skeletal muscle regeneration. Therefore, SC-specific reduction of Smad4 is a feature of aged regenerating skeletal muscle and Smad4 is a critical regulator of SC and MP amplification during skeletal muscle regeneration."

Genetic studies utilizing lineage labeling, as well as cell ablation, have established that <i>Pax7</i>-expressing SCs are essential for various aspects of skeletal muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib37\">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). At homeostasis, SCs reside in a quiescent state at the interface between skeletal muscle fibers (myofibers) and the surrounding basal lamina (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brack et al., 2012</a>). In response to degenerative stimuli, SCs activate and undergo proliferative expansion, providing myogenic progenitors (MPs) necessary for myofiber regeneration (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brack et al., 2012</a>). Skeletal muscle regeneration requires a balance between SC/MP amplification and terminal myogenic commitment in order to efficiently form multinucleated myofibers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brack et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, there is evidence that this balance is compromised in aging skeletal muscle, where changes in SC function and their surrounding environment occur, yielding defective progenitors and stem cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sousa-Victor et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Almada and Wagers, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blau et al., 2015</a>).

Superfamily ligands include TGF\u03b2s, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), Activins, and Myostatin. These ligands bind to transmembrane type II receptors with differing specificities. This association leads to the eventual formation of transmembrane complexes composed of type I (activin-like kinases, ALKs) and type II receptor homodimers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Massagu\u00e9, 2008</a>). The formation of these complexes triggers the phosphorylation of receptor SMADs (R-SMADs). The R-SMADs associated with TGF\u03b2/Activin/Inhibin and BMP ligands are SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 respectively. Phosphorylated R-SMADs, associated with the cofactor SMAD4, accumulate in the nucleus, where together with chromatin modifiers and other transcriptional co-factors they promote the expression of target genes. Depending on cell type and context, the TGF\u03b2 superfamily pathways regulate many cellular processes including differentiation, renewal, quiescence, and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Massagu\u00e9, 2012</a>). In aged regenerating skeletal muscle, TGF\u03b2 superfamily signaling is widely considered to be abnormally elevated, and is thought to inhibit SC activation and terminal myogenic differentiation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kollias and McDermott, 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Trendelenburg et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2009</a>). However, it has also been proposed that during regeneration TGF\u03b2 superfamily ligands may enable SC and MP expansion (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ono et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sinha et al., 2014</a>)."

Loss-of-function <i>SMAD4</i> mutations lead to familial juvenile polyposis, which can be associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and aggressive forms of various cancers (<a href=\"#bib26\">Malkoski and Wang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akhurst, 2004</a>). In myogenic culture systems derived from immortalized cell lines or using sequential pre-plate techniques, knockdown of Smad4 promotes myogenic differentiation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ono et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, global reduction of expression through direct intramuscular injection of Smad4 siRNAs or viral vectors with Smad4 shRNAs into injured mouse skeletal muscle can promote the formation of larger regenerated muscle fibers relative to controls (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). However, given that multiple non-myogenic cell types, such as inflammatory cells and fibro/adipogenic progenitors, also contribute to SC and MP fate decisions during skeletal muscle regeneration; It is unclear which cellular mechanisms promote hypertrophy of regenerated myofibers with non-targeted Smad4 loss. In contrast, specific loss of Smad4 in MPs compromises myogenic differentiation during embryonic skeletal muscle development (<a href=\"#bib18\">Han et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, consistent with the critical role for Smad4 in stem and progenitor cell function, targeted deletion of Smad4 in hematopoietic, hair follicle, and neural stem and derived progenitor cell populations leads to their depletion during homeostasis and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib21\">Karlsson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mira et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, targeted loss of Smad4 in myofibers leads to modest deterioration during growth and aggravation of denervation-induced atrophy in adults (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sartori et al., 2013</a>). Recently, gain-of-function <i>SMAD4</i> mutations that prevent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation have been identified as the cause of the rare developmental disorder Myhre syndrome in humans (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caputo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Le Goff et al., 2012</a>). Patients with Myhre syndrome are characterized by short stature, various musculoskeletal abnormalities, and hypertrophied musculature (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caputo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Le Goff et al., 2012</a>). Although Smad4 clearly has crucial roles in skeletal muscle and tissue-specific stem and progenitor cell biology, to date no studies have explicitly examined whether or not there is a cell-autonomous requirement for Smad4 in SCs and derived MPs during skeletal muscle regeneration."

These factors include impaired activation, premature terminal fate commitment, and the occurrence of senescence and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sousa-Victor et al., 2015</a>). Since SMAD-dependent signaling and target genes such as <i>Id1</i> have been implicated in the regulation of the terminal fate and amplification of SC and MP populations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ono et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clever et al., 2010</a>), we examined the expression of <i>Smad4</i> and <i>Id1</i> in SCs and MPs from regenerating adult and aged skeletal muscles. Initially, we employed previously characterized flow cytometric analysis to examine age-related modification of SMAD4 protein levels in SCs and MPs (Lin-, Sca1-, ITGA7+) isolated from adult and aged, uninjured and regenerating skeletal muscle. Regenerating muscle was examined at five days post injury (5dpi), a time point when new myofibers are rapidly forming through the expansion, differentiation, and fusion of SC-derived myogenic cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Murphy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cosgrove et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernet et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-Prat et al., 2016</a>). To induce skeletal muscle regeneration, a barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) solution was directly injected into tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, which is an established model of skeletal muscle degeneration and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib31\">Murphy et al., 2011</a>). Relative to SCs from adult uninjured TAs, an approximately 2.5-fold increase in SMAD4 protein was observed in SCs and MPs isolated from adult 5dpi TA muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and C</a>). In contrast, SMAD4 induction was not detected in SCs and MPs isolated from aged 5dpi relative to uninjured TA muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>). To further substantiate these findings, we conducted RTqPCR analysis of <i>Smad4</i> expression as well as the SMAD-target <i>Id1,</i> the loss of which is associated with deficiencies in skeletal muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clever et al., 2010</a>). Both <i>Smad4</i> and <i>Id1</i> expression were higher in SCs and MPs from adult when compared to those from aged 5dpi TAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>). We were unable to obtain consistent Ct values in the detectable range (&lt;36) for <i>Smad4</i> or <i>Id1</i> in SCs from uninjured skeletal muscle indicative of low to negligible expression (data not shown). Therefore, a feature of age-related regenerative decline is the loss of Smad4 induction in SCs and MPs."

To characterize Smad4 loss in <i>Pax7<sup>+/CreERT</sup>; Smad4<sup>flox/flox</sup></i> (P7:S4KO) and <i>Pax7<sup>+/+</sup>; Smad4<sup>flox/flox</sup></i> (Ctl) animals, adult mice were administered tamoxifen (Tmx), SCs and MPs from 5dpi TAs were prospectively isolated, and the expression of <i>Smad4</i> and the SMAD-target <i>Id1</i> were interrogated (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As a validation of successful deletion, flow cytometric analysis revealed that SMAD4 protein induction fails to occur in P7:S4KO SCs from 5dpi relative to uninjured skeletal muscles in comparison to the induction seen in Ctl muscles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A,B\u00a0and\u00a0C</a>). As expected, we also observed a reduction in <i>Smad4</i> and <i>Id1</i> mRNA levels in P7:S4KO when compared to Ctl SCs and MPs from 5dpi TAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>). We have also previously demonstrated a very high efficiency of <i>Pax7<sup>CreERT\u00a0</sup></i>recombination in adult SCs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, both Smad4 expression and function are efficiently lost in P7:S4KO SCs and MPs."

To examine the terminal myogenic fate decisions of Smad4-deficient SCs, FACs-purified adult P7:S4KO and Ctl SCs and MPs were cultured for 96 hr in plating media (10% horse serum, FGF2, DMEM), and supplemented with vehicle, TGF\u03b21, or BMP4 ligands (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zammit et al., 2004</a>). Based on immunofluorescence analysis, all cells regardless of genotype or supplementation were labeled by either Pax7 (SC renewal marker) or Myogenin (terminal myogenic commitment marker) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consistent with previous reports, both TGF\u03b21 and BMP4 supplementation led to a lower proportion of Ctl SC-derived cells that were Myogenin-positive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ono et al., 2011</a>). Notably, cultures derived from P7:S4KO SCs contained a significantly lower proportion of Pax7+ cells; However, we observed a higher proportion of Myogenin+ cells compared to Ctl, regardless of supplementation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). We subsequently tested whether the enhanced terminal myogenic commitment observed in P7:S4KO cultures was associated with greater myogenic fusion and formation of immature multinucleated muscle fibers (myotubes). To achieve this, SCs were cultured at high density (10,000 cells/well) to ensure adequate numbers of fusion-competent MPs. Cultures were then immunostained with pan anti-skeletal muscle myosin antibody to visualize myotubes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In accordance with an increased propensity to differentiate, quantification of nuclei within skeletal muscle myosin-expressing cells (fusion index) revealed this parameter to be\u00a0~two fold greater in P7:S4KO compared to Ctl myotubes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

Additionally, we examined the expression of cell cycle inhibitors <i>Cdkn1a</i> (p21), <i>Cdkn1b</i> (p27), and <i>Cdkn2a</i> (p16). No induction in the expression of cell cycle inhibitors was observed in adult P7:S4KO SCs and MPs isolated by FACs from 5dpi TAs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between P7:S4KO and Ctl SC number in uninjured TAs 21 days after Tmx treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, the loss of SCs in P7:S4KO 5dpi TAs does not reflect initial declines in Pax7+ SCs upon recombination at homeostasis."

Furthermore, non-specific knockdown of Smad4 through siRNAs or viral delivery of shRNAs to regenerating aged skeletal muscle promotes myofiber hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, we sought to examine whether specific disruption of Smad4 in aged SCs could promote aged skeletal muscle regeneration, presumably in an environment of high TGF\u03b2 ligand activity, suggesting that the implications of signaling loss could differ from results observed in adult mice. To test this hypothesis, P7:S4KO and Ctl mice were aged to 22 months and treated with Tmx. Thereafter, a TA muscle was degenerated with intramuscular injection of BaCl<sub>2</sub>, and subsequently allowed to regenerate for five days. In accordance with Smad4 disruption in adult mice, expression of <i>Smad4</i> and the SMAD-target <i>Id1</i> was reduced in FACs-isolated SCs and MPs from aged P7:S4KO 5dpi TAs, validating efficient and similar Cre-mediated Smad4 deletion at both ages (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). As described elsewhere, aged SCs displayed elevated expression of <i>Cdkn2a</i> (p16), however the extent of increased expression did not differ in response to Smad4 disruption (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernet et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cosgrove et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carlson et al., 2008</a>).

Furthermore, we demonstrate that in an inducible mouse model driving specific loss of Smad4 in SCs, a decline in the number of proliferating Pax7+ SCs and MPs, and consequently severe deficits in skeletal muscle regeneration are experienced regardless of age. Several studies have specifically manipulated components of TGF\u03b2 superfamily signaling in myogenic progenitors and SCs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guardiola et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). However, until now, no reports have examined the cell-autonomous roles of Smad4, the common cofactor for all branches of canonical TGF\u03b2 superfamily signaling, in adult or aged Pax7+ SCs and determined the subsequent consequences on skeletal muscle regeneration."

However, declines in proliferating SCs and MPs during regeneration were also observed. Myofibers are multinucleated cells formed by the fusion of many terminally committed myogenic cells. Therefore, the progression to the formation of mature multinucleated myofibers can be impeded at multiple levels, including impaired myogenic differentiation and/or reduced MP amplification through a variety of mechanisms: inhibition of cell cycle entry, cell death, and/or premature terminal commitment (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sousa-Victor et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brack et al., 2012</a>). Given that we have detected differences in myogenic cell proliferation with no increased cell death or cell cycle inhibitor expression, we suspect that the reduced number of MPs in regenerating skeletal muscles following acute SC-specific Smad4 loss is likely due to a heightened propensity for terminal commitment. In contrast, specific disruption of Smad4 in embryonic mouse MPs, driven by <i>Myf5-Cre</i>, altered terminal myogenic commitment and myofiber formation in the tongue (<a href=\"#bib18\">Han et al., 2012</a>). Intuitively, these divergent results could reflect differences in the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate SCs and MPs in response to the environments of embryonic tongue growth versus adult TA regeneration. Another possibility is that the <i>Myf5-Cre</i>, in addition to targeting the myogenic lineage, drives recombination in further resident cell populations with the capacity to directly or indirectly influence skeletal muscle growth and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib19\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). It will be of interest to determine in what manner specific disruption of Smad4 in other resident non-myogenic cell populations may influence adult or aged skeletal muscle regeneration. Although in adult Smad4 null SC cultures we observed reductions in <i>Fgf6</i> and <i>Fgfr4</i> expression similar to embryonic Smad4 deleted muscle, we also detected a robust induction of <i>Fgf2</i>. We have previously found that the presence of elevated levels of FGF2 in aged skeletal muscle is associated with a propensity for aged SCs to progress toward terminal fates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, compensatory induction of FGF2 resulting from Smad4 loss may be a unique feature of adult SCs that drives terminal myogenic commitment, the mechanisms of which will require further investigation."

Furthermore, Id1, which we found to be reduced in aged wildtype and adult P7:S4KO SCs and derived MPs, was identified as a SMAD target required for SC and MP amplification (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ono et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, through direct interactions Id1 can also promote Myogenin degradation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vinals and Ventura, 2004</a>). Therefore, loss of Id1 in aged and P7:S4KO SCs and MPs during regeneration could potentially stabilize Myogenin and thus promote excessive terminal commitment that impedes myogenic cell amplification. Although we observe loss of <i>Smad4</i> and <i>Id1</i> expression, some reports have described the presence of elevated TGF\u03b2 and phospho-Smad activity in aged SCs and MPs from regenerating skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carlson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pessina et al., 2015</a>). Although less characterized, TGF\u03b2 can function through non-canonical Smad4-independent pathways (<a href=\"#bib13\">Derynck and Zhang, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Massagu\u00e9, 2012</a>). For instance, pSmad3, which is elevated in aged SCs and MPs, also associates with Drosha in a Smad4-independent complex required for microRNA processing (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis et al., 2008</a>). Studies examining keratinocyte differentiation have shown I\u03ba\u03b2 kinase to be a critical regulator of signaling through Smad2/3 that is Smad4-independent (<a href=\"#bib14\">Descargues et al., 2008</a>). Non-canonical TGF\u03b2 mediators such as TAK1 (TGF\u03b2 activated kinase 1) and the downstream target p38 are both shown to be elevated in aged myogenic cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cosgrove et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernet et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Trendelenburg et al., 2012</a>). Notably, heightened p38 activity in aged SCs hinders myogenic cell amplification through mechanisms that include promotion of terminal myogenic commitment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cosgrove et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernet et al., 2014</a>). Collectively, it will be critical to determine if loss of Smad4 in aged and P7:S4KO SCs and MPs could impair myogenic cell amplification through promotion of multiple Smad4-independent pathways."

For example, it has been shown that SC-specific loss of Cripto, an inhibitor of Activin, Myostatin, and TGF\u03b2 signaling in myogenic cells, leads to smaller regenerated myofibers (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guardiola et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, genetic ablation of the BMP receptor <i>Alk3</i> in embryonic myogenic cells, utilizing <i>MyoD-Cre</i> and <i>Myf5-Cre</i> mice, was found to result in ineffective adult skeletal muscle regeneration, however this occurs primarily through mechanisms other than major dysfunction within the SC pool (<a href=\"#bib19\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). This conclusion was based primarily on the lack of observable depletion or dysfunction of <i>Alk3</i> null SCs in vivo or in culture, respectively, which is thought to occur due to stimulation of the expression of the related <i>Alk6</i> as a compensatory mechanism to maintain SC function (<a href=\"#bib19\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). In this study, we determined that inducible <i>Pax7</i>-driven loss of Smad4 impedes SC-derived myogenic proliferation and proper skeletal muscle regeneration. Further studies will be needed to determine in what way targeted disruption of Alk3, induced later in life, in adult or aged SCs may affect skeletal muscle regeneration at these ages, with potential compensation possibly being eliminated."

Furthermore, utilizing miR-26 disruption to increase, and miR-431 mimics to decrease, <i>Smad4</i> expression at later timeponts during regeneration promotes myofiber atrophy and hypertrophy respectively (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). However, it is intuitive that since microRNAs often target many genes, the aforementioned manipulations likely do not alter <i>Smad4</i> expression alone. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the balance between myogenic progenitor expansion and terminal fate commitment could be manipulated to be beneficial to adult and aged muscle if cell-specific Smad4 loss was induced at different timepoints during regeneration or by alternative, more transient, means."

Muscle sections were fixed for 3 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and if needed, subjected to antigen retrieval: incubation in citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0) in a steamer (Oster #5712) for 15 min after 10 min preheating of buffer (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Tissue sections were permeabilized with PBS-T (0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 min and blocked in 10% Normal Goat Serum (NGS; Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) in PBS-T for 30 min at room temperature. When mouse primary antibodies were used, sections were additionally blocked in 3% AffiniPure Fab fragment goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research) with 2% NGS in PBS at room temperature for 1 hr. Primary antibody incubation in 2% NGS/PBS was carried out at 4\u00b0C overnight or 2 hr at RT and sections were incubated with secondary antibodies in 2% NGS/PBS for 1 hr at RT. DAPI staining was used to label nuclei. All slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech,\u00a0Birmingham,\u00a0AL). At least four sections from three slides were analyzed per sample. Immunocytochemistry was performed following the same protocol with the exception of the Fab blocking step. Sections and cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer A.1 microscope\u00a0(Germany)."

Regenerated skeletal muscles harvested 14 days after injury were processed for H and E or Sirius Red staining. For H and E, flash-frozen sections were fixed for 3 min in 4% PFA, stained with Mayers Hematoxylin and Alcoholic Eosin Y, dehydrated, equilibrated with xylene and mounted using Cytoseal 60 (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). For Sirius Red staining, a Picrosirius Red stain kit (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) was utilized. Frozen sections were fixed for 1 hr at 56\u00b0C in Bouin\u2019s fixative, washed in water, stained for 1 hr in Picrosirius Red, washed in 1 M HCl, dehydrated, equilibrated and mounted. Bright-field images were collected with a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope. To obtain quantification of average cross-sectional area and frequency distribution of 14dpi regenerated fiber size, Myosin/Laminin immunostained TA sections were analyzed using ImageJ software."

The authors show that SMAD4 is normally induced during muscle repair in young adults, and furthermore, using well-established lineage-specific, inducible CreER-LoxP deletion strategies, that deletion of Smad4 accelerates satellite differentiation, reduces proliferation, and impairs muscle regeneration after injury. Interestingly, they also examine SMAD4 ablation in aged animals, where it has been suggested that elevated TGF\u03b2 signaling constrains robust muscle regenerative potential. Unexpectedly, the authors report impaired SMAD4 induction in aged, regenerating muscle and show that SMAD4 deletion in this context is unable to reverse age-related regenerative defects. These results implicate SMAD4 as a positive regulator of muscle repair, and should prompt additional dissection of the upstream signals that modulate SMAD4 levels during muscle regeneration and aging."

The authors' use of highly specific genetic systems and aging of their animals out to 2 years is an important contribution. Furthermore, the results nicely highlight important differences in the generative/regenerative responses of developing, adult and aged muscle, and make an important point about the context specificity of SMAD4 requirement and the challenges of predicting pathway activity or impact based solely on ligand levels. However, a major discussion point among the reviewers was the extent to which the work provides new insights into SMAD4 functions, especially as this is a well-studied target in development and skeletal muscle biology, and the extent to which the authors are able to resolve the apparent differences they report between a loss of Smad4 during development, which seems to prevent efficient differentiation but not proliferation, and during adulthood, which reduces proliferation presumably by promoting differentiation. There were also some technical concerns related to the sufficiency with which the authors documented recombination efficiency in their mice, whether Smad4 fails to be upregulated, or if it is already upregulated in satellite cells of aged muscle (the way the data is presented, this is not clear), and whether the defects in P7S4-/- mice persist at later time points after injury. Addressing these points will be essential to shore up the authors' conclusions, and should be achievable by this team with their existing genetic tools and expertise. If these issues are addressed appropriately, then the work will be appropriate for <i>eLife</i>."

The latter is correct and we apologize for the confusion this may have caused and corrected the Results section accordingly. Although these data do provide similar results to the tongue study as it pertains to Smad4 loss in myogenic cells leading to decreased FGF6 and FGFR4 expression, the reduction in <i>FGFR1</i> and 4, and increased FGF2 expression are not congruent with the notion that FGF supplementation could somehow rescue deficiencies in proliferation. If anything, and consistent with the Han et al., 2012 study, such supplementation may promote terminal commitment. Therefore, based on our observations supplementation of individual FGFs was not conducted."
