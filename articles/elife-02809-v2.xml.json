Current drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) lower blood glucose levels but they do not directly alleviate \u03b2 cell stress nor prevent, let alone reverse, \u03b2 cell de-differentiation. We show here that Urocortin 3 (Ucn3), a marker for mature \u03b2 cells, is down-regulated in the early stages of T2D in mice and when \u03b2 cells are stressed in vitro. Using an insulin expression-coupled lineage tracer, with Ucn3 as a reporter for the mature \u03b2 cell state, we screen for factors that reverse \u03b2 cell de-differentiation. We find that a small molecule inhibitor of TGF\u03b2 receptor I (Alk5) protects cells from the loss of key \u03b2 cell transcription factors and restores a mature \u03b2 cell identity even after exposure to prolonged and severe diabetes."

Current drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) lower blood glucose levels but they do not directly alleviate \u03b2 cell stress nor prevent, let alone reverse, \u03b2 cell de-differentiation. We show here that Urocortin 3 (Ucn3), a marker for mature \u03b2 cells, is down-regulated in the early stages of T2D in mice and when \u03b2 cells are stressed in vitro. Using an insulin expression-coupled lineage tracer, with Ucn3 as a reporter for the mature \u03b2 cell state, we screen for factors that reverse \u03b2 cell de-differentiation. We find that a small molecule inhibitor of TGF\u03b2 receptor I (Alk5) protects cells from the loss of key \u03b2 cell transcription factors and restores a mature \u03b2 cell identity even after exposure to prolonged and severe diabetes."

                        "text": "Dysfunction or death of pancreatic \u03b2 cells underlies all types of diabetes. In the case of Type 1 diabetes, it is unknown whether the initiating cause of \u03b2 cell destruction is an immune attack or a \u03b2 cell pathology that instigates autoimmunity. \u03b2 cell failure in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is thought to begin as a compensatory response to peripheral insulin resistance and eventually results in the loss of a mature \u03b2 cell phenotype, without necessarily leading to \u03b2 cell death (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weir and Bonner-Weir, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Weir et al., 2013</a>). The loss of a mature \u03b2 cell phenotype, sometimes called de-differentiation, can result from exposure to high levels of glucose, lipids, and inflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib1\">Accili et al., 2010</a>). De-differentiation of \u03b2 cells in the context of diabetes has been shown in vivo with the genetic disruption of key transcription factors, including <i>FoxO1</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Talchai et al., 2012</a>) and <i>NeuroD</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gu et al., 2010</a>), and is also seen in isolated islets cultured in vitro on an adherent substrate (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gershengorn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Weinberg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Russ et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bar-Nur et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Negi et al., 2012</a>). In both the <i>FoxO1</i> knockout mice and obese diabetic (Lepr<sup>Db/Db</sup>) mice, de-differentiating \u03b2 cells gradually lose insulin expression and begin to express progenitor-cell markers including Ngn3 and Sox9 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Talchai et al., 2012</a>). Oxidative stress, also associated with T2D, inactivates the \u03b2 cell specific transcription factors <i>MafA</i>, <i>Nkx6.1</i>, and <i>Pdx1</i>, again leading to the loss of mature \u03b2 cell identity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guo et al., 2013</a>). \u03b2 cell de-differentiation may represent a reversal of the normal ontogeny of \u03b2 cells, or follow a different pathway, but it is clear that de-differentiation depletes the pool of functionally mature \u03b2 cells in T2D patients (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weir and Bonner-Weir, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Weir et al., 2013</a>). It is not known whether there are stages of de-differentiation at which the cells can recover or re-differentiate back into fully mature \u03b2 cells. The commonly used T2D drugs act by suppressing glucose production in the liver (e.g., Metformin), by enhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity (e.g., Rosiglitazone and other thiazolidinediones), or by forcing the secretion of more insulin from the already-stressed \u03b2 cells (e.g., sulfonylureas such as Glyburide). There is no evidence that any of these drugs reverse \u03b2 cell de-differentiation or restore the functionally mature \u03b2 cell mass after \u03b2 cell de-differentiation has occurred (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kahn et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Accili et al., 2010</a>). The availability of markers for early \u03b2 cell stress (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akirav et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mahdi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Erener et al., 2013</a>) allows one to test whether dysfunctional, stressed \u03b2 cells can be revived or re-differentiated."

Thus, the expression levels of Ins1 and Ucn3 mRNAs in the mildly diabetic (blood glucose levels between 200\u2013500 mg/dl) and the severely diabetic (blood glucose levels &gt;500 mg/dl) groups was compared to that of age-matched non-diabetic controls (C57BL/6, blood glucose levels &lt;200 mg/dl).

The expression level of <i>Ins1</i> mRNA was slightly, but not significantly, higher in islets of mildly diabetic mice as compared to non-diabetic controls, but was reduced to 28% of control levels in islets of the severely diabetic group (p &lt; 0.001).

Mice treated with S961 develop acute insulin resistance and severe diabetes within 1 week, with non-fasting glucose levels of \u2265500 mg/dl. Removal of S961 relieves the diabetes, and the mice restore their glucose control within 1 week. We thus induced transient hyperglycemia in wild-type mice with S961 for 1 week; control animals were similarly treated with PBS. At the end of the first week, half of the animals were sacrificed for analysis, and half were taken off S961 treatment and allowed to recover from diabetes for another week by which time their blood glucose levels returned to normal (\u2264200 mg/dl). Immunostaining of pancreata from all groups shows the levels of Ucn3 and insulin proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As expected, animals treated with S961 developed diabetes (reaching blood glucose levels \u2265460 mg/dl) and show an increase in insulin staining, while Ucn3 staining was almost completely abolished. In the diabetic animals that recovered and showed normoglycemia following withdrawal of S961 for 1 week, there was a complete recovery of Ucn3 staining, with a staining intensity comparable to that of the PBS-treated controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses on islets at different time point during the development of S961-induced diabetes and its subsequent recovery showed that the levels of <i>Ucn3</i> mRNA are significantly (p &gt; 0.005) reduced to about half of the levels in control mice as early as 4 days after S961 induction and are down to about a third by day 7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A small reduction of the <i>Ins1</i> mRNA was also seen, but this was not statistically significant. The expression of both <i>Ins1</i> and <i>Ucn3</i> increases to its normal levels (and even slightly higher) 3 days after pump removal, followed by a non-statistically significant decline 7 days after the withdrawal of the S961 pumps, which is not observed at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,A</a>, respectively).

The experimental design, outlined in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, employs healthy islets from adult RCU mice, isolated on day 1 and plated on an adherent 804G matrix in a 384-well plate format. The islets were first cultured for 1 week to achieve adequate de-differentiation (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Test compounds were then added on day 7 for another week. Each compound was tested in duplicate at two or three concentrations (listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A,B</a>). Fresh un-manipulated RCU islets were used as a positive control, and DMSO- or non-treated cultures were used as a negative control. The islets were fixed on day 11 for automated imaging and subsequent analysis. Percentages of mCherry positive cells that co-express GFP were calculated for each well and used to identify conditions that significantly increased the number of GFP positive cells over negative (DMSO- or non-treated) controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Positive hits were selected according to their statistical significance (p value) over the negative control. Of the 114 tested factors, three growth factors restored <i>Ucn3</i>-GFP expression with a high statistical significance (p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These factors are BMP9, soluble TGF\u03b2 receptor 3 (TGF\u03b2 sRIII, also known as betaglycan), and the GDNF-family member Artemin."

To answer this question, gene expression analyses were performed on islets from lean non-diabetic C57BL/6 mice and from mice with advanced to severe diabetes (Lepr<sup>Db/Db</sup>, Lep<sup>Ob/Ob</sup>, and Ins2<sup>Akita</sup>; blood glucose levels of 406 \u00b1 39 mg/dl, 527 \u00b1 48 mg/dl, and &gt;600 mg/dl, respectively). The islets isolated from these diabetic animals, and controls, were cultured in vitro for 24 hr with or without Alk5 inhibitor II (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Culturing control healthy islets for 24 hr with Alk5 inhibitor II results in a 1.5- to2.5-fold higher expression of <i>Ucn3</i>, <i>MafA</i>, <i>Nkx6.1</i>, <i>Pdx1</i>, and <i>FoxO1</i> compared to DMSO-treated controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We also observe an unexplained twofold decrease in <i>Ins1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Similarly, islets from mice with advanced diabetes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) and islets from mice with severe diabetes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>) responded to the Alk5 inhibitor II. The increase in <i>Ucn3</i>, <i>Nkx6.1</i>, and <i>Pdx1</i> gene expression caused by Alk5 inhibitor II in severely diabetic mice was 1.5- to 2.5-fold, similar to the effect on non-diabetic islets. The induction of <i>MafA</i> expression by Alk5 inhibitor II in the severely diabetic islets increased to fivefold and sixfold over DMSO-treated controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). This may reflect the early role of <i>MafA</i> disappearance in \u03b2 cell stress (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guo et al., 2013</a>).

However, if the metabolic stress persists, \u03b2 cells succumb to the metabolic overload and de-differentiation occurs. De-differentiation begins with translocation of the transcription factor <i>FoxO1</i> to the nucleus, and continues with an inactivation of \u03b2 cell-specific transcription factors including <i>MafA</i>, <i>Nkx6.1</i>, and <i>Pdx1</i> and consequently, a reduction in insulin production and secretion.

This is further demonstrated by the loss of Ucn3 in S961-treated mice, exposed to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia for only a week.

It is noteworthy, however, that loss of expression of Ucn3 per se is not a driver of diabetes, but is rather caused by it, as mice homozygous for a <i>Ucn3</i>-null allele are not diabetic, and even show slightly better glucose tolerance under high-fat feeding and aging (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2007</a>)."

This genetic system allows one to trace \u03b2 cells even after profound de-differentiation. Using this system, we show that \u03b2 cell de-differentiation can be reversed after 1 week of S961 treatment in vivo or after 1 week of adherent culture in vitro. A screen for pathways that can rescue \u03b2 cells from de-differentiation identified three growth factors that restored <i>Ucn3</i>-GFP expression, namely BMP9, TGF\u03b2 sRIII, and Artemin, all belonging to the TGF\u03b2 superfamily. Of those, only BMP9 had previously been identified as having an active role in glucose homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2003</a>). The gene encoding TGF\u03b2 receptor III has been shown to be up regulated in pancreata from obese human patients compared to lean subjects (<a href=\"#bib31\">Muharram et al., 2005</a>), while Artemin and its receptor GFR\u03b13 have, to the best of our knowledge, not been described in pancreatic islet function."

This inhibitor also blocked the loss of specific \u03b2 cell gene expression under cytokine-induced stress. Alk5 inhibitor II, identified using mouse \u03b2 cells, can induce the expression of key \u03b2 cell transcription factors in human islets. While human UCN3 is a marker of the functional maturation for both \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">van der Meulen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Benner et al., 2014</a>), and despite evidence that UCN3 is not a faithful marker for functional \u03b2 cell maturation in human islets during human pancreas development (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hrvatin et al., 2014</a>), the signals that reverse \u03b2 cell de-differentiation (i.e., inhibition of Alk5 signaling) may be conserved between mouse and human."

Ichida et al. showed that this inhibitor can replace Sox2 in cell reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ichida et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, it was recently reported that \u03b2 cells of mice carrying a conditional deletion of both Alk5 (referred to as TGF\u03b2 receptor I) and TGF\u03b2 receptor II do not proliferate in response to inflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib45\">Xiao et al., 2013</a>). In our results, Alk5 inhibitor II restored specific \u03b2 cell gene expression in de-differentiated \u03b2 cells, blocked cytokine-induced \u03b2 cell stress, and stimulated over-expression of these genes in \u03b2 cells from healthy, non-diabetic mice, and humans. It is noteworthy that the up regulation of SMAD7, a downstream mediator of TGF\u03b2 signaling, promotes \u03b2 cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Xiao et al., 2014</a>). Inhibition of Alk5 would inhibit SMAD7-induced proliferation. This may hint on the intriguing idea that \u03b2 cell proliferation, at least under inflammatory stress, may require a phase of de-differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that Alk5 signaling may be constitutively active in \u03b2 cells, that sustaining mature \u03b2 cell phenotype depends on constant inhibition of this signal, and that the inhibition of Alk5 signaling may confer its effect by inducing expression of \u03b2 cell transcription factors including <i>MafA</i>, <i>Nkx6.1</i>, and <i>Pdx1</i>. This postulated inhibition of Alk5 signaling in mature \u03b2 cells develops during the first postnatal weeks, when the cells reach their fully mature state (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blum et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Szabat et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Szabat et al., 2011</a>), and is reduced under diabetic stress or when the cells are taken out of their proper niche and grown in vitro. If inhibition of Alk5 signaling is not restored, the \u03b2 cells will evidently de-differentiate and disappear. Alk5 is a broadly expressed protein and its activity is required in many other tissues besides \u03b2 cells. Indeed, our preliminary attempts to inject high dosage of Alk5 inhibitor II to diabetic mice resulted in overall poor health without significant reduction of blood glucose. We therefore suggest that screening for compounds that inhibit Alk5 signaling specifically in \u03b2 cells may yield compounds that in combination with traditional blood-glucose lowering medicines will delay, prevent, or perhaps restore the loss of healthy, mature \u03b2 cell function in T2D patients."

Relative expression of mouse <i>MafA</i> was determined using Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent) on the same machine. Primers for mouse <i>MafA</i> were 5\u2032-AGCGGCACATTCTGGAGAG-3\u2032 forward and 5\u2032-TTGTACAGGTCCCGCTCCTT-3\u2032 reverse. Levels of gene expression were normalized to the expression of Ubc or Eif2A genes."

They found that Alk5 inhibitor II induced expression of Maf, Nkx and Pdx in de-differentiated b cells. However, the inhibitor failed to induce insulin."

However, the mechanism of action of those factors and physiological significance of the finding remains unknown. As Alk5 inhibitor II failed to induce insulin, clinical significance of the finding is unclear. It might be worthy to comment on the recently reported observation that up-regulation of SMAD7 promotes proliferation of b cells (Xiao et at, PNAS 2014). Inhibition of Alk5 would inhibit SMAD7 up-regulation and hence it may suppress re-differentiation."

Nkx6.1 and Pdx1 and MafA mRNA levels are also reduced at the same time as Ucn3, to about the same magnitude, supporting the notion that the phenomenon represents \u03b2 cell de-differentiation or at least a loss of the mature \u03b2 cell state.

These data show that addition on Alk5i to the islets after one week of de-differentiation restores Ucn3-GFP fluorescence to levels comparable to that of fresh islets. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of FACS-sorted mCherry-labelled \u03b2 cells from these cultures shows that the mRNA levels of Ucn3, MafA, Nkx6.1, Pdx1 and Insulin1 are diminished in the untreated cultures, supporting the idea of \u03b2 cell de-differentiation, i.e., the loss of \u03b2 cell mature gene expression. Strikingly, addition of Alk5i one week after the start of de-differentiation is sufficient to restore the expression levels of Ucn3, MafA, Nkx6.1 and Pdx1, and to a lesser extent insulin1. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> shows by immunostaining the reduction of Ucn3 and insulin proteins in the de-differentiated cultures, and their recovery following Alk51 treatment."

We discuss this attempt in the Discussion section, and suggest that screening for mediators of Alk5 signaling that are expressed specifically in \u03b2 cells, or at least are not as crucial as Alk5 itself, may yield potent drugs for manipulating this pathway in vivo."

As Alk5 inhibitor II failed to induce insulin, clinical significance of the finding is unclear.
