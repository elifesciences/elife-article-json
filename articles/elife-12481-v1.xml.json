Embryonic stem cells are active during early development and give rise to all the different cell types in the body. Adult stem cells are specific to each tissue and give rise to all the specialized cells in a particular tissue or organ. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or differentiate into a more specialized type of cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, it can be difficult to analyze these division patterns in humans. Now, in eLife, Benjamin Werner, Fabian Beier, Arne Traulsen and colleagues have used a mathematical model to reconstruct the dynamics of blood stem cells from measurements of telomere length (<a href=\"#bib9\">Werner et al., 2015</a>)."

When telomeres become very short, they lose their protective properties and cell division stops. This process is known as \u2018replicative senescence\u2019 and is correlated with aging: put simply, telomeres get shorter as people get older."

Two alternative models of stem cell dynamics were then analyzed. The first model considered that the stem cells only divide asymmetrically, producing one stem cell and one non-stem cell. The second model included both asymmetric cell division and symmetric self-renewal (where a stem cell divides to form two daughter stem cells; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Werner, Beier et al. found that the first model predicted a linear relationship between average telomere length and the donor\u2019s age, whereas the second model predicted a nonlinear decrease in telomere length. The data strongly favored the second model."

Since symmetric self-renewal could promote the accumulation of mutations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Tomasetti and Vogelstein, 2015</a>), this has implications for understanding how cancer emerges. A previous theoretical study argued that the high number of cell divisions that occur during fetal development puts us at risk of acquiring mutations even before birth (<a href=\"#bib3\">Frank and Nowak, 2003</a>). The new results extend this argument into childhood and adolescence. That is, before adulthood is reached, there is possibly a relatively high risk of acquiring mutations that may predispose an individual to cancer \u2013 even if the onset of cancer typically occurs much later in life."

In the model of Werner, Beier et al., tissues are maintained in adulthood through asymmetric cell divisions. However, as they point out, this model cannot be mathematically distinguished from an alternative mechanism that relies on a mixture of symmetric self-renewal and symmetric differentiation (i.e., when the stem cell divides to produce two non-stem cells). This is because tissues can also be maintained if the probabilities of symmetric self-renewal and differentiation are balanced and controlled through feedback loops (<a href=\"#bib4\">Lander et al., 2009</a>); this latter model is supported by stem cell data from both humans and other animals (see <a href=\"#bib7\">Shahryiari and Komarova, 2013</a> for references). Some mathematical models suggest that the prevalence of mutations depends on the division patterns, so it may be possible to distinguish between them mathematically (<a href=\"#bib7\">Shahryiari and Komarova, 2013</a>)."

                "text": "Using telomere length as an indicator of biological processes is not a new idea. Telomere length has previously been singled out as a marker to identify adult stem cells and their location in the body (<a href=\"#bib2\">Flores et al., 2008</a>). From a modeling perspective, the length of telomeres has also been proposed as a signal to assess the risk posed by pre-cancerous mutations in healthy individuals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Rodriguez-Brenes et al., 2014</a>). Telomere length might also help predict the success rate of cancer therapies, and studies of telomerase inhibitors predict better outcomes for patients with short telomere length (<a href=\"#bib1\">Chiappori et al., 2015</a>). The work by Werner, Beier et al. adds an important contribution in this context, allowing us to use telomere lengths to gain insights into cell division patterns that occur in vivo."
