In this study, we present the mechanistic basis of a configuration-specific enzyme that selectively removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of dimeric D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) from <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog shows how it uses an invariant \u2018cross-subunit\u2019 Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. While no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, the unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition provides a clear explanation for DTD\u2019s ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The strict chiral specificity elegantly explains how the enriched cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. The study thus provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus."

In this study, we present the mechanistic basis of a configuration-specific enzyme that selectively removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of dimeric D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) from <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog shows how it uses an invariant \u2018cross-subunit\u2019 Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. While no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, the unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition provides a clear explanation for DTD\u2019s ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The strict chiral specificity elegantly explains how the enriched cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. The study thus provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus."

With the selection of only L-amino acids (L-aas) for incorporation in proteins, effective enforcement and perpetuation of homochirality became essential for an efficient translational machinery to be a part of living systems. To this end, multiple checkpoints ensure that only L-aas are incorporated during translation. These include aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and ribosome (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jonak et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pingoud and Urbanke, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bhuta et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yamane et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ban et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agmon et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ogle and Ramakrishnan, 2005</a>). Many aaRSs possess proofreading modules that remove similar non-cognate L-aas mistakenly attached to tRNAs and thus ensure fidelity of translation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nureki et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Silvian et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dock-Bregeon et al., 2004</a>). However, a freestanding enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) removes D-amino acids (D-aas) mischarged on tRNAs and ensures that D-aas do not get incorporated into proteins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calendar and Berg, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wydau et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zheng et al., 2009</a>). Since DTDs act in <i>trans</i> as freestanding modules, they are most likely to operate through resampling by recapturing aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) from EF-Tu (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ling et al., 2009</a>)."

The structure of archaeal ThrRS editing domain from <i>Pyrococcus abyssi</i> (Pab-NTD) not only highlighted the evolutionary link between DTD and Pab-NTD but also suggested the probable role this fold might have played in enforcement of homochirality during early evolution of translational machinery, since weakly discriminating primordial aaRSs would have been less enantioselective (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dwivedi et al., 2005</a>). Even some of the highly evolved present day aaRSs have been shown to be inherently weak in enantioselection, leading to the formation of D-aminoacyl-tRNAs (D-aa-tRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calendar and Berg, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Soutourina et al., 2000b</a>). D-aa-tRNAs thus formed could either get incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain leading to global misfolding or get accumulated in the cell leading to depletion of tRNA pool. Either way, decoupling of D-aa from tRNA is extremely important which makes the cellular role of DTD crucial."

So far three distinct types of DTDs have been reported. The most commonly found canonical DTD has been shown to be present in most bacteria and all eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Soutourina et al., 1999</a>). Archaea, on the other hand, lack canonical DTD sequence in their genomes and instead possess another structurally unrelated protein which carries out the function of deacylating D-aa-tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ferri-Fioni et al., 2006</a>). This functional equivalent of DTD has been termed DTD2 and it is found in archaea and plants (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wydau et al., 2007</a>). The third type of DTD, known as DTD3, has been reported in some cyanobacteria that lack both canonical DTD and DTD2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wydau et al., 2009</a>). Overall, the universal distribution of DTD function across the three domains of life clearly suggests an essential role DTDs must have played and continue to play in enforcing homochirality. From here on, DTD would refer to the canonical DTD found in bacteria and eukaryotes unless otherwise mentioned. The DTD sequence is highly conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes with the sequence identity between <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Homo sapiens</i> being 39%. The biological significance of DTD has been shown in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes with deletion of <i>dtd</i> gene leading to reduced tolerance to several D-aas in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib38\">Soutourina et al., 2000a</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2000b</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zheng et al., 2009</a>). DTD is ubiquitously expressed and shows high levels of expression in the human neuronal cells, which are abundant in D-aas, thus strongly indicating a critical role of DTD (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zheng et al., 2009</a>)."

This can be seen from the fact that DTD is able to act on diverse substrates such as Tyr, Phe, Asp, and Trp as long as they carry a D-configuration of the amino acid on tRNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calendar and Berg, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Soutourina et al., 2000b</a>). The problem is further compounded by the very high excess of L-aa-tRNA over D-aa-tRNA in the cellular milieu and warrants a stringent D-configuration specificity to avoid depletion of L-aa-tRNA pool. Although biochemical studies have indicated its configurational preference, the mechanistic basis of this fundamental process remained elusive due to lack of a cognate substrate-bound complex structure."

Later, the apo structures of DTD from <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lim et al., 2003</a>), <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i> (PDB id: <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2DBO\">2DBO</a>) and <i>H. sapiens</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kemp et al., 2007</a>) also became available. In the absence of any ligand-bound structure, docking studies were done with <i>H. influenzae</i> DTD in an attempt to understand its mechanism (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lim et al., 2003</a>). Recently, the structure of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> DTD (<i>Pf</i>DTD) was solved in complex with ADP and multiple free D-aas (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhatt et al., 2010</a>). Although these studies had proposed a catalytic mechanism implicating the role of a Thr residue, the structural basis of DTD\u2019s strict enantioselectivity was not clear. In this study, we report the mechanism of this crucial process with the help of high resolution structures of <i>Pf</i>DTD in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog. We further validate the mechanistic proposal with the help of biochemical assays conducted on <i>Pf</i>DTD as well as <i>Ec</i>DTD and NMR-based binding studies with <i>Pf</i>DTD.

The ester linkage between amino acid and adenosine is replaced by an amide linkage to make it non-hydrolyzable. Similar post-transfer substrate analogs have been used extensively to study proofreading mechanisms in atomic details for both Class I-specific CP1 editing domains and Class II-specific editing domains (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lincecum et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dock-Bregeon et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fukunaga and Yokoyama, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hussain et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2010</a>).The crystal structure of <i>Pf</i>DTD in complex with D-Tyr3AA has been solved in two different crystal forms: crystal form I at a resolution of 1.86 \u00c5 in C2 space group and crystal form II at a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 in P2<sub>1</sub> space group (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Crystal forms I and II have two and eight copies per asymmetric unit, respectively. This provides us with 10 independent observations of the ligand in the active site (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since all copies present a similar picture, the higher resolution crystal form I is discussed here unless otherwise mentioned (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The enzyme is a symmetric dimer with two active sites per dimer that are located at the dimeric interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The residues defining the active site pocket span the conserved \u2013SQFTL\u2013 motif from one monomer and the \u2013NXGP(V/F)T\u2013 motif from the other.

However, there are subtle rearrangements of the active site region upon ligand binding, indicating the plasticity associated with the active site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

The main chain atoms of Lys107 and Ile43 have direct and water-mediated interactions with the adenine moiety. An invariant Phe137 provides base-stacking interaction to the adenine ring. The main chain nitrogen of Gly138 along with the side chain hydroxyl of Ser87 holds the 2\u2032-OH. The 5\u2032-OH projects outwards as should be expected since it would be attached to the preceding nucleotide (C75) in the actual substrate, which is D-aa-tRNA. Considering that Pab-NTD, which is a structural homolog of DTD (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), also interacts with the substrate mostly through main chain atoms, it appears to be a conserved feature of this fold to employ main chain atoms extensively for ligand binding (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hussain et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2010</a>). Moreover, the adenosine-binding pocket is highly conserved in this DTD-like fold with an invariant Phe providing base-stacking interaction (Phe117 in Pab-NTD and Phe137 in <i>Pf</i>DTD) as shown in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. To prove that the ligand complex we have obtained is a biologically relevant one, we disrupted the adenine-binding pocket with the help of mutations and showed that it leads to complete loss of activity. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, Phe137 that stacks with the adenine base was mutated to Ala. In another mutant, we blocked the adenine pocket by mutating a conserved Ala112 to a bulkier Phe (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Both F137A and A112F mutations resulted in a complete loss of activity, confirming that the adenosine-binding pocket identified here indeed represents the bona fide functional site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The corresponding mutations F125A and A102F in <i>Ec</i>DTD were also tested for their activity against D-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. These mutants in <i>Ec</i>DTD also showed a complete loss of activity (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), further substantiating the biological relevance of the substrate-binding pocket identified here."

Therefore, even though Ser87 interacts with 2\u2032-OH of the ribose, it seems to perform a space-filling function of maintaining the ribose in an active conformation. It is also worth noting here that in some DTDs from different organisms, Ser87 is naturally substituted by a Pro, which further proves that the side chain chemistry of this residue is not essential for catalysis. The catalytic role of other protein residues Gln88 and Thr90 can also be ruled out as Q88A, Q88N, Q88E, T90A, and T90S mutants deacylated D-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> as efficiently as the wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Strikingly, Thr90 was identified from the modeling studies (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lim et al., 2003</a>) as a crucial residue responsible for catalysis, as discussed further in a later section. However, mutating this residue did not at all affect the activity of the enzyme. The corresponding mutants S77A, S77P, Q78A, and T80A in <i>Ec</i>DTD were also tested for their deacylation activity. In the case of <i>Ec</i>DTD, all mutants including S77A deacylated D-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> as efficiently as the wild type (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The above data suggest that none of the protein residues around the scissile bond are involved in catalysis."

                                "text": "Our earlier structural studies on Pab-NTD have suggested an RNA-assisted catalytic mechanism implicating the role of 2\u2032-OH in activating a water molecule for catalysis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hussain et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2010</a>). Subsequently, the catalytic role of RNA in proofreading has also been experimentally shown in the case of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ling et al., 2007</a>). Unlike in the case of PheRS, the catalytic role of RNA in DTD could not be directly probed with a modified tRNA having a terminal 2\u2032-deoxyadenosine since tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) attaches the amino acid on 2\u2032-OH of the ribose, which is then transesterified to 3\u2032-OH for proofreading reaction. As we show later, this transesterification is required for DTD to act since it is expected to recognize aminoacyl moiety only when it is attached to the 3\u2032-OH. A comparison of non-cognate and cognate substrate analog-bound structures of Pab-NTD had revealed that the space available in the reaction zone is crucial for catalysis. It was shown that upon cognate substrate binding this space is constricted due to a subtle movement of a crucial Lys side chain (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hussain et al., 2010</a>). This limited space, therefore, does not allow the putative catalytic water molecule to be accommodated in that site as it would have serious short contacts, and hence no deacylation. Although we do not observe a water molecule in that region in DTD, there is enough space available for a water molecule to be positioned without any clashes. Furthermore, it is worth noting here that the site of catalysis in DTD is much more accessible to the external bulk solvent as compared to Pab-NTD and could be a plausible reason as to why we do not observe the water molecule crystallographically. Therefore, considering the structural similarity and conservation of substrate-binding modes between DTD and Pab-NTD along with the experimental evidence showing the absence of any direct role of protein side chains in the catalytic mechanism, we propose a similar RNA-assisted catalysis in DTD also (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The 2\u2032-OH of the terminal ribose would activate a water molecule, which in turn makes a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. The resultant tetrahedral transition state would be stabilized by the oxyanion hole formed by main chain nitrogen atoms of Phe89 and Thr90 situated at a distance 3.03 \u00c5 and 4.05 \u00c5 respectively from the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate. It would then result in the subsequent cleavage of the ester bond between the D-aa and the tRNA. Therefore, taken together with studies on Pab-NTD and the primordial nature of its fold and function, the above data indicate that the DTD fold is an RNA-based catalyst in the proofreading reaction."

The aminoacyl moiety has interactions with residues from both monomers. The carbonyl oxygen interacts with the main chain nitrogen of Phe89 and the side chain amide of Gln88. Both the residues belong to the \u2013SQFTL\u2013 motif. The \u03b1-amino group of D-tyrosine has an interaction with carbonyl oxygen of Gly149 from the cross-subunit Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro motif. Such a capture of the carbonyl oxygen and the amino group of the incoming D-aa, automatically positions the C\u03b2 in such a way that it makes favorable C-H<sup>\u2026</sup>O hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro150, again from the cross-subunit Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro motif. In addition, the C\u03b1 also makes a weak C-H<sup>\u2026</sup>N bond with the Gln88 side chain amide nitrogen. The interaction distances of the aminoacyl moiety have been summarized in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>. With this mode of recognition of the configuration, the side chain of D-tyrosine is positioned in such a way that it projects out of the binding pocket and has no interaction beyond the C\u03b2 atom as seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>. The atomic B-factors of the ligand clearly show a sharp rise in the side chain atoms beyond the C\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). The superimposition of all the copies of ligand from both the crystal forms I and II shows considerable deviations in only the side chain atoms beyond C\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The lack of recognition of side chain atoms indicates that residues with different side chain chemistries and sizes are treated alike. Such a side chain-free recognition mechanism provides the basis for how nature has designed a single deacylase to deal with any D-aa-tRNA and reveals the crucial role played by weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection."

In conformation I, where the side chain swaps positions with H\u03b1, it would result in serious clashes with several atoms in the binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Even the C\u03b2 of L-Tyr would have short contacts of 3.08 \u00c5 with the C\u03b4 and 2.69 \u00c5 with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro150. In conformation II, the side chain would occupy the place of the amino group (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In this position it would be placed adjacent to 5\u2032-OH and would therefore have short contacts with the preceding nucleotide (C75). In fact, the C\u03b2 itself would have a short contact (2.56 \u00c5) with the amide nitrogen of the substrate (ester oxygen in the real substrate). It should be highlighted here that the side chain rejection in both positions occurs at the C\u03b2 level itself, which implies that an amino acid with even a minimal side chain like L-Ala will be rejected from occupying these two positions. In the third possibility of conformation III, the amino group would swap its position with H\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In this case, in addition to losing its hydrogen bonding interaction with Gly149 carbonyl oxygen, the amino group would be placed also in an unfavorable environment at a distance of 3.07 \u00c5 from the C\u03b4 atom of the non-polar side chain of Pro150 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This provides an elegant mechanistic design for L-chirality rejection from this pocket irrespective of the conformation and side chain chemistry of the incoming substrate. The rejection mechanism also rules out any other possible mode of D-aa binding than the one observed where the side chain is kept protruding out (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Biochemical studies have revealed deacylation mechanism of DTD against aa\u2013tRNA pairs belonging to both classes of aaRS. However, it was not clear whether DTDs would act on D-aas linked to 2\u2032-OH or 3\u2032-OH or both. The structure shows that the 2\u2032-OH is positioned in a confined area with the help of tight interactions with Gly138 main chain nitrogen and Ser87 side chain hydroxyl group. Modeling even the simplest of amino acids on the 2\u2032-OH shows severe steric clashes irrespective of the ribose pucker (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). We have further confirmed this mechanistic proposal using 2D <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H TROSY experiments. Titration of <sup>15</sup>N-<i>Pf</i>DTD with D-Tyr3AA showed chemical shift perturbations for a number of resonances (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). On the other hand, titration with D-Tyr2AA (analog of D-tyrosine bound to 2\u2032-OH of adenosine) resulted in no observable chemical shift perturbations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). This confirms that the enzyme acts on tRNAs only when the amino acid is either attached to 3\u2032-OH or transferred to 3\u2032-OH from 2\u2032-OH through rapid transesterification. A similar mechanistic mode of operation of Pab-NTD delineates this DTD-like fold as a 3\u2032-specific deacylase enzyme (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hussain et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2010</a>)."

To experimentally demonstrate the crucial role of this unique motif for DTD function, we carried out deacylation assays with <i>Pf</i>DTD by mutating these two critical residues. A complete loss of activity was observed for both G149A and P150A mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We also carried out deacylation assay with G149A/P150A double mutant and similar to both single mutants, it showed a total loss of activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The biochemical studies, thus clearly, show that Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro motif is essential for DTD function. We further wanted to ensure that the observation is not <i>Plasmodium</i>-specific. Therefore, we performed the same biochemical study with the mutants of <i>Ec</i>DTD to ensure that the critical role of the Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro motif is universal. Similar to <i>Pf</i>DTD, both G137A and P138A mutants of <i>Ec</i>DTD showed a complete loss of deacylation function (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We also tested G137A/P138A double mutant for deacylation function and it also showed no activity like the individual point mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The biochemical analyses with the mutants of both <i>Pf</i>DTD and <i>Ec</i>DTD prove the critical role played by the unique Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro motif in DTD function and also suggests the universality of its crucial role irrespective of the organism."

Comparison of these parameters from all known complex structures of proofreading domains with the structure presented in the current study places our structure in the same bracket as the other well-studied proofreading domains (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). We have mutated Phe89 that has been shown to stack with adenine in ADP-complex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhatt et al., 2010</a>), to Ala and show that the mutant is as active as the wild-type <i>Pf</i>DTD (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,C</a>). The corresponding mutant F79A in <i>Ec</i>DTD was also completely active suggesting that the Phe has no significant role in binding the adenine (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Furthermore, the earlier work had implicated a conserved Thr90 as the catalytic residue that was proposed to mount a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lim et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bhatt et al., 2010</a>). However, our analysis clearly shows that not only the distance (5.72 \u00c5) of \u03b3-hydroxyl group of Thr90 from the carbonyl carbon is unfavorable for any nucleophilic attack but also it is oriented away from the point of attack where it is strongly tethered to Thr152 main chain atoms through a highly conserved cross-subunit interaction (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). To experimentally demonstrate that Thr90 is not the catalytic residue as had been proposed earlier, we mutated this residue to Ala in both <i>Pf</i>DTD and <i>Ec</i>DTD, and showed that they still efficiently deacylated D-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). These data, therefore, rule out the earlier propositions not only with respect to the adenosine-binding site but also the catalytic mechanism."

The most striking feature of the Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro motif is the near-parallel fixation of the two carbonyl groups at an angle of \u223c20\u00b0, a highly conserved structural feature in DTDs irrespective of the presence or absence of ligand as seen in 72 different observations (including 10 from this study) from five different organisms (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The Ramachandran dihedral angles of both residues remarkably illustrate a striking conservation, which allows DTD to selectively recognize the chiral centre. It also provides a structural explanation for having an invariant Gly in that position as no other residue can normally lie in that region of Ramachandran map (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Since the cellular milieu will be in abundance with L-aa-tRNAs, when compared to D-aa-tRNAs, such a positioning of the critical enantioselective components, as seen here, prevents even a promiscuous deacylation of L-aa-tRNAs leading to their depletion from the pool, as shown by the biochemical studies with 1000-fold excess of DTD in two different systems. The essential role of Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro motif in chiral discrimination is also strongly indicated by its absolute invariance in all DTD sequences from eubacteria to higher eukaryotes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Previous work has shown the ability of L-proline to catalyze asymmetric synthesis of simple sugars leading to their enantioenrichment (<a href=\"#bib6\">Breslow and Cheng, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hein and Blackmond, 2012</a>). Based on the work, there has been a proposal of a role of L-proline in symmetry-breaking during the prebiotic era. In the present work also, we show the critical role of a proline residue as a part of a motif in a process involved in enforcement of homochirality."

A mechanistically unique solution to the problem of enantioselectivity employing two carbonyl oxygens from a \u2018cross-subunit\u2019 Gly-<i>cis</i>Pro dipeptide has been shown to be responsible for D-chirality selection and strict L-chirality rejection from the active site of DTD. The conserved and indispensable nature of the motif in DTD argues strongly for its crucial role in solving this key chiral discrimination problem in biology. The presence of DTD-fold and function in all kingdoms of life suggests an important role such systems have played in enforcing homochirality during early evolution of the translational apparatus, and high levels of expression in neuronal cells indicate a crucial role of DTD in higher organisms, which still needs to be explored."

It has been shown that D-Tyr-adenosine was not hydrolyzed by DTD, but a D-Tyr-esterified oligonucleotide produced by RNase T1 digestion of D-Tyr-tRNA having a 19mer oligonucleotide, is its substrate (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ferri-Fioni et al., 2001</a>).

This has been substantially based on the conserved nature of the Gly<i>cis</i>Pro motif (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In principle, the substrate binding pocket of an enzyme has to have certain amount of plasticity and even if the stereochemistry of a couple of residues is conserved, possible structural changes due to the plasticity associated with other residues can not be ruled out. Indeed, this argument is consistent with the degenerate recognition of diverse D-amino acids in case of the same enzyme (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhatt et al. (2010)</a>). This is important particularly considering that the true substrate is much bigger than the ligand used here. While it is accepted that the L-amino acids are rejected, one has to be cautious about interpreting the mechanism based on the rigidity of a motif consisting of only two amino acids from the binding pocket."

The model proposed in their case emphasizes substantial plasticity at the binding site and highlights the possible catalytic steps. The authors of the present study reject that model based on two counts: they were not cognate ligand complexes and their binding modes are different. Knowing that D-Tyr-adenosine is also not a true substrate of DTD, better explanation would be required to rule out the earlier described binding modes considering they also involve D-amino acids and adenosine."

We have now provided in the main text all the references where these analogs were used to decipher the structural basis of proofreading mechanism both in class I and class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which were further validated biochemically. In our current manuscript, we have added additional data to experimentally demonstrate that the ligand-bound complex we have obtained is the functionally relevant one by disrupting the adenine pocket with the help of mutations and showing that it leads to complete loss of activity in two different systems, i.e., <i>Pf</i>DTD and <i>Ec</i>DTD (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). As can be seen, both these mutations were selected to have opposing structural consequence, one protrudes in the adenine binding pocket and the other removes the naturally occurring stacking interaction. These data clearly show that the adenine binding mode identified in our study is used for the biological function of DTD. In addition, as elaborated later, the mutation of the adenine binding site as predicted by Bhatt et al. did not alter the activity, again done in both <i>Pf</i>DTD and <i>Ec</i>DTD, clearly showing that it is not the functional adenosine pocket. However, as correctly pointed out by the reviewers, we have modified the text to avoid misleading statements.

Moreover, the role of 2'-OH in catalysis has also been suggested in the case of Pab-NTD, which shares a striking structural similarity with DTD. Although, the catalytic role of vicinal hydroxyl group of ribose in proofreading has been experimentally shown in case of Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) by using deoxy analogs (Ling et al., 2010, PNAS (104), 72-77), doing the same for DTD or Pab-NTD has some practical limitations. In the case of Threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS), 2'-OH has been shown to play a critical role in aminoacylation reaction also, which means that tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> with a terminal 2'-deoxyadenosine (2'-dA) cannot be charged. In the case of Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS), the problem is even worse since it charges the amino acid on the 2'-OH of tRNA which then gets transesterified to 3'-OH. Therefore, generating substrate for DTD with tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-2'-dA would not be possible. These practical limitations make it difficult to directly verify the catalytic role of 2'-OH in both DTD and Pab-NTD. However, the lack of involvement of any protein residues in catalysis strongly suggests a role of RNA in catalysis, as shown in the case of PheRS. The above aspect on catalysis with the new mutational data has been extensively dealt with in the new manuscript, while the overall focus is still on the unique chiral discrimination mechanism of DTD."

Even if we consider it as a mimic of the substrate since it also has an adenosine moiety, there are serious issues with the mode of binding observed in the ADP-bound structure. Going by the general principles of enzyme-substrate interactions, the ligand in a biologically relevant complex is expected to bind in the deepest available pocket with strong surface complementarity and chemical compatibility with a conserved network of interactions. As we now show in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, where we compare the ADP-bound structure with our structure and all the known complexes of proofreading domains, the ADP binds in a site that leaves the deepest pocket unoccupied unlike our structure or any other known complex structure of proofreading domains. Moreover, the striking surface complementarity that is evident in all complex structures including ours is totally absent in ADP complex. Secondly, the binding of ADP buries less than 50% of the ligand that is much less than the values that are mostly in the range of 80% for all known complex structures including ours. Thirdly, the biologically relevant complexes exhibit a remarkable redundancy of observation wherein the presence of ligand is observed in every monomer. Although such a redundancy is seen in our structure, where the ligand D-Tyr3AA has been observed in all ten monomers from 2 different crystal forms, ADP has only been sporadically observed in just 7 out of 18 monomers. Lastly and most importantly, a biologically relevant complex is expected to have a substantial number of interactions between the ligand, and the enzyme and the residues involved in these interactions must be evolutionarily conserved. Such evolutionarily conserved interactions are observed in all proofreading domain complexes as well as our structure but are missing in ADP complex."

Even if we assume them to partly mimic the actual substrate, the D-amino acid complexes reported have some serious problems as discussed below. First of all, these structures (except D-Lysine complex) have been solved at resolutions ranging from 2.75 \u00c5 to 3.00 \u00c5, which makes the accurate modeling of free D-amino acids difficult. It may be noted that in most of these structures even waters have not been modeled. Secondly, in most cases the D-amino acid has only been modeled in just 1 out of 6 monomers highlighting a lack of redundancy of observations. Thirdly, the D-amino acids have been modeled with minimal interactions with the protein (in some cases there is no interaction between D-amino acid and protein at all). Even these minimal interactions with protein residues are not evolutionarily conserved at all. All these features are highly unexpected of a functionally relevant complex. Moreover, as we have illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, the position as well as orientation of all D-amino acids is highly variable. In some cases the carboxylate group points towards the enzyme, whereas in some cases it points outwards. This variable mode of D-amino acid binding has been possibly misconstrued as plasticity of active site and has been used to explain DTD\u2019s activity against multiple D-amino acids (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhatt et al., 2010</a>). We do not think that the above argument holds good given the fact that the actual substrate for DTD is D-aminoacyl-tRNA, which means that D-amino acid would be ester linked to the terminal adenosine of tRNA. Therefore, the position as well as the orientation of D-amino acid in a functional complex would be fixed by the adenosine-binding pocket. In order to accommodate all the modes of D-amino acid binding observed, DTD must have multiple adenosine binding pockets as well, which is a highly improbable scenario. In any case, the observed modes of D-amino acid complexes do not provide any explanation for the chiral selection mechanism. On the other hand, the side chain-independent mode of D-Tyr3AA binding that we observe in the current study not only elucidates this chiral discrimination mechanism but also elegantly explains the ability of DTD to act on multiple D-amino acids, even when they are bound in a fixed orientation."
