We now report that CaMKII has a remarkable property, which is that activation of the holoenzyme triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, including unactivated ones, enabling the calcium-independent phosphorylation of new subunits. We show, using a single-molecule TIRF microscopy technique, that the exchange process is triggered by the activation of CaMKII, and that exchange is modulated by phosphorylation of two residues in the calmodulin-binding segment, Thr 305 and Thr 306. Based on these results, and on the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that the phosphorylated regulatory segment of CaMKII interacts with the central hub of the holoenzyme and weakens its integrity, thereby promoting exchange. Our results have implications for an earlier idea that subunit exchange in CaMKII may have relevance for information storage resulting from brief coincident stimuli during neuronal signaling."

We now report that CaMKII has a remarkable property, which is that activation of the holoenzyme triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, including unactivated ones, enabling the calcium-independent phosphorylation of new subunits. We show, using a single-molecule TIRF microscopy technique, that the exchange process is triggered by the activation of CaMKII, and that exchange is modulated by phosphorylation of two residues in the calmodulin-binding segment, Thr 305 and Thr 306. Based on these results, and on the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that the phosphorylated regulatory segment of CaMKII interacts with the central hub of the holoenzyme and weakens its integrity, thereby promoting exchange. Our results have implications for an earlier idea that subunit exchange in CaMKII may have relevance for information storage resulting from brief coincident stimuli during neuronal signaling."

There are four CaMKII genes in humans, termed \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 and these generate \u223c40 isoforms through alternative splicing that results in variations in the linker (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tombes et al., 2003</a>).

Crystal structures of isolated hub domain assemblies of CaMKII revealed both tetradecameric and dodecameric forms, and spectroscopic studies provided evidence for variability in the number of subunits in intact holoenzymes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hoelz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rosenberg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rellos et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nguyen et al., 2012</a>). This variability in subunit stoichiometry raised the possibility that the CaMKII holoenzyme might dissociate and reassemble, allowing subunits to exchange in the process. To study this, we analyzed CaMKII subunit exchange by using a single-molecule technique to visualize fluorescently labeled holoenzymes directly.

This type of analysis is complicated in bulk solution by the difficulty in distinguishing between aggregation of holoenzymes and true subunit exchange. Gel filtration analysis of a constitutively active mutant (CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>) shows no evidence for aggregation, and incubation of the wild-type holoenzyme with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP shows no changes in the UV-vis absorption spectrum (data not shown). We also used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the size distribution of activated CaMKII assemblies in solution (for both wild-type, activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and a constitutively active mutant in which Thr 286 is replaced by aspartate [CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>] in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM). DLS measurements indicate that the addition of ATP to CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>, under the conditions used in our mixing experiments, results in a small population with sizes that are larger than that of a single holoenzyme (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The DLS data for both wild-type CaMKII and CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> demonstrate that there is no time-dependent change in the particle size distribution over the time scale of our experiments."

CaMKII holoenzymes are then immobilized on a glass slide such that individual holoenzyme assemblies are separated spatially from each other, and visualized by TIRF microscopy (see schematic diagram in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

On average, 6\u201320% of particles were eliminated from the analysis. Since samples from different time points are from the same reaction, the distribution of fluorescence intensities of each sample should not change over time in the absence of aggregation. Histograms of the fluorescence intensities were created for each image, after processing in the particle-tracking program, and monitored to check for any population of extra-bright particles (most likely aggregates). The distribution of fluorescence intensities did not change significantly over the time course of the subunit exchange reaction, indicating that the colocalization we report is not due to aggregation, which would cause the distribution to shift towards values of greater intensity (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This does not, however, rule out that aggregation or self-association of CaMKII holoenzymes may be necessary as an intermediate step for subunit exchange to occur, since such self-association might be reversed by dilution prior to the single-molecule analysis."

Activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM releases the R3 element from the kinase domain, but it remains hidden within calmodulin. Thr 286 is, however, outside the footprint of calmodulin, and it is phosphorylated upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the holoenzyme. The release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM from a subunit after Thr 286 is phosphorylated facilitates phosphorylation at Thr 305 and Thr 306, which prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM rebinding (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hashimoto et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hanson and Schulman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colbran, 1993</a>).

We envisage two possible kinds of mechanisms for the exchange of subunits between CaMKII holoenzymes. The first mechanism is suggested by the unusual allosteric activation of porphobilinogen synthase (<a href=\"#bib63\">Selwood and Jaffe, 2012</a>). This enzyme converts between an inactive hexamer and an active octamer, with the transition requiring dissociation of the assembly into dimers (<a href=\"#bib64\">Selwood et al., 2008</a>). We have developed a speculative structural model for how activation might promote the release of subunits, most likely dimers, from a CaMKII holoenzyme, discussed below. An alternative mechanism involves the transient formation of higher order aggregates of two or more holoenzymes, with exchange occurring within the aggregate followed by separation of holoenzymes with mixed subunits. The data available to us at present provide no clues as to how such a process might occur, so we do not discuss this further although it remains an important alternative mechanism for future investigation."

We developed a model for how the regulatory segment might weaken the hub assembly by analyzing molecular dynamics simulations of CaMKII (see \u2018Appendix\u2019), and by considering several characteristic features of the structure of the holoenzyme and the exchange process. These include (i) the ability of the hub assembly to interconvert between dodecameric and tetradecameric forms, (ii) the importance of phosphorylation of the regulatory segment, (iii) the presence within the hub domain of a deep cavity containing three conserved arginine residues and (iv) the known ability of the hub domain to serve as a docking site for peptide segments by virtue of its exposing an uncapped \u03b2 sheet, with no steric hindrance to extending the sheet by an additional strand provided by the regulatory segment. For ease of discussion, the details of the molecular dynamics simulations and the reasoning that went into the development of this model are presented in an \u2018Appendix\u2019 that follows immediately after the main body of the text.

(<b>B</b>) Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding, Thr 286 is trans-phosphorylated. For simplicity, just one kinase domain is depicted. When calcium levels drop, CaM falls off and Thr 305 and Thr 306 are subsequently phosphorylated. The now-released regulatory segment is free to bind the open \u03b2 sheet of its own hub domain. This brings residues 305/306 in close proximity to the hub cavity (blue triangle), which houses the three conserved Arg residues. Binding of the regulatory segment induces a crack to open in the hub domain, which exposes the Arg residues to the phosphate groups. We reason that phosphorylation of the regulatory segment leads to an interaction between the R3 element and the hub domain that weakens the lateral association between hub domain dimers, leading to their release from one holoenzyme. (<b>C</b>) Fluctuations in the autoinhibited holoenzyme create a hub assembly that resembles a \u2018C\u2019 shaped structure. This fluctuation may allow the capture of a vertical dimer that has been released from an active holoenzyme. The drawing depicts the adoption of a tetradecameric structure upon docking of an incoming vertical dimer, which may be an intermediate in the exchange process. As discussed in the main text, we have no direct experimental evidence at present concerning the exchange process.

In a view that has the mid-plane of the dodecamer horizontal, these vertical dimers each contribute one hub domain to the upper ring and one to the lower ring of the hub assembly. We propose that the hub assembly within a holoenzyme, whether activated or not, normally undergoes fluctuations that convert it from the closed double-ring form seen in crystal structures to an open C-shaped form with a gap between two adjacent vertical dimers. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this gap can easily be large enough to capture a vertical dimer provided by another holoenzyme. This could, for example, convert a dodecameric assembly to a tetradecameric one. In the absence of activation, however, the transient openings in the hub assembly of the holoenzyme simply reanneal, due to the stability of the lateral interactions between vertical dimers."

We speculate that when this happens, one or more of the phosphorylated sidechains in the regulatory segment reach into the interior of the hub and interact with the conserved arginine residues located in the hub cavity. This interaction might distort the structure of the hub domain, slightly weakening the lateral interactions in the hub assembly. A fluctuation in the hub assembly can now result in the release of an activated vertical dimer.

We now demonstrate that the CaMKII holoenzyme has precisely this property when studied in vitro. Activated CaMKII holoenzymes can indeed instruct previously unactivated holoenzymes as to their phosphorylation state through subunit exchange, and this ability is switched on by activation and autophosphorylation. In the time since Lisman\u2019s earlier speculation about subunit exchange, there has been no experimental precedent that has pointed to such a mechanism being operative for CaMKII. Translocation of CaMKII to the NMDA receptor requires active subunits and has been postulated to serve as a molecular memory (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bayer et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jiao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lemieux et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Neant-Fery et al., 2012</a>).

Interestingly, another study demonstrated that localized stimulation of a neuron resulted in the translocation of CaMKII from the main body of the axon to synapses throughout the dendritic arbor for much longer times (15\u201340 min) after the local stimulation is stopped; the authors of this report commented that subunit exchange may play a role in this process (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rose et al., 2009</a>).

The internal motions of the hub can be described as rigid-body motions of individual vertical-dimer units, with alterations in the lateral dimer\u2013dimer interfaces. This is demonstrated by aligning each instantaneous structure from the trajectory on each subunit in turn, and graphing the root mean square deviations in the positions of the C\u03b1 atoms in the two subunits across the lateral interfaces and the one subunit across the equatorial interface (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To do this, we made a copy of the trajectory. The subunits in the original are labeled C through K, and in the copy they are labeled C\u2032 through K\u2032. The two internal interfaces (E:F/G:H and G:H/I:J) are brought into alignment by superimposing subunit E from the original onto subunit G\u2032 of the copy of the trajectory, for pairs of structures at the same point in the trajectory. The overlaid structures are shown at the bottom left. The close overlap shows that the two vertical interfaces in this instantaneous structure are similar.

There is limited access to this cavity in the context of the holoenzyme. A close up of the G/H dimer from the crystal structure of CaMKII\u03b3 (PDB code: 2UX0) is highlighted in blue/pink (right). There are three arginine residues that are located deep within the hub cavity (residues 403, 423, and 439), and these are highly conserved in CaMKII. (<b>B</b>) Shown is a vertical dimer from the mouse CaMKII\u03b1 crystal structure (PDB code: 1HKX). The crystal structure is shown in cartoon representation (left) with the regulatory segment (magenta) docked onto \u03b23 (yellow). On the right, the crystal structure is shown as a surface representation where the hub cavity that contains the arginine residues (blue) is apparent through a small crack (between \u03b1A and \u03b23), which we refer to as the lateral opening. (<b>C</b>) The regulatory segment (magenta) was docked onto \u03b23 in the hub assembly (yellow). This docked model was used to generate three independent molecular dynamics trajectories (100 ns each). In each of these trajectories the R3 element retains the hydrogen bonding pattern (right) that is consistent with its incorporation into the \u03b2 sheet of the hub domain and the phosphate group maintains its proximity to the sidechain of Arg 403, suggesting that this interaction is plausible. Each trajectory was sampled every 2 ns and each dot represents the formation of a hydrogen bond (&lt;3.5 \u00c5). (<b>D</b>) Peptide binding disrupts lateral contacts within the hub domain. Docking of the regulatory segment peptide (magenta) prevents the crack between \u03b1A (yellow) and \u03b23 (yellow) from closing. This is coupled to changes in the loops that make lateral contacts with the adjacent vertical dimers. This disruption may be sufficient to allow the release of a vertical dimer unit from the hub assembly and facilitate the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes."

Although in many cases the only access to the interior of the hub cavity is through the main opening to the cavity, which is far from where the regulatory segment connects to the hub, some individual subunits in hub domain assemblies exhibit cracks in the surface at the interface between helix \u03b1A and the \u03b2 sheet against which it is packed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). These cracks make Arg 403, located within the cavity, partially accessible from the side of the hub domain. If such cracks were to open up further then phosphorylated residues in the R3 element might gain access to the interior of the cavity from the side of the hub domain, in the vicinity of the lateral interfaces between vertical hub domain dimers in the holoenzyme."

Static images were recorded with a Hamamatsu (Hamamatsu City, Japan) Orca-R2 interline charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The sample was illuminated with a 488 nm argon-ion laser (Spectra Physics 177g, Santa Clara, CA), 561 nm optically pumped solid state laser (Coherent Sapphire, Santa Clara, CA), 640 nm diode laser (Coherent Cube, Santa Clara, CA). Lasers were controlled using an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) and aligned into a fiber launch custom built by Solamere (Salt Lake City, UT). A single-mode polarization maintaining fiber (Oz Optics, Ottawa, Canada) was connected to the TIRF illuminator. All optical filters were from Chroma (Bellows Falls, VT). Dichroics were 2-mm thick and mounted in metal cubes to preserve optical flatness: ZT488rdc, ZT561rdc, and ZT640rdc. Long-pass emission filters included: ET500lp, ET575lp, and ET660lp. Bandpass emission filters were located below the dichroic turret in a filter wheel (Sutter Lambda 10-3, Novato, CA): ET525/50m, ET600/50m, and ET700/75m. Multicolor acquisition was performed by computer-controlled change of illumination and filter sets. Multi-color TIRF imaging was performed at twelve different positions which were calculated from an initial reference point so as to capture images at a reasonable distance from one another. Images were acquired using Micro-Manager microscopy software. For all images, 2 by 2 binning was used as part of acquisition and 500 ms exposure time was used for most images."

The program enabled us to detect particles systematically and to quantify the amount of colocalization. Analysis was carried out in two overall steps: (i) localization of particles in micrographs and quantification of integrated fluorescence emission intensity from each identified spot and (ii) colocalization of detected particles in different color channels. Initial guesses for the location of particles were generated by locating sites of divergence in the gradient vector field of the image. Fitting an elliptical Gaussian to the intensity profile of individual particles refined the initial guesses. A cut-off in the circularity (evaluated as the ratio of the major and minor axis of the ellipse) enabled aggregates and particles with overlapping intensity distributions to be excluded. Colocalization, or the (number of colocalizing particles)/(number of total particles in reference channel), was evaluated by counting particles in separate channels with center positions located within a threshold distance (1.0\u20132.5 pixels). The colocalization number was normalized subsequently by the experimentally determined maximum value obtained from a positive control of doubly labeled CaMKII proteins. The channel with smaller total particle number was chosen systematically as the reference channel in all experiments. Error bars shown in the single-molecule experiments represent the standard deviation between multiple collected images."

The authors make beautiful use of two- and three-color single molecule experiments (and complementary solution FRET experiments) and a series of mixed CaMKII constructs to demonstrate that subunit exchange and spreading occurs, and requires: 1) subunit activation, 2) dissociation of activated subunits from the dodecamer, 3) activities within the R3 regulatory and adjacent regulatory regions, including phosphorylation of Thr86 and Thr305/6, and 4) exchange of activated subunits into the previously inactive holoenzymes. An elegant mechanistic model for subunit exchange is proposed based upon structural and experimental constraints, and supported by molecular dynamics simulations."

The detailed proposal for activation-induced subunit exchange is still rather speculative, but is well thought out and logical and its inclusion enriches the paper. Unfortunately, the authors were unable perform the one very obvious test of their mechanistic proposal, mutation of the Arg-rich hub cavity, owing to technical problems. Nevertheless, there is much solid, important work here and it seems appropriate for the authors to propose a detailed model for subunit exchange and wait for subsequent studies to test the model (and its biological implications) more rigorously."

They will get a distribution, of course, but they should be able to determine how many of their fluorescent spots are due to potential dimers because if dimers are indeed ejected upon activation, there will be more spots with fewer photobleaching steps. It will also be good to perform an experiment with a single population of wild-type kinase all labeled with a single dye and measure the distribution of photobleaching step counts before and after activation. The current single molecule intensity distribution measurements are not precise enough to address these points."

As we understand the mixing experiments, the exchange could also be from inactive form into an active form. If this is correct, the wording should be changed. This issue is important because it relates to one of the physiological roles of CaMKII that is alluded to: the role of subunit exchange in memory maintenance. According to ideas cited, CaMKII bound to the NMDA channel may be a molecular memory at synapses. The work of Colbran (2011) shows the importance of autophosphorylated CaMKII for binding to the PSD. One can thus assume that the bound CaMKII is autophosphorylated and active. If such a holoenzyme were replaced during protein turnover by an unphosphorylated holoenzyme, information would be lost. On the other hand, if as postulated in previous models (Lisman), turnover occurred by subunit exchange, the key step in protein turnover would be insertion of unphosphorylated (new) subunits into a previously activated holoenzyme. The new subunit would become phosphorylated by well established intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation. In this way, any loss of phosphorylated subunits from this holoenzyme would be compensated. These ideas are not clearly presented in the Discussion. The Discussion is further muddled by allusion to a completely different phenomenon, the spread to CaMKII activation throughout the dendrite after local stimulation. This is a little studied phenomenon of questionable physiological significance. It is worthy of mention but needs to be described in a separate paragraph and not mixed in with the discussion of the potential importance of subunit exchange for memory maintenance."

It is interesting to note that the hydrodynamic radius derived from the light scattering data for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-activated sample (\u223c30 nm) is larger than that for the T286D mutant (\u223c11 nm). We interpret the apparent increase in the hydrodynamic radius in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to mean that the binding of CaM converts the holoenzyme to a more extended form than seen for the T286D mutant. Regardless of the origin of the increased apparent hydrodynamic radius of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM complex, there is no observable increase in the hydrodynamic radius with time for either sample. Note also that the T286D mutant exhibits a robust degree of subunit exchange in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, comparable to the exchange kinetics seen for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Thus, the differences in the apparent hydrodynamic radii of the two species is not a contributing factor to the exchange process."
