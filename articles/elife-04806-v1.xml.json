Consistent with previous electron and fluorescence microscopic studies, cofilin formed clusters along actin filaments, where the filaments were 2-nm thicker and the helical pitch was \u223c25% shorter, compared to control filaments. Interestingly, the shortened helical pitch was propagated to the neighboring bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster, while the pitch on the barbed-end side was similar to the control. Thus, cofilin clusters induce distinctively asymmetric conformational changes in filaments. Consistent with the idea that cofilin favors actin structures with a shorter helical pitch, cofilin clusters grew unidirectionally toward the pointed-end of the filament. Severing was often observed near the boundaries between bare zones and clusters, but not necessarily at the boundaries."

Consistent with previous electron and fluorescence microscopic studies, cofilin formed clusters along actin filaments, where the filaments were 2-nm thicker and the helical pitch was \u223c25% shorter, compared to control filaments. Interestingly, the shortened helical pitch was propagated to the neighboring bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster, while the pitch on the barbed-end side was similar to the control. Thus, cofilin clusters induce distinctively asymmetric conformational changes in filaments. Consistent with the idea that cofilin favors actin structures with a shorter helical pitch, cofilin clusters grew unidirectionally toward the pointed-end of the filament. Severing was often observed near the boundaries between bare zones and clusters, but not necessarily at the boundaries."

Cofilin is one such protein that binds to and forms clusters on actin filaments and it can also sever actin filaments. Severing an actin filament can encourage the filament to disassemble, or it can help produce new barbed ends that can then grow into new filaments. Previous work had suggested that cofilin severs actin filaments at the junction between regions on the filament that are coated with cofilin and those that are not. It was also known that cofilin binding to a filament causes the filament to change shape, and that the shape change is propagated to neighboring sections of the filaments not coated with cofilin. However, the details of where cofilin binds and how changes in shape are propagated along an actin filament were not known. Furthermore, the findings of these previous studies were largely based on examining still images of actin filaments, which are unlike the constantly changing filaments of living cells."

This technique can be used to directly visualize individual proteins in action. Consistent with previous findings, Ngo, Kodera et al. observed that filaments coated with cofilin are thicker than those filaments without cofilin; and that cofilin binding also substantially reduces the helical twist of the filament. Ngo, Kodera et al. also found that these changes in shape are propagated along the filament but in only one direction\u2014towards the pointed-end. Moreover, cofilin clusters also only grew towards the pointed-end of the actin filament\u2014and the filaments were often severed near, but not exactly at, the junctions between cofilin-coated and uncoated regions. Such one-directional changes in shape of the actin filaments presumably help to regulate how other actin binding proteins can interact with the filament and consequently regulate the roles of the filaments themselves."

                        "text": "Actin filaments are involved in a variety of important functions in eukaryotic cells, including muscle contraction, amoeboid movement, cytokinesis, intracellular transport, and transcriptional regulation within the nucleus. These diverse functions depend on the interaction between actin and specific actin binding proteins (ABPs), and it is generally assumed that specific biochemical signaling is involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of each actin\u2013ABP interaction. During migration of amoeboid cells, for instance, cofilin plays essential roles in continuous extension of lamellipodia by severing actin filaments to promote filament depolymerization or to initiate polymerization from new barbed ends (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib9\">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</a>). Three independent biochemical mechanisms are known to inhibit cofilin activity; phosphorylation of Ser3, sequestration to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in plasma membrane, and lower pH (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</a>). These inhibitory mechanisms are implicated in the regulation of cofilin activity during cell migration, since experimental unleashing of inactive cofilin has been shown to initiate cofilin-dependent processes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</a>). Critically speaking, however, these data do demonstrate that active cofilin is required, but there is little experimental evidence that localized activation of cofilin is necessary for proper cofilin functions in cell migration. Indeed, overexpression of constitutively active S3A cofilin did not inhibit motility (<a href=\"#bib18\">Endo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Popow-Wozniak et al., 2012</a>). Thus, biochemical signaling is not sufficient to explain how cofilin activities are properly regulated spatially and temporally in cells."

                        "text": "On the other hand, many ABPs alter the atomic structure of actin subunits within filaments, and in certain cases these conformational changes are cooperative. For instance, the pioneering work of Oosawa and his colleagues demonstrated that the increase in fluorescence intensity of a fluorophore on actin saturates when only one molecule of the myosin motor domain is added for each 10 actin subunits within filaments (<a href=\"#bib44\">Oosawa et al., 1973</a>). Similar myosin-induced cooperative conformational changes have been detected in various other assays (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tawada, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fujime and Ishiwata, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Loscalzo et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miki et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Prochniewicz et al., 2010</a>). In addition, dense binding of cofilin shortens the helical pitch of actin filaments by 25% (<a href=\"#bib34\">McGough et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Galkin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>), and time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy (<a href=\"#bib51\">Prochniewicz et al., 2005</a>) and differential scanning calorimetry (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dedova et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bobkov et al., 2006</a>) showed that one molecule of bound cofilin changes the structure of \u223c100 actin subunits within a filament. Moreover, binding of cofilin to actin filaments is cooperative (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hawkins et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hayden et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McGough et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">De La Cruz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hayakawa et al., 2014</a>). This implies that cooperative conformational changes induced by an ABP are propagated to neighboring actin subunits, increasing their affinity for that, or another, ABP. This could provide a novel mechanism by which actin filaments change their function by regulating their affinities for various ABPs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tokuraku et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Michelot and Drubin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Schoenenberger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Uyeda et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Galkin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Romet-Lemonne and Jegou, 2013</a>)."

There is little information available in the molecular mechanism that mediates the propagation of structural changes to neighboring actin subunits. Atomic force microscope (AFM) is unique in that it enables detailed structural analysis of wet protein samples (<a href=\"#bib41\">M\u00fcller and Dufr\u00eane, 2008</a>), and recent dramatic improvements in scanning speed now enables real time imaging of conformational changes in protein samples with high-spatial resolution (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ando et al., 2013</a>). This high-speed AFM (HS-AFM) has been used to visualize molecular movements such as the stepping motion of myosin V along actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kodera et al., 2010</a>), rotary catalysis of F<sub>1</sub> ATPase without a rotor (<a href=\"#bib63\">Uchihashi et al., 2011</a>), and light-induced conformational changes in bacteriorhodopsin (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shibata et al., 2010</a>). Here, we used HS-AFM to directly visualize conformational changes in actin filaments induced by cofilin binding. We found that conformational changes within cofilin clusters unidirectionally propagate to the neighboring bare actin zone in a cooperative manner and that the growth of the cofilin cluster follows this unidirectional cooperative conformational change."

When the true crossover point coincides with the position of an actin subunit (<b>A</b>) or a bound cofilin molecule (<b>C</b>), the position of the peak is equal to that of the crossover point, and its height is the tallest of the various possible orientations of the filament on the substrate. When the true crossover point is at the middle of two actin subunits (<b>B</b>) or two bound cofilin molecules (<b>D</b>), the peak height is the shortest of the possible orientations. In this latter case, the observed peak position is away from the true crossover point by as much as \u223c2.5 nm. Depending on the orientation of the filament, therefore, the distance between the observed peak position and the true crossover point fluctuates between 0 and 2.5 nm. Random distribution of distances between the true crossover points and the highest points of the closest actin subunits would result in \u00b11.7 nm of error in the estimation of the positions of the true crossover points. If the peak positions at both ends of a half helix have this much error, the half helical pitch would have \u00b12.3 nm (\u00b11.7 nm \u00d7 \u221a2) error. This is somewhat smaller than the \u00b13.0 nm standard deviation of the half helical pitches of actin filament paracrystals, and the difference should derive from small structural fluctuations in the paracrystals and/or measurement error from various other sources. In either case, it is safe to use the 3.0 nm standard deviation as the upper limit of the combined measurement errors and to estimate the lower limit of the structural fluctuations of control and cofilin-bound filaments."

Quantitative analysis indicated that the height of those peaks, or the thickness of the filaments, was 8.6 \u00b1 0.8 nm (average \u00b1 SD), and the spacing between the peaks, or half helical pitch, was 36.8 \u00b1 4.3 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). These values, which are consistent with previously reported structural data (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hanson and Lowy, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib25a\">Hanson, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Egelman et al., 1982</a>), will hereafter be referred to as normal height and normal half helical pitch, respectively. The distribution of half helical pitches ranged from \u223c26 nm to \u223c45 nm and was well fit by a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 4.3 nm. This distribution should reflect natural variation in half helical pitch, as was proposed on the basis of a similar distribution of half helical pitches in electron micrographs of negatively stained specimens (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanson, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Egelman et al., 1982</a>) and also measurement errors. To assess the overall magnitude of the measurement errors, we prepared paracrystals of actin filaments in the presence of 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (Hanson, 1973). The distribution of the half helical pitches of the paracrystals measured under the same conditions was narrower than that of free filaments, with a mean of 36.5 nm and standard deviation of 3.0 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In a hypothetical case where the paracrystals do not undergo spontaneous conformational changes, this distribution is the upper limit of the measurement errors in our system. Furthermore, assuming normal distributions of the true half helical pitches and measurement errors, the true standard deviation of the half helical pitches of control filaments was calculated to be 3.1 nm or larger, by subtracting the variance of the actin paracrystals from that of control filaments. This indicated that the structure of the actin filaments does indeed vary with changes in helical twist."

Peak heights within long cofilin clusters (longer than eight consecutive half helices) showed a single distribution of 10.6 nm \u00b1 1.0 nm, approximately 2 nm taller than the control filaments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

To answer that question, we needed to visualize individual cofilin molecules bound to actin filaments, and measure the half helical pitch of the filament around those bound molecules. This has not been possible because cofilin molecules are too small to image individually using electron microscopy or AFM. We therefore engineered a fusion protein in which the N-terminal half of the rod domain of \u03b1-actinin was attached to the C-terminus of cofilin. In electron micrographs of negatively stained specimens (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), as well as in HS-AFM images (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), we were able to see clusters of cofilin-rod with a half helical pitch \u223c25% shorter than the bare zones, which is similar to control cofilin molecules bound to actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

These are most likely the rod portions of the cofilin-rod molecules bound sparsely along seemingly bare sections of the filaments, because their length was \u223c10 nm, which is expected for half an \u03b1-actinin rod (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yan et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anson et al., 1996</a>), and because similar rod-like structures were rarely observed in control images of cofilin added to actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We therefore estimated the helical pitches on both sides of single rod-like structures sticking out from the filaments by measuring the filament length that encompassed three actin subunits along one strand on either side of the bound molecule. In addition, because we did not know the polarity of each filament, we compared the helical pitches on both sides by dividing the longer helical pitch by the shorter one. This yielded a value of 1.02 \u00b1 0.02 (average \u00b1 SD, n = 9), which was much smaller than the 1.30 \u00b1 0.18 (n = 4) measured for cofilin clusters in electron micrographs or 1.37 calculated from the AFM data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and was comparable to the value of randomly selected regions along control actin filaments (1.04 \u00b1 0.05, n = 18). Furthermore, the helical pitches around the apparently singly bound cofilin-rod molecules (36.0 \u00b1 1.0 nm, n = 5) did not significantly differ from the control helical pitch (36.3 \u00b1 1.0 nm, n = 8) measured in electron micrographs."

In the case illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, observed in F buffer containing 1 mM ADP and 0.1 mM ATP, P4 was already tall when imaging started (\u223c10.5 nm, average of t = 0\u20135 s), while P3 had an intermediate height (\u223c9.5 nm), and P1 and P2 were normal (\u223c8.5 nm) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, middle). We interpreted this to mean that the initial cofilin cluster extended beyond P4 but ended near P3. P3 gradually became taller and plateaued beyond \u223c25 s. Thereafter, P2 started to rise at \u223c15 s and plateaued at \u223c63 s, whereas P1 started to rise at \u223c60 s. The distance between P2 and P3 rapidly shortened to \u223c27 nm between 0 and 15 s, before P2 started to rise, while the distance between P1 and P2 shortened between 30 and 40 s, before P1 started to rise (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, bottom).

Since actin filaments in F buffer containing ATP should have ATP\u2013actin caps near the barbed ends, and since subunits on the pointed-end side tend to carry ADP only due to ATP hydrolysis and Pi release (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carlier, 1990</a>), the directional growth of cofilin clusters toward the pointed-end might reflect the asymmetric distribution of actin subunits with different nucleotides. To test this possibility, we prepared two different types of actin filaments with homogenous nucleotide states along the lengths. In the first case, filaments polymerized in buffer containing 1 mM ATP were incubated for 30 min in buffer containing 1 mM ADP, which is much longer than the 350 s required to hydrolyze ATP and release the resultant Pi from half of the polymerizing ATP\u2013actin molecules (<a href=\"#bib35\">Melki et al., 1996</a>), so that most of the actin subunits should carry ADP only. In the second case, filaments polymerized in buffer containing 1 mM ATP were incubated for 10 min in buffer containing 1 mM ADP and 10 mM Pi. Under this condition, most of the actin subunits should carry ADP and Pi, considering a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.5 mM for Pi (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlier and Pantaloni, 1988</a>). HS-AFM observations after the addition of 20 nM S1 and 75 nM cofilin or 150 nM S1 and 900 nM cofilin demonstrated that, in both cases, the growth of cofilin clusters was primarily to the pointed-end direction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>).

In most experiments we used 75 nM cofilin since we were able to observe de novo formation of clusters and tractable growth, after mixing and settling of the system. When 1 \u00b5M cofilin was added and mixed, we were unable to find bare zones of actin filaments. When actin filaments were incubated with 1 mM ADP and 10 mM Pi, much higher concentrations of cofilin (e.g., 900 nM) was needed to induce cofilin clusters. The growth rates of cofilin clusters were within tractable range even in the presence of 1 \u00b5M cofilin, when 10 mM Pi was present (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These results are consistent with the weaker affinity of cofilin for actin subunits carrying ADP and Pi (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carlier et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blanchoin and Pollard, 1999</a>)."

Because a previous study by <a href=\"#bib2\">Adrianantoandro and Pollard (2006)</a> found that severing activity is highest at 10 nM of human cofilin and that this activity sharply declines above and below 10 nM, we observed severing events at several different cofilin concentrations, including 10 nM. In the presence of 10 or 20 nM cofilin, severing was very infrequent (<a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Severing was often observed between 40 (<a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and 200 nM cofilin. In the presence of 650 nM cofilin, many of the filaments were fully decorated with cofilin when observations started, and severing was observed exclusively near the ends of the long clusters (<a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). When the cofilin concentration was increased to 1 \u00b5M, all the filaments were fully decorated with cofilin, and severing was infrequent along those fully decorated filaments (<a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). Thus, we also observed that cofilin's severing activity was highest in the medium concentration range (i.e., 40\u2013200 nM), but this concentration is at least several-fold higher than that reported by <a href=\"#bib2\">Adrianantoandro and Pollard (2006)</a>. These two studies used the same pair of proteins (i.e., skeletal muscle actin and human cofilin), and we can only speculate that this discrepancy is due to differences in experimental conditions."

Comparison of the last two categories demonstrates that severing within cofilin clusters occurs preferentially near the ends. Note, however, that this comparison does not necessarily show a quantitative difference in the susceptibility to severing between end and inner half helices, since the number of end and inner helices examined are not the same. (<b>E</b>) A schematic summary of the proposed distributions of bound cofilin molecules (red spheres), segments of normal (yellow) and shortened (orange) helical pitch, and normal (black arrows) and tall (orange arrows) crossover points. Free cofilin molecules tend to bind to the supertwisted bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster (gray arrows), driving the growth of the cluster in the pointed-end direction. This is most certainly an oversimplification, ignoring a number of complex issues, some of which are discussed in the main text."

Although a <i>t</i>-test indicated that the untwisting was statistically significant, we are not certain if it was an active process. If interactions between actin filaments and the lipid surface produced resistive force against local rotation of the filament, supertwisting in the cluster would induce passive, compensating untwisting of the nearby helix. If that is the case, the fact that actin filaments are not necessarily free to rotate in vivo suggests similar passive untwisting may occur in vivo as well. In any case, it is noteworthy that cofilin clusters induced distinctly asymmetric cooperative conformational changes in neighboring bare zones.

If the unidirectional cluster growth to the pointed-end is driven by the shortened helical pitch on the pointed-end side of the cluster, the new molecule is likely to bind any of the vacant binding sites in the supertwisted, apparently, bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster. This view is consistent with the result of recent high-resolution single molecule fluorescence microscopic assays that showed that free cofilin molecules prefer to bind within 65 nm of an already bound cofilin molecule, but not necessarily to the site immediately neighboring the already bound molecule (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hayakawa et al., 2014</a>). We thus speculate that there are vacant binding sites behind the advancing front of cofilin clusters, which are eventually filled by other cofilin molecules to form tight clusters, and that the advances are not necessarily in concert between the two strands of the double helix."

That observation is consistent with the idea that severing preferentially occurs at sites of structural discontinuity, such as the boundary between supertwisted and normal helical pitches (<a href=\"#bib36\">Michelot et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">De La Cruz, 2009</a>). An alternative view is that cofilin binding weakens longitudinal contacts between actin subunits within cofilin clusters and also in neighboring bare zones, but because bound cofilin bridges two actin subunits, strengthening interactions between them, severing occurs in nearby supertwisted bare zones (<a href=\"#bib22\">Galkin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bobkov et al., 2002</a>). Roughly 40% of the severing events in our AFM observations occurred at the boundary between a cluster and a bare zone or within the neighboring bare zone, which may be explained by these hypotheses. However, more than half of the severing events occurred within the cofilin clusters, albeit close to the cluster ends. One plausible explanation is that the scattered unoccupied cofilin binding sites near the ends of the cluster, discussed above, may be easy to break due to the lack of bridging cofilin molecules. Alternatively, if growth of cofilin clusters on one of the two filament strands lags the growth on the other, conformational stress may develop between the two strands, leading to breaks in the filament near the ends of cofilin clusters."

However, our AFM observations are more consistent with the view that efficient severing requires a cofilin cluster longer than one-half of a helix, since most of the severing events were observed within or very near cofilin clusters that were recognizable in our AFM images. The need of contiguously bound cofilin molecules for efficient severing is consistent with our earlier mutant analysis. Within filaments in solution, D11Q mutant actin subunits rapidly exchange bound ADP for ATP in solution. Consequently, most subunits within D11Q actin filaments have ATP bound, reducing their affinity for cofilin and protecting them from severing. Interestingly, cofilin was able to bind to copolymers of D11Q and wild-type actins, but severing was inefficient (<a href=\"#bib65\">Umeki et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that contiguous clusters of cofilin-bound actin subunits are necessary for efficient severing activity."

Answering this question is technically difficult when the imaging power is not sufficient to see individual bound cofilin molecules, but our observations using a cofilin-rod fusion protein showed that one is not enough. Consistent with this view, previous simulation studies suggested that two cofilin molecules bound close to one another along an actin filament serve as a nucleus to initiate cooperative binding of cofilin to form a cluster (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ressad et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blanchoin and Pollard, 1999</a>).

Apparently cofilin is able to induce at least two distinct types of cooperative conformational changes: one that requires cluster formation, involves \u223c25% supertwisting of the helix, and propagates over half a helix toward the pointed-end of the filament; and a second type that singly bound cofilin molecules can induce which involves relatively subtle conformational changes, and propagates much longer.

For example, cofilin is implicated in severing and depolymerization of aged actin filaments in lamellipodia. However, those actin filaments are often bound with tropomyosin (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gunning et al., 2008</a>), which inhibits binding of cofilin and protects the filaments from cofilin's severing and depolymerizing activities (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein and Bamburg, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ono and Ono, 2002</a>). If cofilin forms a small cluster at a vacant site on an actin filament that is otherwise decorated and protected by tropomyosin, the cluster would induce, or apply conformational stress to induce, supertwisting on the neighboring tropomyosin-bound segment on the pointed-end side. This would accelerate dissociation of tropomyosin, resulting in faster growth of the cofilin cluster than when cluster growth needed to wait for spontaneous dissociation of neighboring tropomyosin molecules. Furthermore, that cluster growth is directed only to the pointed-end may be beneficial in selective disassembly of aged actin filaments."

It should be noted, however, that formin bound to the barbed-end of an actin filament also allosterically changes the structure of the filament (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bugyi et al., 2006</a>), which may interfere with the interactions of the filament with cofilin, independent of mechanically forced untwisting of the filament helix."

In brief, a low-pass filter to remove spike noise and a flattening filter to make the xy-plane flat were applied to individual images. The position and height of the peak within each half helix were determined semi-automatically using the following steps. First, the most probable highest point near a crossover point was selected manually. Second, the actual highest point was automatically determined by searching a 5 \u00d7 5 pixel area (typically 7.5 \u00d7 7.5 nm<sup>2</sup>) around the selected point. Third, the peak position was refined based on a center of mass calculation using information on the heights and positions within the 5 \u00d7 5 pixel area around the selected point, after which the refined peak position and height were used to represent the peak of the half helix."

This mixture was then added to F buffer containing sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) so that the concentration of actin was 0.5\u20131 \u00b5M and that of Pi was 5 mM, and a drop of this solution was immediately placed on a copper grid. The samples were fixed and negatively stained using a solution containing 1% uranyl acetate and 20 \u00b5g/ml bacitracin (<a href=\"#bib30\">Katayama, 1989</a>). The fixed samples were dried under an incandescent lamp to form films over the holes of the grid.

This method offers unprecedented resolution for studying the process in real time, so there is no question about the technical advance over previous methods. They show that cofilin forms clusters along actin filaments and discovered that the shortened helical pitch propagates to the neighboring 'cofilin-free' zone towards the filament pointed end. Furthermore, they demonstrate that cofilin clusters grew unidirectionally towards the filament pointed end. Finally, they show that severing most frequently occurs within the cofilin clusters (&gt;50%), while 1/3 of severing events were observed to occur near these clusters. Because of the critical importance of cofilin severing in nearly all actin cytoskeleton activities, these findings have general relevance and interest for the readers of <i>eLife</i>.

However, we did not detect severing in the presence of 10 cofilin, and only very infrequently in 20 nM. In the presence of cofilin higher than 500 nM, binding was so rapid that it was difficult to follow the growth of cofilin clusters even by HS-AFM, but we did confirm that severing is very infrequent in the presence of 500 nM cofilin and almost not at all in 1 \u00b5M. Thus, we also found that intermediate concentrations of cofilin (around 40-200 nM) are optimum for severing, although we do not have quantitative data. This is qualitatively consistent with Andrianantoandro and Pollard\u2019s finding. However, our optimum concentrations are higher by several-fold, and we can only speculate that this discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental conditions. In Andrianantoandro\u2019s experiments, actin filaments were immobilized by small number of NEM-myosin molecules, while in our experiments, actin filaments were attracted to the positively charged lipid membrane. Furthermore, in Andrianantoandro\u2019s experiments, actin filaments were chemically labeled with fluorophores. All these may affect the state of actin filaments in different manners. In addition, movements of actin filaments are more or less restricted to two-dimension on the lipid surface under our conditions. Furthermore, Andrianantoandro reported that the severing activity is dependent on filament length, and it is plausible that our filaments were shorter than Andrianantoandro\u2019s."
