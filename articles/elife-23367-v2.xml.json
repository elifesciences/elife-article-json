Little is known about how T-tubules maintain highly organized structures and contacts throughout the contractile system despite the ongoing muscle remodeling that occurs with muscle atrophy, damage and aging. We uncovered an essential role for autophagy in T-tubule remodeling with genetic screens of a developmentally regulated remodeling program in Drosophila abdominal muscles. Here, we show that autophagy is both upregulated with and required for progression through T-tubule disassembly stages. Along with known mediators of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, our screens uncovered an unexpected shared role for Rab2 with a broadly conserved function in autophagic clearance. Rab2 localizes to autophagosomes and binds to HOPS complex members, suggesting a direct role in autophagosome tethering/fusion. Together, the high membrane flux with muscle remodeling permits unprecedented analysis both of T-tubule dynamics and fundamental trafficking mechanisms."

Little is known about how T-tubules maintain highly organized structures and contacts throughout the contractile system despite the ongoing muscle remodeling that occurs with muscle atrophy, damage and aging. We uncovered an essential role for autophagy in T-tubule remodeling with genetic screens of a developmentally regulated remodeling program in Drosophila abdominal muscles. Here, we show that autophagy is both upregulated with and required for progression through T-tubule disassembly stages. Along with known mediators of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, our screens uncovered an unexpected shared role for Rab2 with a broadly conserved function in autophagic clearance. Rab2 localizes to autophagosomes and binds to HOPS complex members, suggesting a direct role in autophagosome tethering/fusion. Together, the high membrane flux with muscle remodeling permits unprecedented analysis both of T-tubule dynamics and fundamental trafficking mechanisms."

Myofibril bundles of sarcomeres provide the contractile force. The power of contraction, however, requires synchronous sarcomere function under control of the \u2018excitation-contraction coupling\u2019 system that includes two membranous organelles, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and Transverse (T)-tubules (<a href=\"#bib3\">Al-Qusairi and Laporte, 2011</a>). The T-tubule membrane network is continuous with the muscle cell plasma membrane, with tubulated membranes that invaginate radially inward in a repeated pattern at each sarcomere. With excitation-contraction coupling, neuromuscular action potentials are transmitted along the muscle T-tubule membrane to the SR junction, or dyad/triad, triggering coordinated SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and synchronous sarcomere contractions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Al-Qusairi and Laporte, 2011</a>). Formation of organized T-tubule membranes is thus critical for muscle function (<a href=\"#bib77\">Takeshima et al., 2015</a>). Mechanisms must also remodel the T-tubule membrane network with ongoing myofiber reorganization in response to muscle use, damage, atrophy and aging. However, the extent and mechanisms of T-tubule remodeling remain largely unknown, in part due to challenges with observing T-tubule membrane network dynamics within intact mammalian myofibers."

In mouse skeletal muscle, mostly longitudinal tubular membranes initially present in embryonic muscle are remodeled postnatally with expansion to predominantly transversal tubular elements (<a href=\"#bib76\">Takekura et al., 2001</a>). In contrast, both longitudinal and transversal T-tubule elements are maintained in adult mammalian cardiac muscle (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brette and Orchard, 2003</a>) and in insect muscles (<a href=\"#bib68\">Razzaq et al., 2001</a>). Relatively few molecular factors are known to shape the T-tubule network, and perhaps not surprisingly, all of which so far encode for membrane-associated functions (CAV3, DYSF, BIN1/Amph2, MTM1, DNM2) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Butler et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hnia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Morlot and Roux, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tang et al., 1996</a>). Mutations in each also are associated with human myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy with T-tubule disorganization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bashir et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Betz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bitoun et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Laporte et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Liu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Minetti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nicot et al., 2007</a>), pointing to the critical importance of membrane-mediated mechanisms to maintain the T-tubule membrane network."

The BIN1 BAR-domain protein has a conserved function involved in membrane tubulation required for T-tubule formation that was first described for the single Drosophila homolog, Amphiphysin (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lee et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Razzaq et al., 2001</a>). The <i>amph</i> null mutant flies lack transversal T-tubule element membranes in myofibers at all developmental stages, corresponding with both larval and adult mobility defects (<a href=\"#bib68\">Razzaq et al., 2001</a>). In contrast, the <i>myotubularin</i> (<i>mtm</i>) fly homolog of mammalian MTM1/MTMR2/MTMR1 subfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate phosphatases is required only at later stages in development for T-tubule remodeling. While <i>mtm</i> loss of function has no obvious effects on larval muscle T-tubule organization or function, <i>mtm-</i>depleted post-larval stage muscles lack transversal T-tubule membranes with adult mobility defects in eclosion and flight (<a href=\"#bib69\">Ribeiro et al., 2011</a>). Together, the <i>amph</i> and <i>mtm</i> mutant conditions that both lack transversal T-tubule elements in post-larval stage muscle yet different early development requirements underscores that distinct mechanisms are involved in T-tubule formation (<i>amph</i>-dependent) versus maintenance/remodeling (<i>amph-</i> and <i>mtm-</i>dependent)."

We previously showed that wildtype IOMs undergo dramatic cortical and membrane remodeling with costamere integrin adhesion complex disassembly and reassembly at discrete pupal stages (<a href=\"#bib69\">Ribeiro et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the <i>mtm-</i>depleted IOMs exhibited persistent disassembly or a block in reassembly of integrin costameres along with the loss of transversal T-tubule membranes at late pupal stages, but without any precocious cell death (<a href=\"#bib69\">Ribeiro et al., 2011</a>). A striking feature in the <i>mtm-</i>depleted IOMs was the accumulation of endosomal-like membranes decorated with integrin and T-tubule markers, Amph and Discs large (Dlg1, a PDZ protein). Altogether, these results suggest that T-tubule membranes may undergo disassembly-reassembly with normal myofiber remodeling, including the delivery of disassembled T-tubule membrane into an endomembrane trafficking pathway. The role for a molecular-cellular program in control of T-tubule remodeling that is at least partially distinct from that involved in initial T-tubule formation raises many questions about possible mechanisms, including the regulation of T-tubule organization and dynamics, the membrane fate(s) and source(s) with disassembly-reassembly, respectively, and the specific membrane trafficking routes and effectors involved. Possible hints may come from studies of other specialized dynamic cell membrane invaginations shown to involve endosomal and Golgi membrane trafficking pathways, such as cellularization of Drosophila syncytial embryos (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee and Harris, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Pelissier et al., 2003</a>) and the tubulated demarcation membrane system in megakaryocyte platelet formation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Eckly et al., 2014</a>)."

The different Rabs are under distinct spatiotemporal regulation for recruitment, activation and functions at specific membrane compartments or domains. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) convert specific inactive GDP-bound Rabs to an active GTP-bound form. Active Rab-GTP then recruits a range of specific effector proteins to the membrane that mediate key trafficking functions, including cargo selection, vesicle budding, transport, tethering and fusion. Subsequently, GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) deactivate Rabs by promoting GTP hydrolysis. Many membrane compartments have been defined by well-established localized functions of specific Rabs, for example: ER (Rab1), Golgi (Rab1, Rab6), secretory vesicles (Rab8), early endosomes (Rab5, Rab21), recycling endosomes (Rab11, Rab35), late endosomes (Rab7, Rab9), lysosomes (Rab7) and others (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jean and Kiger, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Stenmark, 2009</a>). Thus, identifying the specific Rabs required for a cellular process can provide clues to potential underlying membrane trafficking mechanisms involved. However, examples exist of Rabs with multiple known sites of function or yet unknown functions, and conversely, certain cellular processes \u2013 like T-tubule remodeling \u2013 lack defined roles yet for any Rabs."

Our results show that the entire contractile and excitation-contraction coupling system, including T-tubules, are disassembled and reassembled in IOMs during Drosophila metamorphosis. We found that autophagy, the membrane trafficking process for degradation of cytoplasmic contents by delivery to lysosomes, is upregulated with IOM remodeling where it plays an indispensable role for progression through T-tubule disassembly to reassembly. Our genetic analysis of IOM remodeling also reveals an unexpected and broad role for Rab2 in autophagy in flies and mammals. From our data, we propose that Rab2 localizes to autophagosomes where it interacts with the HOPS complex, which in turn, mediates tethering and trans-SNARE complex formation with Rab7-marked lysosomes to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Together, these results show that Drosophila IOM remodeling provides an unprecedented in vivo context for discovery and analysis of T-tubule dynamics with relevance to human myopathy, as well as an ideal system due to high membrane flux to study fundamental trafficking pathways."

It was unexpected, however, to find a shared RNAi phenotype between this set of known functions and Rab2, which had been implicated with functions at the ER and Golgi (<a href=\"#bib72\">Saraste, 2016</a>). The specificity of the Rab2 RNAi phenotype was confirmed by rescue with co-expression of a wildtype Rab2 transgene (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). From this, we speculated that the \u2018Rab2 class\u2019 of shared phenotypes was in each case a result of a block in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. To explore this possibility, we tested a requirement for the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex that is known to mediate SNARE-dependent autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tak\u00e1ts et al., 2014</a>). As expected, disruption of the HOPS complex with RNAi of subunits, <i>Vps39</i>, <i>Vps18</i>, and <i>Vps11</i> each phenocopied the specific Rab2 class of IOM defects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results suggest that a defect in autophagosome-lysosome fusion leads to the unique Rab2 class of RNAi phenotypes in IOM remodeling and predicts a novel role for Rab2 in autophagy."

The mCherry:GFP:Atg8a autophagic flux reporter indicates both dually-labeled Atg8-marked autophagosomes and, due to the greater resistance of mCherry than GFP to lysosomal proteases, the successful delivery of autophagosomes to the lysosome by mCherry-labeled autolysosomes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kimura et al., 2007</a>). In control IOMs, there were dual mCherry-GFP-positive autophagosomes, as well as just mCherry-positive degradative autolysosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, the <i>Rab2</i>, <i>Rab7</i> and <i>Stx17</i> RNAi IOMs contained a striking increase in dual mCherry-GFP-positive puncta (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>), showing that autophagosome clearance was severely blocked either due to accumulation of autophagosomes or nondegradative autolysosomes. The Stx17 SNARE localizes to the outer membrane of fully formed autophagosomes then detaches upon lysosomal degradation of the autophagosomal inner membrane (<a href=\"#bib30\">Itakura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Tsuboyama et al., 2016</a>). In the RNAi conditions, Stx17 localized to the vesicle membranes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) also marked with Atg8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; 0.53 Pearson correlation), indicating their identity as primarily mature autophagosomes. Confirming these results, TEM myofiber transverse sections (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) revealed <i>Rab2</i>, <i>Rab7</i> or <i>Stx17</i> RNAi-depleted IOMs similarly and uniformly filled with thousands of accumulated autophagosomes carrying nondegraded cytoplasm and organelles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013F</a>). Thus, similar to previous reports of Rab7, Stx17, SNAP29 and Vamp7/8 functions in other Drosophila tissues\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Heged\u0171s et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Tak\u00e1ts et al., 2013</a>), with myofiber remodeling, Rab2 also is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion."

In wildtype animals, we used imaging to monitor the amount of autophagosomes (GFP:Atg8) and endolysosomes/autolysosomes (GFP:Lamp1, GFP:Rab7) in live IOMs over 24h intervals of metamorphosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The number of Atg8 puncta indicative of autophagosomes dramatically increased by 1d APF and then sharply decreased by 3d APF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, top row and 6B). We confirmed a similar autophagosome distribution detected by immunostaining of endogenous Atg8 in wildtype IOMs at 1d APF (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results parallel the increased prevalence of uniformly sized mCD8:GFP-marked vesicles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and autophagosomes detected by TEM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>) over 1-3d APF during wildtype IOM remodeling. Likewise, the number of Lamp1 and Rab7 marked endolysosomes or amphisomes/autolysosomes also increased during pupal stages 1d-3d APF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Importantly, the increase in autophagy at 1d APF does not reflect an autophagy role in myofiber cell death, as the IOMs normally survive throughout metamorphosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>) and assist days later with adult eclosion (<a href=\"#bib69\">Ribeiro et al., 2011</a>)."

These knockdown IOMs remained persistently blocked at an 18\u201320h stage in remodeling throughout metamorphosis."

In the case of the Rab2 class of RNAi phenotypes, T-tubule disassembly at 18\u201324h APF occurred in conjunction with an abnormal accumulation of uniformly-sized mCD8:GFP vesicles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, middle row; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, top rows), many of which were identified as Atg8-marked autophagosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). In contrast, the Atg1 class of RNAi phenotypes showed normal timing in initial T-tubule membrane disassembly at 18\u201320h APF, but with abnormally large clusters of bright mCD8:GFP-positive membrane patches (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). By 1d APF, the bright membrane clusters increased in size to reveal stacked membrane whirls that persisted to 4d APF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, bottom row; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, bottom row; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Together with the lack of T-tubules and autophagosomes in IOMs with autophagy disruption at 4d APF (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), these results indicate that autophagy plays a key role downstream of initiation and membrane scission in T-tubule disassembly for subsequent mobilization of disassembled T-tubule-derived membranes."

Unlike in myofibers, TEM analysis of Rab2-depleted fat body indicated the site of accumulated autophagic cargo at late stages of autophagy with an increased number and size of amphisomes or autolysosomes, often with nondegraded cytoplasmic contents (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F</a>).

This indicates that Rab2A/B are required for amphisome-lysosome fusion or autophagic clearance at autolysosomes, however, are not essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion in MEFs. To test if the accumulation of autolysosomes results from a defect in lysosomal function, we used \u2018mosaic analysis\u2019 by mixing unmarked parental cells and stably GFP-marked Rab2A/B_DKO MEFs to compare effects of both genotypes side by side in the exact same condition. Consistent with a block in autophagy flux, Rab2A/B_DKO MEFs (GFP+) had more LC3 puncta than seen in parental MEFs (GFP-) grown in a mosaic culture (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). There was no difference between parental and Rab2A/B_DKO MEFs in lysosome functions needed for degradation, as indicated by number and size of acidified compartments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>; LysoTracker) or by Cathepsin B activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>; Magic Red). Furthermore, there was no difference between parental and Rab2A/B_DKO MEFs in the kinetics or levels of ligand-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation, an established indicator of lysosomal activity (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2H\u2013I</a>). Thus, overall lysosomal maturation appears unaffected by Rab2A/B_DKO despite a block in autophagic clearance. Collectively, a conserved Rab2 function is indispensable for autophagic flux, which for Rab2A/B is required after autophagosome delivery in MEFs."

Colocalization between YFP:Rab2 and mCherry:Atg8 confirmed autophagosome identity of Rab2-marked compartments in <i>Rab7</i> RNAi IOMs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013D</a>). These results indicate that Rab2 localizes to autophagosomes in fly IOMs. Similarly in MEFs, both Rab2A and Rab2B significantly colocalized with LC3 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Immuno-EM also identified colocalization of endogenous LC3 and GFP:Rab2A on the same membranes of autophagic structures with the typical appearance of autophagosomes containing undigested contents (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). It is established that LC3 localizes to mature autophagosomes as well as the isolation membrane, an elongating pre-autophagosome structure (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kabeya et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Mizushima et al., 2001</a>) marked by Atg16L1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Mizushima et al., 2003</a>). To assess to what extent Rab2A/B localizes to the isolation membranes and/or autophagosomes, we examined colocalization between Atg16L1, LC3 and GFP:Rab2A/B. Rab2A/B colocalized well with LC3 but not noticeably with Atg16L1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). Rab2A/B also did not colocalize with Lamp1, a late endosome-lysosome marker (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). Colocalization analysis among Rab2A, Rab7 and LC3 or Lamp1 revealed that Rab2A and Rab7 preferentially localized to autophagosomes and endolysosomes, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013L</a>).

In starved MEFs, recruitment of CFP:LC3 preceded YFP:Rab2 by several minutes (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), consistent with Rab2A localization to autophagosomes but not isolation membranes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013H</a>). In turn, recruitment of YFP:Rab2A to autophagosomes preceded CFP:Stx17 by several minutes in most cases (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), suggesting that Rab2A localization is independent of Stx17. Consistent with the timing of Rab2A recruitment, Drosophila Rab2 localization at autophagosomes was unaffected by <i>Rab7</i>, <i>Stx17</i> or <i>Vps39</i> RNAi in IOMs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013C</a>). Since Rab2 has affinity with the HOPS complex, we tested whether <i>Rab2</i> RNAi affects the recruitment of HOPS to autophagosomes. As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tak\u00e1ts et al., 2014</a>), Dor, a fly homolog of the Vps18 HOPS complex component, colocalized with GFP:Atg8 in control IOMs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). In contrast, this colocalization was diminished by <i>Rab2</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>), indicating that Rab2 is important for recruitment of the HOPS complex to autophagosomes. Collectively, Rab2 is an autophagosome-associated Rab GTPase that promotes autophagosome-lysosome fusion through interactions with the HOPS complex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>), and T-tubule remodeling requires a high volume of membrane flux through the autophagy pathway."

However, the dynamics and mechanisms that shape the T-tubule membrane network are largely unexplored, in part due to methodological challenges in many systems. In the present study, we characterized a wildtype myofiber remodeling program by confocal and electron microscopy in intact muscles in vivo. In Drosophila IOMs during metamorphosis, the entire contractile and excitation-contraction coupling system, including T-tubules, are disassembled and then reassembled. This process highlights that myofibers harbor distinct programs for initial T-tubule formation versus regulated T-tubule remodeling. This likely includes additional mechanisms for T-tubule membrane disassembly and renovation, features that reflect those seen with mammalian myofiber atrophy and recovery (<a href=\"#bib65\">Piccirillo et al., 2014</a>). We demonstrate that the Drosophila body wall muscles provide an unprecedented system permitting a combination of powerful visualization and systematic perturbation analysis, including the first genetic screens, of T-tubule dynamics and organization. We uncovered both that autophagy is indispensable for the remodeling, and that Rab2 plays an unexpected role at autophagosomes for autophagic clearance in this process and in broader contexts."

Further, disruption of autophagy initiation, autophagosome formation or clearance all induced loss of T-tubules with a block in IOM remodeling at/after T-tubule disassembly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). As far as we know, this is the first report of a non-cell death role of autophagy in Drosophila metamorphosis. The role of autophagy in IOMs that persist and redifferentiate during metamorphosis is clearly different from its roles in pupal midgut and salivary gland cells that undergo autophagic forms of cell death (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berry and Baehrecke, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Das et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lee et al., 2002a</a>). There are multiple speculative direct or indirect role(s) for autophagy specifically in T-tubule membrane remodeling: (1) a direct role in T-tubule membrane recycling, as a means to deliver disassembled T-tubule membrane via autophagosomes to lysosomes or related organelles for intracellular storage, then later redeployed to contribute to T-tubule reassembly; (2) an indirect role in cell renovation, including T-tubule membrane clearance, to permit cell space for redifferentiation; or (3) an indirect role in cell metabolism, to support cell survival and/or the energy cost of redifferentiation with starvation during metamorphosis. Most likely, autophagy serves some combination of these roles in IOM remodeling."

This suggests that mCD8:GFP localizes to autophagosomes during IOM remodeling. It is possible that T-tubule membranes are a source of autophagosomal membrane, at least in part: mCD8:GFP labels the muscle plasma membrane and T-tubules in larval muscle precursor cells of IOMs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), and T-tubule disassembly coincides with the upregulation in autophagy early in metamorphosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>).

In the absence of autophagy initiation, mCD8:GFP-positive stacked membranes were observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), likely retained or partially disassembled T-tubules. We propose that T-tubules are remodeled through autophagosomes. It is important to note that T-tubules are not an apparent autophagic cargo, but instead, a possible source of autophagosome membrane. In this scenario, T-tubules are disassembled into autophagosomes and then reassembled from subsequent autolysosome-related structures (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>), both of which successively increased in numbers during wildtype IOM remodeling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

Extensive IOM atrophy with nearly complete disassembly of the contractile and excitation-contraction systems by 1d APF is followed by a rapid re-differentiation within hours after 3.5d APF. Autophagy could be required to simply clear away and degrade the old contraction systems in order to make space to rebuild and realign new systems, as well as permit the normal central repositioning of nuclei away from the myofiber cortex. However, the persistent block in early IOM remodeling with autophagy disruption suggests that the remodeling normally proceeds through a progression of interrelated steps rather than independent programs for disassembly and reassembly. Autophagy also has a well-established role in metabolic homeostasis through the recycling of amino acids and turnover of damaged mitochondria in the lysosome. Our data suggests that mitochondria are a major autophagic cargo with IOM remodeling. In conditions that disrupted autophagy initiation (<i>Atg1, Atg18</i> RNAi), the cytoplasm was abnormally filled with mitochondria in IOMs at 4d APF (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consistent with that, a significant portion of autophagosomes harbored intact mitochondria when autophagosome-lysosome fusion was blocked (<i>Rab2, Rab7 or Stx17 RNAi;</i> <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This is different from observations in larval muscle, in which mitochondria were notably absent in autophagosomes that accumulated with a block in autophagy (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zirin et al., 2013</a>). It is possible that mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy for mitochondrial turnover, is upregulated and could play both metabolic and cell renovation roles in IOM remodeling. Interestingly, the autophagy-blocked IOMs remained viable throughout metamorphosis, suggesting that autophagy is not absolutely required for cell survival through the starvation with metamorphosis."

The striking Rab2 RNAi IOM phenotype was shared with RNAi of other functions known to be specifically required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Genetic blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion resulted in a dramatic phenotype, with massive accumulations of autophagosomes within IOMs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Previously, autophagosome-lysosome fusion was shown to involve the cooperative functions of Rab7, the HOPS tethering complex, and a trans-SNARE complex between Stx17, SNAP29 and VAMP7/8 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shen and Mizushima, 2014</a>). Among these tethering and fusion functions, it has been shown that Stx17 (a hairpin SNARE) is recruited to autophagosomal membranes, while Rab7 and VAMP7/8 localize to endolysosomal membranes. Stx17 localizes to autophagosomes as well as to the ER and mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib30\">Itakura et al., 2012</a>), but the HOPS complex directly associates and colocalizes with Stx17 only at autophagosomes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tak\u00e1ts et al., 2014</a>).

We envision that upon completion of autophagosome biogenesis/maturation, Rab2 and Stx17 are recruited to the outer autophagosomal membrane. Then, the HOPS complex is subsequently recruited to autophagosomes in a Rab2-depedent manner through coincident interactions with both Stx17 and Rab2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013E</a>). At the same time, the HOPS complex binds Rab7 on lysosomes. In turn, the HOPS complex tethers autophagosomes and lysosomes to promote trans-SNARE complex formation between Stx17, SNAP29 and Vamp7/8 and ultimately autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>)."

The localization of Rab2 on autophagosomes in Drosophila IOMs was conserved for both Rab2A and Rab2B in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). As in flies, the Rab2A/2B double knockout led to a delay or block in autophagy clearance as indicated by accumulation of LC3/Atg8. However, the specific Rab2 loss-of-function phenotypes were not identical. While Rab2 was required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion in fly IOMs, the Rab2A/2B double knockouts in MEFs indicated a requirement at a later step in autophagic clearance. Interestingly, this disparity in autophagy phenotypes across species is also seen with Rab7. In flies and yeast, Rab7/Ypt7 is essential for autophagosome-lyososome/vacuole fusion (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kirisako et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heged\u0171s et al., 2016</a>), while mammalian Rab7 knockdowns more clearly indicate a required role in autolysosome maturation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gutierrez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">J\u00e4ger et al., 2004</a>).

First, it is suggested that autophagosomes sequentially fuse with endosomes then lysosomes to become amphisomes and autolysosomes, respectively. If either of the steps requires Rab2A/2B, then intermediates with partially degraded contents could accumulate in double knockout MEFs. Alternatively, an autophagosome may normally fuse with multiple lysosomes to ensure full degradation of its contents (<a href=\"#bib83\">Tsuboyama et al., 2016</a>). In the absence of Rab2A/2B in MEFs, autophagosomes could still fuse but not with a sufficient number of lysosomes, resulting in an accumulation of partially digested autolysosomes."

Thus, it is likely that Rab2 exerts multiple functions through interaction with different effectors at different places. We do not exclude a possible Rab2 function in the endosome-lysosome system that affects autophagic flux, although we did not detect clear lysosomal defects in Rab2A/B knockout MEFs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013I</a>).

Jumpy/MTMR14 PI3-phosphatase and Dynamin-2 (DNM2) GTPase, two causative genes of human centronuclear myopathy, are required for not only T-tubule maintenance but also proper progression of autophagy (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dowling et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Durieux et al., 2012</a>).

One exception was for TEM analyses, which were performed on two parallel replicates with multiple animals each. All replicate experiments were performed in parallel with wildtype controls. RNAi phenotypes for the \u2018Rab2 class\u2019 were fully penetrant. Data shown is representative and inclusive of all results for procedures with properly performing experimental controls. Pearson correlation measurements for co-localization quantification were performed with ImageJ software (<a href=\"https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/\">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</a>)\u00a0for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>. For each combination, ten 30 \u00d7 30 \u03bcm cropped images taken from different animals were used. Quantification of autophagic flux with mCherry:GFP:Atg8a was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tak\u00e1ts et al., 2013</a>). Quantification of the number of autophagosomes, autolysosomes or mitochondria in TEM images was performed as follows: double-membrane bound structures with undigested cytoplasmic contents (autophagosomes), single membrane bound structures with electron dense cytoplasmic contents (autolysosomes) or mitochondria were quantified manually and normalized to the area of section as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>. For each genotype, ten images taken from multiple animals were used. GFP:Atg8 puncta in IOMs were quantified manually and then normalized to the IOM area for <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and D</a>. To measure T-tubule area in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, we manually set a threshold where the dimmest tubules were visible and plasma membrane and other brighter structures were excluded. More than 10 images were used for the quantification. LC3 puncta quantification in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Itoh et al., 2011</a>) using ImageJ. Thirty cells were quantified for each condition. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired <i>t</i> test. Colocalization of puncta was counted manually in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F and H</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, only taking into account overlapping structures with a similar shape in relevant fluorescent channels. Ten images were quantified for each combination. p-values&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant."

The authors then used IOMs to screen factors required for T-tubule remodeling and revealed that RNAi of Rab2, Rab7, STX17, SNAP29 or VAMP7/8 causes accumulation of small vesicles positive for the T-tubule marker mCD8. They further provided evidence to show that Rab2 is essential for autophagosome maturation. Rab2 localizes to autophagosomes and binds to the HOPS complex. This manuscript includes two relatively separate parts, one on autophagy in T-tubule remodeling and another on the role of Rab2 in autophagosome tethering/fusion.

In this study, authors performed RNAi screen for Rab GTPases, Arf GTPases, sorting nexins, BAR domain proteins, SNARE proteins, and phosphoinositide regulators that may affect T-tubule membrane remodeling. Rab2, Rab7, Stx17, SNAP29, VAMP7/8 and components of HOPS complex functions were found to be involved in T-tubule remodeling.

Through an RNAi screen of 300 lines, the authors found that silencing of Rab2, Rab7, Syntaxin17, Syntaxin7/8 or SNAP29 resulted in a similar phenotype with the T-tubule marker mCD8:GFP found on small vesicles in IOMs. The four latter proteins have previously been implicated in autophagy, and the authors found that silencing of Rab2 also inhibits autophagic flux. Autophagy was indeed found to be upregulated during early metamorphosis, which coincided with IOM remodeling, and muscle-targeted silencing of autophagy proteins resulted in disorganized and fragmented T-tubules in IOMs along with accumulation of mitochondria. The authors also found that knockout of Rab2A and Rab2B gives an autophagic phenotype in MEFs, confirming a conserved role for Rab2 in autophagy. Both Rab2A and Rab2B were found to co-IP with components of the mammalian HOPS complex, and co-localization between Rab2 and Atg8/LC3 were found in both IOMs and mammalian cells. The authors conclude that autophagy plays a crucial role in T-tubule remodeling and propose that Rab2 recruits the HOPS complex to autophagosome membranes to mediate autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Both the two main findings in this manuscript are novel and interesting, but some of the data need to be strengthened in order to support the conclusions."

While initiation and membrane scission of T-tubule disassembly were indicated by proper timing in the onset of membrane reorganization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and subsequent lack of T-tubule membranes continuous with the plasma membrane (now <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>), the disruption of autophagy functions consistently altered the pattern in T-tubule-derived membrane at/after 18h APF. Interestingly, the genetic block of autophagy initiation (<i>Atg1, Atg3, Atg18</i> RNAi) resulted in an accumulation of mCD8:GFP-positive stacked membranes that enlarged over time in the absence of autophagy, while block of a step in autophagy clearance (<i>Rab2, Rab7, Stx17</i> RNAi) resulted in an accumulation of mCD8:GFP-marked autophagosomes. Altogether, autophagy is required for proper disassembly and subsequent mobilization of T-tubule membranes, potentially as a contributing source to autophagosome membranes."
