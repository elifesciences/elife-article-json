Complicating this task is the wide assortment of potential pathogens that the host may encounter, combined with the ability of most pathogens to readily evolve to escape the host's immune system. This \"moving target\" requires evolutionary innovation on the part of the host, which is a tall order for vertebrates because they evolve sluggishly."

Human IFIT1 protein, by contrast, is not tricked by the disguise and targets both cap0 and cap1 viral mRNAs. This suggests that human IFIT1 protein recognizes viral mRNA by a different and as-yet-unknown means. A simple explanation for this difference could be that functional specialization, perhaps driven by challenges from different pathogens, drove the <i>IFIT1</i> gene to diverge in the mouse and human lineages. This would make the <i>IFIT1</i> genes orthologs."

This analysis pointed to a gene duplication event that occurred at the <i>IFIT1</i> locus early in mammalian evolution, more than 100 million years ago. This means that mouse <i>IFIT1</i> and human <i>IFIT1</i> are paralogs (caused by a gene duplication event) rather than orthologs (caused by a speciation event), so the authors renamed the mouse gene <i>IFIT1B</i>."

To do this, they made use of the fact that budding yeast produces only cap0 structures (<a href=\"#bib1\">Banerjee, 1980</a>). When they expressed mouse IFIT1B in yeast, it targeted cap0 mRNA, in turn inhibiting growth of the yeast, as expected. Growth was rescued when human cap1-methyltransferase was co-expressed with IFIT1B (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Human IFIT1, on the other hand, behaved differently. Like mouse IFIT1B, it also inhibited cap0 mRNA and inhibited the growth of the yeast: however, growth was not rescued by co-expressing cap1-methyltransferase. This suggests that IFIT1 depends on something other than cap status to find its target mRNAs. Interestingly, orthologs of IFIT1B from two primates \u2013 gibbons and African green monkeys \u2013 exhibited the same cap0-targeting behavior as mouse IFIT1B, despite rodents and primates having diverged more than 100 million years ago. Human IFIT1B, by contrast, has lost this particular function."

Such loci frequently undergo duplication, recombination, and gene conversion events (<a href=\"#bib5\">Eir\u00edn-L\u00f3pez et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Nei et\u00a0al., 1997</a>)\u00a0that can significantly alter the immune repertoire of various species. Gene duplication events, in particular, can result in relaxed selective pressure on one of the copies, allowing the acquisition of novel functions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Lynch and Conery, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ohno, 1970</a>). As shown here, such an event is the likely basis for the different functions of IFIT1 and IFIT1B. Indeed, based on this study, these two genes appear to have been the most active of the mammalian <i>IFIT</i> genes, undergoing frequent gene birth and loss, as well as recurrent homogenization."
