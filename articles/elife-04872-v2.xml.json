In animals, the ISR is antagonised by selective eIF2\u03b1 phosphatases comprising a catalytic protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) subunit in complex with a PPP1R15-type regulatory subunit. An unbiased search for additional conserved components of the PPP1R15-PP1 phosphatase identified monomeric G-actin. Like PP1, G-actin associated with the functional core of PPP1R15 family members and G-actin depletion, by the marine toxin jasplakinolide, destabilised the endogenous PPP1R15A-PP1 complex. The abundance of the ternary PPP1R15-PP1-G-actin complex was responsive to global changes in the polymeric status of actin, as was its eIF2\u03b1-directed phosphatase activity, while localised G-actin depletion at sites enriched for PPP1R15 enhanced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and the downstream ISR. G-actin's role as a stabilizer of the PPP1R15-containing holophosphatase provides a mechanism for integrating signals regulating actin dynamics with stresses that trigger the ISR."

In animals, the ISR is antagonised by selective eIF2\u03b1 phosphatases comprising a catalytic protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) subunit in complex with a PPP1R15-type regulatory subunit. An unbiased search for additional conserved components of the PPP1R15-PP1 phosphatase identified monomeric G-actin. Like PP1, G-actin associated with the functional core of PPP1R15 family members and G-actin depletion, by the marine toxin jasplakinolide, destabilised the endogenous PPP1R15A-PP1 complex. The abundance of the ternary PPP1R15-PP1-G-actin complex was responsive to global changes in the polymeric status of actin, as was its eIF2\u03b1-directed phosphatase activity, while localised G-actin depletion at sites enriched for PPP1R15 enhanced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and the downstream ISR. G-actin's role as a stabilizer of the PPP1R15-containing holophosphatase provides a mechanism for integrating signals regulating actin dynamics with stresses that trigger the ISR."

However, experiments that attempted to recreate this phosphatase activity using just these two subunits in a test tube failed to generate a working enzyme that specifically targeted the phosphate group of eIF2\u03b1. This suggests that in cells this enzyme contains an additional unknown subunit. Now, Chambers, Dalton et al.

Individual G-actin proteins can bind together to form long filaments, and signals that encourage a cell to divide or move also trigger the formation of actin filaments. This reduces the activity of the phosphatase enzyme by depriving it of a crucial component, i.e., free G-actin proteins. As such, the new mechanism described by Chambers, Dalton et al. suggests how growth and movement signals might also change a cell's sensitivity to stress. These findings may hopefully enable stressed cells to be targeted by drugs to treat disease; but future work is needed to clarify under what circumstances the integration of such signals into the stress response is beneficial to the cell."

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 complex recruits the initiator methionyl-tRNA to ribosomes in a GTP-dependent catalytic cycle, but phosphorylation of its alpha subunit (eIF2\u03b1) by a family of stress-sensing kinases inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange, attenuating translation initiation and with it, global protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clemens, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). During endoplasmic reticulum stress, the eIF2\u03b1 kinase PERK triggers attenuation of protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harding et al., 1999</a>), while other members of the family respond variously to amino acid deprivation, viral infection or heme deficiency (<a href=\"#bib46\">van 't Wout et al., 2014</a>). This ability of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to integrate signals from multiple, apparently unrelated, stresses led this pathway to be named the \u2018integrated stress response\u2019 (ISR) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harding et al., 2003</a>). Attenuated global protein synthesis is cytoprotective early in the stress response. The ISR also involves the translational induction of the transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, which activate a transcriptional programme that has pro-survival effects in the short term, whilst prolonged activation leads to a switch to apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zinszner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marciniak et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lu et al., 2014</a>)."

PPP1R15 family members share significant homology in their C-terminal conserved PP1-interacting domain, constituting a core functional domain sufficient to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 when over expressed in cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Malzer et al., 2013</a>).

The interaction with actin, thus maps to the conserved portion of PPP1R15 family members and is favoured by a short stretch of hydrophobic residues at the extreme C-terminus of this core.

The poor reactivity of the available antisera to actin and tendency of actin to associate non-specifically with immunoprecipitation reactions frustrated our efforts to detect actin associated with endogenous PPP1R15A in MEFs; however, treatment with jasplakinolide, which depleted the soluble pool of actin led to a marked loss of PP1 association with PPP1R15A in the stressed cells (compare lanes 2 and 3, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To test the converse interaction, PP1 was affinity purified from MEF lysates using microcystin\u2013agarose beads.

To extend these observations, cells were treated with the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin, which depletes the ER of calcium and rapidly and transiently activates the ER stress-inducible kinase PERK. As expected, this led to a robust yet transient phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by PERK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> lanes 1\u20136). The transient nature of this phosphorylation relates to the rectifying response of PERK on levels of ER stress, but also draws on the combined activities of constitutively expressed PPP1R15B and the induction of PPP1R15A that promote eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jousse et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Novoa et al., 2003</a>).

Thus, application of GSK2606414A to <i>Gcn2</i>\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts rapidly abrogates eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. To measure selectively the dephosphorylation phase of the stress response, PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was induced by thapsigargin and further phosphorylation was then blocked with the kinase inhibitor GSK2606414A. In the absence of kinase activity, the subsequent decay of the phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 signal reflects its de-phosphorylation (degradation of the protein is not observed over this time scale), which was markedly attenuated by jasplakinolide (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, compare lanes 1\u20135 with lanes 6\u201310 and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

In the context of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, it seemed particularly relevant to examine the effects of actin polymerisation in the vicinity of the ER membrane, where the majority of PPP1R15 is located (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brush et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Malzer et al., 2013</a>). Cells that conditionally expressed a constitutively active mutant of mDia2, a formin that stimulates localised polymerisation of F-actin (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pellegrin and Mellor, 2005</a>), were generated. To direct mDia2 to the same membranous compartments as PPP1R15, we fused the membrane-targeting domain of PPP1R15B (residues 1\u2013146, devoid of catalytic activity) to mDia2 and a GFP tag to facilitate visualisation of the fusion protein. Control cells were generated expressing a PPP1R15B (1\u2013146)-GFP fusion protein lacking mDia2. Induction of eGFP-PPP1R15B (1\u2013146)-mDia2 increased polymerisation of actin adjacent to the ER, as indicated by co-localisation of GFP fluorescence with phalloidin staining (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). In control cells, the GFP and phalloidin signals showed little correlation, but as expected, these became strongly correlated (indicating co-localisation) on expression of the mDia2 construct (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Immunoblot confirmed the expression of each fusion protein on treatment with doxycycline, but only the mDia2 construct led to the induction of ATF4 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> compare lanes 4\u20136 with 13\u201315). ISRIB, a small molecule that renders cells unresponsive to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sidrauski et al., 2013</a>), blocked formin-mediated induction of ATF4 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, compare lanes 15 and 16), validating ATF4 as an ISR marker in this assay."

During ER stress, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by PERK attenuates protein translation to offload the ER (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harding et al., 1999</a>). The degree of translational attenuation depends upon the intensity and the rapidity of ER stress (<a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2001</a>). Sudden and intense ER stress caused by depletion of ER calcium stores by thapsigargin induces marked inhibition of translation. In contrast, gradually escalating ER stress by the accumulation of unglycosylated proteins upon treatment with tunicamycin, attenuates translation less dramatically because induction of PPP1R15A limits the degree of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2001</a>). In control cells (expressing the bland eGFP-PPP1R15B [1\u2013146] targeting fragment), tunicamycin induced a transient and minor decrease in translation with a nadir at 2 hr (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, lane 5). By contrast, in cells expressing ER-targeted mDia2, tunicamycin led to a sustained drop in protein synthesis associated with a sustained increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, compare lanes 8 and 9). These experiments are consistent with a pool of G-actin localised in the vicinity of PPP1R15 in promoting eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation."

In this study, an unbiased approach identified actin as a conserved binding partner of PPP1R15. The affinities of actin for PPP1R15 lay within a physiologically relevant range such that fluctuations of the G:F actin ratio affected the amount of actin recovered in the complex. Alterations to the ratio of G:F actin at the site of PPP1R15 action were seen to modulate cellular sensitivity to ISR stimuli via changes in eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase activity. Collectively, these findings establish G-actin as an important regulator of PPP1R15-mediated eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation in vivo."

In mammalian cells, tubulin and HSP70 were consistently recovered in complex with overexpressed PPP1R15 and PPP1R15-containing fusion proteins. These interactions are less conserved across phyla than the PPP1R15-actin interaction. Furthermore, in vitro experiments in the accompanying manuscript demonstrate that addition of actin is sufficient to endow the PPP1R15-PP1 complex with selectivity towards eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Thus, while there is nothing in our observations to argue against tubulin or HSP70 joining the complex and modulating PPP1R15-directed phosphatase activity, the evidence at hand suggesting actin's relevance to the core activity of the eIF2\u03b1-directed phosphatase justifies the focus on actin."

Following polymerisation of actin to the barbed end of a filament, bound ATP is hydrolysed and eventually ADP-actin dissociates from the pointed end (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</a>). This dynamic is regulated by proteins that enhance depolymerisation, for example, ADF, or promote the recharging with ATP, which enhances the recycling of monomers, for example, profilin (<a href=\"#bib37\">Paavilainen et al., 2004</a>). Capping proteins prevent the consumption of monomers and so increase free G-actin concentrations, while severing proteins can lead to filament disassembly or nucleate more filament formation depending upon the context (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wear and Cooper, 2004</a>). In contrast, formins like mDia2 remain associated with the barbed end yet promote addition of actin monomers."

By depleting G-actin, growth signal-driven actin polymerisation releases MAL to enter the nucleus, bind SRF and activate target genes. Other examples include Phactr, a PP1 regulatory subunit whose cytoplasmic localisation depends upon G-actin binding (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wiezlak et al., 2012</a>) and RNA polymerases II and III for whom actin forms a scaffold for the assembly of enzyme complexes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kukalev et al., 2005</a>)."

This site is blocked by cytochalasin D, which inhibits such interactions. Latrunculin B increases the level of actin monomers by binding to a different site on G-actin, the nucleotide-binding cleft, and does not interfere with binding at the hydrophobic cleft. Our observation that cytochalasin D diminishes the recovery of actin in complex with PPP1R15, is consistent with interaction via the hydrophobic target-binding cleft. While the precise details remain to be worked out, structural and biochemical studies presented in the accompanying manuscript support this idea and further suggest the C-terminal most residues of the functional core of the PPP1R15 family members play an important role in actin engagement (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). A crystal structure obtained for the binary complex of PPP1R15B and PP1 demonstrated that the N-terminal half of PPP1R15's functional core extensively engages the surface of PP1 following an itinerary previously observed for the regulatory subunit PPP1R9/spinophilin (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ragusa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, the C-terminal portion of PPP1R15's functional core, implicated here in actin binding, was not observed in a high-resolution crystal structure of the PPP1R15B-PP1 binary complex, suggesting that this portion of PPP1R15B remained unstructured in the absence of actin. The crystal structure obtained for the 1:1:1 ternary complex of PPP1R15B-PP1-actin was of too low a resolution to identify these C-terminal residues of PPP1R15's functional core, but unaccounted for density observed in the cleft between lobes I and III of actin suggests a mode of engagement of actin by this portion of PPP1R15B that would be sensitive to disruption by cytochalasin, which binds to the same region of G-actin."

These two mechanisms are likely to work in concert and suggest a crucial role for G-actin in establishing a biologically relevant route to eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation."

The latter are particularly attractive given the evidence for crosstalk between the ISR and memory formation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ma et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sidrauski et al., 2013</a>)."

Yeasts rely on direct recruitment of the catalytic phosphatase subunit (Glc7p) to the eIF2 substrate, with no PPP1R15 intermediate (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rojas et al., 2014</a>), while PPP1R15 family proteins are apparent only in complex animals: insects and vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jousse et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Malzer et al., 2013</a>).

This study reveals that both PPP1R15 isoforms are poised to undergo post-translational regulation through changes in the polymeric status of actin. The focus here has been on the conserved functional core of PPP1R15, but there remains room for further modulation of both isoforms by their large, poorly characterised N-terminal regions. Our protein discovery effort has identified other interactors that may be unique to each isoform. Thus future studies to explore the possibility of differential regulation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase activity by the different paralogues and their unique interactors seem warranted."

In <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2013figure supplement 1</a> it can be seen that expression of this construct led to a marked increase in F-actin within the cell in a central distribution rather than the cortical arrangement observed in control cells.

Then, following the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we scaled up the input material for the immunoprecipitation to recover endogenous PPP1R15A at a quantity comparable to that of the over-expressed PPP1R15A and assayed for the associated actin. As shown in new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, comparable levels of actin were found, supporting the conclusion that actin is a functionally relevant constituent of the endogenous PPP1R15-containing complex."

While this does not exclude an ancillary role for tubulin or HSP70, parsimony justifies the focus on actin here. It is noteworthy however, that PPP1R15 proteins have extensive portions outside their functional core (which engages PP1 and actin and constitutes the specific eIF2\u03b1<sup>P</sup>-directed phosphatase). Thus there is nothing in our observations to argue against further component (tubulin, HSP70) joining the complex in high stoichiometry to regulate other aspects of its function."
