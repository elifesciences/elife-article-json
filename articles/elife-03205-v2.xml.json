These motors do not always follow a linear trajectory. Rather, they generate torque perpendicular to their direction of motion, resulting in a helical movement relative to the filament. Such helical movement was first observed in a filament gliding assay in which surface-immobilized <i>Tetrahymena</i> axonemal dynein motors rotated MTs about their principal axes while translocating them (<a href=\"#bib18\">Vale and Toyoshima, 1988</a>). Helical movement of cargoes has subsequently been demonstrated for several members of the myosin and kinesin superfamilies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Nishizaka et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Nitzsche et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Yajima et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bormuth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brunnbauer et al., 2012</a>)."

Despite its importance, key aspects of dynein's mechanism remain unclear, including whether or not the motor can produce torque. In contrast to kinesin-1, which follows a single protofilament track (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ray et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Yajima and Cross, 2005</a>), dynein takes frequent sideways steps (<a href=\"#bib15\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). However, the full trajectory of dynein motors in three dimensions (3D) remains unknown, because the motors are sterically prevented from moving around the circumference of surface-immobilized MTs."

The bridges were constructed by suspending a fluorescently labeled MT between two large (2 \u00b5m diameter) polystyrene beads, immobilized on the surface. These beads were densely coated with a chimeric protein containing the dynein MT binding domain (MTBD) that stably binds to MTs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gibbons et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carter et al., 2008</a>). Multiple dynein motors were linked to a 0.5-\u00b5m diameter bead (referred to as cargo) and brought in proximity of the MT bridge with an optical trap. When the motors bound to the MT, the cargo bead was released from the trap and its motion was recorded with bright-field microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The <i>xy</i> position of the cargo was determined by a two-dimensional Gaussian tracking algorithm. The <i>z</i> position was determined by changes in the intensity of the bead center (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>), allowing us to track bead movement in 3D."

Because the handedness of the MTs varies based on the number (11\u201314) of protofilament tracks (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hyman et al., 1995</a>), we polymerized tubulin with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (GMP-CPP). 96% of GMP-CPP MTs is made of 14 protofilaments and has a left-handed supertwist with 6400 \u00b1 1000 nm pitch (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hyman et al., 1995</a>). The average velocity of kinesin-driven beads was 541 \u00b1 23 nm/s (mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 10), comparable to the speed of single motors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Yildiz et al., 2008</a>). We observed that kinesin-1-coated beads travelled along GMP-CPP MTs with a left-handed helical motion with a pitch of 6500 \u00b1 400 nm (mean \u00b1SEM, N = 6) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), similar to the helicity of 14 protofilament MTs. The results are also consistent with the reported values of kinesin-1 movement on GMP-CPP MTs (5700\u20137900 nm pitch, left-handed) using alternative geometries (<a href=\"#bib12\">Nitzsche et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brunnbauer et al., 2012</a>)."

We used a tail-truncated yeast dynein artificially dimerized with glutathione S-transferase (GST-Dyn<sub>331kD</sub>), which has similar motile properties to full-length dynein (<a href=\"#bib15\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). The motors were fused to GFP at the N-terminus and attached to cargo beads coated with anti-GFP antibodies (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). At 1 mM ATP, dynein-coated beads moved in helical trajectories with a pitch of 591 \u00b1 32 nm (mean \u00b1 SEM, 67 rotations, 15 beads, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). This rotation corresponds to a sideways movement to a neighboring protofilament (6 nm) for every six tubulin dimers (48 nm) in the forward direction. Unlike axonemal dynein and kinesin motors, which primarily rotate along their tracks in only one direction (<a href=\"#bib18\">Vale and Toyoshima, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brunnbauer et al., 2012</a>), beads coated with cytoplasmic dynein exhibited both left- and right-handed helical movement on MTs (N = 67 rotations, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1 fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>, <a href=\"#media2 media3\">Videos 2,3</a>). The speeds of left- and right-handed movements along the helical path (79 \u00b1 4.7 nm/s and 89 \u00b1 17 nm/s, mean \u00b1 SEM, respectively) were statistically indistinguishable (t-test, p = 0.28). Bidirectional helical movement was also evident from traces of single beads, which occasionally switch direction during a run (4 out of 67 rotations, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In contrast, reversal of bead motility along the MT axis was never observed."

Single dynein dimers take frequent sideways steps (<a href=\"#bib15\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>), whereas multiple dynein dimers persistently move in a helical path with a net preference for a right-handed rotation. What is the molecular basis of this preference? Kinesin-1 monomers are believed to move to the closest possible site on the microtubule which stays to the left of the previous binding site (<a href=\"#bib19\">Yajima and Cross, 2005</a>). However, kinesin-1 dimers only walk along a single protofilament because their short neck-linker prevents off-axis stepping (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brunnbauer et al., 2012</a>). In dynein, monomers may prefer to attach to the nearest tubulin binding site towards the MT minus end, favoring a rightward step (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In the case of a dimer, the heads are attached to neighboring protofilaments and the leading head prefers to be on the right side at 30\u00b0 relative to the trailing head (<a href=\"#bib5\">DeWitt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Qiu et al., 2012</a>).

This results in a tendency to move in a left-handed helical pattern. (<b>D</b>) Due to the finite run length of dynein motors, MT-associated motors dissociate and new ones attach to the track.

The molecular basis of the switches in helical directionality remains unclear. The irregular stepping pattern of individual motors rules out the possibility of a rotational tug-of-war. Instead, we propose that the helical pattern of bead movement may be determined by the conformations of dynein motors associated with the MT track. It is likely that dyneins that are bound in sufficiently close proximity to other dyneins experience steric exclusion effects. If a bead is carried by motors which are oriented such that one is bound immediately forward and to the right of the other, the tubulin binding sites ahead and to the right of the trailing head will be obstructed. Therefore, these motors may prefer to step to the left, and the entire cargo will eventually trace out a left-handed spiral (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The number and orientation of the motors that are simultaneously in contact with the MT may change over the course of a recording. Individual dynein motors have 1400 nm run length (<a href=\"#bib15\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>), indicating that motors on the bead detach and reattach during a processive run of a cargo bead. These may alter the orientation of the MT bound motors, resulting in the reversal of helical directionality during a processive run (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), as occasionally observed."

Furthermore, the intracellular space is crowded with large structures, such as vesicles and organelles. The ability of molecular motors to produce torque and axial force may allow the motors to switch protofilaments and avoid these obstacles. In cells, the same MT track is used for both plus- and minus-end-directed transport. Sideways movement may prevent traffic jams on MTs. In vitro assays have shown that dynein can bypass roadblocks whereas kinesin-1 stalls when it encounters an obstacle and eventually releases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dixit et al., 2008</a>). Bidirectional helical movement may provide additional flexibility to dynein to transport cargos in dense cellular environments."

HiLyte-labeled MTs were excited with 632 nm laser beam in epifluorescence mode, and the fluorescent signal was detected by the EM-CCD camera with an effective pixel size of 160 nm. The videos were recorded at 100 ms frame rate. The surface of the flow chamber was scanned to find MT bridges between the two 2-\u00b5m-diameter beads. We performed our bead tracking assays on the bridges, in which MTs are 10\u201315 \u00b5m long between the beads, appear steady by the resolution of a fluorescence microscope (250 nm) at 10 Hz frame rate, and the entire MT fluorescence appears in focus."

The dynein-coated beads were captured with an optical trap and brought to the proximity of the MT. When the motors on the cargo bead attached to the MT and started to move, the optical trap was turned off. The movement of beads was recorded using bright-field microscopy. MT polarity was first tested by placing the bead on a MT at the center of the bridge. Once the directionality is determined, the bead was moved away from the MT and placed at the plus-end tip of the bridge to explore the motility throughout the entire length of the bridge. All of the beads moved towards the same direction on a single bridge, without any reversals in axial direction."

Because the amplitude of side to side movements was smaller in the case of Q-dots (\u223c50 nm) compared to beads (\u223c250 nm), the MT fluctuation was subtracted from Quantum-dot labelled dynein data. To measure the oscillation of the MT bridges, the MTs were sparsely labeled with a quantum dot 585. The standard deviation of the position of 585 quantum dots was 35 nm in perpendicular direction and 17 nm in parallel direction to the long axis of the MTs. The position of 585 quantum dots was subtracted from the quantum dot 655 labeled dyneins to correct for MT oscillations."

The Matlab code used in data analysis is available at <a href=\"http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/yildiz/SubPages/code_repository.html\">http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/yildiz/SubPages/code_repository.html</a> and in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. The precision of bead tracking was 3 nm in <i>x</i> and 5 nm in <i>y</i> directions. The <i>z</i> position of the bead was determined by the intensity of the bead center. To calibrate the bead intensity as a function of <i>z</i> position, the surface of a sample chamber was decorated with 0.5-\u00b5m diameter beads. The microscope objective was moved \u00b1250 nm in the <i>z</i> direction with 25 nm increments using PIFOC objective scanner (Physik Instrumente, Germany). Corresponding intensities of peaks at each frame were plotted with the <i>z</i> position relative to the microscope objective. This routine was repeated for 20 times to obtain a calibration curve shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>. The bead intensity profile was fitted with a third order polynomial function and the <i>z</i> position of the bead was calculated from the calibration curve. The bead image could not be well-fit by a Gaussian when the <i>z</i> position was between \u221225 nm and +25 nm. To avoid sample-to-sample variability in calibration procedures, the background was subtracted and the intensities were normalized in the bright-field images of the bead. Traces of bead motility were smoothed by the moving average filter of window of five data points."

In the cell, the nature of this movement has important implications for how cargo is transported and how motors navigate the crowded cytoplasmic environment. Kinesin-1 precisely follows a single protofilament track on a microtubule, while dynein has been shown to take frequent sideways steps to neighboring protofilaments. However, since most work has been done on surface-immobilized MTs, which constrains movement to two dimensions, little is known about dynein's 3-dimensional movement and whether it can generate torque. The surprise from this work by Can et al. is that the dynein bead shows long distance helical motion in both directions."

This needs more careful explanation, considering it looks like the brightfield signal may be insensitive to Z in parts of the trajectories. Could the flat tops of the trajectories in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A &amp; B</a> reflect this? The side to side (Y) tracking should not have this problem. Please clarify that the side-to-side tracking is using centroids and that both black and white images are included. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> does not currently make this clear. It might be better to plot X versus time and Y versus time and Z versus time one underneath the other for each sequence.

The experiment reported here clearly shows that dynein monomers have an intrinsic tendency to step off-axis, and that yeast artificial dynein dimers retain this tendency. I was left wondering whether authentic cytoplasmic dynein dimers might be better at tracking the MT axis, just as kinesin-1 dimers can over-ride the intrinsic tendency of kinesin monomers to drift off axis. The discussion concludes firmly that (yeast) dynein rotates its cargoes around the MT with a pitch of about 600nm. It is worth pointing out that blocking this rotation, as it is implied happens when MTs are bound to the coverslip surface, does not impede axial motion."

The standard deviation of the quantum dot position was 35 nm in perpendicular direction and 17 nm in parallel direction to the long axis of the MTs.
