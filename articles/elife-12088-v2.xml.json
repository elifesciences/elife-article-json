Mechanosensation is initiated through the opening of mechanosensitive ion channels, including the K<sub>2P</sub> family in vertebrates, NOMPC in <i>Drosophila</i>, and the DEG/ENaC family in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ranade et al., 2015</a>). Recently, Piezo proteins were identified as the pore-forming subunits of an excitatory (non-selective cation) mechanosensitive channel in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coste et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Faucherre et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>). Piezos are large proteins with &gt;2500 residues that lack homology to any known proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coste et al., 2015</a>). The two mammalian isoforms, Piezo1 and Piezo2, are widely expressed and play key roles in many physiological processes, including vascular development, red blood cell volume regulation, lineage choice in neural stem cells, and touch sensation in Merkel cells and DRG neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cahalan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Maksimovic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pathak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ranade et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Woo et al., 2014</a>).

The recent medium-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of mouse Piezo1 revealed many features of the coarse channel architecture, but does not provide conclusive clues about the activation mechanism (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ge et al., 2015</a>). In vivo, Piezos respond to diverse forces, including laminar flow and cellular compression (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ranade et al., 2014a</a>). In heterologous systems, two techniques used to evoke channel activity are direct stimulation of the cell by touching with a blunt glass pipette and application of negative pressure to stretch the membrane in a patch pipette (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coste et al., 2010</a>). Both stimuli induce several geometric and energetic changes in the membrane, including alterations in curvature and tension, any of which could in principle activate mechanically activated ion channels (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sukharev and Corey, 2004</a>). For example, lateral membrane tension is the stimulus for the well-characterized bacterial mechanosensitive ion channel MscL (<a href=\"#bib29\">Moe and Blount, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sukharev et al., 1999</a>). To date, no accessory proteins of Piezos have been identified that could tether the channel to the cellular matrix, suggesting that, as for MscL, the activating stimulus may be directly transmitted through the bilayer."

Consistent with a high physiological importance for inactivation, Piezo mutations that alter inactivation kinetics are linked to several human diseases, including dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, xerocytosis, Marden-Walker and Gordon syndromes, and distal arthrogryposis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albuisson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coste et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">McMillin et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, several of these gain-of-function mutations not only reduce the rate and/or extent of inactivation, but also apparently sensitize Piezos to pressure (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, the only known agonist for Piezo ion channels, Yoda1, both sensitizes Piezo1 to pressure and slows inactivation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Syeda et al., 2015</a>)."

Local membrane tension and curvature also vary among and even within cells, with potentially important implications for Piezo function. Piezo sensitivity is also modulated by proteins including EPAC1 and STOML3; differential expression of these and other modulators both among cells and within a single cell may also regulate the overall sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eijkelkamp et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Poole et al., 2014</a>). A mechanistic understanding of the link between the activating stimulus, local membrane environment, inactivation, and channel sensitivity may provide specific strategies for pharmacological modulation of Piezo activity. Here, we combine high-resolution, high-contrast imaging with electrophysiology to investigate whether membrane curvature or lateral membrane tension is the physical stimulus for activation of Piezo1 and how sensitivity to this stimulus might be intrinsically regulated. We find that Piezo1 is activated by membrane tension with a high degree of sensitivity (T<sub>50</sub> = 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 mN/m) and that this sensitivity is directly influenced by resting membrane tension."

Peak current amplitudes again increased with the magnitude of pressure, albeit with a striking difference: pressure responses were right-shifted, as currents first became apparent at +15 mmHg and often did not reach saturation before rupture of the patch. Interestingly, we also often observed small currents upon release of small (+5 mmHg) positive pressure stimuli, discussed further below.

We therefore repeated these experiments in both inside-out and outside-out patches, both of which result in disrupted cytoskeletal structure and in the latter, inverted membrane leaflets with respect to the patch pipette. For inside-out patches, both positive and negative pressure again evoked transient inward currents through Piezo1 ion channels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>). In this patch configuration, the optical density of the membrane was reduced compared to cell-attached patches, consistent with the idea that less cytoskeleton is retained in a cell-detached configuration (<a href=\"#bib41\">Suchyna et al., 2009</a>). However, DIC imaging was still sufficiently sensitive to resolve the convex and concave membrane curvatures induced by positive and negative pressure protocols, respectively. In the outside-out configuration, we were only able to consistently visualize the membrane during application of positive pressure, but not during negative pressure, perhaps because excess membrane folded within the tip was conformationally flexible and therefore not resolved at our imaging speed (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ruknudin et al., 1991</a>). Still, we obtained the same result as for the other patch configurations: both positive and negative pressure robustly activated Piezo1 currents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and F</a>).

While Piezo1-mediated currents were reliably evoked by bidirectional pressure in all patch configurations, individual patches did show some expected variability in their precise current amplitude levels, mostly among different patch configurations. Several variables could potentially change among configurations, including patch surface area, cytoskeletal content, and stability of the gigaseal, any or all of which could in theory contribute to the observed differences. Specifically, currents elicited by positive pressure in outside-out patches were typically larger than in the other configurations, consistent with the observation that a larger surface area of membrane is preserved within the confines of the gigaseal in this configuration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In contrast, currents elicited by positive pressure in inside-out patches were small, likely because patches that survived multiple positive pressure pulses were biased towards those made using smaller pipettes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

These values for positive pressure are likely an underestimate of the true P<sub>50</sub> values for the positive pressure in both configurations, due to premature rupture of some patches before reaching saturation. For outside-out patches, much larger pressures were required for activation than other configurations (positive pressure: P<sub>50</sub> = +70.0 \u00b1 9.6 mmHg; N=11; negative pressure: P<sub>50</sub> = \u221239.8 \u00b1 3.1 mmHg; N = 6). Together, these experiments provide strong evidence that Piezo1 can be activated by both convex and concave membrane curvature. Further, as cytoskeletal content varies with patch configuration, the different sensitivities we observed among configurations and with convex versus concave geometry suggests that Piezo1 sensitivity to a given stimulus (in this case, pressure) may vary significantly with the amount of cytoskeletal content and its sidedness, i.e., whether the cytoskeleton is subjected into a convex vs. concave geometry (<a href=\"#bib41\">Suchyna et al., 2009</a>)."

The fact that inside-out patches require a greater increase in tension to open Piezos is also consistent with the notion that the intrinsic resting tension is different in these two configurations (see below).

Additionally, we observed that membrane patches are already substantially curved at rest, i.e. in the absence of any external pressure difference (\u0394p = 0 mmHg) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Finally, as mentioned above, we noticed in our cell-attached and inside-out recordings that stimulation with +5 mmHg was not sufficient to activate channels, but that instead a current was evoked upon pressure release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B and D</a>). We therefore hypothesized that even at rest (\u0394p = 0 mmHg), a substantial fraction of Piezo1 ion channels might be stimulated and subsequently inactivated. From this, we predicted that a small positive pressure stimulus, that precisely compensates the resting curvature, should effectively zero membrane tension in the patch dome and therefore, if sufficiently long, such a stimulus would allow Piezos to recover from inactivation."

Strikingly, with this first prepulse protocol we were able to elicit robust rapidly-inactivating currents in cell-attached patches not during the presence of pressure, but rather upon its release. The current amplitudes depended strongly on the prepulse amplitude in a U-shaped manner, i.e., currents were maximal after prepulses of ~ +5\u20136 mmHg and decreased for smaller or larger prepulses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We never observed currents upon release of pressure in cells transfected with empty vector (pcDNA), indicating that these currents were indeed Piezo1-mediated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Importantly, the biphasic dependence of current on prepulse pressure amplitude was tightly linked to membrane curvature. Specifically, we observed for each individual patch that peak currents occurred at or near the minimal curvature, i.e., when the membrane was flattest (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Averaging data from N = 14 patches further showed that currents are maximal precisely after prepulses that minimize membrane curvature (R\u2192\u221e) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

We chose to examine Piezo sensitivity in membrane patches from living cells, which differs from the bottom-up approaches of artificial lipid bilayers or micelle systems, in that the lipid composition is heterogeneous, the channel protein is not purified from possible interaction partners, and cellular mechanical stability is maintained. We found that similar to the vertebrate mechanosensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels TREK-1 and TRAAK, Piezo1 responds robustly to both positive and negative pressure (<a href=\"#bib37\">Brohawn et al., 2014b</a>). There are several possible mechanisms for how mechanosensitive ion channels may convert physical force into pore opening (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ranade et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sukharev and Corey, 2004</a>). In a tethered mechanism, force could be transmitted to the channel through auxiliary proteins, whereas in a bilayer mechanism, force could be transmitted directly through the lipid bilayer. In the latter case, the channel must sense either membrane curvature or lateral membrane tension. Several well-studied mechanosensitive ion channels have previously been demonstrated to sense lateral membrane tension, including prokaryotic channels MscS and MscL, as well as TREK-1 and TRAAK (<a href=\"#bib37\">Brohawn et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moe and Blount, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sokabe et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sukharev, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">2002</a>). However, Piezos are distinct from each of these previously identified tension sensors in that they are much larger, with many more predicted transmembrane domains, and in that they share no homology on a primary sequence or overall architectural level (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brohawn et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coste et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ge et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kamajaya et al., 2014</a>)."

While it is theoretically possible that Piezo1 senses convex and concave membrane curvature with equal sensitivity, this mechanism would require curvature sensing structures that are symmetrical. However, Piezo proteins do not contain any amino acid sequences with similarity to any known curvature-sensing proteins, and the recently obtained cryo-electron microscopy structure shows no symmetrical features with respect to the plane of the bilayer, making this possibility unlikely (<a href=\"#bib3\">Antonny, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ge et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McMahon and Boucrot, 2015</a>). It is also possible that local membrane curvature and tension are not strictly coupled to macroscopic membrane curvature. Previous reports indicate that alterations in local curvature induced by asymmetric incorporation of lipids can change the response of tension-gated channels to pressure (<a href=\"#bib33\">Perozo et al., 2002</a>); this will also have to be tested for Piezo1."

Our data suggest that Piezo is a unique mechanosensor, as Piezo1 probed in a cellular environment is much more sensitive to tension (T<sub>50</sub> = 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 mN/m) than are MscL and MscS in azolectin liposomes (T<sub>50</sub> ~5\u201310 mN/m), although we cannot rule out differences arising from the different local lipid environment in eukaryotic cells versus reconstituted systems (<a href=\"#bib29\">Moe and Blount, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nomura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sukharev, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sukharev et al., 1999</a>).

First, sensitivity of Piezo1 to tension differed in cell-attached versus inside-out patches. One potential explanation for this difference is the varying amount of cytoskeleton retained in the two configurations, which contributes to membrane properties, including tension (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gauthier et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with this, we observed lower optical density in inside-out patches, which are known to contain less cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib41\">Suchyna et al., 2009</a>). Together, this predicts that the cytoskeleton is an important regulator of Piezo1 sensitivity, a finding that is reconciled with previous reports that inhibition of actin polymerization with cytochalsin-D inhibits whole-cell Piezo1 currents evoked by direct stimulus with a glass pipette, but increases opening in cell-attached pressure-evoked currents (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gnanasambandam et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gottlieb et al., 2012</a>). In fact, we cannot rule out a role of the cytoskeleton in directly contributing or even being essential to Piezo activation. We also observed differences in both rate and extent of decay of Piezo1-mediated currents among patch configurations. While the mechanism of Piezo1 inactivation is unknown, a previous study reports that inactivation is irreversibly lost with repeated stimulation, which may explain why we observed the least inactivation in outside-out patches, in which the membrane undergoes the most manipulation prior to assaying activity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gottlieb et al., 2012</a>)."

For example, while the P<sub>50</sub> is typically reported to be ~ \u221230 mmHg for heterologously expressed Piezo1 in HEK293t cells, in neural stem cells, the P<sub>50</sub> was ~\u221213 mmHg, whereas the P<sub>50</sub> was ~\u221240 mmHg in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coste et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pathak et al., 2014</a>). One explanation for this is that Piezo1 sensitivity is modulated by interaction with other cellular components, which may be differentially expressed: For example, Piezo1 mechanosensitivity requires the presence of phosphoinositides, which are depleted over time in excised patches (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borbiro et al., 2015</a>); the integral membrane protein STOML3 also greatly increases Piezo1 sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Poole et al., 2014</a>). Here, we found that an additional modulator of Piezo sensitivity is resting membrane tension. Importantly, cellular membrane tension varies greatly with cell type; even within one cell local tension depends on factors including lipid composition, cytoskeletal contacts, the extracellular matrix, and others (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blumenthal et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hoffman, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>). As Piezos are thus under differing tension depending on their cellular expression and localization, the ability of tension to modulate sensitivity gives Piezo1 a broad tuning curve that primes it to respond to physiologically relevant changes in tension at that location. Importantly, this makes Piezos robust sensors of membrane tension in the remarkably wide variety of cell types in which they are expressed."

Interestingly, the currents we observed after Piezo channels recovered from inactivation during a transient period of zero tension (i.e., +5 mmHg prepulses) may have important physiological relevance: a stimulus that results in a local reduction of membrane tension may lead to increased Piezo activity in this region upon release of this stimulus, perhaps providing a mechanism by which cells can sense not only the onset, but also the offset of a stimulus. The interplay between activation and inactivation may also make Piezo1 most sensitive to rapidly applied mechanical stimuli, similar to previous reports for MscS, as slowly applied stimuli will lead to gradual accumulation of channels in inactivated states (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akitake et al., 2005</a>). The advent of structural information about the various domains of Piezo, as well as its overall architecture will be extremely useful in identifying the structural correlates of both the mechanosensor and the inactivation mechanism, as activation and inactivation combine to dictate overall sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ge et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kamajaya et al., 2014</a>)."

Data were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 2.9 kHz. Borosilicate glass pipettes (1.5 OD, 0.85 ID; Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) had a resistance of 1.5\u20134 M\u03a9 when filled with pipette buffer solution (in mM: 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 TEACl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2,</sub>\u00a0pH\u00a0=\u00a07.3\u00a0with\u00a0NaOH). The standard bath solution was (in mM): 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose,\u00a0pH\u00a0=\u00a07.3\u00a0with\u00a0KOH. Pipettes were angled at ~15\u00b0 with respect to the glass cover slip to optimize image contrast. Pressure was controlled with a high-speed pressure clamp system (HSPC-1; ALA Scientific Instruments, Farmingdale, NY). Patches were held at \u221280 mV and stimulated with pressure-step protocols described in the manuscript. Unless stated otherwise, sweeps were separated by 10 s to allow for recovery from inactivation."

Only one patch was excised from each cell; with the exception of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, which required prior determination of the appropriate prepulse for each patch using the protocol in 4B, only one protocol was performed on each patch. Analysis was performed with Igor Pro 6.22A (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Baseline currents before pressure stimulation were subtracted off-line and peak currents measured at each pressure. Student\u2019s t-test or ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer comparison of pairs of means were used to assess statistical significance."

During imaging, the focal plane was continuously adjusted to center on the contact points of the membrane with pipette walls, indicated by the \u2018crossing over\u2019 of the lines corresponding to the pipette (see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Short (300 ms) pressure pulses were used to minimize membrane \u2018creep\u2019 and excessive movement of the membrane out of the focal plane. Images were extracted from videos in NIS-Elements (Nikon Instruments Inc, Melville, NY) and imported into Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). To identify the membrane geometry, a line scan parallel to the pipette walls was performed to localize the minimum pixel intensity for each line over a rolling average of 9 pixels; the script, custom-written in IgorPro, is available in our Github Repository (github.com/GrandlLab). These positions were then fit with a circle to obtain the radius (R). Tension (T) was calculated for every pressure step \u0394p using Laplace\u2019s law: T= R\u00b7\u0394p/2. For pooling and binning data, current-pressure responses for individual cells were fit with a Boltzmann function (I<sub>max</sub>/(1+exp(-(P-P<sub>50</sub>)/k))) and individual current amplitudes were re-normalized to the plateau response to saturating stimuli from the fit (I<sub>Max</sub>). To calculate the tension required for activation, binned data were fit with a Boltzmann function (I = I<sub>max</sub>/(1+exp(-(T-T<sub>50</sub>)/k))); the fit was weighted with the standard deviations from each bin."

In brief, there are two key findings. First, Piezo1 channels respond to changes in membrane tension rather than curvature. Second, that sustained tensions even such as those present in membrane patches held at symmetric atmospheric pressures are sufficient to inactivate a proportion of the channels. This leads to activation following applications of pressures sufficient to flatten patches and may help to establish resting set points in cells. These biophysical findings were facilitated by careful measurements of membrane curvature as well as controlled application of pressure differences across membrane patches. They have important applications for how Piezo1 works in cells and for the origin of variations in the kinetics of their responses to mechanical stimulation."

However, we face the issue that cytoskeletal disrupting agents (for example, cytoD or latrunculin B) are not acute disrupters that depolymerize actin, but instead inhibit polymerization, and thus act slowly compared to the lifetime of a patch. This limitation is also supported by a publication (Gottlieb, 2012) that reports that chronic treatment with Cyto-D does not affect sensitivity of Piezo1 in the cell-attached mode. The best way to test whether the cytoskeleton is dispensable for Piezo1 activation would be to reconstitute the protein in bilayers and show that it retains mechanosensitivity, which is beyond the scope of this study. We therefore decided not to perform such experiments."
