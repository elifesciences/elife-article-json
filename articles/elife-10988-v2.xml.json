This F-actin network is also found to provide mechanosensitivity to the Cav1.3 channels when varying intracellular hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, this F-actin mesh network attached to the synaptic ribbons directly influences the efficiency of otoferlin-dependent exocytosis and its sensitivity to intracellular hydrostatic pressure, independently of its action on the Cav1.3 channels. We propose a new mechanistic model for vesicle exocytosis in auditory hair cells where the rate of vesicle recruitment to the ribbons is directly controlled by a synaptic F-actin network and changes in intracellular hydrostatic pressure."

This F-actin network is also found to provide mechanosensitivity to the Cav1.3 channels when varying intracellular hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, this F-actin mesh network attached to the synaptic ribbons directly influences the efficiency of otoferlin-dependent exocytosis and its sensitivity to intracellular hydrostatic pressure, independently of its action on the Cav1.3 channels. We propose a new mechanistic model for vesicle exocytosis in auditory hair cells where the rate of vesicle recruitment to the ribbons is directly controlled by a synaptic F-actin network and changes in intracellular hydrostatic pressure."

Now, Vincent et al. show that in hair cells, a cage-like network made from a protein called actin surrounds each active zone. This network helps to position the calcium ion channels. Treating the hair cells with a compound that disorganized the actin networks speed up the process of vesicle movement, which suggests that the actin network also controls the rate at which vesicles reach the membrane."

Neural encoding of these microphonic potentials occurs at the ribbon synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) by mechanisms involving Cav1.3 channels (<a href=\"#bib28\">Platzer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brandt et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brandt et al., 2005</a>) and otoferlin-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib30\">Roux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beurg et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Vincent et al., 2014</a>). Unlike most neuronal central synapses, IHCs have the extraordinary property to sustain indefatigably high rates of exocytosis during continuous sound stimulation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Safieddine et al., 2012</a>). The precise molecular mechanisms underlying this fast and massive recruitment of synaptic vesicles to the IHC ribbon active zones still remain elusive. The implication of an unconventional molecular regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion and replenishment of the releasable pool of vesicles has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nouvian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Vogl et al., 2015</a>). In other secretory cells such as neuroendocrine cells, a network of sub-membranous cortical F-actin is known to influence exocytosis greatly by tightly regulating plasma membrane tension and the access of the granules to the secretory sites (<a href=\"#bib2\">Apodaca, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Torregrosa-Hetland et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gutierrez and Gil, 2011</a>). In central neuronal synapses, F-actin is also involved in maintaining vesicle pools and regulating vesicle mobility (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</a>). Electron-tomography evidence for F-actin and microtubules near the synaptic ribbons has been observed in bullfrog hair cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Graydon et al 2011</a>). Whether IHC synaptic exocytosis is modulated by F-actin remains unknown. Other factors affecting membrane tension and exocytosis in many cell types, such as mast cells, include hydrostatic pressure across the membrane (<a href=\"#bib32\">Solsona et al., 1998</a>). This latter factor has also been shown to influence the spontaneous and evoked activity of vestibular hair cells of the dogfish by mechanisms that remain unknown (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fraser and Shelmerdine, 2002</a>). In the present study, we investigated whether F-actin and intracellular hydrostatic pressure regulate synaptic exocytosis in mouse IHCs."

The mean distance between the Cav1.3 immunoreactive patches and the ribbons increased from 218 \u00b1 11 nm (n = 71) in controls to 260 \u00b1 12 nm with latrunculin-A treatment (n = 102; p&lt;0.05). In the latter conditions, surprisingly, whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed a largely facilitated exocytosis as compared to controls, while voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were unchanged (Figure 2A,B). After 100 ms depolarization, from -80 to -10 mV, the exocytotic response in control IHCs reached a maximum amplitude of 22.0 \u00b1 2.9 fF (n = 11). Considering that a 40 nm diameter synaptic vesicle corresponds to 37 aF (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lenzi et al., 1999</a>), we estimated a RRP size of about 590 vesicles, i.e 33 vesicles per ribbons if we assume a number of 18 ribbons per IHCs. This number of RRP vesicles fit well with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib18\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Vincent et al., 2014</a>).

Since the exocytotic response was unchanged for short impulses below 30 ms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), these results suggested that the disruption of F-actin did not affect the steps of vesicle docking and priming but facilitated the replenishment of the RRP.

We first found that increasing intracellular osmotic pressure from 310 to 390 mOsm with sucrose produced a significant increase in the resting membrane capacitance of IHCs. The resting size of IHCs, voltage-clamped at -80 mV for a period of 2\u2009min after break-in, was 9.93 \u00b1 0.27 pF (n = 11, 310 mOsm) and 11.10 \u00b1 0.34 pF (n = 10, 390 mOsm; p&lt;0.05), respectively. This augmentation of the IHC resting membrane capacitance was about 50 times larger than the size of the RRP evoked by membrane depolarization (Figure 2B;\u00a0RRP\u00a0=\u00a022 fF). Where does this large addition of membrane come from?

We cannot exclude the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to the plasma membrane during the massive vesicular fusion caused by increased hydrostatic pressure. However, this mechanism appears unlikely in regards to results obtained in non-secretory cells such as smooth muscle and HEK cells where similar effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels were obtained (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lyford et al., 2002</a>).

Notably, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitude in low bath hydrostatic pressure (equivalent to increasing intracellular pressure) was also reported in dissociated guinea pig vestibular hair cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Duong Dinh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haasler et al., 2009</a>). In these latter studies, the change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents could be interpreted as due to a pressure activation of K<sup>+</sup> currents leading to less pronounced depolarization. Although pressure effects on K<sup>+</sup> currents have also been shown in guinea-pig IHCs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kimitsuki, 2013</a>), we don't think that these currents would influence our Ca<sup>2+</sup> current measurements since we were working in conditions where most K<sup>+</sup> currents are blocked. Overall, our results suggested here that the mechanosensitivity of the Cav1.3 channels is mediated through an intact synaptic F-actin network."

The role of actin in the process of exocytosis is unknown for auditory hair cell ribbon synapses, although these synapses have an abundant supply of actin, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> of this paper. At other synapses, it is thought that actin modulates the process of exocytosis and the recruitment of vesicles to the readily releasable pool (RRP). The authors of this paper show that a 45-minute treatment with latrunculin-A, a drug that depolymerizes actin, increases the amount of exocytosis in hair cells. Interestingly, it also appears to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to be located further away from the synaptic ribbon. It thus appears that actin is involved in stabilizing the exact localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at synaptic ribbon active zones. These are important and novel findings. They will be of interest to a wide audience of neuroscience and cell biology. I have only a few major concerns that need to be addressed:"

F-actin 'cages' appear to surround hair cell active zones. When cages are disrupted by latrunculin, the spacing of synaptic ribbons and calcium channel clusters is widened. Latrunculin treatment increases the voltage-evoked capacitance increase thought to reflect fusion of synaptic vesicles. Increased hydrostatic pressure also increased voltage-gated calcium current. Calcium-invoked capacitance increases are enhanced by increased hydrostatic pressure. This work raises many interesting questions. The initial observation of F-actin-dependent synaptic structure and function is significant and potentially quite important, particularly in view of the organized membranous domains of hair cells (see for example, Bullen et al., J Cell Sci. 2015 Jul 15;128(14):2529-40).
