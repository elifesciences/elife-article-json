The planarian, a flatworm, is even more remarkable, being able to regenerate its head or tail following amputation, and even a whole animal from just a small body fragment. This is particularly impressive given that planarians have a complex internal anatomy, which includes muscles, intestines, a system similar to kidneys, and a central nervous system with a brain."

However, the animal\u2019s ability to routinely replace old cells via a stem-cell mediated mechanism is unaffected. This indicates that <i>follistatin</i> is specifically required for the replacement of cells lost through injury. Gavi\u00f1o et al. further demonstrate that the protein encoded by <i>follistatin</i> likely initiates tissue regeneration upon substantial tissue loss through inhibition of proteins called Activins."

New tissues are formed at planarian wound sites in a process called blastema formation, and pre-existing tissues are reorganized after amputation to accommodate reduced animal size and further generate missing tissues (<a href=\"#bib15\">Morgan, 1901</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2004</a>). The source of regenerated tissue in planarians is a population of adult dividing cells called neoblasts (<a href=\"#bib23\">Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2004</a>), which include pluripotent stem cells called clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). Neoblasts are the only somatic cycling cells in adult animals and can be specifically ablated by gamma irradiation, allowing for dissection of the requirements for neoblasts in regenerative processes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2004</a>). Recent work has described the earliest molecular and cellular events that occur following injury (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sandmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>). One finding to emerge from this work is that animals initiate distinct cellular and molecular responses to \u2018major injuries\u2019 that remove significant amounts of tissue (e.g., head amputation) and to \u2018simple injuries\u2019 that require only minimal healing for repair (wounds that do not elicit blastema formation, such as punctures or incisions). Following simple injury, for example, animals display an increase in mitotic numbers 6 hr after injury before returning to baseline levels (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>), and expression of numerous wound-induced genes becomes undetectable by 24 hr after injury (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>). Following a major injury, these same initial responses are observed, but subsequent responses are also activated: the 6 hr increase in mitotic numbers is followed by a second increase 48 hr after amputation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>), and wound-induced gene expression persists beyond 24 hr and is refined over several days (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>). These responses are referred to as the \u2018missing-tissue response\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>). How animals distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate these distinct wound response programs remains unknown."

Strikingly, unamputated <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals did not shrink or lose structures, as is typically seen in animals with neoblast dysfunction, even after several months of significant expression reduction with RNAi (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Furthermore, amputated animals\u2014despite failing to regenerate\u2014displayed ongoing long-term neoblast-based tissue turnover of remaining tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Together, these data suggest that the requirement for <i>fst</i> in tissue replacement is specific to regeneration, as it is not detectably required for neoblast-mediated tissue turnover. Because of the rarity of genes required for regeneration but not tissue turnover, <i>fst</i> was a good candidate for specifically mediating the processes that occur following injury to bring about regeneration."

Neoblasts can be visualized by detecting neoblast-specific transcripts through whole-mount in situ hybridization (<a href=\"#bib25\">Reddien et al., 2005</a>) and quantified using flow cytometry (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hayashi et al., 2006</a>). <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals displayed normal neoblast numbers prior to amputation, indicating that the observed regeneration failure is not caused by neoblast loss (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We next assessed whether neoblasts respond to injury in <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals. The neoblast response to injury involves two peaks (6 hr and 48 hr post-amputation) in mitotic cell numbers, in between which neoblasts migrate to wounds (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>). The first peak is generically induced by all injury types and is spatially widespread (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>). The second peak occurs specifically following major injuries (removing tissues) and is biased toward wound sites (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>). Amputated <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals displayed a normal 6 hr mitotic peak, indicating that a normal generic injury response was present (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). By contrast, these animals failed to display a 48 hr mitotic peak (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals did however display localization of mitoses toward wound sites 48 hr after amputation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and neoblast enrichment at wound sites 18 hr after injury (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that neoblast migration occurred normally."

Apoptosis increases following injury in planarians (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>), and, like the mitotic response, this increase involves a generic injury phase and a missing-tissue-specific phase. First, a local apoptosis burst occurs at wound sites 4 hr following any injury; second, a body-wide apoptosis burst occurs 72 hr after injury, but only in cases involving missing tissue (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>). The apoptosis level in this latter phase scales with the amount of missing tissue (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>). Planarians possess a centrally located pharynx used for feeding and defecation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2004</a>); measuring apoptotic cell numbers by TUNEL within the pharynx is an established assay for quantifying the body-wide increase in apoptosis that occurs 72 hr post-amputation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>). Strikingly, <i>fst(RNAi)</i> pharynges displayed little increase in apoptotic cell numbers 72 hr post amputation, whereas a roughly 20-fold increase from pre-amputation levels occurred in control pharynges (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals had a normal 4 hr apoptosis burst, indicating that <i>fst</i> is not generally required for apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Some aspects of this process do not require blastema formation. For example, <i>wntP-2</i> (also known as <i>wnt11-5</i> [<a href=\"#bib2\">Gurley et al., 2010</a>]) is normally expressed in planarian tails (<a href=\"#bib22\">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Gurley et al., 2010</a>) and its expression domain restricts posteriorly within 48 hr of amputation whether regeneration proceeds or not (<a href=\"#bib2\">Gurley et al., 2010</a>). <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals did not rescale the <i>wntP-2</i> expression domain 48 hr following amputation, further supporting a model in which <i>fst</i> is required for responding to missing tissue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Following head amputation, head fragments not only produce posterior-specific cell types but also reduce numbers of anterior-specific cell types (which are overabundant for the new fragment dimensions). This process failed in <i>fst(RNAi)</i> head fragments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Finally, <i>fst(RNAi)</i> fragments did not produce pharynges de novo (which normally occurs in pre-existing head and tail fragment tissue) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, RNAi of a different gene that blocked blastema formation (<i>smad1</i>) did not block pharynx formation, indicating this defect is not a simple consequence of blastema formation failure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that <i>fst</i> is required broadly for missing-tissue-specific wound responses, and that these defects likely underlie the inability of <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals to regenerate."

We therefore assessed <i>fst</i> as compared to <i>act</i> expression at wounds following either incision or excision of a tissue wedge. Increased <i>act-1</i> expression was not detected following either type of wound, with expression detected throughout the intestine of uninjured animals, suggesting an intestinal source of Activin-1 protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). <i>act-2</i> expression was similar to <i>act-1</i> in intact animals, but unlike <i>act-1</i> is wound-induced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2013</a>). Indeed, <i>act-2</i> was wound-induced following either incision or tissue wedge excision, with expression persisting for several days irrespective of injury severity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). By contrast, <i>fst</i> expression was induced at both wound types by 6 hr after injury, but by 48 hr after injury was present only at wedge excision wound sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate that <i>fst</i> expression persists longer at wounds that result in tissue absence. Furthermore, <i>fst</i> expression was greater at wounds involving a large amount of missing tissue (assessed at 48 hr) than at wounds with little missing tissue (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which wound-induced <i>fst</i> expression levels are regulated by the amount of missing tissue. In this model, <i>fst</i> promotes regenerative responses by inhibition of <i>act-1</i> and <i>act-2</i> following major injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Planarians are an exceptional example of the regenerative potential of animals. Distinct cellular and molecular programs for responding to simple injury vs missing tissue exist in planarians. In the case of injuries involving substantial missing tissue, animals mount unique mitotic and apoptotic responses and produce an extended program of wound-induced gene expression (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>).

Finally, <i>fst</i> is wound-induced, with the level of <i>fst</i> expression persisting at high levels longer following a major injury than following a simple injury. We propose that wound-induced <i>fst</i> expression allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence."

Not all missing-tissue responses are abolished following <i>fst</i> inhibition, however. For example, neoblast migration to amputation sites occurred normally in <i>fst(RNAi)</i> animals, despite the absence of a normal proliferative response. Similarly, although expression of <i>act-1</i> and <i>act-2</i> are required for the <i>fst(RNAi)</i> phenotype, inhibition of <i>activin</i> expression in the absence of amputation does not affect homeostatic tissue turnover or induce a regeneration-like state, demonstrating that the suppression of Activin alone is not sufficient to induce missing-tissue responses. Therefore, some aspects of the missing-tissue response to injury require an as yet unknown \u2018missing-tissue\u2019 signal or signals that operate independently of <i>fst</i> and Activin signaling. Identifying and characterizing these processes will be important for understanding how the decision to mount a regenerative response occurs."

The possibility therefore exists that Activin signaling may serve similar functions in other organisms. Indeed, TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been implicated as a negative regulator of regeneration in a variety of contexts, including following partial hepatectomy (<a href=\"#bib29\">Russell et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Kogure et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Romero-Gallo et al., 2005</a>), in embryonic chick retinas (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sakami et al., 2008</a>), in renal regeneration following ischemia/reperfusion injuries (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kojima et al., 2001</a>), and for mouse skeletal muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Given the relevance of these systems to human medicine, it will be important to investigate to what extent regenerative regimes recapitulate the mechanisms observed in planarians. Interestingly, a number of systems use TGF-\u03b2 signaling to promote rather than suppress regeneration: TGF-\u03b2 signaling is involved in axolotl limb and <i>Xenopus</i> tail regeneration (<a href=\"#bib11\">L\u00e9vesque et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Ho and Whitman, 2008</a>), <i>activin</i> expression can be induced by wounding and exogenous TGF-\u03b2 can speed healing in mammals (<a href=\"#bib16\">Mustoe et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">H\u00fcbner et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sulyok et al., 2004</a>), TGF-\u03b2 signaling can promote regeneration following mouse ear hole-punching (<a href=\"#bib12\">Liu et al., 2011</a>), and wound-induced <i>activin</i> promotes cell proliferation and migration following zebrafish fin amputation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ja\u017awi\u0144ska et al., 2007</a>). Despite these contextual differences, TGF-\u03b2 signaling plays a major role in many forms of regeneration studied. Therefore, uncovering \u2018missing-tissue\u2019 signals in planarians, describing how these signals interact with Activin signaling, and identifying the key factors regulated by these signals will inform a broad understanding of core regenerative mechanisms."

Images were acquired using an AxioImager with Apotome (Zeiss) or an LSM 700 (Zeiss)."
