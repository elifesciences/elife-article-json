It is hard to imagine people travelling for thousands of miles across difficult terrain to bring spices from the East to the courts of France and England, but they did. Whether or not these early explorers were of right mind, their experiences shaped their views of the world, and the tales they told expanded the universe for all those they encountered."

In truth, I was leaving the United States at a time when I wasn't proud to be American, at the end of the war in Vietnam, and I didn't really know if I wanted a job. But I did know that there were beautiful papers in invertebrate neuropharmacology from the laboratories at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in Paris. So why wouldn't I go?"

But I had never heard French spoken by the French (a high school French teacher with a Brooklyn accent didn't count). Nine years later, when I got off the plane at Charles De Gaulle airport, I couldn't understand a word. I spent my first year learning enough French to understand the conversation in the lab: almost everyone spoke English to me one-on-one, but the conversation immediately switched back to French as soon as there was a group of two. I found myself learning two languages simultaneously: French and enough biophysics to understand the experiments my new colleagues were doing."

In San Diego I had been with people building a new institution with enthusiasm and blind confidence in the future they were creating: in Paris I had trouble understanding an education system that didn't allow people to start over later in life. (Most of those at the ENS had been stellar students throughout their education in a highly competitive school system; in the US, on the other hand, students had an opportunity redeem themselves if they suffered setbacks during their education.) Moreover, I had trouble understanding a scientific culture that gave life-time positions to people my age."
