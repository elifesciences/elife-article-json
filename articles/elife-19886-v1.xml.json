                    "text": "Adult-born neurons are continually produced in the dentate gyrus but it is unclear whether synaptic integration of new neurons affects the pre-existing circuit. Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bax</i> in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that <i>Bax</i> deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit."

Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bax</i> in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that <i>Bax</i> deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit."

Increasing the number of newborn neurons reduced the number of synapses between the cortex and the mature neurons in the dentate gyrus. Conversely, killing off newborn neurons had the opposite effect, increasing the strength of the synaptic connections to older cells. This suggests that new synapses are not formed to accommodate new neurons, but rather that there is a redistribution of synapses between old and new neurons in the dentate gyrus."

During a transient period of maturation, new GCs exhibit intrinsic and synaptic properties distinct from mature GCs, potentially underlying the contribution of neurogenesis to memory encoding (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ge et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aimone et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mar\u00edn-Burgin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dieni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brunner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dieni et al., 2016</a>). Yet computational models also suggest that remodeling of pre-existing circuits by continual neurogenesis can degrade established memories (<a href=\"#bib77\">Weisz and Argibay, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chambers et al., 2004</a>), a possibility that has recently gained experimental support from the observation that neurogenesis facilitates \u2018forgetting\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Epp et al., 2016</a>). Circuit remodeling could occur by synaptic redistribution, wherein existing terminals that synapse onto mature GCs are appropriated by newly integrating GCs. This possibility is supported by anatomical evidence that immature dendritic spines transiently receive a high proportion of synapses from multiple-synapse boutons (<a href=\"#bib73\">Toni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Toni and Sultan, 2011</a>). Furthermore, dramatically increasing the number of new neurons does not alter the density of spines and synapses in the molecular layer, suggesting a readjustment of synaptic connections (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2009</a>). Yet whether synaptic integration of new GCs is accompanied by changes in synaptic function and structure of mature GCs is not known."

Similarly, inducible expression of the diphtheria toxin receptor in Nestin-expressing stem cells allows selective ablation of adult-born neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arruda-Carvalho et al., 2011</a>). These approaches have been used to identify contributions of adult born neurons in hippocampal-based behaviors, with the understanding that behavioral outcomes could either reflect unique functions of adult-born neurons themselves or homeostatic adaptions within the network (<a href=\"#bib64\">Singer et al., 2011</a>). Physiological stimuli like exercise and environmental enrichment also enhance dentate neurogenesis, yet it is unclear whether genetically targeted manipulations of neurogenesis mimic the\u00a0circuit function in the same manner as physiological stimuli."

We measured synaptic transmission to pre-existing mature GCs in response to selective genetic manipulations of Nestin-expressing stem cells, using inducible <i>Bax</i> deletion to enhance, or diphtheria toxin-induced ablation to reduce, the number of new neurons. We also tested synaptic transmission to immature GCs and mature GCs with <i>Bax</i> deletion to investigate potential non-apoptotic functions of the Bax signaling pathway in synaptic function (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jiao and Li, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2014</a>). Finally, we tested whether enhancing neurogenesis by a physiological stimulus likewise alters excitatory transmission to mature neurons. Our results show that selectively manipulating the number of immature GCs modifies synaptic function of mature GCs in a manner consistent with synaptic redistribution, with an inverse relationship between the number of new neurons and perforant-path evoked EPSCs. In contrast, enhancing neurogenesis via the non-selective paradigm of environmental enrichment generates a net increase in functional connectivity of mature neurons. Together these results demonstrate the capacity of mature GCs to alter synaptic function in response to genetic and experiential circuit manipulations."

We crossed Nestin-CreER<sup>tm4</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kuo et al., 2006a</a>) to Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buch et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arruda-Carvalho et al., 2011</a>). Six weeks after tamoxifen-induced recombination, DT injections were given to ablate immature adult-born GCs in <i>Nestin-Cre<sup>+</sup>/iDTR<sup>+</sup></i> offspring (termed Ablated<sub>im</sub> mice; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) with <i>Cre<sup>-</sup></i> littermates used as controls. Ten days after injections, there was a 27% reduction in the number of Dcx-expressing immature cells in the dentate of Ablated<sub>im</sub> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; 5601\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0262, n\u00a0=\u00a02, compared to 7648\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0332, n\u00a0=\u00a04, p=0.016), noting that re-population of Dcx-expressing cells in the period after DT injection can lead to an underestimation of ablation efficiency\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib76\">Vukovic et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yun et al., 2016</a>). Performing simultaneous field and whole-cell recordings from mature GCs in Ablated<sub>im</sub> mice and controls at 1\u20132 weeks after DT injections suggested no change in total synapses, assayed by the FV and fEPSP slopes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also assayed synaptic terminals by immunodetection of the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut1) in the molecular layer, and found no differences between controls and either Ablated<sub>im</sub> or BaxKO<sub>im</sub> slices (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, there was no change in the fEPSP normalized to the FV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, there was enhanced synaptic transmission to individual mature GCs, shown by larger EPSC amplitudes across FVs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and an overall larger EPSC/FV ratio (2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 in control compared to 3.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 in Ablated<sub>im</sub> mice; n\u00a0=\u00a042, 47 respectively, p=0.001 unpaired t-test). The change in synaptic strength was not associated with any changes in the intrinsic properties of mature GCs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). These results suggest that reducing the number of immature GCs increases the strength of synaptic transmission to mature GCs, an effect that cannot be explained by altered inhibition as GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were blocked in these experiments (<a href=\"#bib64\">Singer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Temprana et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Drew et al., 2016</a>). There was no difference in PPR, suggesting that release probability was unchanged (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We were unable to detect differences in the average frequency or amplitude of sEPSCs in mature GCs from Ablated<sub>im</sub> mice (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), making it unclear whether reduced EPSCs resulted from pre- or postsynaptic mechanisms. Since the frequency of spontaneous activity in GCs is low, the threshold for detecting differences in synaptic function using spontaneous activity may\u00a0be higher than for evoked transmission with FV normalization, and it appears that neurogenesis was altered by a greater degree in BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice compared to Ablated<sub>im</sub> mice (~40% versus 25% change in new neuron number). However, we also cannot rule out the possibility that separate pools of synaptic vesicles contribute to differences between results obtained with evoked and spontaneous assays (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib34\">Kavalali, 2015</a>)."

The idea that global measures of basal synaptic transmission and release probability are independent of the number of dentate GCs is in agreement with prior results in the conditional <i>Bax</i>KO (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sahay et al., 2011</a>) as\u00a0well\u00a0as the observation that perforant path synapse density is unaltered in germline <i>Bax</i>KO mice which exhibit dramatically enhanced numbers of dentate GCs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2009</a>).

We therefore sought to confirm synaptic integration of <i>Bax</i>KO immature GCs by crossing <i>Bax</i>KO<sub>im</sub> and control mice with a tdTomato reporter line (Ai14) to target <i>Bax</i>KO and <i>Bax</i>WT immature GCs for recordings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The input resistance is a measure of cell maturity (<a href=\"#bib52\">Overstreet-Wadiche and Westbrook, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dieni et al., 2013</a>) and as expected, labeled immature GCs (six weeks post-tamoxifen) had higher input resistance than mature GCs, with no difference between genotypes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This confirms that the immature GCs were at a similar stage of maturation and is consistent with the similar dendrite development reported in this model (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sahay et al., 2011</a>). FVs and fEPSP slopes were the same between genotypes, replicating the results of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and further suggesting a similar level of axonal activation and number of total synapses after conditional <i>Bax</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with the low excitatory connectivity of immature GCs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dieni et al., 2016</a>), in control mice the EPSC/FV ratio of immature GCs (1.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 n\u00a0=\u00a080) was lower than the EPSC/FV ratio in mature GCs (2.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 n\u00a0=\u00a086, p&lt;0.0001 unpaired t-test). But unexpectedly, simultaneously recorded fEPSPs and EPSCs revealed that EPSCs in <i>Bax</i>KO immature GCs were significantly larger than EPSCs in <i>Bax</i>WT immature GCs across FV bins, and the overall EPSC/FV ratio was greater (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus <i>Bax</i>KO immature GCs showed enhanced synaptic transmission compared to WT immature GCs. The PPR of EPSCs in immature GCs was similar between genotypes and there was not a significant difference in the frequency or amplitude of sEPSCs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), again noting that the low frequency of spontaneous activity in immature GCs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mongiat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dieni et al., 2016</a>) makes it difficult to interpret the lack of change in sEPSCs. These results confirm that <i>Bax</i>KO immature GCs acquired synapses during integration and, in fact, suggest <i>Bax</i> deletion promotes the synaptic integration of new GCs."

We directly compared EPSCs using simultaneous recordings from neighboring <i>Bax</i>WT (tdT<sup>-</sup>) and <i>Bax</i>KO (tdT<sup>+</sup> GCs; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In this paradigm, FV normalization is unnecessary because the number of stimulated axons is the same for both recorded cells. To compare across cell pairs with different numbers of stimulated fibers in each slice, we normalized EPSCs to each <i>Bax</i>WT GC.

Prior work suggests that Bax activation is an intermediary step between NMDAR-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and local activation of caspase-3, which in turn is necessary and sufficient for LTD and subsequent spine pruning (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jiao and Li, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sheng and Ert\u00fcrk, 2014</a>). The high level of <i>Bax</i> mRNA throughout the adult dentate gyrus (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lein et al., 2007</a>) raises the possibility that this pathway contributes to activity-dependent synaptic remodeling of mature GCs in addition to controlling the number of integrating new GCs via apoptosis. Given that synaptic strength may depend on Bax expression, we tested whether overall Bax levels are altered in BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice. Western blot analysis revealed no difference in Bax protein levels in hippocampal lysates from BaxKO<sub>im</sub> and control mice, showing that deletion of <i>Bax</i> from a small percentage of GCs does not lead to widespread changes in Bax protein (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Expression of tdTomato<sup>\u00a0</sup>(tdT)reporter revealed that most, but not all, NeuN-expressing GCs in the granule cell layer expressed Cre and that NeuN-lacking proliferating progenitors in the subgranular zone were Cre negative (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), consistent with transient activity of the <i>POMC</i> promoter in early postmitotic GCs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Overstreet-Wadiche et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Overstreet et al., 2004</a>). We compared EPSCs in simultaneous recordings from neighboring tdT<sup>+</sup> (<i>Bax</i>KO) and tdT<sup>-</sup> (<i>Bax</i>WT) mature GCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), again normalizing EPSCs to each WT cell to compare EPSCs across cell pairs. EPSCs in <i>Bax</i>KO GCs were larger than EPSCs in <i>Bax</i>WT GCs across a range of stimulus intensities (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To confirm that the increase in EPSC amplitude resulted from <i>Bax</i> deletion, we repeated the experiment in <i>POMC-Cre</i>/<i>Bax</i>WT/tdT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). EPSCs were the same in neighboring tdT<sup>+</sup> and tdT<sup>-</sup> mature GCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), indicating that the difference shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> requires the <i>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> genotype. Thus, <i>Bax</i> deletion from immature GCs <i>decreases</i> EPSCs in mature GCs via a non-cell autonomous mechanism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>), whereas here we show a cell-autonomous effect of <i>Bax</i> deletion that <i>increases</i> EPSCs in mature GCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These counterintuitive results could occur if <i>Bax</i> deletion generates presynaptic actions that are most evident when <i>Bax</i> is deleted from a large population of GCs. We addressed potential presynaptic alterations in BaxKO<sub>mat</sub> mice by testing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of synaptic transmission. However, we found no difference in presynaptic function as assessed by comparing EPSC amplitudes and PPRs across a range of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Posthoc analysis revealed a significant increase in the density of spines in <i>Bax</i>KO mature GCs, with no change in head diameter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>).

We thus assayed neurogenesis-induced synapse loss from mature GCs in BaxKO<sub>mat</sub> mice, where most mature GCs lack Bax. First, we confirmed that <i>Bax</i>KO in newly postmitotic GCs increases the number of integrating new neurons by assessing neurogenesis using <i>POMC</i>-eGFP expression. Consistent with the later period of cell death that occurs in newly postmitotic GCs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sierra et al., 2010</a>), we found that the number of newborn integrating neurons was enhanced to a similar degree as observed in BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, neurogenesis-induced suppression of synaptic transmission to mature GCs was absent, since the evoked EPSC was similar to controls across all stimulus intensities and the average EPSC/FV ratio was unchanged (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Similar to Ablated<sub>im</sub> and BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice, there was no difference in axonal activation or total synapse number, measured by the FV amplitude and fEPSP slope versus FV, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Intrinsic properties of mature GCs were the same in BaxKO<sub>mat</sub> and control mice, showing that <i>Bax</i> deletion does not affect these measures of cellular excitability (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). There was also no difference in the PPR, sEPSC frequency or sEPSC amplitude between mature GCs in control and BaxKO<sub>mat</sub> mice (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, there was considerable variability in EPSC/FV ratios and sEPSC frequencies in mature GCs from BaxKO<sub>mat</sub> mice, potentially indicative of the heterogeneous population of <i>Bax</i>WT and <i>Bax</i>KO GCs (as in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) with mixed susceptibility to neurogenesis-induced synapse impairment. Together, these results suggest that neurogenesis-induced loss of synaptic strength to mature GCs requires intact Bax signaling."

One long-established strategy to enhance neurogenesis is housing rodents with environmental enrichment (EE) that includes exploration of novel objects, social interactions, and running wheels. EE enhances both the number of newborn GCs and their synaptic integration (<a href=\"#bib75\">van Praag et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tashiro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ambrogini et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chancey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bergami et al., 2015</a>), as well as altering structural plasticity in the dentate and other brain regions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Green and Greenough, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Foster et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Eadie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Foster and Dumas, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stranahan et al., 2007</a>)."

We previously found that housing mice with running wheels alone for four weeks increases the number of <i>POMC</i>-eGFP labeled GCs to 146% of age-matched controls (<a href=\"#bib50\">Overstreet et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that EE enhances neurogenesis to a similar or greater extent as observed in BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). To assess the strength of excitatory transmission from entorhinal cortex across the population of GCs and onto individual mature GCs, we again stimulated the medial perforant path while simultaneously recording fEPSPs\u00a0and EPSCs from mature GCs in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib27\">Green and Greenough, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Foster et al., 1996</a>), the fEPSP slope was enhanced in slices from EE mice with no difference in the FV, suggesting an increase in total synaptic strength with no change axonal excitability (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Indeed, normalizing the fEPSP slope to the FV to account for differences in the number of stimulated axons across slices revealed a significant increase in\u00a0the fEPSP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). We targeted mature GCs located near the outer edge of the granule cell layer and confirmed their maturity by intrinsic membrane properties (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Consistent with the enhanced fEPSPs, EPSCs in mature GCs were larger in slices from mice housed in EE (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), such that the overall EPSC/FV ratio was 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 in EE compared to 1.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 in control (n\u00a0=\u00a088, 58 respectively, p&lt;0.0001 unpaired t-test). Enhanced synaptic strength after EE could result either from increased release probability, increased number of synapses or increase in the number of receptors per synapse. We found no difference in the\u00a0PPR of evoked EPSCs, suggesting that release probability is unchanged (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib22\">Foster et al., 1996</a>). However, the frequency of sEPSCs was increased with no change in sEPSC amplitude (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>), similar to the recently reported increase in miniature EPSCs in mature GCs after EE (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kajimoto et al., 2016</a>). Together these results suggest that enhanced evoked EPSCs in mature GCs result from greater number of functional synapses, consistent with increased spine density in Golgi-stained (presumably mature) dentate GCs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eadie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stranahan et al., 2007</a>). These results show that mature GCs exhibit experience-dependent synaptic enhancement that argues against the recently described restricted period for experience-dependent plasticity of dentate GCs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bergami et al., 2015</a>). However, these results cannot resolve whether integration of EE-induced newborn GCs affects synaptic function of mature neurons. Increased connectivity of mature neurons is likely a parallel phenomenon independent of neurogenesis, since similar increases in synaptic transmission and spine density occur in non-neurogenic regions (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rampon et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Malik and Chattarji, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jung and Herms, 2014</a>). Thus, the magnitude of increased connectivity of mature GCs could be reduced by neurogenesis-induced synaptic redistribution. Altogether, these results highlight the capacity of mature GCs to undergo changes in synaptic connectivity in response to both genetic and experiential circuit manipulations."

To determine whether the magnitude of altered transmission to mature GCs could be explained by a redistribution of existing synapses to integrating new GCs, we made a quantitative estimate of the proportion of mature synapses that would be transferred to new GCs over the time course of our experiments. We simulated the BaxKO<sub>im</sub> condition, since in this condition we quantified excitatory input to mature GCs and immature GCs, as well as the increase in new cells induced by <i>Bax</i> deletion. Other parameters were based on reported rates of neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chancey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gil-Mohapel et al., 2013</a>), cell death (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sierra et al., 2010</a>) and excitatory synaptic integration (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dieni et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2016</a>). The simulation is based on a static number of synapses that re-distribute to immature GCs according to their number and time-dependent synaptic integration\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The simulation showed a steep increase in the proportion of synapses occupied by immature GCs in BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice starting at the time point when immature GCs start to integrate into the network (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, red line). The robust transfer of synapses resulted not only from the increased number of immature GCs, but also from the increased acquisition of immature synapses resulting from <i>Bax</i> deletion. The predicted reduction in mature synapse number (expressed as a %) at days 36\u201343 in the simulation was similar to the % change in mature EPSCs measured experimentally (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Despite the small proportion of immature GCs within the network (initially set at 5%), the continuous increase in cell number along with enhanced synaptic integration was compounded over time to attenuate synapses on pre-existing neurons to a degree that could account for the magnitude of reduced synaptic strength observed in the BaxKO<sub>im</sub> experiments."

We found that selectively manipulating adult-born neurons inversely correlated with synaptic strength of mature neurons with no detectable changes in global measures of synaptic transmission. We reasoned that there are two ways that integrating newborn GCs can acquire synapses; new GCs can form new synaptic connections with existing afferent axons or new GCs can take pre-existing synapses from neighboring mature GCs. If synaptic integration of developing GCs triggers formation of new presynaptic terminals, then neurogenesis will increase the total number of synapses within the DG network but will not affect the number of synapses per mature GC (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C1</a>). In contrast, appropriation of existing synaptic terminals would cause mature GCs to lose synapses while the total number of synapses in the network remains constant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C2</a>). By comparing measures of total synapses (fEPSPs) and synapses per mature GC (EPSCs) after selectively altering neurogenesis, our results support the latter model wherein newborn GCs appropriate existing synapses and consequently modify synaptic input to mature GCs."

Anatomical analysis has suggested that multisynaptic boutons (MSBs) represent an intermediary structure in the transfer of functional synapses from mature to immature GCs (<a href=\"#bib73\">Toni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Toni and Sultan, 2011</a>). Although we did not find evidence for alterations in the total number of functional synapses reflecting the presence of MSBs when neurogenesis was manipulated, shared transmission from MSBs may be functionally silent due to lack of AMPA receptors on new neurons (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chancey et al., 2013</a>), or may be below the detection limits of field potential recordings. Furthermore, recent work suggests MSBs are a common feature of mature GCs and the complexity of MSB innervation increases with GC maturation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bosch et al., 2015</a>), so it is\u00a0unclear how our functional results relate to prior anatomical studies. Nevertheless, our results unambiguously demonstrate that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to existing mature GCs through a mechanism that involves reduced number of functional synapses. Unlike prior reports of alterations in DG excitability following selective manipulations of neurogenesis, we isolated excitatory synaptic transmission using GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists, thus our results cannot be attributed to differential recruitment of local inhibitory circuits by immature GCs (<a href=\"#bib64\">Singer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Massa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ikrar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Temprana et al., 2015</a>). In addition to such feedback inhibition, regulation of the density of mature GC excitatory synapses could potentially contribute to the counter-intuitive finding that the number of immature GCs is inversely related to the\u00a0excitability of the mature network (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ikrar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Drew et al., 2016</a>)."

Several pieces of evidence support this assumption. First, to account for differences in the number of stimulated axons across slices, we normalized EPSCs in mature GCs to the simultaneously recorded fiber volley, a common approach used in synaptic plasticity studies. Thus, differences in EPSCs cannot result from systematic differences in the number of stimulated axons. Second, reduced evoked EPSCs were accompanied by reduced frequency of sEPSCs with no change in amplitude and no change in the PPR. These characteristics are widely accepted indicators of changes in synapse number. Third, strontium-evoked asynchronous EPSCs likewise supported the idea that small EPSCs in mature GCs from BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice resulted from fewer active synapses rather than a postsynaptic change in sensitivity. We also found no difference in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of EPSCs between BaxKO<sub>mat</sub> and control mice. This suggests that <i>Bax</i> deletion from the majority of GCs did not affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of release processes, making it unlikely that a secreted factor acts presynaptically to alter release following <i>Bax</i> manipulation. Finally, we found that the density of mature GC spines was reduced after selective enhancement of neurogenesis. Our results are consistent with a model wherein newly generated GCs usurp pre-existing synapses from mature GCs, perhaps through an activity-dependent competitive process (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tashiro et al., 2006</a>), yet we cannot rule out other non-competitive mechanisms by which newly generated cells affect the number of\u00a0synapses on mature GCs. The recent observation that conditional suppression of spines on mature GCs enhances the integration of newborn GCs further supports the interactions between new and existing neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">McAvoy et al., 2016</a>)."

We used fEPSPs as a primary measure of total synapses, and presumably the fEPSP does not change despite the loss of EPSCs in mature GCs due to the additional contribution of synapses on immature neurons. Although we did not detect differences in fEPSPs (or vGluT expression), it is important to note that fEPSPs may not be particularly sensitive to synaptic density and will also be affected by intrinsic excitability. We did not detect any differences in the intrinsic excitability of mature GCs in our genetic models, but it is expected that the higher intrinsic excitability of immature neurons would enable a greater contribution to fEPSPs compared to mature GCs (for a given number of active AMPAR-containing synapses). However, newborn GCs have a high fraction of silent synapses that may limit their contribution to fEPSPs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chancey et al., 2013</a>). Most importantly, our interpretation of synaptic redistribution is not affected if the immature GC contribution to the fEPSP does not fully compensate for the loss of transmission to mature neurons (that is, <i>if the fEPSP was reduced in BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice</i>). Only an <i>increase</i> in the fEPSP in BaxKO<sub>im</sub> mice would lend support a synaptic addition model.

The contribution of Bax in our experiments is thus complex. We show that mature GCs exhibit a non-cell autonomous effect of <i>Bax</i> deletion from adult-born GCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>, <i>decreased</i> EPSCs) that is opposite to the cell-autonomous effect of <i>Bax</i> deletion in both cell types (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>, <i>increased</i> EPSCs). Remarkably, the cell autonomous function is required for the non-cell autonomous effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This complexity, however, makes sense when we consider the role of Bax signaling in both cell death and synapse pruning.\u00a0We propose that the non-cell autonomous effect results from enhanced neurogenesis (supported by the observation that ablation of neurogenesis produced the opposite outcome, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), whereas the cell autonomous effect results from a contribution of the Bax pathway in synaptic depression and spine pruning."

                                "text": "Although\u00a0the Bax signaling pathway is best known in the context of programmed cell death, it also has a non-apoptotic role in synaptic plasticity that is mediated by downstream caspases, the same family of cysteine proteases that initiate cell apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sheng and Ert\u00fcrk, 2014</a>). Caspases mediate dendritic remodeling during neural development (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kuo et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Williams et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</a>), and more recent work shows that caspase-3 activation is necessary and sufficient for NMDAR-mediated AMPA receptor internalization and LTD at hippocampal synapses (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Jiao and Li, 2011</a>). LTD is associated with spine shrinkage and is typically considered a herald of synapse pruning (<a href=\"#bib48\">Oh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wiegert and Oertner, 2013</a>), thus it appears that pathways mediating cellular destruction also contribute to synaptic destruction (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sheng and Ert\u00fcrk, 2014</a>). Indeed, local induction of caspase-3 activity in dendrites triggers spine elimination whereas caspase-3 KO mice exhibit increased GC spine density (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lo et al., 2015</a>), similar to our results of increased spine density in <i>Bax</i>KO GCs. Our findings that <i>Bax</i> deletion enhanced synaptic strength and spine density while blocking neurogenesis-induced loss of mature GC synaptic strength are consistent with the idea that on-going synaptic refinement controls the strength of excitatory transmission and that continual neurogenesis promotes a competitive environment for redistribution of synapses (<a href=\"#bib45\">McAvoy et al., 2016</a>)."

First, both enhancing neurogenesis and blocking output from mature GCs improves performance on the same context discrimination task (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sahay et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that neurogenesis could contribute to DG function by modifying mature GC activity. Synaptic depression and subsequent pruning are activity-dependent processes that typically require NMDA receptor activation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shipton and Paulsen, 2014</a>). Hence, re-distribution of active terminals away from mature GCs could transiently sparsify population activity, if new GCs initially have insufficient excitatory connectivity to allow recruitment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dieni et al., 2016</a>). Second, since eliminating <i>Bax</i> in progenitors leads to greater innervation as well as greater survival of neural progeny, enhancing neurogenesis by blocking the apoptotic pathway likely promotes competition to a greater extent than other methods of increasing neurogenesis. This could have implications for understanding the potential role of enhanced neurogenesis using <i>Bax</i> deletion in behavioral outcomes assessing pattern separation, stress resilience and forgetting (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sahay et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2015</a>). Finally, our results showing that deletion of Bax signaling in postmitotic GCs enhances synaptic transmission is consistent with increased activation of DG neurons observed in caspase-3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which also show behavioral deficits in attending to relevant stimuli (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lo et al., 2015</a>). Together, we speculate that synaptic redistribution between immature and mature GCs may contribute to activity-dependent synaptic remodeling that allows salient stimuli to receive precedence in DG encoding and may also contribute to circuit remodeling that degrades established memories (<a href=\"#bib77\">Weisz and Argibay, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chambers et al., 2004</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Epp et al., 2016</a>)."

In some experiments we tested a pre-set range of stimulus intensities, again ceasing stimulation after responses saturated. Both methods used the same range of intensities (0 to 100 V) with each approach generating fewer independent observations at progressively higher stimulus intensities due to saturation of axonal recruitment. The response of 10 stimuli at each intensity was averaged. Averaged field EPSPs (fEPSPs) and EPSCs were binned by their corresponding fiber volley (FV) amplitude.

New GCs are continually added to an existing network comprised of mature and immature GCs.

This is the other side of the coin that has not been looked at previously, focusing on how networks are remodeled to accommodate development and integration of new neurons. The authors used conditional Bax deletion to prevent apoptotic death of new neurons to increase neurogenesis, and found reduced excitation onto mature preexisting neurons due to a reduced number of synapses. When neurogenesis was reduced using diphtheria toxin, synaptic transmission onto mature neurons was increased, suggesting a competition for presynaptic terminals between new and old neurons. The authors also found that Bax deletion increases excitation in a cell-autonomous manner both in developing and in mature granule cells, and that synaptic competition requires Bax signaling. This is a very interesting work that approaches circuit remodeling by from an original perspective, necessary to understand in depth the consequences of neuronal addition in functional networks."

The fiber volley vs stimulus intensity plot in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> (left panel) shows clear saturation beyond 10x threshold, with the FVs reaching a plateau at around 100 microV even with a doubling of the stimulus intensity (compare 10x with 20x). Thus, stimulation beyond 10x clearly does not recruit any more afferent fibers. The saturation effect is also obvious in the fEPSP slope vs stimulation intensity plot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, middle panel), where again the response reaches a plateau beyond 10x threshold. Therefore, it appears meaningless to use stimulation intensities beyond 10x threshold, or the corresponding FV value of 200 microV. But if we accept the latter premise, the argument that there is a reduced synaptic transmission to mature neurons without a change in fEPSP falls apart. To wit, in the fEPSP slope vs FV plot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, right panel), the two BaxKOim data points at 100 and 200 microV are clearly (and probably significantly) smaller than their control counterparts. At these smaller stimulation intensities, the fEPSP vs FV and the EPSC vs FV plots actually look very similar. Note also that the largest difference in the EPSC amplitude vs FV plot in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> appears at the strongest stimulation intensity. Thus, the basic finding about the unchanged fEPSP in the face of altered single cell EPSC does not appear to be valid when responses to physiologically meaningful stimuli are considered."

The frequency of spontaneous activity in mature dentate GCs is low (~1Hz), and primarily mediated by single site events since the amplitude is not affected by TTX (i.e. Dieni et al., J Neuro 2013, Parent et al., E J Neurosci 2016). Mature granule cells are estimated to have up to -5,000 synapses, such that spontaneous events represent the activity of only a small fraction of synapses, and there is high variability in the frequency of activity between individual GCs. Due to dendritic filtering and imperfect space clamp, it is also likely that spontaneous synaptic activity arising at proximal locations (i.e. synapses in the IML) are over represented, potentially contributing to \u201cnoise\u2019 within and between experiments that does not occur in the evoked assay. While it is informative to see changes in spontaneous activity, it may be difficult to detect relatively small differences using this \u201clower resolution\u201d assay, whereas evoked transmission repeatedly assays a higher fraction of synapses and there is less variability between cells after we use the FV to normalize the number of stimulated axons across slices. It appears that the change in neurogenesis in BaxKOim mice is greater than in iDTR mice (~40% vs ~25% change), and thus the \u201clower resolution\u201d assay is unable to detect a difference in the iDTR model whereas the \u201chigher resolution\u201d assay can detect both. Finally, there is also ongoing debate about whether evoked and spontaneous synaptic release events actually arise from the same pool of vesicles, potentially underlying many reported differences in experimental results obtained by evoked and spontaneous activity (reviewed by Kavalali, Nat Rev Neurosci 2015).

We replicated the longstanding findings on fEPSPs and FVs (new <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and now directly show enhanced synaptic transmission to mature neurons with both evoked and spontaneous EPSC assays (new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Our results are thus consistent with the prevailing evidence that EE increases synaptic connectivity of pre-existing mature GCs, in contrast to recent evidence that only adult born neurons in a critical period of development exhibit increased connectivity after EE (Bergami et al., Neuron 2015). Several differences in the cell populations tested or timing of EE could contribute to these differences.

The averaged data, however, is not a good indicator of saturation in individual experiments because the stimulus-response relationships are highly variable between slices. We have illustrated this variability in a few examples of raw data and their average (<a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 2</a>). The raw data shows variability both in the maximum FV amplitude (ordinate) as well as the stimulus intensity at which the maximum FV amplitude is achieved (the point of saturation on the abscissa). Hence the \u201clinear range\u201d of the stimulus response in each experiment occurs across a variable range of stimulus intensities. The goal of our stimulating protocol was to stimulate at multiple points within the linear range to acquire useful data across that range, but not above it. When saturation appeared (i.e. Slice A, D, E), we did not acquire responses at higher stimulus intensities. This results in variability in the stimulus intensities and intervals used (compare slice B versus E), and fewer data points in the averages for the highest range of stimulus intensities. Each individual response includes a range of FV amplitudes with a minimal number of saturated FVs. We have added the following description to the Methods to clarify how the experiments were performed:"

In later experiments we tested a pre-set range of stimulus intensities, again ceasing stimulation after responses saturated. Both methods used the same range of intensities (0 to 100 V) with each approach generating fewer independent observations at progressively higher stimulus intensities due to saturation of axonal recruitment. The average response of 10 stimuli at each intensity was used for analysis. Field EPSPs (fEPSPs) and EPSCs were binned by their corresponding fiber volley (FV) amplitude.

Yet, our interpretation of synaptic redistribution does not require that the immature neuron contribution to the fEPSP fully compensates for the loss of transmission to mature neurons (that is, if we had actually found a reduction in the fEPSP, or if the sensitivity of extracellular recording is too low to detect such a difference).

The frequency of spontaneous EPSCs in mature dentate GCs is low (~1Hz), and primarily mediated by single site events since the amplitude is not affected by TTX (i.e. Dieni et al., J Neuro 2013, Parent et al., E J Neurosci 2016). Mature granule cells are estimated to have up to -5,000 synapses, such that spontaneous events represent the activity of only a small fraction of synapses, and there is high variability in the frequency of activity between individual GCs. Due to dendritic filtering and imperfect space clamp, it is also likely that spontaneous synaptic activity arising at proximal locations (i.e. synapses in the IML) are over represented, potentially contributing to \u201cnoise\u2019 within and between experiments that does not occur in the evoked assay. While it is informative to see changes in spontaneous activity, it may be difficult to detect relatively small differences using this \u201clower resolution\u201d assay, whereas evoked transmission repeatedly assays a higher fraction of synapses and there is less variability between cells after we use the FV to normalize the number of stimulated axons across slices. It appears that the change in neurogenesis in BaxKOim mice is greater than in iDTR mice (~40% vs ~25% change), and thus the \u201clower resolution\u201d assay is unable to detect a difference in the iDTR model whereas the \u201chigher resolution\u201d assay can detect both. Finally, there is also ongoing debate about whether evoked and spontaneous synaptic release events actually arise from the same pool of vesicles, potentially underlying many reported differences in experimental results obtained by evoked and spontaneous activity (reviewed by Kavalali, Nat Rev Neurosci 2015).
