Yet, how our brain selects the noteworthy information that will be consolidated during sleep remains largely unknown. Here we show that post-learning sleep favors the selectivity of long-term consolidation: when tested three months after initial encoding, the most important (i.e., rewarded, strongly encoded) memories are better retained, and also remembered with higher subjective confidence. Our brain imaging data reveals that the functional interplay between dopaminergic reward regions, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus contributes to the integration of rewarded associative memories. We further show that sleep spindles strengthen memory representations based on reward values, suggesting a privileged replay of information yielding positive outcomes. These findings demonstrate that post-learning sleep determines the neural fate of motivationally-relevant memories and promotes a value-based stratification of long-term memory stores."

Yet, how our brain selects the noteworthy information that will be consolidated during sleep remains largely unknown. Here we show that post-learning sleep favors the selectivity of long-term consolidation: when tested three months after initial encoding, the most important (i.e., rewarded, strongly encoded) memories are better retained, and also remembered with higher subjective confidence. Our brain imaging data reveals that the functional interplay between dopaminergic reward regions, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus contributes to the integration of rewarded associative memories. We further show that sleep spindles strengthen memory representations based on reward values, suggesting a privileged replay of information yielding positive outcomes. These findings demonstrate that post-learning sleep determines the neural fate of motivationally-relevant memories and promotes a value-based stratification of long-term memory stores."

                        "text": "It is well established that sleep contributes to memory consolidation processes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Maquet, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stickgold and Walker, 2013</a>). In animals and humans memory traces are reinforced through neural reactivation and trimmed through synaptic downscaling. Critically, both neural replay and synaptic downscaling entail the tagging of neural elements coding for specific memories and coincide with the occurrence of specific oscillatory elements in sleep such as sleep spindles, and slow wave activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ringli and Huber, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tononi and Cirelli, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schwindel and Mcnaughton, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wilhelm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">K\u00e1li and Dayan, 2004</a>). For memory consolidation to be adaptive, information that is critical for survival, such as stimuli with an emotional or rewarding value, should be consolidated in priority during sleep (<a href=\"#bib30\">Perogamvros and Schwartz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sterpenich et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, behavioral studies in humans suggest that reward may modulate sleep-related memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fischer and Born, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Werchan and G\u00f3mez, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Oudiette et al., 2013</a>). At the neural level, animal studies provide evidence for spontaneous coordinated replay of neural activity in memory and reward brain structures during slow-wave sleep (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lansink et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pennartz et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that the activation of reward circuits during sleep influences neural plasticity. Further, within the rat hippocampus, the firing patterns of CA1 and CA3 neurons encode the high or low reward outcome of items in an associative memory task (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mckenzie et al., 2014</a>). In humans, at wake, the activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system enhances associative memory through interactions with the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shohamy and Wagner, 2008</a>), as well as subjective confidence and feeling of goal attainment during successful retrieval (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shohamy and Wagner, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adcock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wolosin et al., 2012</a>). Yet, it is unclear whether the\u00a0replay of rewarded memories during sleep primarily involves the transfer of hippocampal memories to cortical sites (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gais et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Takashima et al., 2009</a>), or the strengthening of memory-reward associations, implicating hippocampal-striatal interactions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lansink et al., 2009</a>). Based on these findings and recent theoretical proposals suggesting that sleep may influence associative memory by facilitating the integration of multi-item sequences (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stickgold and Walker, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ellenbogen et al., 2007</a>), a critical and unanswered question that we ask here is whether reward values linked to recent memory items control the remodeling of associative knowledge during sleep. Specifically, we test whether reward influences sleep-dependent memory consolidation by promoting associative processes in the hippocampus, ultimately prioritizing long-term retention and subjective confidence for highly (over lowly) rewarded stimuli."

The task was composed of eight series of six successive pictures each; four series were associated with high reward outcome (HR: dollar coin) and four with low reward outcome (LR:\u00a0cent\u00a0coin) all participants received the same total payment. The participants first saw the eight series once during the encoding session (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), followed by the 2-alternative forced choice learning session with feedback during which participants successively selected the next picture in the series among two presented pictures <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Then, the participants either took a 90-min nap (Sleep group, n = 16) or spent an equivalent period quietly awake (Wake group; n = 15), both monitored by polysomnography EEG. After this delay and again three months later, the participants performed an associative memory task on pairs of pictures with different relational distances (direct, inference of order 1 and order 2). They were presented with one image and were then asked which one among two images was part of the same series as the first image (while the other image belonged to a different series) and gave confidence ratings for each answer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

A direct comparison between the Sleep and Wake groups for HR versus LR (independently of Relational Distance) revealed increased activity in the right hippocampus [z-score = 4.04 (30x, -10y, -23z), p&lt;0.05 SVC; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)]. Within this interaction, post-hoc analysis of the extracted beta values showed that both for Sleep and Wake groups HR condition was different from LR condition (both p=0.02). Because the integration of distant associative memories possibly relies on sleep spindles (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tamminen et al., 2010</a>), we tested for the brain correlates of this functional relationship. To test specifically for the integration of associative memories (and not the consolidation of previously seen associations, as in direct trials), we considered associations between non-consecutive images with distinct relational distances by comparing inference 2 to inference 1 trials (inference 2 &gt; inference 1). We found that the number of slow spindles in the Sleep group positively correlated with activation in the right hippocampus for HR distant associations [HR inference 2 versus HR inference 1; z-score = 3.75 (27x, -16y, -11z), p&lt;0.05 SVC; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>], and not for LR associations."

While we found no main effect of Group, Reward, or Relational Distance (ANOVA all p&gt;0.05), we found a Group x Reward interaction (F(1,66) = 4.21,\u00a0p=0.044). Only the Sleep group remembered HR compared to LR series better (T(32) = 2.91, p=0.006), while no such difference was found in the Wake group (T(38) = -0.25, p=0.80). In fMRI, we tested for Group differences between HR and LR trials according to Relational Distance. We observed a selective increase of left hippocampus activity for HR versus LR during inference 2 trials in the Sleep group compared to the Wake group [z-score = 3.78 (-36x, -28y, -8z), p&lt;0.05 SVC; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>], we observed no Group difference for direct and inference 1 trials. Post-hoc analyses of the hippocampal beta values showed that the interaction was due to an increased hippocampal response to HR vs. LR trials in the Sleep group only (p=0.03). Further, using psychophysiological interaction (PPI), we asked whether sleep had some long-term effects on the functional coupling between the hippocampus and other brain regions during the processing of HR (vs. LR) trials (see Materials and methods). Both the caudate nucleus [z-score = 3.41 (15x, 20y, 7z); p&lt;0.05 SVC] and the medial prefrontal cortex [z-score = 2.99 (15x, 59y, -5z); p&lt;0.05 SVC] showed such pattern of increased functional connectivity in the Sleep (compared to the Wake) group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Because striatal activation may be relevant for the reprocessing of rewarded associations during sleep (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lansink et al., 2009</a>), we tested whether the strength of the caudate-hippocampal functional coupling correlated with the number of slow sleep spindles during the nap in the Sleep group, and found that this correlation was significant (R = 0.591, p=0.028, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

We therefore analyzed \u2018certain\u2019 confidence responses. To correct for potential performance biases, we considered the percentage of \u2018certain\u2019 responses for hits only. For the test session, we found a main effect of Group (F(1,78) = 4.90, p=0.029; more \u2018certain\u2019 responses for the Sleep group), of Reward (F(1,78) = 59.06,p&lt;0.001; higher confidence for HR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Further, we found a Group effect (Sleep&gt;Wake) within HR hits (F(1,78) = 6.63, p=0.01), and not for LR hits (F(1,78) = 0.73, p=0.39). Importantly, the Group effect was not due to an unspecific influence of sleep, as confidence judgments for incorrect responses did not differ between the groups, neither for HR trials (U = 72.50, p=0.35) nor for LR trials (U = 84, p=0.51). Note that we performed U-Tests because of small sample size and non-normal distribution of incorrect responses. For the retest session, we found a main effect of Reward (higher confidence for HR trials; F(1,66) = 18.92, p&lt;0.001) and a post-hoc difference between HR and LR confidence within the Sleep group only (p=0.003 for the Sleep group and p=0.38 for Wake group) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). At retest, there were very few certain responses. To obtain correctly sized samples to analyze confidence judgments at retest, we grouped \u2018certain\u2019, \u2018by elimination\u2019 and \u2018not sure\u2019 answers together and contrasted them to \u2018guess\u2019 answers. In line with our main imaging results for inference 2 trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), this analysis on confidence yielded higher activation in the parahippocampus [z-score = 3.49 (27x, -25y, 26z) p&lt;0.05 SVC] and in the putamen [z-score = 3.46 (-18x, -1y, 7z), p&lt;0.05 SVC] for Sleep &gt; Wake selectively for HR inference 2 when comparing some confidence to guess (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

(<a href=\"#bib34\">Schmidt et al., 2006</a>) who reported that memory improvement for word-pairs over a nap implicated slow spindles. Sleep spindles may induce long-term synaptic plastic changes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Marshall et al., 2006</a>), thus consolidating newly learned information into a more stable form of long-term memory. Slow spindles (11\u201313\u00a0Hz) are dominant over the prefrontal lobe (<a href=\"#bib32\">Saletin and Walker, 2012</a>) and are related to a cross-linking of transferred information within prefrontal circuitry (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clemens et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, activity in dopaminergic reward regions such as the VTA is increased during slow spindles in humans (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schabus et al., 2007</a>). Consistent with these observations, we found that slow spindles after learning were related to the functional interplay between the hippocampus and the caudate nucleus during the long-term recall of high rewarded series. From these connectivity findings, we conclude that slow spindles may primarily favor the long-term consolidation of rewarded stimuli across striatal and hippocampal networks. We may speculate that enhanced hippocampal recruitment for HR trials at retest could possibly foster recall processes subserved by the mPFC, a brain region reportedly involved in the retrieval of episodic memories (<a href=\"#bib10\">D\u00fczel et al., 1999</a>)."

This mechanism could promote the conversion of implicit forms of memory into more explicit and conscious memories (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wilhelm et al., 2013</a>), and also facilitate the access to remote associations (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zeithamova et al., 2012</a>)."

This analysis included standard preprocessing procedures: realignment, slice timing to correct for differences in slice acquisition time, normalization (images were normalized to an EPI template), and smoothing (with an isotropic 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel). A general linear model (GLM) approach was then used to compare conditions of interest at the individual level and then these contrasts from each participant entered a second-level random-effects analysis. All group comparisons were performed using ANOVAs. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by submitting all reported activations to small-volume correction (SVC) for familywise error (p&lt;0.05) using regions of interest based on the Anatomy toolbox of SPM8 for the hippocampus (SPM Anatomy toolbox 2.1, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH), the automated anatomical labeling (aal) atlas for the caudate nucleus, the parahippocampus and the putamen (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>), and using the coordinates from (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bunzeck and D\u00fczel, 2006</a>) for VTA-compatible midbrain regions and from (<a href=\"#bib10\">D\u00fczel et al., 1999</a>) for the medial prefrontal cortex.

Each session contained 2 regressors for successful trials and 2 regressors for misses according to their reward outcome (HR, LR) and the 6 motion parameters derived from the spatial realignment added as covariate of no interest. We then performed a contrast between HR and LR hits for each participant and entered the resulting statistical maps into a second-level 2-sample t-test which also included the difference in performance between HR and LR series (i.e., HR minus LR performance) as a covariate. This analysis allowed us to identify brain regions selectively contributing to reward-related performance improvement. This analysis revealed increased activation in a midbrain region compatible with the VTA [z-score = 3.71 (-3x, -13y, -20z),\u00a0p&lt;0.05, small-volume corrected (SVC) for familywise error] using the VTA coordinate from Bunzeck and Duzel (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bunzeck and D\u00fczel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Therefore, we took as psychological factor the contrast between HR and LR hits, irrespective of trial type (direct, inference 1 and inference 2 trials). A new linear model was prepared for PPI analyses at the individual level, using three regressors. The first regressor represented the psychological factor, composed of HR vs. LR hits. The second regressor was the activity in the right hippocampus. The third regressor represented the interaction of interest between the first (psychological) and the second (physiological) regressor. To build this regressor, the underlying neuronal activity was first estimated by a parametric empirical Bayes formulation, combined with the psychological factor and subsequently convolved with the hemodynamic response function (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gitelman et al., 2003</a>). The model also included movement parameters. A significant psychophysiological interaction indicated a change in the regression coefficients between any reported brain area and the reference region, related to the correct retrieval of HR vs. LR trials. Next, individual summary statistic images obtained at the first-level (fixed-effects) analysis were spatially smoothed (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel) and entered a second-level (random-effects) analysis using ANOVAs to compare the functional connectivity between groups. Finally, based on existing animal data suggesting a coordinated replay of rewarded associations within striatal and hippocampal regions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lansink et al., 2009</a>), we tested whether reward-related regions showing increased functional connectivity with the hippocampus as a function of reward level (selectively in the Sleep group) correlated with sleep spindles. We thus extracted the beta values around relevant PPI result peaks using a 10 mm diameter sphere and performed a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis (appropriate for small samples) with the number of spindles detected during the nap for the participants in the Sleep group."

Critically, we also explicitly told them that both the dollar and the cent were \u201csymbols\u201d (not actual US dollar values) and that we would convert their performance into Swiss Francs at the end of the learning session, so that if they performed well they would receive the maximal amount (i.e. 120 Swiss Francs). This manipulation was meant to: (i) ensure that the participants would pay attention to the distinct reward levels associated with each sequence, (ii) increase the participants\u2019 motivation to obtain the rewards, and (iii) also ensure that each participant got the same final monetary outcome (i.e. 120 Swiss Francs). Moreover, because the participants could not guess during the learning session how much in Swiss Francs they would receive, we do not think that a post-hoc leveling effect may have occurred. This was confirmed at debriefing, during which participants reported that they believed that they got the maximal amount because they performed well. The revised version of the manuscript now clarifies this important point. More details about this manipulation are provided in the subsection \u201cBehavioural task\u201d."

This can be best achieved by contrasting more distant pairs (inference 2 trials) to less distant pairs (inference 1 trials) in inference trials; inference 2 trials involving higher integrative demands than inference 1 trials, while both types of trials have a very similar learning status (unlike direct trials which were first presented (and tested) during the learning session). This contrast should thus reveal brain regions whose activity reflected the strength of the integration between non-consecutive pictures within a series. Therefore, the reported test in the fourth paragraph of the Results section (comparing inference 2 &gt; inference 1) was performed on purpose and does not correspond to one among multiple possible options.

We have now clarified the way the PPI was done and conducted the PPI analysis without masking as asked by the reviewer(s) for the other contrasts. This new analysis yielded two significant activation clusters, one in the medial prefrontal cortex [z-score=2.99 (15x, 59y, -5z); &lt;0.05 SVC] and one in the caudate nucleus [z-score=3.41 (15x, 20y, 7z); p&lt;0.05 SVC). To directly address the reviewers\u2019 comment, and because the striatal-hippocampal coupling may be relevant for the selective replay of rewarded associations during sleep (Lansink et al., 2009), we extracted the beta values of the PPI around the caudate nucleus peak using a 10 mm diameter sphere and correlated these values to the number of slow sleep spindles during the nap in the sleep group. We performed a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation (appropriate for small samples, here n=12) and obtained a significant correlation (R=0.591,p=0.028). Note that no such correlation was observed for the connectivity between the hippocampus and mPFC. From these connectivity findings, we conclude that slow spindles may primarily favor the long-term consolidation of rewarded stimuli across striatal and hippocampal networks. We may speculate that enhanced hippocampal recruitment for HR trials at retest could possibly foster recall processes subserved by the mPFC, a brain region reportedly involved in the retrieval of episodic memories (Duzel et al., 1999).The new correlation has been added to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a> and to the manuscript in paragraph five Results section.

This general pattern of results suggests that it is the differential impact of sleep on memory and reward circuits as a function of reward values that drives the interaction effects.

To minimize possible effects of encoding disparities due to reward levels, in all the analyses and for each participant, we only included well encoded items, namely associations for which the participant was correct on at least 2 over 3 repetitions during the learning phase. To directly address the reviewers\u2019 comment, we have now performed a new analysis for the test session, further separating items according to their encoding strength (i.e. separating items for which a participant gave 2 or 3 correct responses during learning) with reward, inference and group as other factors. This analysis revealed no effect of encoding strength at test (F(1,74)=0.0002, p&gt;0.05) neither any interaction effect with encoding strength (all ps&gt;0.05), thus suggesting that associated reward value rather than stronger encoding promotes sleep-related memory consolidation in our study. Consistent with our results, one previous study which specifically tested for the effects of encoding strength on sleep-related memory consolidation found that sleep favors the consolidation of less well encoded material (more than thoroughly encoded material) (Schmidt et al., 2006). Concerning the specific effect of reward, one behavioral study in which instruction about the future relevance was provided after an encoding session, also demonstrated that sleep selectively promotes the consolidation of information associated with a positive future outcome (for information with a similar level of initial encoding) (Fischer and Born, 2009). Moreover, animal data showing that neural activity recorded during a place-reward associative learning task may be reactivated (and possibly consolidated) during sleep across both reward and memory systems (Lansink et al., 2009) may also point to a specific role of associated reward value for the reprocessing of hippocampal-dependent memories during sleep. Although these considerations and the new analysis reported above support our initial interpretation that highly (compared to lowly) rewarded items benefit more from consolidation processes occurring during sleep, we now acknowledge in the Abstract and Discussion that encoding strength may also have an influence on these offline consolidation processes, despite our efforts to minimize disparities in encoding strength."

An explanatory framework is suggested by the title, but as yet we encounter a number of rather separate findings. As related areas such as N. Accumbens, OFC and Amygdala are part of the same network, how is it explained that no effects were picked up in these areas? Moreover, it remains unclear which mechanisms would account for the fact that sometimes the right hippocampus shows up (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C, D</a>), and sometimes the left hippocampus (e.g. 2F \u2013 although for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, the figure legend states \"left\" hippocampus whereas the text states \"right\" hippocampus). Likewise, the origin of the lateralization effects is unclear for the PFC.</i>"

Specifically, our reward-based learning paradigm implicates distinct mechanisms that can best be described as a 2-step process. (1) At encoding, (high) potential rewards activate dopaminergic midbrain regions, which would seal a relevance tag to recently learned and rewarded associations. This initial step is substantiated by our data showing that VTA activity at encoding mediates the acquisition of highly rewarded material. (2) During sleep, the privileged reprocessing of associations with a high relevance would plausibly implicate the activation of a VTA\u2013striatum-hippocampal network (Lansink et al., 2009; Perogamvros and Schwartz, 2012; Valdes et al., 2015), and be coordinated by oscillatory activity during sleep, in particular sleep spindles (Born et al., 2006; Molle et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2006; Wilhelm et al., 2011), during which the human VTA has been found to be activated (Schabus et al., 2007). Here, we report enhanced performance and higher hippocampus activity for the recall of highly rewarded associations. Critically, although we did not acquire fMRI data during sleep in our study, we also show that the number of slow spindles correlated with the selective consolidation of highly rewarded associations at test and, at long-term, with increased hippocampal-striatal connectivity, thus consistent with a determinant role of sleep spindles in the consolidation of rewarded associations across memory and reward brain regions."

In the case of rewarded memories the striatum may have an important contribution (Wittmann et al., 2005), in line with recent observations of joint caudate and prefrontal involvement during the recall of positive relative to neutral autobiographical memories in humans (Speer et al., 2014)."

In the present study, we did not have any a priori hypothesis concerning the lateralization of hippocampal activity because our task involves associative memory while the nature of our stimuli involves the processing of spatial contexts, which may respectively recruit the left and the right hippocampus (Igloi et al., 2010)."
