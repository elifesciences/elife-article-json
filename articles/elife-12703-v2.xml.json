In the brain, the phenotypic spectrum of <i>PIK3CA</i>-related segmental overgrowth includes bilateral dysplastic megalencephaly, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia, the most common cause of intractable pediatric epilepsy. We generated mouse models expressing the most common activating <i>Pik3ca</i> mutations (<i>H1047R</i> and <i>E545K</i>) in developing neural progenitors. These accurately recapitulate all the key human pathological features including brain enlargement, cortical malformation, hydrocephalus and epilepsy, with phenotypic severity dependent on the mutant allele and its time of activation. Underlying mechanisms include increased proliferation, cell size and altered white matter. Notably, we demonstrate that acute 1 hr-suppression of PI3K signaling despite the ongoing presence of dysplasia has dramatic anti-epileptic benefit. Thus PI3K inhibitors offer a promising new avenue for effective anti-epileptic therapy for intractable pediatric epilepsy patients."

In the brain, the phenotypic spectrum of <i>PIK3CA</i>-related segmental overgrowth includes bilateral dysplastic megalencephaly, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia, the most common cause of intractable pediatric epilepsy. We generated mouse models expressing the most common activating <i>Pik3ca</i> mutations (<i>H1047R</i> and <i>E545K</i>) in developing neural progenitors. These accurately recapitulate all the key human pathological features including brain enlargement, cortical malformation, hydrocephalus and epilepsy, with phenotypic severity dependent on the mutant allele and its time of activation. Underlying mechanisms include increased proliferation, cell size and altered white matter. Notably, we demonstrate that acute 1 hr-suppression of PI3K signaling despite the ongoing presence of dysplasia has dramatic anti-epileptic benefit. Thus PI3K inhibitors offer a promising new avenue for effective anti-epileptic therapy for intractable pediatric epilepsy patients."

The mice were genetically engineered to have various mutations in the gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of the PI3K enzyme. The mutations were the same as those found in people with brain overgrowth disorders, and were activated only in the developing brain of the mice. These mutations caused enlarged brain size, fluid accumulation in the brain, brain malformations and epilepsy in developing mice \u2013 thus mimicking the human birth defects. The severity of these symptoms depended on the specific mutation and when the mutant genes were turned on during development."

This drug specifically targets and reduces the activity of PI3K. Adult mutant mice with brain malformations were treated for just one hour; this dramatically reduced their seizures. These experiments prove that seizures associated with this kind of brain overgrowth disorder are driven by ongoing abnormal PI3K activity and can be treated even when underlying brain abnormalities persist. Roy et al. suggest that drugs targeting PI3K might help treat seizures in children with these brain overgrowth disorders."

Activating mutations in genes of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, especially <i>PIK3CA</i>, encoding the catalytic p110\u03b1 isoform of the PI3K complex, have long been linked to cancer\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Cheung and Testa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Engelman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hennessy et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Iwabuchi et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Samuels and Waldman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gymnopoulos et al., 2007</a>). Germline and mosaic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> and other pathway genes also cause a wide range of brain and body overgrowth disorders; all anomalies caused by somatic <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations are now collectively termed <i>PIK3CA</i>-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Keppler-Noreuil et al., 2014</a>). The broad spectrum of brain overgrowth disorders caused by <i>PIK3CA</i> activating mutations is impressive. Three strongly activating <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations found most commonly in cancer (hotspot mutations) result in severe segmental cortical dysplasia (SEGCD), which includes bilateral dysplastic megalencephaly (MEG), hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) types 2a/2b\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">D'Gama et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Conway et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jansen et al., 2015</a>). Other mutations, resulting in intermediate or weak <i>PIK3CA</i> activation, cause MEG or MEG with polymicrogyria (MEG-PMG) as part of the MEG-capillary malformation syndrome (MCAP)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Conway et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mirzaa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2012</a>). Developmental features of these brain disorders include cortical malformations, hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Keppler-Noreuil et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mirzaa et al., 2012</a>). FCD represents one of the most common causes of intractable epilepsy\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Bast et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fauser et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fauser, 2006</a>)."

To understand the cellular mechanisms behind <i>PIK3CA</i>-related brain overgrowth disorders, we used a series of <i>cre</i>-drivers to activate expression of <i>H1047R</i> and <i>E545K</i> alleles in subsets of neural progenitors. Dramatic phenotypes resulted, faithfully modeling the entire spectrum of <i>PIK3CA</i>-associated human brain disorders including enlarged brain size, hydrocephalus, cortical dysplasia and epilepsy. The severity of these brain phenotypes critically depended on the <i>Pik3ca</i> allele and its time of activation. Notably, <i>Pik3ca-</i>associated\u00a0epilepsy in mice was independent of brain overgrowth and cortical dysplasia. Further the seizures of adult megalencephalic mice were suppressed by acute 1\u00a0hr-administration of pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib48\">Maira et al., 2012</a>). We conclude that epilepsy in these models represents an active <i>Pik3ca</i>-driven process that can be restricted by dynamic modulation of PI3K pathway activity in dysmorphic brains. These results raise the exciting prospect of new molecular based epilepsy therapies in patients whose seizures have been intractable to current anti-seizure therapies."

The labeling index was similar to the control at E14.5 but increased in E16.5 mutants (p&lt;0.05), indicating more proliferation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3m,o,r</a>). Cell density in <i>E545K</i> mutant neocortex was similar to the control at E14.5 but was reduced at E16.5 (p&lt;0.05). Total cells per cortical column length did not change in the <i>E545K</i> mutant; but the TUNEL<sup>+</sup>\u00a0cell number was lower in E16.5 mutant cortex than in control (p&lt;0.001).

We do not believe that overexpression of the transgenic <i>H1047R</i> allele versus the knock-in design of the <i>E545K</i> allele underlies the phenotypic differences.

Similarly, embryonic activation of <i>H1047R</i> and <i>E545K</i> in mice caused abnormal neocortical lamination, with late-migrating Cux1-positive neurons severely affected in both the mutants. Birthdating studies support the conclusion that Pik3ca activation does not alter cell fate and that cortical dysplasia is predominantly a result of aberrant migration. The severity of dyslamination in <i>H1047R</i> mutants likely reflects the dysplastic Reelin-positive Cajal-Retzius cells. However the Reelin-positive layer remained well defined in both mutants. This is in contrast to the ectopic Reelin expression in neurons expressing high levels of overactive pAKT introduced by electroporation into embryonic mouse cortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Baek et al., 2015</a>). In human SEGCD, late migrating neurons often fail to migrate to the upper layers\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Arai et al., 2012</a>), a phenotype more severe than seen in any of our mouse models. However, NeuN immunohistochemistry in <i>H1047R</i> mutants confirmed the presence of ectopic neurons in the subcortical white matter, as seen in human SEGCD brain\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Arai et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Salamon, 2006</a>).

Although cortical dysplasia resulted from embryonic activation of <i>Pik3ca</i> in <i>Nestin-cre;E545K</i> mice, postnatal activation of <i>Nestin-creER;E545K</i> did not cause increased cell size or megalencephaly or altered cortical lamination. Thus Pik3ca-dependent epilepsy is independent of dysmorphology. Further, inhibitory interneurons were not grossly perturbed in <i>Nestin-creER;E545K</i> mice (data not shown). This is congruent with the fact that these interneurons are born at embryonic stages and their migration is almost complete before birth\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Batista\u2010Brito and Fishell, 2009</a>). Therefore altered interneuron development in <i>Nestin-cre;E545K</i> may contribute to epilepsy, aberrant interneuron development cannot represent a common mechanism for epilepsy in both models. The observation that acute BKM120 treatment is sufficient to inhibit PTZ-induced seizures even in adult megalencephalic mice supports the argument that the epileptic seizures are independent of dysplasia since the latter is not reversed over the short course of treatment. This is an important finding since a large portion of FCD patients who do not show detectable dysplasia suffer from intractable epilepsy\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Bernasconi et al., 2011</a>)."

The modest changes in signaling compared to controls is congruent with previous studies which demonstrated only modest changes in the steady-state levels of PI3K signaling in breast cancer cells with <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib64\">Stemke-Hale et al., 2008</a>). Higher signaling levels in hippocampus versus cortex suggest a more prominent role of hippocampus in the seizure phenotype. PTZ administration alone in both controls and megalencephalic <i>Nestin-cre;E545K</i> mutants caused upregulation of many core components of PI3K-AKT pathway, including pAkt, pS6 and pNDRG1. This is congruent with a report showing PTZ-induced seizures in rats upregulated PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhang and Wong, 2012</a>) and suggests that elevated baseline PI3K signaling levels are epileptogenic."

A number of mechanisms including altered development, cell size, growth, proliferation and circuitry have been reported\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib68\">Wong and Crino, 2012</a>). Most remarkably however, our acute BKM120 administration data clearly demonstrates that histopathological mechanisms are not the primary epilepsy drivers. Acute 1\u00a0hr of BKM120 administration was sufficient to completely inhibit the increased phosphorylation levels induced by PTZ, notably returning mutant hippocampal mTOR-dependent pS473-AKT levels to baseline untreated control levels. This was sufficient to normalize the PTZ-seizure induction threshold, despite continued dysplasia in <i>Nestin-cre;E545K</i> mutants. We conclude that elevated PI3K signaling is itself actively epileptogenic, independent of underlying developmental pathology."

Briefly, mice underwent survival surgery to implant fine (diameter: 130\u00a0\u00b5m bare; 180\u00a0\u00b5m coated) silver wire EEG and EMG electrodes under isoflurane anesthesia. Four EEG electrodes were placed bilaterally through the small cranial burr holes over the posterior and frontal cortices and were fixed in place with cyanoacrylate glue and dental cement (Lang Dental Manufacturing Co., Inc., Wheeling, IL). Similarly, one reference electrode was placed above the cerebellum. A ground electrode was inserted subcutaneously over the back. EMG electrodes were placed in back muscles. Only 2 electrodes were implanted in the young <i>Nestin-cre;E545K</i> mutant and control mice. Mice were allowed to recover from surgery for 2-3 days. Simultaneous video-EEG-EMG recordings were collected from conscious mice on a PowerLab 8/35 data acquisition unit using LabChart 7.3.3 software (AD Instruments, Colorado Spring, Co). All bioelectrical signals were acquired at 1KHz sampling rate. The EEG signals were processed off-line with a 1-70 Hz bandpass filter and the ECG signals with a 3-Hz highpass filter. Interictal spikes were identified as transient, clearly distinguished from background activity, with pointed peak and short duration. Myoclonic seizures were identified as shock-like jerks of the muscles on video associated with a spike or polyspike-wave complex on EEG."

Three independent biological replicates per sample were analyzed. Analysis was performed as previously described\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib67\">Tibes et al., 2006</a>). The mouse brain tissue samples were lysed and underwent protein extraction. Cellular protein was denatured by SDS sample buffer and serial dilution was made for each sample. Cell lysates were then probed with different validated antibodies. Signals were detected by DAB colorimetric reaction and intensity was quantified using ArrayPro software. Protein concentration was determined by super curve fitting. All the data points were normalized for protein loading and transformed to linear value.

Cortical length and thickness were measured using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA); the data was normalized to the control value. Cell counts from E14.5 and E16.5 brains were obtained from 25% of the neocortex. Area of interest was derived by dividing the whole length of neocortex into quarters and then taking images of the total area, from pia to ventricle, in the third quartile from dorsal midline. Confocal stacks of immunostained sections of each developmental stage were generated by scanning at intervals of 0.99\u00a0\u03bcm using \ufb01lters of appropriate wavelengths at 20X and 40X magnifications. Confocal images of DAPI-stained brain sections and NeuN/pS6-immunostained sections were used to measure nuclear and cell size respectively. Measurements for labeling index, quit fraction, birthdating studies, cell density and size were calculated using ImageJ. For zonal quantification of cells, the cortical column was divided into 5 different parts \u2013 the ventricular-subventricular zone (vz/svz), white matter, and 3 equally divided zones of the neocortical plate (lower, mid, upper)."

For example, the experiments documenting neuronal colocalization with <i>E545K</i> are all shown in the supplementary data while those with the <i>H1047R</i> mutant are shown in the body of the paper in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>.

First, the authors need to provide some kind of quantification, focusing on the <i>E545K</i> mutants, to solidify their data. This could be as simple as dividing the cortex into zones/layers (depending upon the age), and quantifying the proportion of layer-specific marker-positive cells that are in the different zones/layers in controls versus mutants. Second, the authors should remove their references to neuronal migration. They don't actually study migration anywhere in this manuscript, but instead study localization of neurons. Since, as they indicate in the discussion, these phenotypes could be due to many different developmental perturbations, to indicate that they are due to neuronal migration deficits is misleading."

They also demonstrate that overexpression of the two PIK3CA alleles leads to increased size of the cortex that is generally associated with an increase in nuclear and cell size and a decrease in cell density. They then demonstrate that the expanded cortex displays defects in lamination. As a consequence, transgenic animals overexpressing active alleles of PIK3CA are more prone to epileptic seizures. Finally, the authors show that a class I PI3K inhibitor has anti-seizure effects, and reduces phosphorylation of PI3K pathway components."

The <i>E545K</i> and <i>H1047R</i> activating mutations have been found before in patients with cancer, but also with various forms of segmental cortical dysplasia. Corresponding mouse lines have been generated and investigated before for studying the role of these activating mutations in cancer. In this study, the authors have used <i>Nestin-Cre</i> and <i>GFAP-Cre</i> for nervous system-specific induction of the mutant alleles, and these mice developed enlarged brain size, cortical dysplasia and epilepsy. The authors find that <i>GFAP-Cre H1047R</i> mutants show a very severe phenotype with progressive hydrocephalus and death around birth. Mice with <i>E545K</i> mutation and the same <i>GFAP-Cre</i> driver were less affected. Earlier developmental induction of the <i>E545K</i> mutation with <i>Nestin-Cre</i> showed a more severe phenotype than that observed after <i>GFAP-Cre</i>-mediated activation. The authors then found that the inner cortical length of <i>GFAP-Cre H1047R</i> mutants at E14-E16 was longer than in controls. Surprisingly, increased proliferation was not observed in these animals, only enlarged cell size. Interestingly, the <i>Nestin-Cre E545K</i> mutants showed enhanced proliferation with reduced cortical thickness, indicating that the newborn cells did not adequately migrate. The authors also observed dysplastic Cajal-Retzius cells in <i>GFAP-Cre H1047R</i> mice at E16. They then investigated <i>Nestin-Cre</i> and Tamoxifen-inducible <i>Nestin-Cre E545K</i> mutant mice for abnormalities in EEG and found signs of epileptiform activity, in particular when induced with the GABA-A receptor antagonist PTZ. The authors then also provide evidence that the PI3K inhibitor BKM-120 suppresses seizure activity and shows some effects on parameters of PI3K pathway activation."

It is even unclear whether alterations in cell division, cell cycle exit, migration, terminal differentiation, spontaneous activity and synaptic plasticity occur in these mice. It is unclear whether <i>GFAP-Cre</i> and <i>Nestin-Cre</i> act in the same or in distinct precursor cell populations, whether defects in all types of neurons, or only specific subtypes, or defects in astrocytes cause this specific phenotype. The latter is possible in particular in <i>GFAP-Cre</i> mice. The previous paper by Robinson et al. in Nature 2012 showed that the same E545K mutation, when induced with <i>Blbp-Cre</i> in lower rhombic lip progenitors accelerates tumor generation, but does not per se initiate WNT subgroup medulloblastoma. This leaves the question open whether the same mutation in <i>Nestin</i>- or <i>GFAP-Cre</i> expressing cells causes defects that need additional signals to develop the pathogenic phenotype."

The E545K and H1047R activating mutations have been found before in patients with cancer, but also with various forms of segmental cortical dysplasia. Corresponding mouse lines have been generated and investigated before for studying the role of these activating mutations in cancer. In this study, the authors have used Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre for nervous system-specific induction of the mutant alleles, and these mice developed enlarged brain size, cortical dysplasia and epilepsy. The authors find that GFAP-Cre H1047R mutants show a very severe phenotype with progressive hydrocephalus and death around birth. Mice with E545K mutation and the same GFAP-Cre driver were less affected. Earlier developmental induction of the E545K mutation with Nestin-Cre showed a more severe phenotype than that observed after GFAP-Cre-mediated activation. The authors then found that the inner cortical length of GFAP-Cre H1047R mutants at E14-E16 was longer than in controls. Surprisingly, increased proliferation was not observed in these animals, only enlarged cell size. Interestingly, the Nestin-Cre E545K mutants showed enhanced proliferation with reduced cortical thickness, indicating that the newborn cells did not adequately migrate. The authors also observed dysplastic Cajal-Retzius cells in GFAP-Cre H1047R mice at E16. They then investigated Nestin-Cre and Tamoxifen-inducible Nestin-Cre E545K mutant mice for abnormalities in EEG and found signs of epileptiform activity, in particular when induced with the GABA-A receptor antagonist PTZ. The authors then also provide evidence that the PI3K inhibitor BKM-120 suppresses seizure activity and shows some effects on parameters of PI3K pathway activation. Although these data are of potential interest to understand the molecular basis of segmental cortical dysplasia in humans, the paper is largely descriptive and the mechanisms how PI3K activation induces this complex disorganization of cortical development that then results in altered excitability and epileptic seizures is not explained. It is even unclear whether alterations in cell division, cell cycle exit, migration, terminal differentiation, spontaneous activity and synaptic plasticity occur in these mice.</i> "
