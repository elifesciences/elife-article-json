How sporozoites locate and enter a blood vessel is a critical, but poorly understood process. In this study, we examine sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels, using intravital microscopy in mice. Our data suggest that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: in regions far from blood vessels, they exhibit \u2018avascular motility\u2019, defined by high speed and less confinement, while in the vicinity of blood vessels their motility is more constrained. We find that curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlight the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site."

How sporozoites locate and enter a blood vessel is a critical, but poorly understood process. In this study, we examine sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels, using intravital microscopy in mice. Our data suggest that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: in regions far from blood vessels, they exhibit \u2018avascular motility\u2019, defined by high speed and less confinement, while in the vicinity of blood vessels their motility is more constrained. We find that curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlight the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site."

This revealed that the parasites have two ways of moving. After first being injected, the parasites move quickly and freely. The parasites slow down when they come close to a blood vessel and move on or around the vessel for some time before entering it. During this stage of movement, the parasites tend to move in paths that follow the curvature of the blood vessels, which may improve how well they make contact with the blood vessel surface and may enable them to find the areas of the vessels best suited for entry."

Sporozoites are then carried by the blood flow to the liver, where they initiate a liver- and subsequently a blood-stage infection (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sinnis and Zavala, 2012</a>). Sporozoite motility, a substrate-dependent gliding motility, is essential for the exit from the dermis, and as a result for sporozoite infectivity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Vanderberg and Frevert, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hellmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ejigiri et al., 2012</a>). In comparison to fast migrating mammalian cells, such as lymphocytes, which crawl at approximately 0.1 \u03bcm/s, sporozoites move at 1\u20133 \u03bcm/s (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hellmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ejigiri et al., 2012</a>). Given the energy cost of such a remarkable speed, fast migration is likely key for sporozoite infectivity. Gliding speed is affected by the turnover of focal adhesion sites (<a href=\"#bib20\">M\u00fcnter et al., 2009</a>), as well as by environmental obstacles present in the dermis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hellmann et al., 2011</a>). While on two-dimensional substrates in vitro, salivary gland sporozoites glide in a circular pattern. In the dermis, this motion is transformed to a complex non-linear path (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hellmann et al., 2011</a>)."

Proteolytic processing of CSP leads to removal of the N-terminus and exposure of a cell-adhesion domain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>). Sporozoites expressing a mutant CSP which lacks the N-terminus (CS\u0394N), thus mimicking the proteolytically processed form of CSP, display normal infectivity when inoculated intravenously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>). However, when CS\u0394N sporozoites are injected intradermally, parasites are undetectable in the liver and exhibit a significant delay in the prepatency period, indicating that CS\u0394N parasites are impaired in their ability to exit the dermis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>). CS\u0394N sporozoites show only a small reduction in gliding motility in vitro (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that these mutant sporozoites have additional impairments in vivo. Mutant TRAP-VAL parasites carry mutations in the putative rhomboid-cleavage site of TRAP and similar to the CS\u0394N mutant, they have a more dramatic reduction in their infectivity after intradermal inoculation, compared to intravenous inoculation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ejigiri et al., 2012</a>). Unlike the CS\u0394N sporozoites, TRAP-VAL sporozoites display a significantly reduced gliding speed in vitro, moving at approximately 0.5 \u03bcm/s in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ejigiri et al., 2012</a>)."

We characterize changes in sporozoite motility over the first 2 hr after intradermal inoculation and identify an altered type of sporozoite motility in proximity of blood vessels. We rendered the CS\u0394N and TRAP-VAL sporozoites fluorescent in order to study the function of these surface proteins in dermal parasite motility and blood vessel recognition and found that CS\u0394N sporozoites spend more time engaging with blood vessels, yet are unable to enter the blood circulation. Imaging TRAP-VAL sporozoites, we find that their slow gliding speed significantly decreases the volume of tissue explored, which likely results in reduced ability to encounter blood vessels."

Reconstructed tracks were re-centered by plotting to a common origin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which revealed a gradual decrease in parasite dispersal over the first 120 min after inoculation. The mean square displacement (MSD) reflects the dissemination of a motile population from their origin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beltman et al., 2009</a>). To characterize changes in sporozoite dissemination over the first 120 min after inoculation, the MSD of sporozoites was plotted over time. Highest dispersals were seen within the first 15 min after intradermal inoculation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Over the following 110 min, parasite dispersal gradually decreases, which is reflected in a gradual reduction of the slope obtained from linear regression fitting of the MSD plot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, inset)."

This allowed us to ascertain whether sporozoite dissemination mimics that of a Brownian walk. The distribution of this probability P(r) was plotted in a normalized histogram (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), and it was found that the migration of sporozoites is not well described by an ordinary random walk. In particular, the probability of large displacements is much higher than would be expected for a Brownian walk (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harris et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Importantly, the analysis of sporozoite displacement only included sporozoites predominantly moving in linear or meandering patterns."

This prompted us to look at the pattern with which sporozoites move at the different time points. Over time, an increasing number of parasites engage in continuous circular motility (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). While at early time points, this sporozoite behavior is seen less frequently, at 20 min and 30 min after inoculation, approximately 22% and 36% of total sporozoites exhibit continuously circling motility. Importantly, at these time points the increased percentage of circling sporozoites is not the result of the other motile sporozoites leaving the field, but rather an increase in the absolute number of sporozoites that are exclusively circling (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, by 60 and 120 min, there are 20 and 40% fewer sporozoites in the field, respectively, and an increased number of non-motile sporozoites. Thus, at 120 min almost all moving sporozoites are circling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To better understand this increase in parasite confinement, track straightness was calculated. Track straightness is defined as the ratio of displacement to track length (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beltman et al., 2009</a>), and smaller ratios reflect more constrained tracks, while straight tracks are characterized by large ratios. This analysis included the entire population of motile sporozoites (meandering sporozoites, as well as sporozoites continuously moving in the same circle). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, the straightness of sporozoite tracks gradually decreases over the first 120 min after inoculation with the most significant decrease seen beginning at 20 min after inoculation. These data suggest that sporozoite motility changes over time such that after an initial phase of maximal dispersal, sporozoites move in more constrained circular paths. Of note, a similiar change in sporozoite motility was seen in data acquired from sporozoites imaged after inoculation by a probing infected mosquito, with a significant drop in MSD 20 min after mosquito bite and a concomitant increase in the number of sporozoites engaging in circular motility (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Though these data suggest that overall, the pattern of motility is similar whether sporozoites are deposited by mosquito bite or needle; additional experimentation is needed to provide more quantitative data. Unfortunately, these data are more difficult to acquire because of technical issues in finding and capturing, by video-microscopy, sporozoites inoculated by a probing mosquito."

Although it was initially postulated that sporozoites might also reach the liver via the lymphatic vessels, a previous study found that sporozoites entering lymphatic vessels in the skin do not travel beyond the draining lymph node, and thus do not participate in liver stage infection (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Radtke et al., 2015</a>). To characterize the ability of sporozoites to engage with dermal vasculature, we visualized vascular endothelia by labeling the pan-endothelial junction molecule CD31 (also designated as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, PECAM-1) by intravenous injection of fluorescently labeled rat anti-CD31 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Formaglio et al., 2014</a>). CD31 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is present on the surface of endothelial cells of both lymphatics and blood vessels, where it is a constituent of intercellular junctions. However, as we performed our experiments within 2\u20133 hr of intravenous inoculation of anti-CD31, lymphatics were not labeled in our studies, since it takes \u223c24 hr for intravenously inoculated antibody to get into the extravascular space and taken up by lymphatic vessels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Sarkisyan et al., 2012</a>). This was confirmed by labeling lymphatic vessels with antibodies against the lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE-1) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kilarski et al., 2013</a>), which in the time frame of our experiments revealed no co-localization with CD31 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

A representative maximum intensity projection of this tracking is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> with the two data sets shown in different colors. Analysis of the two tracking sets showed that compared to sporozoites gliding independently of CD31-labeled vessels, the average apparent speed of gliding sporozoites decreases once they approach a blood vessel from 1.38 \u03bcm/s to 1.06 \u03bcm/s, and this difference is highly significant (p value &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

To normalize for track length in this analysis, all tracks were fragmented to 30-s intervals. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, the displacement of sporozoites gliding on or in proximity to blood vessels is decreased, as is the slope obtained from linear regression fitting of the MSD plot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, inset). This is partially a result of the decrease in gliding speed of these sporozoites, but also due to an increase in sporozoite confinement. This is demonstrated by an analysis of the curvature of sporozoite tracks, which is the curvature of the circles fitted to every 10-s interval of a given track and is defined as the inverse of the radius of that circle (see <a href=\"https://github.com/kevinkchiou/Malaria-Motility\">https://github.com/kevinkchiou/Malaria-Motility</a> and\u00a0\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The analysis revealed that while avascular tracks have little curvature, most commonly 0.077\u20130.125 \u03bcm<sup>\u22121</sup>, the majority of sporozoite tracks that overlap with blood vessels describe trajectories that have a curvature of 0.125\u20130.2 \u03bcm<sup>\u22121</sup>, which, remarkably, equals the curvature of the circumference of dermal capillaries (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Yen and Braverman, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Braverman, 1997</a>). These data demonstrate that sporozoite motility can change in response to environmental signals encountered by the sporozoite and suggest that sporozoites in the dermis exhibit two types of motility: \u2018avascular motility\u2019, which is defined by high speed and less confinement, leading to maximal displacements in avascular areas and a more constrained \u2018perivascular motility\u2019, which is observed once the parasite glides in proximity of a blood vessel."

We characterized the motility of CS\u0394N and TRAP-VAL sporozoites in the dermis to elucidate the function of these surface proteins in vivo, specifically focusing on parasite motility and blood vessel entry. Both mutants were generated in a drug selection cassette-free parental <i>P. berghei</i> parasite line expressing mCherry under the control of a strong sporozoite-stage promoter (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). CS\u0394N and TRAP-VAL sporozoites were imaged 10 and 30 min after intradermal injection into the ear pinna of an anesthetized mouse, and sporozoite trajectories were visualized by maximum intensity projection of the 4-min videos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). To quantify the proportion of mutant sporozoites that were motile, sporozoites were manually counted, with sporozoites being considered non-motile if they moved less than approximately 2 \u03bcm throughout the duration of the video (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). An average of 66% of wild-type control sporozoites are motile 10 min after intradermal injection and 52% are motile at the 30 min time point. At 10 min after injection, only 47% of CS\u0394N sporozoites are motile, however, this number is stable over time and similar to wild-type control levels at 30 min. The analysis of TRAP-VAL sporozoites showed that only 40% and 20% of the inoculated sporozoites are motile at 10 min and 30 min after inoculation, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

(<b>A</b>) Maximum intensity projection over 240 s reveals trajectories of WT, CS\u0394N, and TRAP-VAL sporozoites (green) moving in the dermis with CD31-labeled vascular endothelia (far red). Scale bars, 50 \u03bcm. For panels <b>B</b>\u2013<b>D</b>, every data point represents one video and 18 WT, 25 CS\u0394N, and 24 TRAP-VAL videos were processed.

Graphs show significant increase in the time CS\u0394N, but not TRAP-VAL sporozoites spend actively gliding on or around blood vessels. (<b>C</b>) To generate the MSD of sporozoites moving in proximity to CD31-labeled vessels, 313 WT, 352 CS\u0394N, and 192 TRAP-VAL tracks of sporozoites moving in proximity to CD31-labeled vessels were generated and compared to 163 WT, 121 CS\u0394N, and 89 TRAP-VAL tracks of sporozoites moving in avascular areas of the dermis. To calculate the MSD of the obtained sporozoite tracks with various duration times, all tracks were uniformly fragmented into tracks of 30 s in duration.

(<b>E</b>) Blood and lymphatic vessel invasion events were manually counted. Invasion was classified similar to previously descriptions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>), with blood vessel invasion being defined by a sudden increase in speed or visual entry of the blood vessel and disappearance out of the field of view. Lymphatic invasion was characterized by the switch from directed forward movement to sideward drifting with a low velocity (see <a href=\"#media7\">Videos 7</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). The proportion of invading sporozoites as percent of total sporozoites in the field of view is shown. In the duration of the acquired 4 min videos, 2.38% and 2.06% of WT sporozoites invaded blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, respectively. This was in sharp contrast to the blood and lymphatic vessel invasion rates of CS\u0394N (0.23% and 0.26%) and TRAP-VAL (0.05% and 0%); n equals number of videos analyzed."

Invasion was classified as previously described (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>), with blood vessel invasion defined by a sudden increase in speed or visual entry of the blood vessel and disappearance out of the field of view. It should be noted that the speed with which sporozoites appear to be carried out of the field is slower in videos that include CD31-labeling, as a result of the slower acquisition speed due to capture of two channels. Lymphatic invasion was defined by the switch from directed forward movement to sideward drifting with a low velocity. On average, in a 4-min video beginning at 10 min after inoculation, 2.38% of wild-type control sporozoites in the field of view enters the blood circulation, and 2.06% of sporozoites enters the lymphatic system (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Blood vessel invasion of the CS\u0394N mutant is reduced to 0.23% and only 0.05% of TRAP-VAL sporozoites is seen to enter into blood vessels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), which is consistent with the decrease in infectivity of these mutants upon intradermal inoculation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ejigiri et al., 2012</a>). Invasion of the lymphatic system by CS\u0394N sporozoites is reduced to 0.26% and not detected at all in the case of TRAP-VAL sporozoites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Importantly, CD31-labeling is not interfering with entry into dermal blood or lymphatic vessels or parasite dispersal, as vessel invasion rates, as well as sporozoite MSDs, are comparable in videos acquired in mice with and without labeled blood vessels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, these mutants sample less of their environment; however, this is unlikely to fully explain their dramatically decreased entry into the blood and lymphatic circulations. Since only motile sporozoites are included in the calculation of MSD, it is important to consider the increased number of non-motile CS\u0394N and TRAP-VAL sporozoites that together with the decreased dispersal, could account for the low numbers of mutants entering the blood circulation. To look at this, we normalized the total time control and mutant sporozoites spent in proximity of blood vessels, by including all sporozoites in the field, that is, both motile and non-motile sporozoites. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> (right panel), TRAP-VAL sporozoites spend on average, 40% less time on vessels compared to wild-type control sporozoites, a decrease that is due, in part, to the large number of non-motile TRAP-VAL sporozoites. Nonetheless, the population of TRAP-VAL sporozoites still spends approximately 10% of its time on or near blood vessels, yet blood vessel entry events were reduced by 97%, suggesting that even when TRAP-VAL sporozoites do contact vessels they cannot invade them. This is even more dramatically illustrated by the CS\u0394N mutant that spends approximately the same total time on vessels as the control wild-type sporozoites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right panel), yet blood vessel entry events were reduced by 90%. These data point to an additional impairment in blood vessel entry, that is, even when they do contact blood vessels, they cannot invade them. Indeed, both CS\u0394N and TRAP-VAL mutations result in the increased surface exposure of cell-adhesion domains: in CS\u0394N sporozoites, the absence of the N-terminus leads to constitutive exposure of the cell-adhesive type I thrombospondin domain in the C-terminus of the protein (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>) and in TRAP-VAL sporozoites, the altered proteolytic cleavage site leads to the retention of TRAP molecules on the sporozoite's surface (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ejigiri et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the inability of these mutants to regulate their adhesive interactions likely results in their inability to complete the entry process."

Previous reports have observed sporozoite motility in the dermis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hellmann et al., 2011</a>), but an in-depth analysis of their motility over time has not been performed. Intravital imaging of sporozoites over the first 120 min after inoculation highlights significant changes in their motility in this time frame. Within the first 20 min after intradermal inoculation, sporozoites displace with high speed and minimal constraint, which likely maximizes the volume of tissue that is explored by the population of sporozoites. After this initial period of dispersal, sporozoite motility changes. Most significantly starting 20 min after inoculation, the migratory pattern of sporozoites becomes increasingly confined, and a growing number of sporozoites engage in continuous circular motility. We hypothesize that this motility pattern optimizes engagement with blood vessels that will ultimately lead to blood vessel entry. 1 hr after inoculation, sporozoites begin to slow down and a significant proportion stop moving with the proportion of non-motile sporozoites increasing to 70% by 2 hr. Importantly, this late-phase slow down is distinct from the change in trajectory that occurs 20 and 30 min post inoculation when the speed and proportion of non-motile sporozoites does not change from what is observed at earlier time points. The reasons for this late-phase slow down are not known, but possibilities include resource exhaustion or encountering a host cell or factor that leads to their arrest."

Our observations of an altered sporozoite migration in proximity to blood vessels point to recognition of the vessel by the sporozoites, further demonstrating that sporozoite migration in the dermis is not well described by the statistics of a Brownian walk. This suggests that internal components or external host\u2013pathogen interactions bias the directionality of sporozoite movement away from Brownian motion. The larger than expected displacements may allow the sporozoite to cover large distances between the blood vessels, which may enable the sporozoite to encounter blood vessels with higher efficiency than Brownian random walkers. We found that once the sporozoite approaches a blood vessel, the more linear type of motility is lost and the sporozoite switches to a more curved and confined motility. This points to a specific host\u2013parasite interaction between the parasite and the environment of the blood vessel and provides evidence for the ability of the sporozoite to alter motility in response to host factors. Indeed, in vitro, sporozoites have been shown to respond to obstacle cues in micro-fabricated arrays so it is possible that environmental constraints alone account for the switch in the sporozoites' migration pattern (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hellmann et al., 2011</a>). However, our observation that the sporozoites' walk statistics change in proximity to blood vessels indicates that there is a specific recognition event that leads to this change."

Our analysis of track curvature reveals that sporozoites gliding in the proximity of blood vessels describe trajectories with local curvatures that interestingly relate to the curvature of the capillary vessel (<a href=\"#bib27\">Yen and Braverman, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Braverman, 1997</a>). This suggests that \u2018perivascular motility\u2019 enhances contact with capillaries, rather than the larger dermal terminal arterioles or post-capillary venules (<a href=\"#bib27\">Yen and Braverman, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Braverman, 1997</a>). Indeed, it has been observed previously, that the curvature of the sporozoite matches the geometry of capillaries (<a href=\"#bib26\">Vanderberg, 1974</a>) and more recently, a study using stochastic computer simulations of sporozoite motility found that in these models, sporozoite interaction with capillaries is greatly enhanced if the parasite has the ability to adapt its curvature and torsion to the surrounding environment (<a href=\"#bib4\">Battista et al., 2014</a>). In addition to the change in sporozoite trajectories, we found that they also had a significant decrease in speed when in the vicinity of blood vessels. These data build upon and solidify the previous observation of Amino et al., who quantified the speed of a small number of sporozoites gliding around blood vessels and reported a decrease after contact with the vessel (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amino et al., 2006</a>)."

The importance of high sporozoite gliding speed is highlighted by the behavior of the TRAP-VAL mutant that moves with less than half the motile speed of wild-type control parasites in the dermis. This decrease in speed corresponds to the reduction of final MSD, which reduces the area of tissue explored by 70%. Consequently, TRAP-VAL sporozoites have a significantly decreased chance to encounter and invade a blood vessel, which together with the increase in number of non-motile TRAP-VAL sporozoites, largely explains their reduced infectivity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ejigiri et al., 2012</a>). Although there is no evidence for an innate host immune response that may impair the exit of sporozoites from the dermis, the observed rapid dispersal of wild-type control sporozoites suggests that the parasite has evolved to leave the skin quickly, possibly as a means to escape from phagocytic host cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amino et al., 2008</a>)."

Of particular interest was the observed increase in the association of CS\u0394N sporozoites with dermal vascular endothelia. Since \u2018perivascular motility\u2019 is more constrained, this, together with the somewhat decreased gliding speed, explains the overall decrease in dispersal of this mutant. It was previously proposed that the function of the N-terminal portion of CSP is to mask the cell-adhesive TSR domain as sporozoites migrate through the skin and controlled proteolytic processing of CSP by a parasite protease regulates the exposure of the TSR (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coppi et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2011</a>). We find that the constitutively exposed TSR on the surface of CS\u0394N sporozoites leads to increased time spent on vascular endothelia. We therefore hypothesize that the ability of the sporozoite to dynamically regulate exposure of the TSR is necessary for continued migration through the dermis, which may be crucial for the sporozoite to locate the areas of the vasculature that allow for blood vessel entry or for blood vessel entry itself. More work is needed to determine if this is the case, however, our data with both TRAP-VAL and CS\u0394N mutant sporozoites demonstrate that the sporozoite's ability to regulate its adhesive intereactions is a key factor for successful movement through and out of the dermis."

Thus, there may be certain areas of the vasculature that are preferentially invaded by sporozoites."

These data suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene. Indeed, the partial success of RTS,S, the only malaria vaccine candidate in Phase III clinical trials, may result from antibodies that target sporozoites in the dermis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Foquet et al., 2014</a>). As we build upon RTS,S, it will be important to consider expanding the antigen repertoire to include proteins critical for dermal exit. Additionally, our data suggest that an analysis of dermal sporozoite motility could be incorporated in the evaluation of future vaccine strategies to predict efficiency of new vaccine targets."

Thus, mutant versions of <i>CSP</i> and <i>TRAP</i> with their endogenous control elements, as well as the h<i>dhfr</i> selection marker flanked by 2.2 kb of 5\u2032UTR and 0.55 kb of 3\u2032UTR of the pb<i>dhfr</i>-ts were introduced into the <i>CSP</i> and <i>TRAP</i> loci. Upon successful integration of the CS\u0394N construct, the wild-type copy of <i>CSP</i> is replaced by a truncated version lacking the amino acids NKSIQAQRNLNELCYNEGNDNKLYHVLNSKNGKIYNRNTVNRLLADAPEGKKNEK KNEKIERNNKLKQP, which encompass the entire N-terminal region, except for the signal sequence. The successful integration of the TRAP-VAL construct changes the canonical rhomboid protease cleavage site motif AGGIIGG to VALIIGV. The transfected parasite populations were cloned. <i>CSP</i> and <i>TRAP</i> loci of wild-type control, CS\u0394N and TRAP-VAL parasite clones were genotyped by PCR to verify successful recombination and the presence of the desired mutations.

A number of tracks with this value were added to the analysis, representative for the percentages of circling sporozoites observed at the individual time point."

A concern was expressed whether labeling with CD31 might have interfered with sporozoite migration and invasion of the vasculature. Another concern was specificity. Because CD31 also labels lymphatic vasculature, the authors need to document sporozoite invasion into each of the CD31+ vessels. Otherwise, these cannot be called blood vessels or the motility cannot be referred to as vascular motility. This should be corrected throughout the text. Finally, there was concern considering the method of analysis. The proximity of the parasites to the CD31+ vessels was scored manually, which can lead to errors. Therefore, it would be helpful if the authors would perform analyses on one of the 3D datasets to validate that the numbers obtained from the maximum intensity projections are correct."

In the original version of the manuscript, in Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2, we showed that CD31-labeling did not interfere with entry into dermal blood or lymphatic vessels, as the sporozoite invasion rates are similar in videos acquired in mice with and without CD31-labeled blood vessels. However, we had not looked at the effect of CD31 labeling on sporozoite migration. In part, this was because vessels were not labeled in the majority of the videos used to determine MSD, they were only labeled in a subset of the 10-minute videos, since this was the time point used for quantification of vessel entry. We went back to the videos used for the MSD analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and reanalyzed the 10 minute time point data to separately calculate the MSD of sporozoites in videos with and without CD31-labeling. We found that the MSD in the two populations was similar and these data are now shown as a new panel of <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>."

It is important to note, and we neglected to do so in the original manuscript, that the methodology we used does not result in CD31 staining of lymphatic vessels. We injected the anti-CD31 intravenously into the blood circulation 2-3 hours prior to the imaging experiment, and as a result it primarily stained blood vessels, since at this point the antibody has not crossed into the extravascular space to be drained into the lymphatic system. For imaging of lymphatic vessels, labeling antibodies are typically injected a day prior to the imaging experiment (Sarkisyan et al., Real-time differential labeling of blood, interstitium, and lymphatic and single-field analysis of vasculature dynamics in vivo, Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol., 2012). Included as a new figure supplement, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, is a still image obtained from live microscopy of a mouse ear in which anti-LYVE-1 antibody, specific for lymphatics, was inoculated intravenously 24 hours prior to imaging and anti-mouse CD31 antibody was inoculated 3 hours prior to imaging. No co-localization is observed, indicating that in our protocol, antibodies to CD31 do not label lymphatics. Lastly, given the unique structural characteristics of lymphatic capillaries, which possess frequent blind endings and are wider and flatter than blood vessels (Tripp et al., The lymph vessel network in mouse skin visualized with antibodies against the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1, Immunobiology, 213:715\u201328, 2008), we are confident that the vessels stained in our experiments are blood and not lymphatic vessels. We have changed the manuscript to clarify this important issue (see the subsection \u201cSporozoites recognize dermal CD31+ blood vessels\u201d)."

Given the high gliding speed of sporozoites, entire stacks have to be acquired with short interval times, and since exposure times of up to 200 ms per capture are necessary to visualize the parasites in the dermis, we were only able to acquire 3-5 slices using a 10x objective with maximal pinhole setting. This amounted to only semi-confocal data, with essentially no z-resolution, which does not allow for tracking in three dimensions. While we agree that in individual cases we may have scored sporozoites as being close to vessels when they were not, given the number of data points we acquired, we do not think that this is a problem, particularly since these false positives would only minimize the differences between vascular and avascular motility, as this would not be an issue with sporozoites moving far from vessels."

We expressed the data as percentages because many of our videos were not part of complete time courses. Thus, in many instances we do not know the proportion of sporozoites that remain in the field at the late time points compared to earlier time points. Nonetheless, we do have two complete time courses, in which the same site was imaged from 5 to 120 minutes. These data were included in the original analyses shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B-F</a>. We now use them to address the reviewers\u2019 concern and have generated a supplement to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Two things become evident when we visualize the data this way. First, at 20 and 30 minutes after inoculation, while the total number of sporozoites and the number of non-motile sporozoites does not change significantly, the number of sporozoites moving in a linear fashion decreases and the number that are circling continuously throughout the video increases. These data are consistent with our observation of an initial period of high dispersal motility, followed by more constrained motility. However, when we look at the very late time points, 60 and 120 minutes after inoculation, these observations are confounded by the 20% and 40% fewer sporozoites in the field respectively, and by the significantly increased number of non-motile sporozoites. We have therefore added more discussion of these data in the Results section and in the Discussion: \u201cIn contrast to previous reports of apparently random motility [\u2026] indicates that there is a specific recognition event that leads to this change.\u201d"

However, we are reporting the first evidence of the ability of the sporozoite to alter motility in response to a specific host structure, suggesting sporozoite migration is responsive to host signals more complex than simple physical constraints. We think that more intravital imaging needs to be performed with visualization of components of the extracellular matrix and host cells other than endothelial cells in order to shed light on the host-pathogen interactions relevant for blood vessel recognition.

We therefore altered our description of the manual invasion counts and now define blood vessel invasion by \u201ca sudden increase in speed or visual entry of the blood vessel and disappearance out of the field of view\u201d.
