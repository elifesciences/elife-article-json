Here, we show that dramatic shifts in large open-chromatin domain (super-enhancer) landscapes underlie these differences and reflect tumor microenvironment. By in vivo super-enhancer and transcriptional profiling, we uncover a dynamic cancer-specific epigenetic network selectively enriched for binding motifs of a transcription factor cohort expressed in squamous cell carcinoma SCs (SCC-SCs). Many of their genes, including <i>Ets2</i> and <i>Elk3,</i> are themselves regulated by SCC-SC super-enhancers suggesting a cooperative feed-forward loop. Malignant progression requires these genes, whose knockdown severely impairs tumor growth and prohibits progression from benign papillomas to SCCs. ETS2-deficiency disrupts the SCC-SC super-enhancer landscape and downstream cancer genes while ETS2-overactivation in epidermal-SCs induces hyperproliferation and SCC super-enhancer-associated genes <i>Fos, Junb</i> and <i>Klf5</i>. Together, our findings unearth an essential regulatory network required for the SCC-SC chromatin landscape and unveil its importance in malignant progression."

Here, we show that dramatic shifts in large open-chromatin domain (super-enhancer) landscapes underlie these differences and reflect tumor microenvironment. By in vivo super-enhancer and transcriptional profiling, we uncover a dynamic cancer-specific epigenetic network selectively enriched for binding motifs of a transcription factor cohort expressed in squamous cell carcinoma SCs (SCC-SCs). Many of their genes, including <i>Ets2</i> and <i>Elk3,</i> are themselves regulated by SCC-SC super-enhancers suggesting a cooperative feed-forward loop. Malignant progression requires these genes, whose knockdown severely impairs tumor growth and prohibits progression from benign papillomas to SCCs. ETS2-deficiency disrupts the SCC-SC super-enhancer landscape and downstream cancer genes while ETS2-overactivation in epidermal-SCs induces hyperproliferation and SCC super-enhancer-associated genes <i>Fos, Junb</i> and <i>Klf5</i>. Together, our findings unearth an essential regulatory network required for the SCC-SC chromatin landscape and unveil its importance in malignant progression."

Of these, cells known as cancer stem cells can form new tumours and drive the growth and spread of the cancer around the body. A central question is how cancer stem cells differ from healthy adult stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to having genetic mutations, cancer stem cells live in a very different environment to other cells within the tumour. This 'microenvironment'also has a major impact on how these cells behave compared to normal stem cells. Together, the genetic and environmental differences profoundly change the way genes are expressed in the cancer cells."

These regions are long stretches of DNA that proteins called transcription factors can interact with to coordinate the expression of nearby genes to alter the production of certain proteins. Super-enhancers contain several transcription factor-binding sites that are close to each other with the different sites being associated with transcription factors that are only active in specific types of cells. Furthermore, super-enhancers are often self-regulatory, meaning that the binding of transcription factors to a super-enhancer can lead to an increase in the expression of the genes that encode the same transcription factors."

Their experiments show that the active super-enhancers in cancer stem cells are associated with a very different set of genes that are highly and often specifically expressed in cancer stem cells. In the cancer stem cells, a transcription factor called ETS2 binds to the super-enhancers and reprograms the expression of genes to promote the development of cancer. Yang, Schramek et al. also show that over-active ETS2 is a major driver of squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, ETS2 also increases the expression of genes that cause inflammation and promote the growth of cancers."

Advances in genome technologies provide the means to not only comprehensively analyze transcriptional profiles of SCs but also map their epigenetic landscape on a global level. Studies on cultured embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have shown that a special set of large open-chromatin domains, so-called super-enhancers (SEs), control expression of genes important to ESC behavior (<a href=\"#bib71\">Whyte et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Parker et al., 2013</a>). Like typical enhancers (TEs), SEs bind with\u00a0Mediator, a complex that brings promoter and enhancer together to activate transcription. However, SEs differ from TEs by their exceptional size (often &gt;15kb) and by their high density of acetylation of histone H3 at the lysine 27 position (H3K27ac), which characterizes active chromatin."

The ability to purify large quantities of SCs directly from their native microenvironment (\u2018niche\u2019) makes the HF one of the few systems where in vivo\u00a0chromatin dynamics can be studied in an adult tissue SC population.

Using SE and transcriptional profiling, we first define the SE chromatin landscape and its gene expression program within the tumor-initiating SC population of skin SCCs and show that SE-associated genes constitute a signature that specifically associates with cancer-vulnerability genes, some of which correlate with poor survival among human SCC patients. Given that HF-SCs are an established origin of these cancers (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lapouge et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">White et al., 2011</a>), we conduct comparative analyses and show that SCC-SC SEs are distinct from SEs found in HF-SCs and also from rapidly proliferating short-term progeny of HF-SCs. We show that SCC-SEs are enriched for sequence motifs of a unique set of TF families, whose members are themselves regulated by SEs. Most importantly, we show by gain and loss of function and by associated chromatin landscaping, that these factors are essential for driving the chromatin dynamics that define the malignant state and govern tumor maintenance and survival."

When coupled with the fact that <i>Fos, Junb</i> and <i>Klf5</i> are associated with SCC-SC SEs which contain AP1, ETS and KLF binding motifs, these findings underscore the physiological relevance of these factors not only in SCC oncogenesis but also in orchestrating the chromatin dynamics of SCC-SCs."

Interestingly, many of the ETS binding motifs in SCC-SC epicenters are in close proximity with AP-1 motifs. Closely juxtapositioned ETS-AP1 motifs, essential for cooperative binding, have also been observed in a prostate cancer cell line in culture, and notably, they exist within the regulatory regions of several key oncogenes in which the Ras/MAPK pathway is activated (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hollenhorst, 2011</a>).

Inflammatory players can be proangiogenic, growth-promoting or tumor suppressive. In addition, epithelial-derived factors collectively termed as the 'epimmunome' (<a href=\"#bib65\">Swamy et al., 2010</a>) can instruct immune cells, thereby harboring the potential to impinge upon immunocompetence and tumor immunosurveillance. Our discovery that SCC cells express and secrete CXCL1 and CXCL2, appears to be particularly relevant, because\u00a0this phenomenon turned out to be hardwired through the establishment of SEs. Additionally, CXCL1/2 can signal to the immune system, solidifying their part in the epimmunome. Intriguingly, however, we found that SCC cells also express CXCR2, the cognate receptor for CXCL1/2, thus establishing an autocrine loop to fuel epithelial proliferation. Indeed, when we knocked down <i>Cxcr2,</i> tumor growth was severely impaired."

We show that SEs controlling the normal SC-TFs are decommissioned in cancer, and that the new SEs drive cooperative auto-regulation of novel master regulators that specify the cancer state. For SCC, this includes an ETS2/ELK3-AP1-SOX2-KLF5 network of which level of ETS family members appears to be critical in regulating SCC SE dynamics and orchestrating expression of a cohort of oncogenic, growth-promoting, and epimmune genes. Of additional relevance are the mutually exclusive H3K27 modifications of SEs and PcG-silencing that provide a powerful two-way switch for the cancer-normal SC balance."

Viral supernatant was collected 46\u2009hr after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter. For lentiviral infections in culture, cells were plated in 6-well plate at 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated with viruses in the presence of polybrene (20 \u03bcg/ml) for 30\u2009min, and then plates were spun at 1100\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C in a Thermo IEC CL40R centrifuge. Infected cells were selected with puromycin. For in vivo lentiviral transduction, viral supernatant was filtered (0.45-\u03bcm filter) and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Final viral particle was resuspended in viral resuspension buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% sorbitol) and 1\u00a0or 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl was in utero injected into E9.5 embryos."

A role of super enhancers in cancer cells has not been well characterized. In this work, Yang and colleagues using squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to interrogate a role of super enhancers in cancer cells. Overall this is an interesting paper with identification of ETS transcript factor family in SCC, which is subject to the regulation by super enhancers. Furthermore, the ETS TF associated super enhancer is highly correlated with development of SCC and is more specific for SCC but not to their \"normal\" counterpart HF-SCs. This ETS binding super enhancer also induced a positive forward loop of CXCL1/2 with their corresponding receptors, reflecting a feature of tumor microenvironment. Their method of prospecting for genes involved in various disease states using SE's and binding motifs could prove very useful. All these are novel findings. However, their conclusions on the relevance of SE's still require direct evidence."

Most significantly, we carried out in vivo RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChiP-seq experiments on purified skin basal epidermal control progenitors and progenitors following Doxy-induction of skin epidermis to induce a phosphomimetic super-activated form of ETS2, which normally requires oncogenic HRas-MAP kinase for this threonine phosphorylation. Not only does the epidermis transform into an SCC-like state, but at the transcriptional level, many of the genes upregulated in SCC-SCs are now elevated in the ETS skin progenitors. At the level of chromatin landscaping, this not only includes the SE-regulated genes, but in fact these genes now acquire the chromatin remodeling and super-enhancer acquisition that we observed in SCC-SCs. Finally, although the numbers of cells required for ETS ChIP-seq are still prohibitive, as are the numbers of cells for ETS2 knock-down tumors, we were successful in carrying out ETS2 ChiP-qPCR with a number of SE-regulated genes from these cells purified in vivo."

In fact there was striking reproducibility.
