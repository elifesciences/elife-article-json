It is relatively straightforward to determine how many colors we can see or sounds we can hear because these stimuli are well defined by physical properties such as wavelength. We know the range of wavelengths that the eye can see or the ear can hear, and we can also understand how two such stimuli (e.g., red and blue) are arranged perceptually (think of a color wheel). It is harder, however, to do the same for smell because most \u2018olfactory stimuli\u2019 consist of mixtures of different odor molecules. Moreover, we understand much less about how olfactory stimuli are arranged perceptually."

To calculate this number the researchers tested the ability of human subjects to discriminate between mixtures of different odor molecules. Each mixture consisted of 10, 20 or 30 molecules selected from a chemical library of 128 different odor molecules. Since each mixture of 10 molecules could contain any 10 of the 128 molecules, more than 200 trillion combinations were possible; the number of possible combinations for the 20- and 30-molecule mixtures were even higher."

In particular, Gerkin and Castro report that the results are extremely sensitive to some parameters of the experimental and analytical design, such as the number of subjects tested, whereas the results of a robust analysis would not be so sensitive to such factors. By modestly varying any of these parameters it is possible to obtain almost any value for the number of smells that can be discriminated. Moreover, the geometrical analogy used set an upper bound on the final answer, rather than a lower bound: in other words, even assuming that the rest of the analysis was robust, the result should have been that humans can discriminate \u2018no more than\u2019 1.72 trillion smells rather than \u2018at least\u2019. In a separate paper Meister also reports that the 1.72 trillion smells claim is unjustified."

Using that paper's methods to reanalyze the data it presented, we show that this estimate is problematically fragile. Specifically, it varies systematically and sensitively (over tens of orders of magnitude, in both directions), for very modest changes in incidental experimental and analysis parameters against which a result ought to be robust. Had the experiment enlisted \u223c 100 additional subjects similar to the original ones, the same analysis would have concluded that <i>all possible stimuli</i> are discriminable (i.e., that each of the more than 10<sup>29</sup> olfactory stimuli possible in their framework are mutually discriminable). By contrast, if the same experimental data were analyzed using moderately more conservative statistical criteria, it would have concluded that there are fewer than 5000 discriminable olfactory stimuli\u2014no larger than the folk wisdom value that the new estimate purports to replace."

We conclude that the framework is unsound: there may be trillions of discriminable olfactory stimuli, or more, or fewer, but the framework does not provide the means for settling this question. Here we first demonstrate the framework's fragility, and then explain the sources of that fragility. For most of this paper, we remain agnostic about whether the framework is conceptually sound, to highlight the fact that it has strictly methodological problems of a statistical origin that do not depend on the validity of a competing set of assumptions."

In other words, the original paper in fact supports the conclusion that humans can discriminate <i>at most</i> one trillion olfactory stimuli (or more or fewer, due to the problem described above), a rather uninspiring claim.

We show below that the order of magnitude claim of \u2018one trillion olfactory stimuli\u2019 requires that those parameters assume a very narrow set of values. Certainly, the precise value of an estimate may change as additional data are collected, but the estimate should not change <i>in expectation</i>; it should not be possible to make an estimate arbitrarily large (or small), simply by collecting more (or less) data. Similarly, the estimate itself should not become arbitrarily small or large with adjustment of a significance criterion. Estimates that scale systematically with such incidental parameter choices are considered statistically <i>inconsistent</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). It is the inconsistency of the present estimate that produces a tremendously large space of extremely different, yet unobjectionable alternative conclusions that can be reached about the number of discriminable olfactory stimuli."

The thin red lines correspond to the same calculation for <i>d</i> but using data for only a single subject (one per line), showing similar sensitivity to the choice of threshold. The absence of a robust d for any individual subject argues that the group data are not simply explained by averaging across a population with well-defined, but diverse values of <i>d</i>. Note that very modest and reasonable alternative choices for the threshold result in extremely disparate estimates. The vertical axis is bounded by the smallest and largest possible number of discriminable stimuli allowed by the framework. The dashed lines are a visual guide to specific (threshold, <i>z</i>) pairs. (<b>C</b>): Box and whisker plots showing the median and inter-quartile range for <i>z</i> when restricting the analysis to individual subjects. Note that the worst performing subjects under one threshold can discriminate many more stimuli than the best performing subjects under a slightly more liberal threshold (compare best subject using a 60% threshold vs worst subject using a 40% threshold). Therefore, it is impossible to report with any confidence the number of discriminable stimuli using this approach. In the main text, we show that the actual framework used in (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bushdid et al., 2014</a>) is nominally employed to make a more principled choice of threshold; however it merely cloaks the arbitrariness of the threshold choice, but does not eliminate it."

By introducing a hypothesis-testing step, the <i>d</i> derived from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> now varies systematically with the number of subjects enrolled in the study (and the number of mixtures tested), and with the choice of significance criterion <i>\u03b1</i>. This is because each data point used to compute <i>d</i> becomes the binary result of a hypothesis test, each of which depends critically on sample size and test specificity. Because <i>d</i> is then fed into an expression (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>) that explodes geometrically, the result is a recipe for producing any of a range of estimates for <i>z</i> that one might choose. If one enlists more subjects or slackens the significance criterion, a very large (even the largest possible) number will be obtained. If one enlists fewer subjects or makes the significance criterion more strict, a very small (even the smallest possible) number will be obtained. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows the explicit dependence of the estimate on each of these quantities alone. Naturally, these can be varied in tandem too, with even more dramatic consequences, as described above (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Thus, there are no serial comparisons of the same mixture that could be used to anchor a stimulus on the map relative to a stimulus against which it was not directly compared experimentally. Thus, there is no way to compute distances between stimuli that do not appear together in a tested pair. In other words, the structure of the perceptual space is severely under-determined by the data. In future experiments such serial repetition of already-tested mixtures would be required to build up a data set to which the proposed method could be applied."

These bounds are essentially the constant-weight versions of the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds, respectively, and have been proven mathematically; specifically, the lower bound is due to Levenshtein (<a href=\"#bib8\">Levenshtein, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Jiang and Vardy, 2004</a>), and the upper bound is slightly weaker version of that developed by Freiman, Berger, and Johnson (<a href=\"#bib4\">Freiman, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agrell et al., 2000</a>)."
