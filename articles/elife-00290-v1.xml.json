To identify mechanisms that scale the spindle during <i>Xenopus laevis</i> embryogenesis, we established an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts prepared from embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37 \u00b5m) and stage 8 (\u223c4000 cells, 18 \u00b5m). We identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin \u03b1, and activated in stage 8 when importin \u03b1 partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle size in <i>Xenopus</i> development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization."

Wilbur and Heald found that over the course of development, importin-\u03b1 became increasingly localized to the cell membrane, meaning that there was less available to bind to kif2a in the cytoplasm. This freed up kif2a to interact with and destabilize microtubules, and led ultimately to a reduction in spindle size."

Following fertilization, the \u223c1.2-mm-diameter egg synchronously divides 12 times at approximately 30-min intervals, leading to a \u223c100-fold decrease in cell volume and at least a 20-fold decrease in cell diameter by the midblastula transition (stage 8.5), when zygotic transcription starts. Initially, the cortically localized meiosis II spindle (\u223c35 \u00b5m) segregates chromosomes a short distance, generating a small polar body that preserves egg cytoplasm. During the early cleavages, there is an upper limit to spindle size (\u223c60 \u00b5m), and astral microtubules mediate movement of chromosomes long distances during anaphase (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wuhr et al., 2008</a>). At these stages, spindle size is small compared to cell size, and cytoplasmic mechanisms likely operate, since in vivo spindle size is maintained in extracts prepared from eggs or two-cell stage embryos (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mitchison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wuhr et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Loughlin et al., 2011</a>). As cell and spindle size converge, a constant ratio of \u223c2:1 cell diameter:spindle length is established, and spindle length reduces to \u223c20 \u00b5m by the end of the synchronous cleavage divisions. To what extent cell size influences spindle size or if changes in cytoplasmic activities contribute to spindle scaling at these later stages is unknown."

By comparing two closely related <i>Xenopus</i> species, we showed previously that meiotic spindle size is partially controlled by activity of the MT severing protein katanin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Loughlin et al., 2011</a>). However, the genetically encoded differences that underpinned variation in katanin activity cannot play a role during early development in an embryo with a single genetic background and when transcription is repressed. In early <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> development, decreasing spindle length correlates with a decrease in centrosome size and a decay gradient of the protein of TPXL-1 along spindle MTs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Greenan et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, spindle assembly in <i>X. laevis</i> egg extracts does not require centrosomes and depends heavily on a chromatin-centered gradient of RanGTP, which locally releases spindle assembly factors from the nucleocytoplasmic transport protein importin \u03b2 and its adaptor importin \u03b1 that binds nuclear localization sequence (NLS)\u2013containing cargos (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gruss et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kalab and Heald, 2008</a>). The respective contribution of gradients and centrosomes are expected to alter spindle architecture and size, and could be influenced by cell size through availability of components (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goehring and Hyman, 2012</a>). The gradual transition from meiotic to mitotic spindle architecture observed in mouse embryos supports this view (<a href=\"#bib4\">Courtois et al., 2012</a>). Collectively, these observations suggest that changes in gradients and spindle assembly pathways are likely to accompany cell size changes and could influence spindle size."

We compared stage 3 and stage 8, the two extremes of spindle size in our extract system, and found that MT dynamics are modified to reduce spindle size upon release of an inhibitory interaction between the MT depolymerizing kinesin kif2a and importin \u03b1. This occurs through redistribution of importin \u03b1 from the cytoplasm to a membrane fraction. Taking advantage of this mechanism to modify spindle size without functionally perturbing the spindle allowed us to uncover an important role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in the large cells of early <i>Xenopus</i> development. This work suggests that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities."

This system is analogous to the cytostatic factor (CSF) arrested meiosis II extract derived from unfertilized <i>X. laevis</i> eggs, which has facilitated fundamental discoveries pertaining to the cell cycle and spindle assembly (<a href=\"#bib22\">Maresca and Heald, 2006</a>). However, embryo extracts form mitotic rather than meiotic spindles, and spindles assemble to varying sizes corresponding to their developmental stage in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Since embryo extracts lack the natural metaphase arrest induced by CSF activity in egg extracts, it was necessary to artificially arrest them by adding a nondegradable form of cyclin B to maintain high cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity together with a dominant negative inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex, UbcH10 C114S (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rape et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, an empirically determined time point within each developmental stage was optimal for generating functional extracts. For example, to generate stage 3 extracts from embryos developing at 23\u00b0C, packing and crushing was initiated exactly 1 hr and 40 min after fertilization and completed 20 min later, just before the second embryonic cleavage would have occurred."

Comparing the extracts that differed most, MTs typically appeared less dense in stage 8 spindles compared to stage 3 or meiosis II spindles, indicating different underlying MT architectures. In vivo spindle size can vary significantly within the different sized cells at a single developmental stage. For instance, stage 8 embryo spindles range from \u223c20 \u00b5m in smaller cells of the animal pole to \u223c50 \u00b5m in length in the large vegetal pole cells. Spindle size varied less within an embryo extract, and on average was slightly reduced compared to the equivalent stage in vivo. Stage 3 populations had average lengths ranging from \u223c35 to 40 \u00b5m and stage 8, \u223c17 to 20 \u00b5m, closer to the size of spindles in animal pole cells. The most common defect observed in embryo extract spindles was the failure of chromosomes to fully align at the metaphase plate, especially in stage 3 extracts, likely due to poor metaphase arrest (unpublished data). These observations indicate that embryo extracts do not entirely preserve spindle morphology and function. However, spindle scaling was apparent in vitro, with a \u223c20 \u00b5m decrease in length between stage 3 and stage 8 extract spindles, compared to \u223c30 \u00b5m in vivo."

Altering the ratio of stage 3 and stage 8 extracts led to dose-dependent changes in spindle size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Since stage 8 extracts contain abundant endogenous nuclei whose chromosomes are incorporated into forming spindles, we wondered whether the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm or the contents of endogenous nuclei were affecting spindle size in stage 8 extracts. We therefore compared reactions depleted of endogenous nuclei by centrifugation, or filtered to remove all nuclei, and then supplemented with exogenous sperm nuclei. Average spindle lengths were very similar in the presence of \u223c2000 nuclei per microliter in untreated stage 8 extract, \u223c1000 nuclei per microliter in centrifuged stage 8 extract, and \u223c500 sperm nuclei per microliter in filtered stage 8 extract (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Furthermore, purified stage 8 nuclei added to stage 3 extracts yielded indistinguishable spindle lengths compared to sperm nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These experiments indicate that the major spindle size controlling factors in embryo extracts are soluble cytoplasmic components."

Whereas MTs nucleated around chromatin in stage 3 extracts, and little interaction of centrosomal MTs with the forming spindle was observed, centrosomes provided most of the MT nucleation in stage 8 extracts and few MTs appeared around the chromosomes except when a centrosome was located nearby (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). These observations suggest that the spindle assembly pathway switches from chromatin-driven in stage 3 to centrosome-driven in stage 8 extracts. To test this idea, we compared the sensitivity of embryo extract spindle assembly to addition of Ran(T24N), a dominant negative inhibitor of the RanGEF RCC1 that destroys the chromatin-induced RanGTP and cargo gradients, severely disrupting spindle assembly in <i>X. laevis</i> egg extracts (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kalab et al., 2002</a>). Stage 3 spindles were similarly disrupted by this treatment, resulting in a significant (p&lt;0.001, comparing treated to control) loss of tubulin intensity in spindle center, while stage 8 extract spindles were unaffected under the same conditions (p&gt;0.01, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Thus, stage 3 spindles assemble by a chromatin-driven mechanism requiring a RanGTP gradient, similar to the <i>Xenopus</i> meiotic spindle, whereas stage 8 spindle assembly more closely resembles the centrosome-dominated spindle pathway typical of somatic cell types."

Therefore, we characterized the dynamic parameters of single MTs nucleated by centrosomes using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, and found the primary difference between stage 3 and stage 8 extracts to be a threefold increase in MT catastrophe frequency (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), a difference sufficient to reduce spindle length from \u223c35 to \u223c25 \u00b5m in the meiotic spindle model (<a href=\"#bib19\">Loughlin et al., 2010</a>). We measured centrosomal nucleation and MT growth rate by counting and tracking MT plus-ends bound to Alexa 488\u2013labeled EB1 (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Whereas growth rates were similar, a small increase in MT nucleation corrected for average rescue frequency was documented in stage 3 extracts, but whether this is relevant to nucleation in the spindle is unclear. The rate of poleward MT flux determined by fluorescent speckle microscopy was similar in stage 3 and stage 8 spindles and comparable to that of meiotic spindles (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Maddox et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Brown et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ohi et al., 2007</a>). Finally, MT severing assayed with fluorescent, taxol-stabilized MTs was also very similar in stage 3 and stage 8 extracts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results suggest that an increased MT catastrophe frequency primarily drives developmental spindle scaling."

Quantification of immunofluorescence intensity revealed that compared to stage 3 spindles in which kif2a localized weakly to kinetochores and spindle poles, increased amounts of kif2a homogeneously localized to stage 8 extract spindles, with a slight enrichment at spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The case was markedly different for MCAK, which displayed a similar localization in both spindle types and had higher overall intensity in stage 3 extract spindles, indicating that it is unlikely to be involved in developmental spindle scaling. Changes in kif2a spindle recruitment between stage 3 and stage 8 spindles occurred without significant changes in protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Many spindle components implicated in regulation of catastrophe or nucleation were quantitatively similar in localization between stage 3 and stage 8 extracts. These include the MT minus-end protector patronin, the MT nucleator \u03b3-tubulin, and the mitotic kinase aurora B (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Other spindle proteins including TPX2 and the kinetochore kinesin CENP-E were qualitatively similar and likewise were not selected for further analysis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, kif2a appeared to be the best candidate for a cytoplasmic developmental spindle scaling factor."

We reasoned that the observed shift in spindle assembly pathways might contribute. Regulation of spindle assembly factors by nuclear transport proteins is central to the chromatin-mediated spindle assembly pathway in meiosis and at stage 3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), but cytoplasmic levels of importin \u03b1 decrease by almost 50% at stage 8, a change that affects nuclear size during development (<a href=\"#bib17\">Levy and Heald, 2010</a>), raising the possibility that importin \u03b1 could impact spindle MT dynamics if it were able to regulate kif2a recruitment and activity."

An interaction between kif2a and importin \u03b1 could be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) from egg extracts. Since IP with kif2a antibodies could co-IP importin \u03b1, but IP with importin \u03b1 antibodies did not efficiently co-IP kif2a (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), this interaction appears to be weak compared to other known importin \u03b1 cargos, such TPX2 that can be co-depleted with importin \u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gruss et al., 2001</a>). This indicates that the binding affinity between kif2a and importin \u03b1 may be in a regime that is sensitive to the levels of both proteins, as well as to cargos that compete for binding to importin \u03b1. In vitro, recombinant importin \u03b1 and kif2a formed a complex detected by size exclusion chromatography, as a significant fraction of importin \u03b1 shifted to a higher molecular weight and coeluted with kif2a (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To test whether importin \u03b1 directly regulates kif2a activity, the proteins were added to fluorescent taxol-stabilized MTs in a flow chamber in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. Under these conditions, 0.5 \u00b5M kif2a depolymerized MTs at 1.2 \u00b5m/min in an ATP-dependent manner, while preincubation with 1.5 \u00b5M importin \u03b1 prevented MT depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), indicating that importin \u03b1 directly regulates kif2a."

Despite this significant size decrease, we did not observe any obvious problems with mitotic timing, metaphase chromosome alignment, or defects during anaphase such as lagging chromosomes. These data suggest that although increasing levels of kif2a decrease spindle size, the mitotic apparatus remains architecturally functional and chromosome segregation is robust to spindle size changes, as might be expected if we were manipulating a physiological mechanism of spindle scaling. Interestingly, however, orientation of metaphase spindles was frequently randomized in the presence of excess kif2a compared to control spindles that were typically nearly aligned with the long animal\u2013vegetal axis of the cell (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). There was a clear correlation between metaphase spindle length and angle relative to the long axis, with shorter spindles less likely to be aligned even in unperturbed control embryos (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This effect was specific to metaphase as prometaphase and anaphase spindles were aligned along the long axis whether exogenous kif2a was injected or not (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). While we cannot rule out that orientation defects result in part from unknown pathways in which kif2a functions or from altered astral MT dynamics at metaphase, no effect was observed on prometaphase centrosome position and anaphase spindle orientation. Furthermore, spindle orientation in very large cells is established by orienting centrosomes during the previous telophase/interphase transition and not by astral MTs contacting the cell cortex hundreds of microns away (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wuhr et al., 2011</a>). Finally, astral MTs were clearly evident at metaphase and early anaphase following injection of kif2a or \u0394NLS kif2a (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Altogether, these data indicate that spindle length, which is controlled by regulation of MT-destabilizing activities within the spindle, impacts metaphase spindle orientation in the very large cells of the <i>Xenopus</i> embryo, but additional mechanisms operate to ensure properly positioned cleavage divisions."

While a number of perturbations have been shown to alter spindle size, we have identified, out the hundreds of known spindle associated proteins, physiological effectors that operate to scale the spindle during embryogenesis. Considering our recent work identifying the microtubule severing enzyme katanin as an activity that scales spindle sized between related frog species, modulation of MT destabilization has now emerged as a general means of physiologically scaling spindle size in <i>Xenopus</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Loughlin et al., 2011</a>). In contrast to interspecies spindle scaling, which relied on a regulatory phosphorylation site, the developmental mechanism described here depends on decreasing cytoplasmic levels of an inhibitor, importin \u03b1, which may be directly linked to changes in the ratio of surface membrane to cell volume (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Importantly, this mechanism functions cell autonomously and independent of developmental stage, thereby assuring that the spindle scales correctly over the range of cell sizes present in the embryo at each cleavage division. It is important to note that neither the interspecies nor developmental scaling mechanisms identified fully account for spindle size differences. Future research will tell whether many factors are involved and if there are other common themes."

Similarly, rounds of DNA, centrosome, or other organelle replication in the absence of cell growth could provide exponentially growing sinks for inhibitory factors or drive spatial redistribution of molecules that contribute to intracellular scaling. Structural components may also become limiting as the cytoplasmic volume decreases, or other aspects of changing cell geometry could alter spatial distributions and reaction rates. It is an open question how many of these processes function to modulate the size of the spindle and other organelles, compared to the contribution of zygotic transcription and other regulatory mechanisms that turn on later in development."

                        "text": "We have shown that developmental spindle scaling is coincident with a change in spindle assembly pathway from a chromatin-mediated mechanism to a centrosome-dominated mechanism. In egg extracts and large blastomeres, importin \u03b1 binds to cargo proteins and provides, in combination with importin \u03b2, functional regulation downstream of the RanGTP gradient (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nachury et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Wiese et al., 2001</a>). Although the mechanisms that regulate spindle assembly through the RanGTP gradient and downstream effectors are poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kalab et al., 2006</a>), we show that the switch in spindle assembly to a more centrosome-mediated pathway occurs concomitantly with a decrease in cytoplasmic levels of importin \u03b1. This mechanism is consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development and suggests that the physical changes in embryonic cells size can impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture (<a href=\"#bib4\">Courtois et al., 2012</a>). In egg extracts, importin \u03b1 phosphorylation is thought to liberate it from membrane stores into the cytoplasm, thereby promoting its transport activity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hachet et al., 2004</a>). Whether the multiple importin \u03b1 bands in stage 7 and stage 8 embryos represent different phosphorylation states or some other posttranslational modification remains to be determined. Interestingly, nuclear size is also sensitive to importin \u03b1 levels, and in this way, nuclear and spindle size may be coordinated, positioning importin \u03b1 as a central molecule in controlling the size of multiple subcellular structures (<a href=\"#bib17\">Levy and Heald, 2010</a>)."

Consistent with a role for kif2a in spindle size control, either increasing its levels or disrupting its localization by inhibiting dynein can modulate meiotic spindle size in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts (<a href=\"#bib5\">Gaetz and Kapoor, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ohi et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, inhibiting the other kinesin-13 family member MCAK dramatically affects global MT dynamics (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ohi et al., 2007</a>). This difference may be due to high importin \u03b1 levels limiting the activity of kif2a in egg extract spindles. Whether importin \u03b1 regulates kif2a in cultured cells, where it is necessary for bipolar spindle assembly and poleward flux of MTs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ganem and Compton, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ganem et al., 2005</a>), is unknown. Kif2a phosphorylation by aurora and polo kinases modulates its activity, which is also regulated through an interaction with inner centromere Kin-I stimulator (ICIS) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Knowlton et al., 2009</a>).

However, chromosome segregation was robust to decreases in spindle size indicating that spindle architecture remained viable and a large spindle is not essential for division of large cells. Previous work has suggested that in contrast to the canonical spindle positioning pathways, astral MTs cannot reach the cortex of large cells to provide position cues and forces at metaphase (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mitchison et al., 2012</a>). Instead, centrosomes are likely positioned prior to spindle assembly through interactions with telophase MT asters of the previous division (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wuhr et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2011</a>), a mechanism that does not appear disrupted under conditions that reduce spindle size in our experiments. The randomized orientation of smaller spindles specifically at metaphase in stage 3 embryos suggests that in addition to initial positioning of centrosomes to define spindle orientation, there is a mechanism that maintains spindle orientation until anaphase onset, after which large anaphase asters may again provide orientation cues. Considering the spindle as a prolate ellipsoid in a viscous medium, the frictional resistance to rotation is nonlinearly related to length. A larger spindle may therefore resist rotation, especially given the highly viscous cytoplasm and the relatively short metaphase duration in blastomeres. While identifying the mechanisms that control spindle size revealed a cellular role in spindle orientation, in the future, it will be interesting to examine how changing spindle size affects the developmental program of the embryo. Overall, our embryo extract system, in combination with biochemical validation of regulatory interactions and experimental manipulation in developing embryos, allows the identification of physiologically relevant molecular mechanisms controlling spindle architecture and cell division."

Full-length kif2a and motor domain (amino acids 204\u2013538) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned in to pMAL-C5X (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch MA, USA), and expressed and purified as described for MBP fusion proteins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Loughlin et al., 2011</a>). The NLS mutant had three charge switch mutations, K427E, K428E, and K430E, introduced into the NLS sequence identified by Quikchange mutagenesis (Stratagene/Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA, USA)."

Both reviewers make the point that the first part of the paper (extract systems and the implications for changes in the spindle throughout development) is profound and very important, while the data presented in the second part (kif2a and importin \u03b1 are responsible for the difference between spindle length) are not strong enough to provide extensive, mechanistic insights. However, we do believe that your work is worth publishing but for resubmission you would have to improve the second part as proposed below."

We would ask you to measure the cytoplasmic levels of active importin \u03b1, data that can be collected either with (1) FCS, (2) FRET (sensors described in Sun et al., 2007, PNAS), or (3) quantitative pull downs. We suggest this because we expect that the reagents already exist in your lab, based on previous papers you have published."

Tagged recombinant kif2a was added to stage 3 or stage 8 extracts and then retrieved, revealing the amount of active importin \u03b1 in the each extract that is free to bind kif2a, using a kif2a NLS mutant as control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We found that in stage 3 extracts importin \u03b1 could bind kif2a while in stage 8 extracts approximately ten-fold less importin \u03b1 interacted with the added kif2a (quantified in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

FCS experiments were performed upon addition of fluorescently labeled kif2a motor domain to either stage 3 or stage 8 extract at low concentrations. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 500 frames/sec and processed as by the PACI method developed by Needleman et al. (Biophysics J. 2009). Correlation curves indicated slower diffusion of kif2a motor domain in stage 3 compared to stage 8 extracts, indicating the interaction with other proteins and consistent with the formation of importin \u03b1-containing complexes. However, curve fits to this data were underdetermined for some parameters and therefore, despite qualitatively supporting our pulldown results, we feel the data are not strong enough to warrant addition to the manuscript."

Given the small changes in importin \u03b1 partitioning that affected spindle size, we were unable to interpret data from the system perturbed in this way since any additional importin \u03b1 protein is expected to affect its steady state distribution."
