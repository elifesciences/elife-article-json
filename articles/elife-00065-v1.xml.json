                    "text": "Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is a hormone secreted by the liver during fasting that elicits diverse aspects of the adaptive starvation response. Among its effects, FGF21 induces hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, increases insulin sensitivity, blocks somatic growth and causes bone loss. Here we show that transgenic overexpression of FGF21 markedly extends lifespan in mice without reducing food intake or affecting markers of NAD+ metabolism or AMP kinase and mTOR signaling. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that FGF21 acts primarily by blunting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway in liver. These findings raise the possibility that FGF21 can be used to extend lifespan in other species."

Among its effects, FGF21 induces hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, increases insulin sensitivity, blocks somatic growth and causes bone loss. Here we show that transgenic overexpression of FGF21 markedly extends lifespan in mice without reducing food intake or affecting markers of NAD+ metabolism or AMP kinase and mTOR signaling. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that FGF21 acts primarily by blunting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway in liver. These findings raise the possibility that FGF21 can be used to extend lifespan in other species."

This phenomenon has since been observed in species ranging from worms to primates, but not in humans. Reducing calorie intake leads to longer lives by modifying a number of the biochemical pathways that sense nutrients, including pathways that involve insulin and various other biomolecules. Chemical and genetic methods can also increase longevity by modifying these pathways, which suggests that it might be possible to develop drugs that can increase lifespan without reducing calorie intake."

The liver has an important role in this response, secreting a hormone called fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) that coordinates these processes among tissues. Previous experiments on transgenic mice with high levels of this hormone have shown that it suppresses the activity of growth hormone and reduces the production of insulin-like growth factor, which prevents growth and can lead to hibernation-like behavior."

They find that the transgenic mice have a longer median survival time than wild-type mice (38 months vs 28 months), and that the transgenic female mice on average live for 4 months longer than their male counterparts. However, unlike in other examples of increased longevity, they find that decreased food intake is not required. Instead, they find that transgenic mice eat more food than wild-type mice, yet remain profoundly insulin-sensitive. The results suggest that the longer survival times are caused by a reduction in the production of insulin-like growth factor, but they also suggest that the mechanism responsible for the increased longevity is independent of the three pathways that are usually associated with such increases. Further research is needed to understand this mechanism in greater detail and could, perhaps, pave the way for the use of FGF21-based hormone therapy to extend lifespan without the need for a low-calorie diet."

The effect of caloric restriction on longevity appears to be mediated by multiple nutrient-sensing pathways including those involving insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), target of rapamycin (TOR), AMP kinase and sirtuins. Pharmacologic and/or genetic manipulation of these pathways increases longevity to varying degrees, suggesting the feasibility of drugs that increase lifespan in the absence of caloric restriction (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kenyon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barzilai et al., 2012</a>)."

In mice, FGF21 is strongly induced in liver in response to prolonged fasts through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1-dependent mechanism. FGF21 in turn elicits diverse aspects of the adaptive starvation response. Among these, FGF21 increases insulin sensitivity and causes a corresponding decrease in basal insulin concentrations; FGF21 increases hepatic fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis; and, FGF21 sensitizes mice to torpor, a hibernation-like state of reduced body temperature and physical activity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Potthoff et al., 2012</a>). FGF21 also blocks somatic growth by causing GH resistance, a phenomenon associated with starvation. Transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing FGF21 are markedly smaller than wild-type mice and have a corresponding decrease in circulating IGF-1 concentrations despite having elevated growth hormone (GH) levels (<a href=\"#bib16\">Inagaki et al., 2008</a>). Conversely, FGF21-knockout mice grow more than wild-type mice under conditions of nutrient deprivation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kubicky et al., 2012</a>). In liver, FGF21 inhibits the GH signaling pathway by blocking JAK2-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, STAT5. This suppresses the transcription of <i>Igf1</i> and other GH/STAT5-regulated genes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Inagaki, et al., 2008</a>). Thus, FGF21-mediated repression of the GH/IGF-1 axis provides a mechanism for blocking growth and conserving energy under starvation conditions."

Comprehensive transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray using RNA from liver, gastrocnemius muscle and epididymal white adipose tissue of wild-type and FGF21-Tg mice and mice subjected to either caloric restriction or a 24 hr fast. Using a false discovery rate &lt;0.10 and fold change &gt;2 as criteria, we found that expression of 33, 8 and 22 genes was changed in liver, muscle and adipose of FGF21-Tg mice, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Many more genes were regulated by caloric restriction or fasting than by the FGF21 transgene in all three tissues. As expected, <i>Fgf21</i> was strongly induced in liver by fasting. Surprisingly, however, <i>Fgf21</i> was not induced by the caloric restriction regimen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Likewise, there was no increase in plasma FGF21 concentrations in response to caloric restriction (data not shown). While the molecular basis for this differential regulation of <i>Fgf21</i> by fasting and caloric restriction is not yet known, these data indicate that FGF21 is not an endogenous mediator of the caloric restriction response. Notably, 30 of the 33 genes with changed expression in liver of FGF21-Tg mice were also regulated by caloric restriction, while 20 of these genes were regulated by fasting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Eight of the genes with altered expression in liver of FGF21-Tg mice (highlighted in red in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; see Discussion) are similarly regulated in long-lived dwarf mice (<a href=\"#bib30\">Swindell, 2007</a>). In contrast, there was little overlap in genes regulated by FGF21 and either caloric restriction or fasting in muscle or adipose. These data suggest that FGF21 may extend lifespan by regulating a small subset of genes also regulated by caloric restriction in liver."

We also determined mitochondrial DNA content in liver as a downstream measure of AMP kinase activity. Phospho-AMP kinase levels were not increased in tissues from FGF21-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Consistent with these data, mitochondrial DNA content was unchanged in liver (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). While Phospho-S6 and phospho-4E-BP1 levels were decreased in muscle of male FGF21-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), they were unchanged in muscle of longer-lived FGF21-Tg females or in liver or adipose from either sex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>).

The increase in lifespan extension is comparable to that achieved by caloric restriction (<a href=\"#bib32\">Turturro et al., 1999</a>). While the FGF21-mediated increase in longevity is less than the 50\u201370% increase seen in pituitary loss-of-function Ames mice and GH receptor/GH binding protein-knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coschigano et al., 2000</a>), it is similar to that seen in other loss-of-function dwarf models including hypopituitary Snell mice (<a href=\"#bib14\">Flurkey et al., 2002</a>) and mice lacking pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a protease that increases IGF-1 activity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Conover et al., 2010</a>). The FGF21-Tg mice share other phenotypic similarities with long-lived dwarf mice including small size, reduced circulating insulin and IGF-1 concentrations, increased circulating adiponectin levels and female infertility. Like the Ames and Snell dwarf mice, female FGF21-Tg mice live longer than males (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown-Borg and Bartke, 2012</a>). These similarities together with our previous finding that FGF21-Tg mice are GH resistant (<a href=\"#bib16\">Inagaki et al., 2008</a>) suggest that FGF21 may increase lifespan by inhibiting the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Because FGF21 also regulates other pathways that impact metabolism, it is not surprising that some of the effects that are seen in dwarf mice, such as increased adiposity in GH receptor-knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib25\">Masternak et al., 2012</a>), are not recapitulated in FGF21-Tg mice."

Interestingly, nearly all of these hepatic genes (30 of 33) were similarly regulated by caloric restriction, a proven method of extending lifespan in mice and other species (<a href=\"#bib24\">Masoro, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kenyon, 2010</a>). In contrast, there was little or no overlap in the genes regulated by FGF21 and caloric restriction in muscle or adipose. A remarkable result of our studies is that FGF21 increased longevity to a similar extent as caloric restriction while regulating a much smaller set of genes in liver. These data suggest that FGF21 may extend lifespan by acting as a selective caloric restriction mimetic in liver. An important caveat, however, is that there may be changes in other tissues or post-transcriptional changes that were missed in this analysis. We note that caloric restriction did not increase circulating FGF21 levels, indicating that endogenous FGF21 does not mediate the longevity effects of caloric restriction."

Eight of these genes (<i>Fmo3</i>, <i>Igfals</i>, <i>Hes6</i>, <i>Alas2</i>, <i>Cyp4a12b</i>, <i>Mup4</i>, <i>Serpina12</i>, <i>Hsd3b5</i>) are among those co-regulated by FGF21 and caloric restriction in liver in our current study, and four others (<i>Igf1</i>, <i>Igfbp1</i>, <i>Socs2</i> and <i>Mup3</i>) were previously shown by more sensitive quantitative real-time PCR to be regulated in liver of FGF21-Tg mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Inagaki et al., 2008</a>). Strikingly, 26 of the 33 genes regulated by FGF21 in liver were previously shown to be regulated in a similar manner in mice lacking STAT5 activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barclay et al., 2011</a>). Thus, FGF21 may increase longevity by suppressing the GH signaling axis in liver in a manner similar to that of caloric restriction. Interestingly, GH induces FGF21 in liver through a STAT5-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barclay et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Yu et al., 2012</a>).

These attributes have made FGF21 an intriguing therapeutic target. In contrast to these positive effects, however, we previously showed that younger (&lt;8-month-old) FGF21-Tg mice and adult mice administered recombinant FGF21 for 14 days have reduced bone mass (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). In our current study, similar reductions in bone mass were seen in older mice. The FGF21-dependent decrease in bone mass is caused in part by an increase in the differentiation of marrow adipocytes and corresponding decrease in osteoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). In addition, FGF21 inhibits GH action directly at the growth plate (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wu et al., 2012</a>), and long-lived PAPP-A-knockout mice have a decrease in bone mineral density (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tanner et al., 2008</a>), suggesting that changes in GH/IGF-1 signaling are also likely to be involved in FGF21-induced decreases in bone mass. While it remains to be determined whether FGF21 causes bone loss in humans, it is likely that this adverse effect will have to be overcome if FGF21 is to be used clinically to combat aging."

Regarding other hormones that influence lifespan, we note that the extracellular domain of Klotho, a membrane protein that regulates phosphate metabolism and serves as a co-receptor for FGF23 but not FGF21, can be cleaved to yield a circulating peptide that blocks insulin and IGF-1 signaling. This hormonal activity may contribute to Klotho\u2019s lifespan-extending effect in mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kurosu et al., 2005</a>). However, unlike FGF21, Klotho causes insulin resistance, which may limit its utility as a therapeutic agent. We conclude that FGF21 could potentially be used as a hormone therapy to extend lifespan in mammals."

RNA was reverse transcribed into cRNA and biotin-UTP labeled using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) and hybridized to the Illumina mouseRefseq-8v2 Expression BeadChips. Hybridizations were done in triplicate with each replicate containing cRNA from 1 to 3 different mice. Image data were converted into unnormalized Sample Probe Profiles using the Illumina BeadStudio software and raw expression data were processed using the Model-Based Background Correction method (<a href=\"#bib37\">Xie et al., 2009</a>). All gene expression values were log2 transformed and quantile normalized. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tusher et al., 2001</a>) was used to identify differentially expressed genes among different groups using a false discovery rate of less than 10% and fold-change &gt;2 as criteria."
