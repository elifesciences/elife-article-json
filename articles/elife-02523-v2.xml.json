Pharmacological agents that inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity with high potency have long been sought, but have remained elusive. In this study, we report that the small molecule erastin is a potent, selective inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. RNA sequencing revealed that inhibition of cystine\u2013glutamate exchange leads to activation of an ER stress response and upregulation of <i>CHAC1</i>, providing a pharmacodynamic marker for system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> inhibition. We also found that the clinically approved anti-cancer drug sorafenib, but not other kinase inhibitors, inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function and can trigger ER stress and ferroptosis. In an analysis of hospital records and adverse event reports, we found that patients treated with sorafenib exhibited unique metabolic and phenotypic alterations compared to patients treated with other kinase-inhibiting drugs. Finally, using a genetic approach, we identified new genes dramatically upregulated in cells resistant to ferroptosis."

Pharmacological agents that inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity with high potency have long been sought, but have remained elusive. In this study, we report that the small molecule erastin is a potent, selective inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. RNA sequencing revealed that inhibition of cystine\u2013glutamate exchange leads to activation of an ER stress response and upregulation of <i>CHAC1</i>, providing a pharmacodynamic marker for system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> inhibition. We also found that the clinically approved anti-cancer drug sorafenib, but not other kinase inhibitors, inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function and can trigger ER stress and ferroptosis. In an analysis of hospital records and adverse event reports, we found that patients treated with sorafenib exhibited unique metabolic and phenotypic alterations compared to patients treated with other kinase-inhibiting drugs. Finally, using a genetic approach, we identified new genes dramatically upregulated in cells resistant to ferroptosis."

We further show that small molecule inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by the transcriptional upregulation of genes linked to the ER stress response. The upregulation of the ER stress response gene <i>CHAC1</i> (ChaC, cation transport regulator homolog 1) serves as a useful pharmacodynamic marker of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> inhibition.

We endeavored to generalize and validate the lethality of erastin towards cancer cells in several ways. First, we tested whether the same effects were observed in other cell types using a \u2018modulatory profiling\u2019 strategy (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wolpaw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>). This method allows for the simplified detection and presentation of small molecule combination effects on cell viability (modulatory effect, M<sub>e</sub> &lt; 0, sensitization; M<sub>e</sub> = 0, no effect; M<sub>e</sub> &gt; 0, rescue). We observed that in five different human cancer cell lines, cell death induced by either erastin or SAS was rescued by the same canonical ferroptosis inhibitors: the iron chelator ciclopirox olamine (CPX), the lipophilic antioxidants trolox and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), the MEK inhibitor U0126, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and the reducing agent beta-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Thus, the ferroptotic death phenotype, whether induced by erastin or SAS, was similar in all cell lines tested. The inhibition of cell death by \u03b2-ME indicates that cell death most likely involves inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function, as \u03b2-ME treatment can generate mixed disulfides taken up by other transporters, thereby circumventing the need for system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ishii et al., 1981</a>)."

We validated this assay in three ways. First, we showed that erastin (<b>1</b>) inhibited glutamate release, while a non-lethal (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yagoda et al., 2007</a>) erastin analog lacking the <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxy moiety (erastin-A8, <b>2</b>) did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Second, we showed that both erastin treatment and silencing of <i>SLC7A11</i> with either of two independent siRNAs resulted in a significant, quantitatively similar inhibition of glutamate release (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>); silencing of the system L transporter subunit <i>SLC7A5</i> using two independent siRNAs had no effect on basal or erastin-mediated inhibition of glutamate release (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Third, we found that only erastin and SAS inhibited glutamate release, while, as expected, RSL3, artesunate and PEITC did not; while artesunate and PEITC induce iron-dependent cell death, neither are known to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> or induce ferroptosis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Trachootham et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hamacher-Brady et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

Towards this end, we undertook a search for more potent analogs, beginning with an achiral analog (<b>3</b>, <a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2014</a>) that lacked the methyl group at the chiral center, and that had an isoproproxy substituent in place of the ethoxy group on erastin (<b>1</b>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

To assess in a parallel assay the correlation between lethal potency and inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity, we examined glutamate release using a high throughput, 96-well Amplex Red assay system in human CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Modifications to this region (<b>4</b>\u2013<b>10</b>), including substitution of the quinazolinone for quinolone (<b>4</b>) or indole (<b>5</b>), obtained using a Meth-Cohn quinoline synthesis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), resulted in moderate to severe losses of lethal potency compared to <b>3</b>, suggesting that the quinazolinone core scaffold is essential for the lethality of erastin. Modifications to the piperazine linker (Region B, <b>11</b>\u2013<b>12</b>) were not tolerated, with <b>12</b> being completely inactive in both the HT-1080 lethality and CCF-STTG1 glutamate release assays. We speculate that rigidification of this portion of the scaffold is essential for activity and that an increase in the number of rotatable bonds in this region results in a higher entropic cost of binding, decreasing lethal potency. Single atom changes to the acetoxy spacer (Region C, <b>13</b>\u2013<b>15</b>) were likewise poorly tolerated, resulting in significant losses in potency that correlated with reduced inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity.

Crucially, these more potent compounds potently triggered lethality in HT-1080 cells via ferroptosis, as death was fully suppressed by \u03b2-ME. Previously, we have shown that erastin and lethal analogs thereof demonstrate selective lethality towards human BJ fibroblasts engineered to express human telomerase, SV40 large and small T antigen, and oncogenic HRAS<sup>V12</sup> (BJeLR) compared to isogenic cells expressing only telomerase (BJeH) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dolma et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). We tested the most potent lethal analog (<b>21</b>), along with the parent compound (<b>3</b>) and a representative non-lethal analog (<b>14</b>), in these cell lines. While <b>14</b> was inactive, we found that both lethal analogs (<b>21</b> and <b>3</b>) retained selectivity towards BJeLR vs BJeH cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Together, these results demonstrate that it is possible to improve the potency of the erastin scaffold substantially while retaining oncogenic RAS-selective lethality, especially via modifications to Region E. The combination of these new structural insights, together with complementary results concerning modifications that enhance the metabolic stability of erastin (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2014</a>), may result in suitable compounds for clinical studies."

To test this hypothesis in a global manner, we examined patterns of changes in the transcriptome using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of mRNA harvested from HT-1080 cells treated for 5 hr with DMSO, erastin (10 \u00b5M), \u03b2-ME (18 \u00b5M) or erastin + \u03b2-ME.

After data processing and averaging of replicates, we identified 33 mRNAs with two-fold more counts (\u2018up-regulated\u2019) and four mRNAs with twofold fewer counts (\u2018down-regulated\u2019) in erastin-treated samples vs DMSO-treated controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>; Data available as \u2018Data Package 1\u2019 from Dryad data Repository [<a href=\"#bib14\">Dixon et al., 2014</a>]).

Consistent with this, we observed that the 33 up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for GO Biological Process terms related directly to the ER stress and unfolded protein responses (GO:0034976, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, p=8.0 e<sup>\u221211</sup>; GO:0006987, activation of signaling protein activity involved in unfolded protein response, p=1.3 e<sup>\u22129</sup>; GO:0032075, positive regulation of nuclease activity, p=1.5 e<sup>\u22129</sup>). The eIF2alpha-ATF4 branch of the ER stress/unfolded protein response can be upregulated by amino acid depletion (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harding et al., 2003</a>), which we hypothesize is linked to intracellular cysteine depletion downstream of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> inhibition by erastin. We investigated further the connection between erastin treatment and activation of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway and observed that, relative to DMSO-treated controls, erastin treatment (5 \u03bcM, 7 hr) resulted in phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and up-regulation of ATF4 at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We saw no evidence for enhanced splicing of the XBP1 mRNA, which provides a readout for activation of a parallel ER stress response pathway (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In HT-1080 cells, co-treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (1 \u03bcg/ml) inhibited erastin-induced changes in gene expression (see below) and delayed but did not prevent erastin-induced cell death (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus, while blockade of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> by erastin (and other agents, see below) can trigger a robust transcriptional signature indicative of ER stress, it is doubtful that this transcriptional response is essential for the lethality observed following erastin treatment."

We therefore explored the RNA-Seq profiles for suitable candidate PD makers; the most highly up-regulated gene observed in erastin-treated HT-1080 cells by RNA-Seq was <i>CHAC1</i> (\u223c24-fold, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), an ER stress-responsive gene known to be upregulated downstream of ATF4 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gargalovic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mungrue et al., 2009</a>). We validated these results by RT-qPCR using fresh samples prepared from HT-1080 and Calu-1 cells, and confirmed that <i>CHAC1</i> up-regulation was fully reversible by co-treatment with \u03b2-ME (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). <i>CHAC1</i> mRNA upregulation was observed in response to seven different active erastin analogs described above (<b>3</b>, <b>20</b>\u2013<b>22</b>) and in a recent publication (AE, PE and MEII, [<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2014</a>]); low levels of <i>CHAC1</i> upregulation were also observed in response to two less potent analogs (<b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, both of which nonetheless retain some ability to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that the induction of ER stress and <i>CHAC1</i> upregulation may be more sensitive to the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> than cell viability (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>).

First, we found that in HT-1080 cells sorafenib (10 \u03bcM, 24 hr) treatment-induced cell death was significantly inhibited by the known small molecule ferroptosis suppressors \u03b2-ME, Fer-1 and DFO (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>); these same inhibitors suppress erastin (10 \u03bcM, 24 hr)-induced ferroptotic death, but not STS-induced apoptotic death (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, sorafenib alone can trigger ferroptosis. The observed suppression of sorafenib-induced death by \u03b2-ME was striking and immediately suggested that sorafenib, like erastin and SAS, could be acting to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function. Indeed, we observed that sorafenib, like erastin, but not the kinase inhibitor imatinib, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function, as assessed using the glutamate release assay in HT-1080 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The ability of sorafenib and erastin to suppress system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity was not inhibited by co-treatment with Fer-1, demonstrating that this effect is upstream of Fer-1-sensitive ROS accumulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), as expected. Likewise, similar to erastin and SAS, we observed a robust transcriptional upregulation of <i>CHAC1</i> in HT-1080 cells in response to sorafenib treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We also observed upregulation of the same biochemical markers of ER stress observed previously with erastin, namely phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and increased levels of ATF4, without any change in XBP1 splicing (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Finally, as observed previously with erastin treatment (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2014</a>), we found that sorafenib treatment (10 \u03bcM, 18 hr) of HT-1080 cells significantly depleted total glutathione and resulted in the accumulation of lipid peroxides as detected by flow cytometry using C11-BODIPY 581/591 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Together, these results suggest that, like erastin, sorafenib inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-mediated cystine import, leading to ER stress, glutathione depletion and the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid ROS."

Consistent with the initial results, in all five cell lines examined, we observed that sorafenib and erastin treatments (20 \u03bcM) caused a comparable inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function, as assessed by glutamate release (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, unlike erastin, we observed that sorafenib triggered Fer-1-suppressible ferroptosis in HT-1080 cells only within a narrow concentration window (sorafenib EC<sub>50</sub> = 18 \u03bcM, sorafenib+Fer-1 EC<sub>50</sub> = 43 \u03bcM), before causing Fer-1-insensitive death at higher concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In the four other cells lines, we observed only slight (143B) or non-existent (TC32, Calu-1, U2OS) differences in sorafenib EC<sub>50</sub> values either with or without Fer-1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, while sorafenib can inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity robustly, this manifests as a ferroptotic cell death phenotype only over a narrow range of concentrations; sorafenib appears to trigger additional lethal mechanisms that act in parallel to the ferroptotic response at higher concentrations."

We took two approaches in an attempt to address this question. First, we examined the effects of functionally-related kinase inhibitors. The global pattern of kinase inhibition by sorafenib against 300 purified kinase domains is highly similar to that of nilotinib, masitinib, and imatinib (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anastassiadis et al., 2011</a>), yet none of these agents appear to trigger ferroptosis, as defined by sensitivity to ferroptosis-specific cell death inhibitors \u03b2-ME and Fer-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>).

To do this we synthesized and tested a set of 87 sorafenib analogs for the ability to trigger \u03b2-ME- and Fer-1-suppressible death in HT-1080 cells in twofold, 10-point dilution series assays, starting at a highest concentration of 20 or 40 \u03bcM. In summary, while many analogs retained lethal activity (three examples of lethal compounds are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), none of the 87 analogs could trigger ferroptosis with enhanced selectivity for \u03b2-ME- and Fer-1-suppressible death over other lethal mechanisms compared to the parent compound itself. Several of the analogs that we synthesized were unable to trigger death (four example compounds are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These analogs (SRS13-67, SRS14-98, SRS13-48, and SRS15-11) contain modifications predicted to disrupt atomic interactions essential for the binding of sorafenib to kinase targets such as BRAF, including burial of the -CF3 group in a hydrophobic pocket and hydrogen bonding with the urea group (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lowinger et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wan et al., 2004</a>). Conversely, the active analogs shown here (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) mostly retain these features. Thus, one hypothesis is that sorafenib triggers ferroptosis by inhibiting an unknown kinase whose activity is necessary for constitutive system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity. Alternatively, sorafenib could modulate system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity by interacting with a non-kinase target that harbors a binding pocket resembling that found within the active site of sorafenib-sensitive kinases."

We speculated that the ability of sorafenib to trigger both ferroptotic and non-ferroptotic death would result in a unique spectrum of clinical observations in patients treated with sorafenib compared to other kinase inhibitors. Specifically, a subset of patients for any drug typically experience adverse events that are dependent on the drug mechanism. Thus, we speculated that the pattern of adverse events could report on the similarity or differences of mechanisms across drugs. Previously, we applied a large-scale statistical analysis to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to systematically identify drug effects and interactions (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tatonetti et al., 2012</a>). Here, we sought to use this approach to discover correlations between sorafenib exposure and human health unique to this drug. First, we identified those reports of patients with exposure to sorafenib, and a set of reports that could serve as controls; for this, we used a high dimensional propensity-score model previously validated for this use in the FAERS that has been shown to mitigate confounding bias and to improve the accuracy of statistical estimates (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tatonetti et al., 2012</a>). Using disproportionality analysis (<a href=\"#bib4a\">Bate and Evans, 2009</a>), we identified adverse drug effects for sorafenib and for a set of comparison kinase-targeted drugs for which sufficient data was available in our data (dasatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, and sunitinib), none of which (at 20 \u03bcM) were found to trigger ferroptosis in HT-1080 cells or inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> activity as assayed using the glutamate release assay (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then filtered out effects that could be attributed to chemotherapy and grouped the drug-effect associations by the physiological system that the adverse event affected. For example, cardiovascular-related adverse events were grouped into the cardiovascular system category. For each kinase inhibitor, we counted the number of reports in each of 20 physiological system categories that involved the above drugs. We then compared this number to the counts obtained from the selected control cohorts. Using a Fisher's exact test, we evaluated significance of associations of each kinase inhibitor to each physiological system category, and then we plotted these data as a heatmap, clustering the data in an unsupervised, hierarchical manner using the computed p values (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

In this analysis, we focused on genes that were transcriptionally upregulated in resistant clones vs the parental cell line. In total, we identified 73 genes that were upregulated at least 10-fold on average across the five resistant cell lines compared to the parental clones (Data available as \u2018Data Package 2\u2019 from Dryad data Repository [<a href=\"#bib14\">Dixon et al., 2014</a>]). The two genes that exhibited the highest average fold-change in expression and that were upregulated to highest average absolute levels within the cell (e.g., FPKM &gt;100) were <i>AKR1C1</i> (586-fold up-regulation) and <i>AKR1C2</i> (528-fold up-regulation) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>). A third family member, <i>AKR1C3</i> was upregulated 84-fold. The AKR1C1-3 enzymes have been shown to participate in the detoxification of toxic lipid metabolites (such as 4-hydroxynonenal) generated downsteam of the oxidation of various polyunsaturated fatty acid species (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burczynski et al., 2001</a>). Thus, overexpression of <i>AKR1C</i> family members (and potentially other genes) may confer partial resistance to erastin by enhancing the detoxification of reactive aldehydes generated downstream of the oxidative destruction of the plasma membrane during ferroptosis."

In this study, we have demonstrated that erastin is a potent and specific inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-mediated cystine uptake and further elucidated the mechanism of action of this and other system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> inhibitors that are able to trigger ferroptosis. Previous metabolomics analysis had suggested that erastin inhibited system L (SLC3A2 + SLC7A5)-mediated amino acid transport in Jurkat T cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>). It was therefore surprising to observe that in HT-1080 and Calu-1 cells erastin inhibited system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> (SLC3A2 + SLC7A11)-mediated cystine uptake, but not system-L-mediated phenylalanine uptake. These results rule out the possibility that erastin inhibits SLC3A2-dependent transporters non-specifically. Further, given evidence that Jurkat cells do not express system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kakazu et al., 2011</a>), we hypothesize that in cells lacking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, erastin can inhibit structurally-related transporters (e.g., system L). An alternative hypothesis is that erastin binds to some indirect target that, in Jurkat cells, favors the inhibition of system L, while in HT-1080, Calu-1 and possibly other cells, favors the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. A definitive resolution of this matter will require further study."

We found that erastin is a substantially more potent inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function than SAS. Further optimization of the erastin scaffold yielded analogs with improved potency against this antiporter in the low nanomolar range that retained a degree of selectivity towards oncogenic mutant HRAS-expressing cells. Our work suggests that the ability of erastin, SAS and sorafenib to induce ferroptosis is tied to the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-mediated cystine import, and the consequent depletion of glutathione and loss of GPX4 activity (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). However, these compounds are also predicted to inactivate the cystine/cysteine redox cycle (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banjac et al., 2008</a>) and, by restricting the intracellular supply of cysteine, to inhibit new protein synthesis. Together, these effects may further reduce cell growth or cause cell death in certain contexts where the induction of ferroptosis per se is not possible. The ability of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> inhibitors such as erastin to trigger ferroptosis at similar concentrations in both monolayer and three-dimensional MCTS cultures, and at both high (21%) and low (1%) O<sub>2</sub> levels, suggests that these compounds are capable of overcoming the \u2018multicellular resistance\u2019 phenomenon observed with many lethal molecules (<a href=\"#bib12\">Desoize and Jardillier, 2000</a>) and do not necessarily require high levels of ambient O<sub>2</sub> to be lethal."

These results are consistent with previous work showing upregulation of these genes in mammalian cells cultured in the absence of cysteine (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2008</a>). Intriguingly, ATF4 is thought to be an important regulator of <i>SLC7A11</i> expression and deletion of <i>Atf4</i> in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells results in an oxidative, iron-dependent death phenotype that is highly reminiscent of ferroptosis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harding et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that the basal level of ATF4 may set the threshold for ferroptotic death. <i>CHAC1</i> is a downstream target of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mungrue et al., 2009</a>) and our results suggest that <i>CHAC1</i> upregulation may be useful as a PD marker for cystine or cysteine-starved cells. Whether CHAC1 plays a role in the execution of ferroptosis remains unclear. ChaC-family proteins were recently reported to function in yeast as intracellular glutathione-degrading enzymes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kumar et al., 2012</a>). One possibility is that CHAC1 upregulation following system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> inhibition may actively contribute to glutathione depletion in cells deprived of cysteine, although inhibition of <i>CHAC1</i> transcription had only minimal effects on the viability of erastin-treated cells."

Despite sorafenib's multi-kinase inhibitory activity, there is disagreement about whether the sorafenib lethal mechanism of action in cells involves kinase inhibition or binding to an alternative target (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wilhelm et al., 2008</a>). It has previously been shown that sorafenib treatment inhibits translation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rahmani et al., 2005</a>), induces ER stress and the expression of <i>DDIT4</i> (REDD1) via the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rahmani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2011</a>), and causes caspase-independent death (<a href=\"#bib42\">Panka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Katz et al., 2009</a>). Most recently, it was suggested that in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, sorafenib can trigger iron-dependent death (<a href=\"#bib38\">Louandre et al., 2013</a>). Here, we show that inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-mediated cystine import by sorafenib can lead to both the induction of an ER stress response (as indicated by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and upregulation of both ATF4 and <i>CHAC1</i>) and ferroptotic cell death. Thus, our results provide a satisfying mechanistic explanation for previous observations: namely, that sorafenib can inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function, leading to ER stress and in some cells the induction of non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, ferroptotic cell death."

This encompasses the range within which we observe the ferroptosis-inducing effects of sorafenib. Notably, sera collected from sorafenib-treated patients display evidence of protein oxidation, with higher levels of protein oxidation being correlated with improved patient outcomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coriat et al., 2012</a>). Thus, it is conceivable that sorafenib could be having effects in vivo related to the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> function and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species. Indeed, given that renal cell carcinomas are among the most sensitive of all cancer cell lines to the lethal effects of erastin (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2014</a>), it may be of interest to re-evaluate whether the efficacy of sorafenib observed in patients could be due, at least in part, to inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-mediated cystine uptake. Likewise, adverse events that are observed in a minority of patients treated with sorafenib may be due to inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. While not all patients treated with sorafenib experience adverse events, we suspect that specific underlying (and unknown) sensitizing factors will render a minority of individuals more sensitive to these events.

To complement FAERS, we also downloaded the OFFSIDES drug effect database (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tatonetti et al., 2012</a>). In addition, we extracted the laboratory values, clinical notes, prescription orders, and diagnosis billing codes from the electronic health records (EHR) at Columbia University Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital for 316 patients with at least one prescription order of sorafenib, dasatinib, erlotinib, gefetinib, imatinib, lapatinib, or sunitunib. These data were employed in the analysis (described in detail in the main text) to identify adverse events uniquely associated with sorafenib treatment. This analysis was covered under the Columbia Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol number AAAL0601."

The erastin-supplemented medium was replaced every 3 days for 2\u20133 weeks to allow for clonal expansion. As summarized in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, 60 resistant clones were initially isolated by ring cloning, with selection limited to non-diffuse cell clusters to minimize risk of selecting drifted populations. Clones were subsequently maintained in complete medium without erastin. Of 36 clones found to be resistant to erastin in an initial re-testing, 20 were cross-resistant to Taxol (paclitaxel), a mechanistically unrelated drug. Of the remaining 16 clones, five exhibited strong resistance to erastin, but not to Taxol, and were further characterized."

As these are mere statistical data, the statement that sorafenib indeed causes these side effects in patients partially due to system xc- inhibition is over-interpreted and should be de-emphasized. In that sense, the authors should consider that mice lacking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> are fully viable and only show subtle phenotypes (Sato et al., JBC 2005). Therefore, major adverse effects induced by system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition in \u201cnormal\u201d cells are less likely, which questions the validity of the statement on page 22, second paragraph, last sentence.

Furthermore, the paper by</i> <a href=\"#bib11\"><i>De Bundel et al 2011</i></a> <i>(referred to on page 27) describes that xCT knockout cells are in fact more resistant to against limbic seizures, and 6-OH dopamine lesioning in substantia nigra (Massie et al., FASEB 2011)</i>."

All drugs have idiosyncratic side effects in a small number of patients\u2014some of these are specific to the drug and some are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. We speculate here that the small percentage of patients that exhibit side effects is linked to the lethal mechanism of sorafenib, and specifically that a kinase inhibitor that also inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> would cause a different spectrum of idiosyncratic side effects compared to a kinase inhibitor that does not cause system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition. Previously we demonstrated that none of the other comparison kinase inhibitors triggered ferroptosis. We have collected new data, shown below and incorporated as <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, which demonstrates that none of these comparison kinase inhibitors inhibit glutamate release.

One interpretation of these data is that no drug targeting system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> in vivo would be expected to result in any pronounced physiological effect. Certainly the effects of many drugs are effectively modeled by the corresponding deletion allele in mouse (discussed in Zambrowicz &amp; Sands, 2003 Nat Rev Drug Discovery). However, this need not always be true, especially for drugs that target metabolic networks. This is because metabolic networks frequently contain redundant synthetic routes to the same product (e.g., Kitami &amp; Nadeau, 2002 Nat Genet). Thus, inactivation of a single node can be buffered by the use of alternative pathways to the same end product. In fact, it is clear from our RNA Seq analysis that in response to erastin treatment (\u2192 system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> blockade) cells upregulate a key enzyme in the transsulferation pathway (CBS), which provides an alternative route to the synthesis of cysteine from methionine. While speculative, in the <i>Slc7a11</i> knockout mouse it is likely that compensatory genes (such as Cbs) and pathways (such as transsulfuration) are gradually activated in cells lacking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> function, enabling cell survival. Conversely, acute drug treatment may not allow sufficient time for compensatory upregulation of alternative pathways to occur, resulting in cell death."
