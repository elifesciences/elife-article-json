Here, we used sub-diffraction resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to resolve the in situ molecular organization of proteins within the kidney glomerular basement membrane (GBM), an essential mediator of glomerular ultrafiltration. Using multichannel STORM and STORM-electron microscopy correlation, we constructed a molecular reference frame that revealed a laminar organization of ECM proteins within the GBM. Separate analyses of domains near the N- and C-termini of agrin, laminin, and collagen IV in mouse and human GBM revealed a highly oriented macromolecular organization. Our analysis also revealed disruptions in this GBM architecture in a mouse model of Alport syndrome. These results provide the first nanoscopic glimpse into the organization of a complex ECM."

Here, we used sub-diffraction resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to resolve the in situ molecular organization of proteins within the kidney glomerular basement membrane (GBM), an essential mediator of glomerular ultrafiltration. Using multichannel STORM and STORM-electron microscopy correlation, we constructed a molecular reference frame that revealed a laminar organization of ECM proteins within the GBM. Separate analyses of domains near the N- and C-termini of agrin, laminin, and collagen IV in mouse and human GBM revealed a highly oriented macromolecular organization. Our analysis also revealed disruptions in this GBM architecture in a mouse model of Alport syndrome. These results provide the first nanoscopic glimpse into the organization of a complex ECM."

Filtration is performed inside the kidneys by tufts of small blood vessels called glomeruli. These glomerular capillaries allow water and waste products to pass from the blood into the urine, while holding back proteins and blood cells. The wall of a glomerular capillary consists of two layers of cells flanking a third layer called the glomerular basement membrane. If any of these layers malfunctions, it becomes possible for proteins to pass into the urine. This is a clear sign of kidney disease."

By combining data from STORM and electron microscopy, Suleiman et al. showed that the proteins in the glomerular basement membranes of both species are arranged similarly to form a distinctive layered structure. This suggests that the organization of the basement membrane plays a critical role in its function."

They contain the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), an intricate structure that constitutes the permselective barrier between the bloodstream and the urine. The GFB is organized into three major layers: (1) endothelial cells with fenestrations that line the glomerular capillaries; (2) unique epithelial cells called podocytes that extend many \u2018foot\u2019 processes that interdigitate with those of adjacent podocytes and are linked to each other via a specialized cell/cell junction called the slit diaphragm; and (3) the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), which is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins secreted by the endothelial cells and podocytes that flank it (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miner, 2011</a>). The GFB\u2019s major physiological role is to allow the unimpeded passage of water and small solutes (including metabolic waste products) from the bloodstream into the urinary space, while restricting the passage of plasma proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulins. Although the exact mechanism whereby the GFB functions in this manner is the subject of much controversy, it is clear that injuries or genetic defects in any one of the three layers can cause GFB malfunction that results in increased levels of protein in the urine, a hallmark of diverse kidney diseases. In this study we focus on the ultrastructure and molecular organization of the GBM and its connections to podocytes and endothelial cells."

A great number of biochemical studies of ECM proteins have revealed the molecular basis for their self-assembly and interactions with each other and with cellular receptors (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib62\">Yurchenco, 2011</a>), and detailed structures are available for specific domains of several ECM proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Khoshnoodi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carafoli et al., 2012</a>).

Transmission electron microscopy (EM) studies show electron dense and translucent layers (lamina densa and lamina lucida), but it is unclear whether these reflect an organization of proteins in the GBM (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 1993</a>).

Our data reveal that the GBM is composed of two layers of laminin and agrin molecules, with their N terminal domains oriented towards the center of the GBM. Using transgenic mice expressing a human laminin chain we observed a striking difference in laminin dynamics within the GBM. Results from our imaging approach provide an in situ model of GBM supramolecular organization and align remarkably well with biochemical interactions gleaned from in vitro studies. Finally, we observed distinct distributions of collagen IV molecules and their disruption in a mouse model of Alport syndrome, a hereditary disease of the GBM caused by collagen IV mutations."

The dense protein network within the GBM results in a higher fluorescence background and significant light scattering.

To investigate agrin\u2019s organization in the GBM, we first labeled kidney sections with an antibody to agrinC. In contrast to conventional immunofluorescence images of agrin, STORM resolved two distinct layers of agrinC within the GBM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To quantitatively document agrinC\u2019s distribution, we digitally selected multiple regions across glomeruli. AgrinC localizations in each region were fitted with a double Gaussian distribution, and the mid-position between the peaks was identified from each image and used as a reference to align subsequent regions. The cumulative localizations obtained from 80 regions are displayed as a histogram (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The gap between agrinC layers, measured as the peak-to-peak distance, showed a mean of 137.9 nm \u00b1 1.9 nm standard error of mean (SEM) for the 80 regions; the distance was 132.7 nm (\u00b10.9 nm) across more than 600 GBM regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Dual channel STORM imaging showed that the two layers of agrinC were indeed localized between two layers of podocalyxin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further correlate the STORM molecular localizations, we developed a hybrid STORM-electron microscopy (EM) approach (see schematic in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). After performing STORM, tissue sections attached to the cover glass were subjected to quick-freezing followed by platinum deep-etching (<a href=\"#bib24\">Heuser, 1981</a>). The tissue and cover glass underlying the platinum replicas were dissolved, and the replicas were transferred to a grid for examination by EM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Superimposition of the podocalyxin-agrinC STORM image with deep-etch EM confirmed that podocalyxin labeled endothelial cells as well as podocytes, while agrin was localized to the GBM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). The STORM\u2013EM correlation also confirmed that ultrastructural features of the GFB such as podocyte foot processes and the GBM were well-preserved."

Kidney Tokuyasu sections labeled with anti-podocalyxin and anti-agrinC were initially detected using gold-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by deep-etch EM. Similar to its STORM localizations, anti-podocalyxin labeled both podocyte foot process and endothelial membranes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), but initial attempts to detect agrinC resulted in very sparse labeling. We postulated that the gold-labeled secondary antibody might not efficiently penetrate the GBM. To circumvent this problem, we used a third antibody (goat anti-rabbit) to bridge the primary antibody (rabbit anti-agrinC) and the gold-conjugated antibody (anti-goat). Images generated using this method confirmed the two agrin layers in the GBM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). These data validate the STORM localizations obtained on kidney sections and also confirm the challenges associated with achieving high efficiency immunogold labeling on a highly cross-linked structure such as the GBM."

First, we found that the localization and distribution of two different antibodies to agrinC were nearly identical (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, co-labeling with antibodies to agrinN and agrinC showed that agrinN was present in two layers that were shifted slightly internally to the two agrinC layers, with center positions at \u221257.5 \u00b1 2.8 nm and 50.2 \u00b1 3.28 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This suggests that agrin is oriented either perpendicular or oblique to the plane of the GBM with the C-terminus nearest the adjacent cells, and the N-terminus, which binds the coiled-coil domain of laminin \u03b31, closer to the center of the GBM. The orientation and mapping of agrinC and agrinN to different locations within the GBM is consistent with the distinct molecular interactions of the two agrin domains as well as the \u223c95 nm extended conformation of agrin visualized by EM (<a href=\"#bib14\">Denzer et al., 1998</a>)."

Next, we labeled the short arm of laminin \u03b15 using an antibody raised against the LEb/L4b domain tandem (LM\u03b15-LEb/L4b), also near the center of the heterotrimer. Similar to LM\u03b22-LF, the position of LM\u03b15-LEb/L4b also mapped in the middle of the GBM, at \u22121.8 \u00b1 3.6 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

Our findings that the short arm epitopes from laminin \u03b15 and \u03b22 were located in the middle of the GBM prompted us to investigate the position of the C-terminal LG domain, which binds cell surface receptors such as integrins, dystroglycan, and the Lutheran cell adhesion molecule (<a href=\"#bib46\">Miner, 2005</a>). Because we did not possess an antibody to the mouse LG domain, we made use of transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of human laminin \u03b15, which assembles with mouse laminin \u03b22 and \u03b31 to generate a functional chimeric human/mouse LM-521 trimer (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goldberg et al., 2010</a>)."

As endogenous laminin \u03b15 has been shown to be synthesized by both cell types (<a href=\"#bib57\">St John and Abrahamson, 2001</a>), this is a physiologically relevant approach. An antibody to the C-terminal LG domain of human laminin \u03b15 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Engvall et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tiger et al., 1997</a>) labeled the aspect of the GBM nearest the cell from which laminin \u03b15 was secreted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). The positions of the LM\u03b15-LG domain were calculated at 88.3 \u00b1 3.07 nm towards the podocyte side and \u221284.7 \u00b1 6.7 nm towards the endothelial side. Together with the data for LM\u03b15-LEb/L4b (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), this shows that LM-521 trimers are oriented with their C-terminal LG domains near the outer aspects of the GBM and their N-terminal domains towards the center of the GBM. The most straightforward interpretation is that the GBM\u2019s laminin component is divided into two networks, one produced by podocytes and the other by endothelial cells. The single band seen with the N-terminal antibody in the center of the GBM occurred because the two networks either overlap or are so close to each other that they are indistinguishable by STORM. In the vast majority of glomeruli, we observed that neither podocyte- nor endothelium-derived LM-521 crossed/flipped over, demonstrating that there is limited mobility of laminin trimers across the thickness of the GBM. A similar conclusion was also reported for the endogenous laminin trimer using a different method (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrahamson et al., 2007</a>)."

These chains assemble intracellularly into \u223c400 nm long triple helical heterotrimers (also known as protomers) that are secreted into the ECM, where they polymerize via hexameric NC1 and dodecameric 7S interactions to form a chicken wire-like network one to several chains thick (<a href=\"#bib35\">Khoshnoodi et al., 2008</a>).

We therefore attempted to map ECM protein epitopes within the human GBM to better understand its architecture and compare with the mouse GBM. We first labeled the integrin \u03b21 ectodomain along with agrinC and observed that, similar to mouse GBM, both protein epitopes localized along the endothelial and podocyte surfaces of the human GBM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). It is notable that significantly more agrinC was detected at the podocyte vs the endothelial aspect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>); this could be due to either epitope masking or differences in expression. The peak-to-peak distance of integrin \u03b21 was measured to be 428 \u00b1 14.4 nm, consistent with the known thickness of the human GBM. Given these data, and since two separate anti-integrin \u03b21 antibodies showed similar distributions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we selected integrin \u03b21 as a reference and mapped laminin and collagen IV epitopes. We observed that the anti-LM\u03b15-LG epitope labeled two layers close to the endothelial and podocyte sides of the GBM in a location near the integrin \u03b21 epitope (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, unlike the mouse, where LM\u03b15-LG was restricted to the two sides of the GBM, in human we also observed LM\u03b15-LG towards the central aspect of the GBM. STORM\u2013EM correlation confirmed that the human GBM was intact and the GBM central LM\u03b15-LG localizations could not arise due a poorly preserved GBM or sectioning artifact (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given the inability of cell surface receptors to interact with LM\u03b15-LG domains in these internal sites, it is not clear how internal LM-521 molecules would be organized. We speculate that LN domain interactions with the subepithelial and subendothelial LM-521 networks could be involved."

Both collagen \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV) epitopes were localized at the center of the GBM, with a clear separation from integrin \u03b21. Staining for collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) using an antibody to the N-terminal part of the collagenous domain (<a href=\"#bib16\">Foellmer et al., 1983</a>) showed that it was localized to the endothelial side of the GBM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), consistent with previous results using conventional immunofluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butkowski et al., 1989</a>). Further, co-labeling for \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV)-NC1 and \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) epitopes showed that the two collagen networks had distinct adjacent distributions (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), with the \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) network occupying the space between the central \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV) layer and the endothelial surface of the GBM.

We therefore analyzed a mouse model of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome that lacks the collagen \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV) network due to a <i>Col4a3</i> null mutation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Miner and Sanes, 1996</a>). In both humans and mice, the lack of this network results in a compensatory increase in the expression of collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV), which is normally found at low levels in adult GBM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kashtan and Kim, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Miner and Sanes, 1996</a>). Despite this compensation, the GBM becomes segmentally split and thickened, and this is associated with hematuria, proteinuria, and progressive renal failure (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hudson et al., 2003</a>). To investigate the architecture of the GBM in this disease model, we examined the organization of agrinC and collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV). In contrast to the wild-type GBM, the Alport GBM showed segments of capillary loops where the two layered organization of agrinC was disrupted, while in some segments it was intact (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). The localization of collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) was also altered, with its distribution spread across the width of the GBM and no longer restricted to the endothelial side. This altered collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) distribution was evident even in capillary loop segments that showed a relatively preserved agrinC organization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Thus, we conclude that an intact collagen \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV) network helps to maintain agrin and collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) organization in the healthy GBM."

Single molecule probe based methods (F)PALM and STORM were originally developed using photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betzig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hess et al., 2006</a>) or photoswitching properties of fluorescent dyes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rust et al., 2006</a>). Exogenous expression of multiple photoswitchable fusion proteins and their functional validation is not yet feasible for studying multi-protein complexes in mammalian tissues. Using a number of well characterized antibodies provides a practical alternative for tissue imaging. Thus, we focused on using photoswitchable dye-conjugated antibody labeling for our experiments. Fluorescence imaging of tissue also presents special challenges, mainly regarding the methods of fixation, labeling, sectioning and the method of electron microscopic correlation. Sub-diffraction microscopy methods typically map the positions of labeled proteins; however, putting these in the context of membranes and other ultrastructures requires EM. Recently, a few studies have described super-resolution imaging of photoswitchable fusion proteins expressed in cultured cells and in <i>C. elegans</i>, followed by plastic embedding and EM correlation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betzig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Watanabe et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kopek et al., 2012</a>). Conventional fluorescence microscopy of resin embedded tissue sections labeled with antibodies has also been described (<a href=\"#bib45\">Micheva and Smith, 2007</a>). Here, we tested a variety of fixation methods, sectioning thicknesses and electron microscopic approaches. Our best results were obtained when we collected 200-nm thickness Tokuyasu cryosections directly onto a coverglass. Since the Tokuyasu method was originally developed for the preparation of tissue for EM imaging, we were able to use freeze etch EM after STORM, to produce correlated images. We believe that the method described here is a breakthrough as it should be useful for the imaging of a wide variety of other tissues."

We showed that agrin and laminin-521 each form two layers within the mouse GBM. In each layer, both proteins were oriented with their C-terminal LG domains close to the adjacent cell membranes, whereas the more N-terminal laminin short arm epitopes and the agrin N-terminus were localized towards the interior of the GBM. Cell culture and biochemical data support these observations: the LG domains of laminin \u03b15 and agrin are known to interact with cell surface receptors (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin and Sanes, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yurchenco et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kikkawa et al., 2007</a>), and the agrin N-terminal domain interacts with laminin \u03b31 near the center of the coiled-coil domain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kammerer et al., 1999</a>). But the \u223c140 nm vertical axis of laminin must be reconciled with our definitive demonstration in mouse that there are two separate networks that meet in the middle of the GBM; the \u223c200 nm wide mouse GBM cannot contain two fully extended laminin trimers, which would approach a 300 nm span. Models predicting either a bent laminin conformation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yurchenco et al., 2004</a>) or an extended laminin situated at an oblique angle relative to the adjacent cells would be consistent with our data."

In contrast, both agrinC and LM\u03b15LG localized near integrin \u03b21, implicating them as the likely biologically relevant ligands. At the endothelial aspect of the GBM, collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) was near enough to the cell to be capable of binding integrin \u03b21. In our Alport syndrome mouse model, which lacks the collagen \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV) network, collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) was found at increased levels throughout the width of the GBM. One implication of this is that podocytes should be exposed to unfamiliar collagen IV ligands, which might then lead to podocyte injury and the glomerulosclerosis that is observed in the disease."

The secreted collagen \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV) protomers are thus likely able to permeate through the LM-521 and agrin networks adjacent to the podocyte, against the flow of filtrate, to reach the center of the GBM. Given the greater thickness of the human vs the mouse GBM, this process should either be faster or persist for a longer period in human glomeruli. In contrast, the collagen \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12(IV) protomers made by endothelial cells form a network closely juxtaposed to the endothelium. These different collagen IV protomer behaviors may be fundamental to establishing and maintaining the GBM and could be related to its splitting and thickening in the setting of Alport syndrome."

Selected regions were rotated to uniformly orient the podocyte and endothelial sides. STORM localizations from agrinC and a co-labeled molecule, were projected onto the perpendicular axis for each region and fitted with Gaussian functions to identify the centroid positions of the STORM localizations. The midpoint between the two agrinC centroid positions was set as zero and the position of the second molecule of interest was identified by the distance of its centroid position with respect to the zero. This procedure was iterated over multiple regions to estimate the mean position, standard error of the mean and standard deviation for each molecule. To view the quantitative profile of STORM localizations, a histogram was generated from each region by projecting localization points onto a line perpendicular to the long axis of the capillary loop. Each histogram was shifted to align them by their zero position and an accumulated histogram from several regions was constructed by adding up all localizations.

Using probes targeting different proteins (and in some cases different domains of the same protein) the authors investigate their relative distributions and show that the ECM in these cells is much more organized than generally believed. Overall this is a very well executed study with data of very high quality. In particular, it represents one of the few sub-diffraction imaging papers published to date, which utilized robust morphometric measurements. It is of interest to scientists involved in high resolution imaging, investigating the basement membrane, and nephrologists. However there are some issues that should be addressed before publication."

Using 4% PFA/PBS fixation with Tokuyasu\u2019s embedding method (90% sucrose/10% PVP) not only allowed us to cut thin sections, but also appeared to preserve antigenicity, as compared with 4% PFA/PBS fixation using alternate embedding media where we were unable to cut sections thinner than 1 \u03bcm.

When we used the C terminal LG domain (human transgene derived) antibody, we identified a band of localizations on each side of this central region. We interpret both sets of data to mean that there are two Laminin layers, with the N termini either overlapping or so close to each other near the middle of the GBM that they are indistinguishable by STORM, and the C termini facing away from the center, allowing us to distinguish the two layers. The contention that there are two separate networks does rely on cell specific expression of the human Laminin \u03b15 transgene, and we are happy to clarify how this conclusion was made. This is consistent with published work showing that both endothelial cells and podocytes synthesize Laminin \u03b15-containing trimers (St. John et al., 2001) and that these trimers remain associated with their cellular origin (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrahamson et al., 2007</a>).
