However, dopamine contribution to the modification of neural representation is largely unknown. Using in vivo two-photon population Ca2<sup>+</sup> imaging in awake mice, I investigated how neural representation of visual input to PFC neurons is regulated by dopamine. Phasic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) evoked prolonged Ca2<sup>+</sup> transients, lasting ~30 seconds in layer 2/3 neurons of PFC, which are regulated by dopamine D1 receptor-dependent pathway. Furthermore, only a conditioning protocol with visual sensory input applied 0.5 second before the VTA dopaminergic input could evoke enhanced Ca2<sup>+</sup> transients and increased pattern similarity (or establish a neural representation) of PFC neurons to the same sensory input. By increasing both the level of neuronal response and pattern similarity, dopaminergic input may establish robust and reliable cortical representation."
