Studies of microbes, which live in complex communities that contain hundreds of interacting species, have taught us much about the dynamics of this struggle (<a href=\"#bib10\">Vetsigian et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, we have recently learned that entire microbial communities can behave as cohesive structures, responding to change and challenge as if each community was a single organism. In the case of fecal transplants, for example, when a healthy microbial community is introduced into the bowel of a sick patient, we often observe the new community outcompeting the resident community responsible for the disease (<a href=\"#bib3\">Khoruts et al., 2010</a>)."

Within a single community, however, many chemical, physical and ecological processes happen simultaneously. Given the sheer number of processes at work when two communities compete, predicting the outcome of a competition event from the bottom up is daunting. Even so, sophisticated computational models may provide a route toward making such predictions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Klitgord and Segr\u00e8, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Freilich et al., 2011</a>)."

In the model, environments are uniform and contain multiple resources. The species that populate these environments are distinguished only by the resources they can use and by the price they pay for using those resources. Each species may consume one or many resources, although consuming more resources comes at an increasing cost. Critically, the model permits no cooperation between species: they can only compete with each other for resources."

You might expect that the species with the lowest nutrient costs for reproduction would come to dominate the community at equilibrium. But because the growth of each species depends on the other species present in the community, things turn out differently. For example, a species that can grow efficiently on a resource for which there is high demand from other species will ultimately be forced to share that resource, thus slowing its growth. However, a specialized species that can grow and reproduce slowly on a little-used resource will eventually flourish."

Note that fitness is defined by the ability to consume resources; therefore otherwise low-performing individuals can form a high-fitness community as long as they consume all the resources in the environment. When species from both groups are grown together in a new environment, species from the low fitness community are more likely to go extinct, resulting in the cohesion of the high fitness community even when the interactions between species in the high-fitness community are purely competitive."

Instead, the overall fitness of each initial community is a much better predictor of the composition of the final combined community. For example, a community composed of low-performing species that exhaustively depletes resources in its environment outcompetes a community of high-performing species that uses resources poorly. Tikhonov shows that this is a direct consequence of interactions that cause organisms to influence their environment because this alters the fitness of individual species regardless of how well they perform in a random environment. For example, if a community contains a species that drives a specific resource to very low levels, the presence of this species `constructs\u2019 an environment for other species in the community where this resource level is low. Thus, remarkably, communities cohere even when all the species in the community selfishly compete with each other. At present it is not known if the mechanism proposed by Tikhonov for community cohesion is at play in real-world processes like fecal transplants, but this is an important avenue for future work."

Tikhonov\u2019s model makes this metaphor mathematically exact. In particular, the changing abundances of different species in the community act in the same way as regulated metabolic pathways act within a single organism as it responds to changes in the availability of resources."

In the future, with sequencing data now available on microbial communities in virtually any setting, our search for the signatures of community cohesion during competition will be guided by theory."
