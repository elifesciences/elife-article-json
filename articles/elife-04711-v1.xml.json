We show that larval <i>Drosophila</i> not only remember the value of reinforcement (How much?), but also its quality (What?). This is demonstrated both within the appetitive domain by using sugar vs amino acid as different reward qualities, and within the aversive domain by using bitter vs high-concentration salt as different qualities of punishment. From the available literature, such nuanced memories for the quality of reinforcement are unexpected and pose a challenge to present models of how insect memory is organized. Given that animals as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, endowed with but 10,000 neurons, operate with both reinforcement value and quality, we suggest that both are fundamental aspects of mnemonic processing\u2014in any brain."

We show that larval <i>Drosophila</i> not only remember the value of reinforcement (How much?), but also its quality (What?). This is demonstrated both within the appetitive domain by using sugar vs amino acid as different reward qualities, and within the aversive domain by using bitter vs high-concentration salt as different qualities of punishment. From the available literature, such nuanced memories for the quality of reinforcement are unexpected and pose a challenge to present models of how insect memory is organized. Given that animals as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, endowed with but 10,000 neurons, operate with both reinforcement value and quality, we suggest that both are fundamental aspects of mnemonic processing\u2014in any brain."

To date, little use has been made of insect memory experiments to reveal these capacities, in particular regarding reinforcement. For example, after experiencing an odor with a sugar reward, fruit flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) approach that odor in a later test. All the known circuitry (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heisenberg, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Perisse et al., 2013</a>) of such learned search behavior suggests that this is because the odor has acquired positive value; that is, that the flies are expecting to find \u2018something good\u2019 in its vicinity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heisenberg, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Schleyer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Perisse et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, <i>Drosophila</i> can associate an odor with an electric-shock punishment. This supports their learned escape in a later test because they may expect \u2018something bad\u2019 with the odor. In other words, the only feature of reinforcement processing that insects are granted is value. We show that larval <i>Drosophila</i> are in a defined sense richer than this in their mnemonic capacity: they also recall of what particular quality that good or bad experience was. Given the numerical simplicity of the larval brain, this is suggested to be a more basic property of brains than hitherto assumed."

In this Petri dish assay, larvae are placed onto a tasteless agarose substrate. This substrate is supplemented with a fructose sugar reward\u2014if odorant A is presented. Odorant B is presented without the reward (A+/B). For a companion group of larvae, contingencies are reversed (A/B+). In a binary choice test, the larvae then systematically approach the previously rewarded odorant (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This behavior, quantified as a positive associative performance index (PI) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), can best be grasped as a memory-based search for reward: if the test is performed in the presence of fructose, the learned approach is abolished (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Schleyer et al., 2011</a>) (olfactory behavior per se is not affected: see below). This is adaptive as learned search behavior is indeed obsolete in the presence of a sought-for item. We have previously shown (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schleyer et al., 2011</a>) that regardless of the absolute concentration of fructose, such an abolishment is seen if the fructose concentration in the test substrate is equal to or higher than that used in training. This means that learned behavior is based on a relative assessment: the larvae recall how strong the training reward was and compare this remembered strength to the current testing situation. Only if that comparison promises a gain (remembered strength &gt; current strength) do they search for what they can thus expect to gain at the odor source. We note that widely applied formal learning models of the Rescorla-Wagner type (<a href=\"#bib26\">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</a>) propose that memory acquisition will only occur if something new and unexpected happens, specifically if the experienced reward is stronger than predicted on the basis of memory (current strength &gt; remembered strength). Thus, the same two pieces of information are compared during memory acquisition on the one hand and the expression of learned search behavior on the other hand\u2014yet in a \u2018swapped\u2019 way. This can inform the animals respectively about what is new or what there is to be gained. Here, we ask whether these processes are integrated across different qualities of reward into one common scale of appetitive value or whether separate systems exist to confer mnemonic specificity for the \u2018quality\u2019 of reward."

Concentrations of aspartic acid and fructose are chosen such that their reward value is equal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This allows us to study the larvae under test conditions that are of equal reward value but that either match or do not match the \u2018quality\u2019 of reward that has been employed during training. If the larvae merely searched for a reward of remembered value, learned search behavior should cease in both cases\u2014because current strength matches remembered strength in both cases. If reward quality were the sole determinant for learned search, in contrast, learned search should be abolished only when test and training substrate match in quality, but should remain intact when quality does not match. If the larvae searched for a reward specified both by its value and by its quality, scores in the mismatch case should be partially abolished: in that case, the reward's value is as sought yet its quality is not. We find that learned search is fully abolished when the training and test reward match in both value and quality but remains partially intact (by 68%) if there is a mismatch in reward quality between training and test (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We conclude that after odor-fructose training the larvae approach the odor both in search of something \u2018good\u2019 (value) and in search of what is specifically fructose (quality of reward). Likewise, after odor-aspartic acid training, they search both for something \u2018good\u2019 and for aspartic acid.

In this case, learned behavior can best be understood as an informed escape that is warranted in the presence but not in the absence of quinine. Accordingly, in the presence but not in the absence of quinine one observes that the larvae run away from the previously punished odor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerber and Hendel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Schleyer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">El-Keredy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Apostolopoulou et al., 2014</a>) (see also <a href=\"#bib22\">Niewalda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Schnaitmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eschbach et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Russell et al., 2011</a> for reports using other aversive reinforcers and/or adult flies). Notably and in accordance with our earlier results in the appetitive domain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schleyer et al., 2011</a>), such learned escape does not merely depend on the concentration of quinine in the test; rather, learned escape lessens as the quinine concentration in the test is reduced <i>relative</i> to that in training (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

For concentrations of quinine and salt that are of equal value as punishment, this is indeed the case (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure Supplement 2</a>); likewise, odor-salt memories are specific in prompting learned escape from salt but not from quinine (for a summary see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Odors are coded combinatorially across the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN, blue). In the antennal lobe, these sensory neurons signal towards local interneurons (not shown) and projection neurons (PN, deep blue). Projection neurons have two target areas, the lateral horn (LH, orange) mediating innate approach, and the mushroom body (MB, yellow). Reinforcement signals (green and red for appetitive and aversive reinforcement, respectively) from the gustatory system reach the mushroom body, leading to associative memory traces in simultaneously activated mushroom body neurons. In the present analysis, this sketch focuses selectively on five broad classes of chemosensory behavior, namely innate odor approach, learned odor search and escape, as well as appetitive and aversive innate gustatory behavior. The boxed region is displayed in detail in (<b>B</b>\u2013<b>C</b>). The break in the connection between mushroom body output and behavior is intended to acknowledge that mushroom body output is probably not in itself sufficient as a (pre-) motor signal but rather exerts a modulatory effect on weighting between behavioral options (<a href=\"#bib30\">Schleyer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Menzel, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al., 2014</a>).

In a functionally separate compartment, a punishment neuron summing quinine and salt signals likewise establishes a memory trace for learned escape from \u2018bad\u2019. This scenario cannot account for quality-of-reinforcement memory. (<b>C</b>) Reinforcement processing by both value and quality: in addition to a common, value-specific appetitive memory, fructose and aspartic acid drive discrete reward signals leading to discrete memory traces in at least functionally distinct compartments of the Kenyon cells, which can be independently turned into learned search. For aversive memory, there may be only quality-specific punishment signals. This scenario is in accordance with the present data."

Appropriate to such nuanced memories, the mushroom bodies show a fairly complex substructure, even in larval <i>Drosophila</i>. At least 10 mushroom body regions are recognized, defined by the tiled innervation of input and output neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pauls et al., 2010b</a>). Our behavioral data suggest that at least five such tiles of the mushroom body would be required to accommodate learned search for fructose or aspartic acid, learned escape from quinine or from high-concentration salt and in addition a less specific appetitive value-memory (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Clearly the things worth remembering for a larva include many more than these five (<a href=\"#bib22\">Niewalda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Pauls et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eschbach et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Khurana et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rohwedder et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Diegelmann et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, the behavioral repertoire of larvae may be considerably greater than thought (<a href=\"#bib35\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>). Using our current approach, it will now be possible to systematically determine the limits of specificity in the processing of reinforcement quality. This may reveal signals of intermediate specificity to inform the animals about, for example, edibility, caloric value, proteinogenic value, suitability for pupariation, toxicity, or even acutely and situationally modulated matters of concern (<a href=\"#bib33\">Simpson et al., 2015</a>)."

On the other hand, reward expectations can apparently also be processed in a quality-specific manner (e.g., <a href=\"#bib6\">Dickinson and Balleine, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Watanabe, 1996</a>). In terms of the minimally required number of cells, the processing by reinforcer quality is more demanding than value-only processing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). The fact that even the humble, 10,000-neuron brain of a larva operates with both reward value and quality may suggest that they both represent fundamentally important, indispensable aspects of reward processing."

This is an important finding that opens up mechanistic studies on the coding of reinforcing stimuli in this very small nervous system of the larvae.

The weakness of this kind of thinking degrades the interesting and important data reported here. Therefore, we suggest removing <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>.
