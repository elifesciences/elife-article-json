The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/\u03a83 required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/\u03a83 was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg<sup>2+</sup>. SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3'UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/\u03a83, leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication."
