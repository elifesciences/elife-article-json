Here, we identify gut microbiota as sufficient to induce depressive-like behaviors in genetically distinct mouse strains. Daily gavage of vehicle (dH2O) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice induced a social avoidance behavior that was not observed in C57BL/6 mice. This was not observed in NOD animals with depleted microbiota via oral administration of antibiotics. Transfer of intestinal microbiota, including members of the Clostridiales, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>, from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to microbiota-depleted C57BL/6 recipients was sufficient to induce social avoidance and change gene expression and myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Metabolomic analysis identified increased cresol levels in these mice, and exposure of cultured oligodendrocytes to this metabolite prevented myelin gene expression and differentiation. Our results thus demonstrate that the gut microbiota modifies the synthesis of key metabolites affecting gene expression in the prefrontal cortex, thereby modulating social behavior."

Here, we identify gut microbiota as sufficient to induce depressive-like behaviors in genetically distinct mouse strains. Daily gavage of vehicle (dH2O) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice induced a social avoidance behavior that was not observed in C57BL/6 mice. This was not observed in NOD animals with depleted microbiota via oral administration of antibiotics. Transfer of intestinal microbiota, including members of the Clostridiales, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>, from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to microbiota-depleted C57BL/6 recipients was sufficient to induce social avoidance and change gene expression and myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Metabolomic analysis identified increased cresol levels in these mice, and exposure of cultured oligodendrocytes to this metabolite prevented myelin gene expression and differentiation. Our results thus demonstrate that the gut microbiota modifies the synthesis of key metabolites affecting gene expression in the prefrontal cortex, thereby modulating social behavior."

The experiments show that introducing specific combinations of bacteria into the gut is indeed able to cause healthy adult mice to avoid social interactions. This effect was caused by changes in the \u201cmyelin\u201d sheath that surrounds many nerve fibers and could be prevented by giving the mice antibiotics, which decreased the number of bacteria in the gut."

Gacias et al. found that cresol is able to reduce the amount of myelin produced by brain cells. Therefore, these findings show that changing the communities of bacteria in the gut can result in the accumulation of molecules that influence social behavior. Future work will aim to identify bacteria that can reduce the amount of cresol produced in the gut, which may have the potential to treat depression."

In addition to genetic predisposition, there is extensive epidemiologic literature emphasizing the role of environmental exposure in the development of mild to severe mood disorders. The aftermath of traumatic life events, for instance, is often characterized by the onset of severe depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shalev et al., 1998</a>). The interplay between genes and environmental variables has gained recent attention, and several immunologic and lifestyle contributors have been proposed to modulate depressive symptoms. The detection of high levels of serum cytokines and the higher incidence of depression in patients with autoimmune disorders (<a href=\"#bib54\">Postal and Appenzeller, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Walker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Moll et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">van Hees et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Feinstein et al., 2014</a>) has suggested a role for neuroinflammation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Godbout et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Menard et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Audet et al., 2014</a>).

Indeed, psychiatric comorbidities often accompany conditions characterized by an aberrant gut microbiota composition, such as irritable bowel syndrome, functional gastrointestinal disorder, and inflammatory bowel disease (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gevers et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Morgan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Haberman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Addolorato et al., 1997</a>). Conversely, altered gut microbiota composition and function have been reported in patients with major depressive disorders and children with autism (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">De Angelis et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Angelis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Parracho et al., 2005</a>). The gut microbiota is a complex microbial ecosystem that rapidly responds to environmental changes and can modulate brain development, function, and behavior (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Collins et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Desbonnet et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bercik et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Daniel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lax et al., 2014</a>). These studies suggest that social behavior may be affected by abnormal interactions between gut microbiota and the brain, though the underlying mechanisms remain only partially understood."

Myelination is a dynamic process that continues into adulthood and contributes to physiologic brain function (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Makinodan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">S\u00e1nchez et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gibson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">McKenzie et al., 2014</a>). Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and neuropathologic and transcriptomic studies have reported downregulated oligodendroglial transcripts and reduced myelin thickness in the brains of patients with schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tkachev et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Katsel et al., 2005</a>). These data highlight the role of myelin in mental illness and depressive-like behaviors, though it remains to be established whether myelination in the adult PFC and social behavior are affected by alterations in gut microbiota composition. This study characterizes the gut microbiota in mice with social avoidance behavior and demonstrates that transfer of specific bacterial taxa is sufficient to alter adult PFC myelination and results in behavioral changes consistent with a depressive-like phenotype."

Daily gastric gavage with vehicle for two weeks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) was sufficient to induce social avoidance behavior in NOD mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), without affecting their overall locomotor activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This depressive-like behavior induced by daily gavage was dependent on the specific mouse strain, as C57BL/6 mice were not affected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moy et al., 2008</a>). Subcutaneous injection of vehicle did not elicit any behavioral effect in either strain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Daily gastric gavage with an antibiotic cocktail proven to deplete the gut microbiota (<a href=\"#bib57\">Reikvam et al., 2011</a>) failed to induce the social avoidance behavior in NOD mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and similarly had no effect on the C57BL/6 mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The antibiotic regimen was well tolerated by both NOD and C57BL/6 mice, did not impact body weight or glucose levels, and did not result in any gastric hemorrhage or visible stomach damage (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Consistent with previous reports, only chronic oral antibiotic treatment (but not subcutaneous delivery) induced enlargement of the large intestine (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), a macroscopic sign associated with microbiota depletion (<a href=\"#bib57\">Reikvam et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, daily gavage also induced an anxiety-like behavior in both NOD and C57BL/6 mice, as revealed by the elevated plus maze (EPM) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). However, the anxiety-like behavioral change displayed in response to daily gavage was not affected by oral antibiotic treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>), suggesting that only the depressive-like behavior is mediated by alterations in gut microbiota. To further validate this hypothesis, we conducted the forced swim test (FST), which is considered a measure of despair-like behavior, in NOD and C57BL/6 mice after daily gavage with either vehicle or antibiotics. The despair-like behavior was induced by vehicle gavage in the NOD strain, and was prevented by oral antibiotic treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), but was not detected in the C57BL/6 mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Together, these results indicate that daily gavage of vehicle induces social avoidance and despair-like behaviors in NOD mice, but not in C57BL/6 mice, and that this effect is not observed when gavaging antibiotics orally and not subcutaneously."

Unweighted UniFrac distances (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lozupone and Knight, 2005</a>) were calculated between all pairs of fecal samples based on their microbiota composition. Based on these distances, Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), an ordination method conceptually similar to principal component analysis, revealed a clear separation between vehicle-gavaged and baseline NOD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and between vehicle and antibiotic treated NOD and C57BL/6 mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). PCoA analysis revealed clear differences between NOD mice before (\u201cbaseline\u201d) and after oral treatment with antibiotics (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), with differences also observed between samples before and after treatment with vehicle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Since the depressive-like behavior was only observed in oral vehicle-treated NOD mice, we focused on identifying the specific microbiota that differ in these animals before and after treatment. Analysis of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs, defined as groups of 16S rRNA gene sequences with high similarity and that broadly correspond to a bacterial species) identified several taxonomic groups that were exclusively found in the vehicle-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Gacias et al., 2016</a>). These taxa represent potential candidates associated with the depressive-like phenotype observed in NOD mice. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Segata et al., 2011</a>), a biomarker discovery method based on the Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Wilcoxon tests, was used to identify key bacterial taxa enriched in vehicle-treated versus antibiotic-treated animals in each strain (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). As expected, Proteobacteria were enriched in antibiotic-treated animals, while vehicle-treated mice had enrichment in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,E</a>)."

This analysis revealed decreased expression of genes related to myelination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig4s2\">2</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Gacias et al., 2016</a>) in vehicle-gavaged NOD mice - characterized by social avoidance behavior - compared to antibiotic-treated mice, whose behavior was comparable to baseline controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The differences in myelin gene transcripts in the mPFC of vehicle-gavaged NOD compared to antibiotic-treated mice were validated by quantitative real-time qPCR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These differences were detected only in NOD mice, and not in C57BL/6 mice that showed no change in social behavior with oral gavage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). The differences in myelin gene expression in the mPFC could not be attributed to a nonspecific effect of antibiotic treatment, as there were no differences observed after subcutaneous delivery (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The regional specificity of the transcriptional changes was also assessed in NOD mice by evaluating samples from a distinct brain region, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), revealing no difference in the two treatment groups (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data provide further support for the relationship between defective mPFC adult myelination and depressive-like behavior, as indicated by the lower levels of myelin transcripts and reduced area of MBP immunostaining in vehicle-gavaged NOD mice exhibiting social avoidance. The results also demonstrate that the transcriptional and behavioral effects were prevented by oral antibiotic treatment."

Social behavior in C57BL/6 depleted recipients was assessed before and after transplantation with microbiota from either vehicle-gavaged (Group I) or antibiotic-gavaged (Group II) NOD donors. The behavior of the C57BL/6 recipients resembled that of the donors: Social avoidance behavior was detected in Group I recipients, and was not observed in Group II recipients (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Intriguingly, transplantation of vehicle-gavaged NOD microbiota also transferred the transcriptional changes in the mPFC, but not in the NAc, as shown by the lower levels of myelin gene transcripts (<i>Mag, Mog, Plp1, Mobp</i>) in Group I mice compared to Group II recipients (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The functional consequences of the transcriptional changes in myelin genes were further validated by electron microscopy, and ultrastructural analysis revealed decreased myelin thickness in Group I recipients displaying a social avoidance behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Quantification of myelin thickness relative to axonal diameter (<i>g</i> ratio) revealed that Group I recipients transplanted with vehicle-gavaged NOD microbiota, presented thinner myelin than Group II, recipients of antibiotic-treated NOD donors. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in the NAc (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The transfer of depressive-like behavior from donor to recipient was further validated by the detection of increased immobility at the FST in Group I mice compared to Group II (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "The genomic DNA content was measured in fecal pellets of C57BL/6 recipients to validate the depletion of the gut microbiota with 14 days of antibiotic treatment, and to evaluate the effectiveness of recolonization after transplantation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>). Analysis of alpha diversity (the number of bacterial taxa present in a sample or group of samples) further confirmed the microbiota depletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E</a>). In both groups, diversity was significantly reduced from baseline after antibiotic treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E</a>; p&lt;0.01 ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s honest significant difference (HSD) post-hoc analysis). As expected, after transplantation Group II mice still exhibited a significantly depleted diversity compared to baseline (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; p&lt;0.01 ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s HSD), while bacterial diversity in Group I had recovered to levels similar to baseline and was not significantly different (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; p=0.09, ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s HSD). These results suggested that transfer of behavioral traits was associated with restoration of bacterial diversity to baseline levels. In order to determine the differences in microbiota compositions associated with the behavioral phenotype, we conducted PCoA analysis based on unweighted UniFrac analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Although all pooled fecal samples from NOD donors and C57BL/6 recipients clustered together at baseline (samples on the right side of the plot), treatment with antibiotics resulted in a drastic reshaping of the bacterial communities of both NOD (middle of the plot) and C57BL/6 (bottom-left side) mice. The microbiota composition of Group II mice after transplant (which did not display social avoidance behavior) was distinct from baseline, similar to antibiotic-treated animals pre-transplant (top-left side). However, Group I recipients which displayed social avoidance behavior (#19 and #18 on the plot), had compositions that were close to those of their vehicle-treated NOD donors. In contrast, Group I recipients which did not display social avoidance behavior (#17 on the plot), clustered with Group II recipients. This result suggests that the transplant procedure was not equally effective in all Group I mice. The distance in microbiota composition between vehicle-gavaged donors and recipients was significantly correlated with the social avoidance behavior, as measured by social interaction time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>; p=0.01). This result suggests that the ability to successfully transfer the gut microbiota from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors was significantly correlated with the transmission of the depressive-like behavior. LEfSe analysis revealed a number of taxa that were significantly different between Group I and Group II C57BL/6 recipients (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Gacias et al., 2016</a>). We further refined this analysis, by identifying the specific OTUs transferred from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to Group I recipients (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Gacias et al., 2016</a>). Members of the Clostridiales order, including <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>, were among those present in equal proportions both in the donors and the recipients in Group I recipients displaying a depressive-like behavior (i.e. samples #18 and #19), while absent in Group I recipients that did not exhibit such behavior (i.e. sample#17; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Gacias et al., 2016</a>). We further confirmed these taxa as potentially responsible for this phenotype by qPCR using primers specific to these bacterial groups (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). In order to identify differences undetectable at the OTU level, we performed oligotype analysis in those OTUs established as potentially responsible for the depressive-like behavior (<a href=\"#bib61\">Segata et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Eren et al., 2014</a>). Oligotype analysis is an entropy-based method to identify single nucleotide differences in sequences from closely related organisms. We found that most OTUs were composed of a single high-abundance oligotype (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C,E,G\u2013O</a>) and therefore support the conclusions from the OTU-level analysis. However, we identified three OTUs that had two oligotypes with similar abundances and distribution across samples: OTU 183849 (<i>Blautia producta</i>, a member of the Lachnospiraceae, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>), 188840 (unidentified member within <i>Lachnospiraceae,</i> <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>), and 4418586 (unidentified member within Clostridiales, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3P</a>). Additional inspection of these sequences revealed the oligotypes GTT and TTT from the <i>Blautia producta</i> OTU, as well as the TG and TT oligotypes from the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> OTU, had <i>B. producta</i> JCM 1471 as the closest reference sequence in NCBI; the oligotypes from Clostridiales had no close reference sequence. Overall, these results show that either a single oligotype or a combination of two oligotypes with similar abundance distributions were dominant within the analyzed OTUs, which suggested they might drive the observed social phenotypes."

To determine whether altered taxa in the gut microbiota could impact the levels of metabolites, which in turn drive behavioral and transcriptional changes observed in the mPFC, we performed an unbiased metabolomic analysis of gut tissue from C57BL/6 recipients with (Group I) and without (Group II) social avoidance behavior (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The analysis included non-targeted and targeted protocols and gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry, hydrophilic liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry and hydrophilic interaction chromatography with liquid chromatography and tandem mass-spectrometry for the study of monoamine to neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tolstikov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Danaceau et al., 2012</a>). After statistical corrections and normalization, we conducted Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), a method that incorporates elements from principal component analysis, regression, and linear discriminant analysis, which revealed a clear separation of the overall gut metabolites between Group I and Group II (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A total of 382 metabolites were detected in the guts of C57BL/6 transplant recipients (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gacias et al., 2016</a>) A first pathway impact analysis provided a visual representation of the most dramatically affected pathways between the two groups, and identified the linoleic/linolenic acid and phenylalanine/tryptophan synthetic pathways as differentially represented in the two sets of samples (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Gacias et al., 2016</a>). Further evaluation of the metabolome using a volcano plot representing individual differences in metabolites revealed increased levels of cresol, stearamide, N-acetylasparagine, and oleamide in Group I recipients, which displayed social avoidance and despair-like behaviors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). As cresol is a highly permeable compound that was detected at high levels in the guts of Group I mice characterized by behavioral changes and impaired mPFC myelination, we treated primary cultured oligodendrocyte progenitors with increasing concentrations of cresol and tested for myelin gene expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Expression of <i>Mag, Mog, Mbp</i>, and <i>Cnp</i> transcripts and the number of double-positive CNP+/OLIG2+ cells were reduced incresol-treated cultures compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). However, this effect was not due to toxicity, but rather to impaired differentiation, as indicated by the increased transcripts of immature progenitor markers (<i>Pdgfra</i>) and the stable OLIG2+ cell counts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>)."

In our study, anxiety-like behaviors were also shown to be affected by daily gastric manipulations affecting microbiota composition. However, social avoidance and despair-like behaviors were differentially induced by gavage in two genetically distinct strains of mice, which could be prevented by the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail. Daily gavage of NOD mice induced significant changes of gut bacterial communities and depressive-like behavior (social and despair-like behaviors), which was associated with enrichment of bacteria within the Clostridiales. Antibiotic treatment decreased the overall bacterial diversity and prevented the behavioral effects. Subcutaneous administration of the same antibiotic treatment failed to induce significant changes either in the microbiota composition or behavior, further highlighting the importance of a local effect of oral antibiotic treatment on these intestinal microbial communities."

Our results demonstrate that only recipients with successful recolonization of the taxa enriched in the vehicle-treated NOD mice (e.g. Clostridiales, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>) exhibited the social avoidance and despair-like behaviors, as well as the myelin gene expression in the mPFC of the donors. These transcriptional changes resulted in decreased adult PFC myelination in mice with transferred behavior. The microbiota of these C57BL/6 recipients showed significant differences in the abundance of several of the bacterial populations identified in the donors. Interestingly, alterations of some <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> spp. have been associated with behavioral deficits in mice (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bruce-Keller et al., 2015</a>). Our results did not identify a single bacterium responsible for the behavioral changes induced by vehicle-gavage in the NOD mice or by transplantation in the C57Bl6 animals, suggesting that specific communities enriched in taxa from the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> are responsible for the observed phenotype. Community-driven effects have also been reported in the induction of colonic regulatory T cells by specific mixtures of Clostridia strains in models of colitis or in cognitive and stereotypic behavioral changes induced by high-fat diet microbiota in non-obese mice (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bruce-Keller et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Atarashi et al., 2015</a>)."

Microbiota composition has previously been shown to modulate anxiety-like behaviors in adult mice via changes in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bercik et al., 2011</a>). The results of our untargeted transcriptomic analysis of the mPFC, the region responsible for the integration of external stimuli and complex behaviors (<a href=\"#bib56\">Regenold et al., 2006</a>), identified a signature characterized by genes regulating transcription, circadian rhythm, protein phosphorylation, synapses, and myelin. Altered expression of genes related to myelin and circadian rhythm is consistent with reported white matter changes and sleep disruption in human patients with major depression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Landgraf et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lavebratt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kishi et al., 2009</a>) as well as with the reported behavioral changes detected on myelin mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hagemeyer et al., 2012</a>).

                        "text": "One mechanism by which the gut microbiota may regulate such alterations is through the production of selective metabolites. Several recent studies have shown that a dysbiotic gut microbiota can produce neurotoxic metabolites directly impacting behavior (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hsiao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Persico and Napolioni, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shaw, 2010</a>). For instance, in a mouse model for autism spectrum disorders during development, characterized by dysregulation of <i>Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae</i> the anxiety-like phenotype correlated with the levels of the metabolite 4-ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hsiao et al., 2013</a>). In our study, social avoidance behavior in adult mice was significantly associated with enrichment in <i>Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae</i> and Clostridiales and thedetection of high levels of cresol. This highly permeable metabolite was detected only in the gut of mice with social avoidance behavior, and was capable of preventing myelin gene expression and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into myelin-forming cells. These results suggest a potential mechanism linking CNS transcriptional changes to gut microbial homeostasis. Thereby increased intestinal production of cresol could be responsible for the behavioral changes observed in Group I transplant recipients by impacting adult myelination in the mPFC, possibly because this brain region is still capable of generating myelin after development. Several species of Clostridia have been shown to be producers of 4-EPS and cresol (<a href=\"#bib53\">Persico and Napolioni, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nicholson et al., 2012</a>), consistent with our findings that the microbiota of transplant recipients displaying an altered behavior (social avoidance and increased despair-like behavior) was enriched with members of the <i>Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae</i>, and other unidentified families within the Clostridiales order. We also detected a disruption in gut biosynthesis of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylanine in recipient mice with behavioral changes after transplantation. This might result in changes in the systemic/CNS levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters, as almost 90% of serotonin production occurs within the gastrointestinal tract from its precursor tryptophan (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yano et al., 2015</a>). Intestinal serotonin could cross through the blood brain barrier into the brain to regulate the observed social and despair-like behaviors. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in the glutamatergic system impact the pathophysiology of major depressive disorders (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tokita et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, another metabolite that was significantly downregulated in affected transplant recipients was hexanedioic acid, also known as adipic acid, which can impact glutamate signaling by inhibiting the L-glutamate decarboxylase in the brain (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wu and Roberts, 1974</a>). Recent work has demonstrated that epsilon toxin produced by <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> Type B is able to bind CNS endothelial cells and white matter tracts, inducing blood brain barrier disruption and oligodendrocyte apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Linden et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rumah et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">2015</a>). Although in our studies we could detect <i>C. perfringens,</i> its low abundance and the lack of demyelination at the ultrastructural level suggests that other members of the Clostridiales might be driving the behavioral outcome."

The single cell solution was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min and resuspended in panning buffer and transferred to a bacterial culture plate coated with Anti-BSL1 <i>Griffonia simplificonia</i> lectin (L-1100; Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA), for negative selection for 15\u2009min, followed by a positive selection step with rat anti-mouse CD140a (10R-CD140AMS; Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) as primary antibody and AffiniPure goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) (112-005-003; Dianova) as the secondary antibody for 45\u2009min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the positive selection plate was washed with DPBS. The adherent OPCs were removed using trypsin, centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 1000\u2009rpm, resuspended in mouse OPC Sato medium (<a href=\"#bib74\">Watkins et al., 2008</a>) and plated in a p100 culture plates coated with poly-d-lysine (P7886; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The OPCs were cultured in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37\u00b0C with media changes every 2 d. OPCs were maintained proliferating in the presence of bFGF (20 ng/mL) and PDGF (10 ng/mL), while oligodendrocyte differentiation was induced by culturing the cells in the absence of mitogens and adding 60 nM T3 (T5516; Sigma-Aldrich) to Sato medium."

Difference in behaviors between mice treated by SI vs oral, such as those in the elevated plus maze (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>) leaves me wondering if in some cases lack or presence of effects of antibiotics could be due to a particular susceptibility of a mouse strain to a manipulation such as gavage or injections, and not really to a difference in the changes in microbiota.

This analysis demonstrated the presence of specific taxa in vehicle-gavaged NOD (displaying a phenotype), that were not found at baseline (= no phenotype), and we identify as potential candidates to explain the depressive-like phenotype in vehicle-gavaged NOD mice. In addition, we reasoned that if this behavior was transferable through the microbiota, then the same relevant bacteria present in the NOD donors with the behavioral phenotype should be detected in C57Bl recipients that showed the social avoidance behavior after transplantation. For this reason, we focused on the similarities between the microbiota of vehicle-gavaged NOD donors (which exhibited a depressive phenotype) and C57Bl recipients transplanted with the microbiota of such NOD donors (which showed the depressive-like symptoms after transplantation, but not before). This analysis is presented in the new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, which identifies members of the Clostridiales, Ruminococcacea and Lachnospiraceae as the main bacterial taxa related to the depressive-like behavior transferred from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to C57bl recipients.

Three OTUs had two oligotypes with similar distribution of abundance across samples: Blautia producta, an unidentified member of the Lachnospiraceae, and an unidentified member of the Clostridiales. Further inspection of the sequences associated with these oligotypes revealed Blautia producta JCM 1471 as the closest reference sequence in NCBI, while the Clostridiales oligotypes had no close reference sequence.

Difference in behaviors between mice treated by SI vs oral, such as those in the elevated plus maze (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>) leaves me wondering if in some cases lack or presence of effects of antibiotics could be due to a particular susceptibility of a mouse strain to a manipulation such as gavage or injections, and not really to a difference in the changes in microbiota.
