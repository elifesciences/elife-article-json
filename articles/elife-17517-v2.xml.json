                    "text": "Recreational drug use leads to compulsive substance abuse in some individuals. Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However, little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously, we identified that translational control by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (p-eIF2\u03b1) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al., 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation, cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover, selectively inhibiting eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB, or knocking down <i>oligophrenin-1</i>\u2014an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-eIF2\u03b1\u2014in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively, our findings suggest that eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP."

Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However, little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously, we identified that translational control by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (p-eIF2\u03b1) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al., 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation, cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover, selectively inhibiting eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB, or knocking down <i>oligophrenin-1</i>\u2014an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-eIF2\u03b1\u2014in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively, our findings suggest that eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP."

The precise molecular and cellular mechanism underlying this transition remains unclear. In addicts, repeated drug use leads to long-lasting changes in neuronal structure and function in key reward areas (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koob and Volkow, 2010</a>), which have emerged as cellular correlates of drug addiction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>). Of particular interest are excitatory synaptic afferents to dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). These activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength in the VTA constitute the initial synaptic adaptations observed after drug exposure (<a href=\"#bib25\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Schilstrom et al., 2006</a>). For instance, a single injection of cocaine (or other drugs of abuse) given 24 hr before recording induces an LTP that is manifested as an increase in the ratio of the amplitude of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)- to <i>N</i>-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) onto DA neurons in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>). These early changes in synaptic strength are believed to facilitate persistent alterations in response to repeated exposure to drugs of abuse."

Interestingly, in contrast to passive cocaine administration, LTP persists for several weeks following self-administration (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Thus, these drug-induced persistent changes in synaptic strength in the VTA may represent the cellular process driving the progression from recreational to compulsive drug use. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a group I mGluR agonist, inhibits cocaine-induced LTP in VTA DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellone and L\u00fcscher, 2006</a>). This inhibition is attributed to the opposing effect of mGluR-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD), which reverses drug-evoked LTP and inward rectification in VTA DA neurons by internalization of AMPARs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellone and L\u00fcscher, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">L\u00fcscher and Huber, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>)."

First, cocaine induces LTP and reduces p-eIF2\u03b1 levels in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2016</a>), whereas DHPG elicits mGluR1/5-induced LTD and increases p-eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Trinh et al., 2014</a>). Second, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control facilitates the induction of LTP by blocking mGluR-LTD in VTA DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2016</a>). Finally, pharmacologically increasing p-eIF2\u03b1 levels\u00a0induces mGluR-LTD and prevents cocaine-induced LTP in VTA DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2016</a>)."

In midbrain slices from these mice, we recorded from GFP-positive (GFP+) neurons (in which eIF2\u03b1 cannot be phosphorylated) and GFP-negative (GFP-) control neurons. As expected, in GFP- (control) VTA DA neurons, cocaine-evoked LTP lasted five days, but returned to baseline by 14 days after withdrawal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d and f</a>). However, in GFP+ VTA DA neurons lacking p-eIF2\u03b1, LTP was much greater at five days and persisted for at least 14 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e and f</a>), highlighting the cell-autonomous effect of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation on the persistence of LTP.

Under normal conditions, postsynaptic AMPA-type currents are mediated by low conductance calcium-impermeable GluR1/GluR2 heteromeric receptors that are characterized by linear AMPAR current-voltage relationships. Exposure to cocaine results in the postsynaptic insertion of high conductance calcium-permeable AMPA receptors that lack GluR2 subunits\u00a0and are consequently inwardly rectifying (manifested as smaller AMPAR EPSCs measured at positive holding potentials versus those measured at corresponding negative potentials). In addition, GluR2-lacking AMPARs are sensitive to blockade by intracellular polyamines (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iino et al., 1996</a>). We therefore sought to determine whether the persistent cocaine-induced LTP that we observed in <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mice was accompanied by a similarly long-lasting shift in AMPAR subunit composition. By recording EPSCs in VTA DA neurons at \u221270, 0, and\u00a0+40 mV to calculate the rectification index, we found that cocaine increased inward rectification in control VTA DA neurons (<i>Eif2s1<sup>S/S</sup></i>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3a,c and e</a>) and to a greater degree in slices from <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3b,d and e</a>) at five days post-injection. However, 14 days after cocaine treatment, EPSCs were non-rectifying in WT controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3a,c and e</a>), whereas <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mice retained their inwardly-rectifying properties (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3b,d and e</a>). Moreover, potentiated EPSCs in cocaine-treated <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mice measured at 14 days were sensitive to two blockers of GluR2-lacking AMPARs, Joro spider toxin (JST (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iino et al., 1996</a>), 500 nM; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>) and 1-Naphthyl acetyl spermine (NASPM (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tsubokawa et al., 1995</a>), 50 \u03bcM; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>).

In the VTA, the origin of the mesolimbic dopamine system, single or multiple injections of cocaine evoke synaptic potentiation that persists for about five days. This LTP is generated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs into the postsynaptic membrane. Two studies revealed that mGluR-LTD in VTA DA neurons blocks cocaine-evoked LTP in these same cells by replacing GluR2-lacking calcium permeable AMPARs with GluR2-containing receptors (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellone and L\u00fcscher, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mameli et al., 2007</a>). Unlike NMDA-induced LTD, mGluR-LTD depends on new protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib24\">L\u00fcscher and Huber, 2010</a>). We have previously shown that eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control is necessary and sufficient for mGluR-LTD in both the hippocampus and the VTA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2016</a>). Translational control by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (i.e., mTORC1) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buffington et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Costa-Mattioli and Monteggia, 2013</a>) has also been implicated in mGluR-LTD. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin blocks mGluR-LTD in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mameli et al., 2007</a>). While both translational control mechanisms (mTORC1 and p-eIF2\u03b1) could be required for mGluR-LTD, it is possible that rapamycin treatment could affect eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control. During mGluR-LTD, activation of mGluRs by DHPG triggers the synthesis of OPHN1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nadif Kasri et al., 2011</a>) in a p-eIF2\u03b1-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib11\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>). If rapamycin exerted its effects on mGluR-LTD by blocking OPHN1 translation, which is required to induce mGluR-LTD (<a href=\"#bib11\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nadif Kasri et al., 2011</a>), these seemingly contradictory findings would be easily reconciled."

By suppressing p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated mGluR-LTD, we found that cocaine induces an LTP that lasted up to 40 days and was mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking receptors.

Thus, for a treatment for addiction to be effective, ideally,\u00a0it should not only target the initial synaptic neuroadaptations in the VTA, but also the synaptic function in other related structures. Given that enhancing mGluR signaling in the NAc blocks cocaine relapse and craving (<a href=\"#bib23\">Loweth et al., 2013</a>) and that eIF2\u03b1 is a key regulator of mGluR-LTD and cocaine-induced LTP, we propose that modulators of p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control may be useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction."

AMPAR/NMDAR ratios were calculated as previously described (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>). Briefly, neurons were voltage-clamped at\u00a0+40 mV until the holding current stabilized (at\u00a0&lt;200 pA), which usually occurred after a period of 5 to 15 min. A bipolar stimulating electrode placed 50\u2013150 \u03bcm rostral to the lateral VTA was used to evoke stable monosynaptic EPSCs at 0.05 Hz. Picrotoxin (100 \u03bcM) was added to the recording ACSF to block GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated IPSCs. After recording the dual-component EPSC, bath-application of DL-AP5 (100 \u03bcM for 10 min) was used to remove the NMDAR component, which was then obtained by offline subtraction of the remaining AMPAR component from the original dual-component EPSC. The peak amplitudes of the isolated currents were used to calculate the AMPAR/NMDAR ratios. Rectification indices were calculated as the ratio of the chord conductance of evoked EPSCs at a negative holding potential (\u221270 mV) to the chord conductance obtained from recordings made at a positive holding potential (+40 mV) in the presence of 100 \u03bcM DL-AP5, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellone and L\u00fcscher, 2006</a>).

The authors find that single or repeated injections of cocaine lead to reduced levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in the ventral tegmental area. Furthermore they confirm that cocaine administration elicits long-term potentiation of glutamatergic synapses onto ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons that lasts at least 5 days but decays to baseline after 14 days. However, in mice with reduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation the potentiation is long-lasting and persist even after 14 days."

Unfortunately, the self-administration procedure in mice is very technically challenging and would take well beyond the two months allowed by the journal for resubmission. While interesting, we believe that the study of whether p-eIF2\u03b1 -mediated translational control regulates compulsive drug-seeking behavior is beyond the scope of this study. That said, we now address this issue in the Discussion section (third paragraph). In future studies, we plan to assess whether reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 -mediated translation in the VTA precipitates compulsive cocaine seeking."
