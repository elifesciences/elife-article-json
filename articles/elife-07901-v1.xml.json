Here, by nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) assay and comparisons of six high-resolution (2.9\u20133.1 \u00c5) cryo-electron microscopy structures of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus with bound ligands, we show that the large sub-domain of the guanylyltransferase (GTase) domain of the turret protein (TP) also has an ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) acts as a signal and binds the methylase-2 domain of TP to induce conformational change of the viral capsid, which in turn activates the putative ATPase. ATP binding/hydrolysis leads to an enlarged capsid for efficient mRNA synthesis, an open GTase domain for His217-mediated guanylyl transfer, and an open methylase-1 domain for SAM binding and methyl transfer. Taken together, our data support a role of the putative ATPase in mediating the activation of mRNA transcription and capping within the confines of the virus."

Here, by nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) assay and comparisons of six high-resolution (2.9\u20133.1 \u00c5) cryo-electron microscopy structures of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus with bound ligands, we show that the large sub-domain of the guanylyltransferase (GTase) domain of the turret protein (TP) also has an ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) acts as a signal and binds the methylase-2 domain of TP to induce conformational change of the viral capsid, which in turn activates the putative ATPase. ATP binding/hydrolysis leads to an enlarged capsid for efficient mRNA synthesis, an open GTase domain for His217-mediated guanylyl transfer, and an open methylase-1 domain for SAM binding and methyl transfer. Taken together, our data support a role of the putative ATPase in mediating the activation of mRNA transcription and capping within the confines of the virus."

This process involves sensing the presence of the signal molecule SAM by methylase \u22122 (MT-2) domain of CPV TP, activating the putative viral ATPase, enlarging the viral capsid for efficient mRNA syntheses, and opening the GTase and MT-1 to enable guanylyl and methyl transfer."

This range of resolutions has permitted us to identify side chains of amino acid residues and to define conformations of bound ligands to build atomic models. Like the atomic model of unliganded CPV (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yu et al., 2011</a>), the atomic models of these liganded CPV all contain two conformers of the capsid shell proteins (CSP-A and CSP-B), two conformers of the large protrusion proteins (LPP-3 and LPP-5), and one conformer of TP in each asymmetrical unit (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We show below that the large sub-domain of GTase domain of TP (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhou et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yu et al., 2008</a>) also has an additional ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Except for A-CPV, these atomic models also contain ligands revealed in our cryoEM maps (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In S-CPV, one SAM binds to the MT-2 domain of each TP. In G-CPV, one GTP binds to the GTase site of GTase domain. In SG-CPV, two SAM molecules bind to the MT-1 and MT-2 domains, one Mg<sup>2+</sup>-GTP to the GTase site and one GTP to the putative ATPase site. In t-CPV and SGA-CPV, two SAM molecules bind to the MT-1 and MT-2 domains (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>), one Mg<sup>2+</sup>-GTP to the GTase site and one ATP to the putative ATPase site. As we will report in detail below, a comparison of these structures and their correlation with the accompanying biochemical results have led to our discovery of a putative ATPase-mediated regulation process for activating viral RNA transcription and capping."

                                "text": "Because SAM is required for efficient mRNA synthesis in CPV in addition to being the methyl donor for mRNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Furuichi, 1974</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">1978</a>), we first asked whether the presence of SAM would have any effect on the structure of CPV. Superposition of the structures (both at 3.1 \u00c5 resolution) of S-CPV and the unliganded CPV (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yu et al., 2011</a>) shows that the capsid shell of S-CPV is slightly expanded with a non-uniform outwards movement of all structure proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). (In contrast, the A-CPV structure reported here does not have such capsid expansion and protein movements, see below.) For example, the apical domain of CSP-A, located next to the fivefold axis, has the largest movement of \u223c1 \u00c5 (RMSD: 0.97 \u00c5); the dimerization domain, located near the twofold axis, has the smallest movement of \u223c0.5 \u00c5 (RMSD: 0.49 \u00c5); the CPV-unique small protrusion domain, which is located between the apical and the dimerization domain, moves outwards \u223c0.8 \u00c5 (RMSD: 0.83 \u00c5) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). TP, residing on the apical domain of CSP-A, moves outwards \u223c1 \u00c5 (RMSD: 0.99 \u00c5), which is the same as the displacement of the apical domain of CSP-A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In CSP-B, located around the threefold axis, the outwards movements of the apical, small protrusion, and dimerization domains are \u223c0.85 \u00c5 (RMSD: 0.85 \u00c5), 0.6 \u00c5 (RMSD: 0.57 \u00c5), and 0.5 \u00c5 (RMSD: 0.49 \u00c5), respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Accordingly, the movement (RMSD: 0.67 \u00c5) of LPP-5 is slightly larger than that of LPP-3 (RMSD: 0.43 \u00c5) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>)."

Among the five protein molecules within each asymmetric unit of CPV, only LPP-3 remains unchanged in both the location and structure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and the other four protein molecules exhibited changes in their locations, their structures, or both. The locations of LPP-5 molecules in t-CPV and S-CPV differ although their structures are the same (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating a rigid-body type of movement, likely effected by changes of the underlying CSP molecules. By contrast, the other molecules undergo both global domain movements and local conformation changes from S-CPV to t-CPV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). All domains of TP undergo global outwards movements (\u223c9 \u00c5), while only the MT-1 domain and the large sub-domain of GTase domain of TP exhibit local conformation changes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). CSP-A not only rotates outwards (up to 9 \u00c5) around a pivot point near the twofold axis (global domain movements indicated by dashed ellipses in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), but it also changes conformation in its apical domain (dotted ellipse in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). CSP-B also undergoes similar but less obvious changes than CSP-A (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These structural changes in CSP molecules result in an enlarged, yet stable capsid of the transcribing CPV. Since viral mRNA synthesis takes place within the confines of intact virus core, an enlarged capsid would facilitate dsRNA template movement, enabling efficient mRNA synthesis."

However, the 3.1 \u00c5 structure of SGA-CPV shows global movements and local conformational changes of its structure proteins that are indistinguishable from those of t-CPV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Furthermore, the large sub-domain of SGA-CPV GTase domain also contains a ligand similar to that in the t-CPV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

While the local conformational changes of SG-CPV structure proteins are identical to those of t-CPV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), the global movements of structure proteins of SG-CPV are slightly less than those in t-CPV or SGA-CPV (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). For example, the movement of GTase domain in SG-CPV is \u223c1 \u00c5 less than that of t-CPV or SGA-CPV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). Most importantly, the density of the bound GTP is not as strong as that of the ligand in t-CPV or SGA-CPV, and its triphosphate group becomes invisible when displayed at the same threshold of 3\u03c3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>)."

Consistent with this assignment, only the large sub-domain (the one containing the ATP-binding site) of the GTase domain undergoes significant conformational changes between S-CPV and t-CPV (<a href=\"#fig3 fig4\">Figures 3C, 4E</a>). Accompanying these conformational changes, part of the loop connecting \u03b113 and \u03b114 in S-CPV became a helix (\u03b1C) in SGA-CPV, SG-CPV, and t-CPV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

We reason that the large sub-domain with the ATP-binding site is possibly an ATPase, and the synergy between SAM and ATP reflects a dependence of its activity on the presence of SAM. To test this hypothesis, we first obtained the 3D reconstructions of G-CPV and A-CPV at 2.9 \u00c5 and 3.1 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our structures of G-CPV and A-CPV show that, in the absence of SAM, neither GTP nor ATP induced any conformational change (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). While a GTP bound to the GTase active site in G-CPV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), neither ATP nor GTP was observed at the newly discovered ATP-binding site in A-CPV and G-CPV (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), indicating that ATP/GTP binding to the large sub-domain of TP GTase domain is directly regulated by SAM, most likely via binding to the MT-2 domain, since the structure of S-CPV revealed only MT-2 domain contained SAM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>)."

Previous biochemical studies have shown that the mRNA transcription of CPV is SAM-dependent and is specifically coupled to ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Furuichi, 1978</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1981</a>). Additionally, it has been shown that the removal of turret in orthoreovirus leads loss of mRNA transcription activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Luongo et al., 2002</a>). Our structural results, when combined with these biochemical data, suggest that the ATP-binding site of TP GTase domain is possibly a SAM-dependent ATPase that mediates the activation of mRNA transcription."

Following the nomenclature of PBCV-1 GTase (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hakansson et al., 1997</a>), we designate the states of GTase domain in G-CPV and t-CPV as closed and open states, respectively. In the open state of GTase domain in t-CPV, we observed extra density next to the \u03b2, \u03b3 phosphates of the bound GTP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>), which we interpret as coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> for two reasons. First, Mg<sup>2+</sup> was the only divalent cation in our reaction mixture. Second, the GTase domains in SGA-CPV and SG-CPV are also in the open state with prominent densities attributable to Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Biochemical data have shown that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> is required for GTase activity of viruses in <i>Reoviridae</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yamakawa et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Le Blois et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Martinez-Costas et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Qiu and Luongo, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mohd Jaafar et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, only the open state (with the putative Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is catalytically active. Remarkably, the gate opening is achieved through the displacement of \u03b114 (i.e., the gate helix), one of the three helices comprising the active site of the putative viral ATPase (<a href=\"#fig4 fig6\">Figures 4A\u2013C, 6B</a>). However, even though the gate helix \u03b114 controls the open and closed state, it is not part of the GTase active site. In fact, the active sites of the putative ATPase and GTase do not share any amino acids or secondary elements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Therefore, the putative ATPase regulates GTase activity allosterically."

Previous loss-of-function mutagenesis study of lysine residues in mammalian reovirus suggested that Lys190 of GTase domain is responsible for guanylylation of GTases (<a href=\"#bib17\">Luongo et al., 2000</a>). Lys190 is located in a 28-aa segment (residues 168\u2013195) that connects two structurally conserved \u03b2 strands. Surprisingly, the conserved \u03b2 strands (\u03b23 and \u03b24) in CPV GTPase is connected by a segment of only 13 aa (a loop from residues 166\u2013178), which contains no lysine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). The connecting segments do not have sequence or structural similarities. Within the vicinity of the bound GTP, the only lysine residue in CPV GTase domain is Lys234, which maps to a non-conserved residue (Ser259) in mammalian reovirus GTase domain. Moreover, during GTase transition from its closed to open state, the \u03b1 phosphorus of the GTP moves towards a histidine-rich segment and away from Lys234 (<a href=\"#fig6 fig7\">Figures 6, 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, our structures indicate that Lys234 cannot directly participate in guanylylation of GTase, a conclusion that is contrary to a previous suggestion based on a likely incorrect placement of a GMP molecule in the active site in a poorer resolution map (<a href=\"#bib40\">Yang et al., 2012</a>)."

Located on the same side of the leaving group (i.e., \u03b2, \u03b3-diphosphate), His208 is hydrogen bonded to the \u03b2-phosphate of the GTP in SGA-CPV and SG-CPV. Therefore, His208 is not the active site residue; rather, it stabilizes the charge built up on the \u03b2-phosphate in the transition state during the catalysis process. Instead, His217 is likely the active site residue. His217 and the leaving group are on opposite sides of the \u03b1 phosphorus, a geometry suitable for in-line nucleophilic attack of the \u03b1 phosphorus by His217 (<a href=\"#fig6 fig7\">Figures 6, 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Indeed, these two conserved histidine residues in orthoreovirus are required for the GTase activities (<a href=\"#bib25\">Qiu and Luongo, 2003</a>). Furthermore, unlike KxDG GTases that have maximum activity at high pH, GTases of viruses in the <i>Reoviridae</i> family have maximum activity at pH about or lower than the pKa value (\u223c6.0) of histidine (<a href=\"#bib25\">Qiu and Luongo, 2003</a>). Because we observed only the pre guanylylation state of GTase in all three CPV structures (t-CPV, SGA-CPV, and SG-CPV), we reason that enzyme guanylylation mediated by His217 is likely the rate-limiting step in the process of guanylyl transfer."

First of all, active sites of MT-1 and the putative ATPase are spatially separated from each other (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as the distance from the putative ATPase site to the MT-1 in the same molecule is \u223c80 \u00c5, while that to a neighboring MT-1 is \u223c40 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Second, even if the putative ATPase is activated by SAM but lacks ATP for binding/hydrolysis, MT-1 remains incapable of SAM binding as was observed in S-CPV. In t-CPV where ATP is available, MT-1 becomes SAM bound (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The structures of MT-2 in S-CPV and t-CPV are essentially identical (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>), but their MT-1 structures differ. In particular, two loops lining one side of the un-occupied MT-1 active site in S-CPV shifted up to 4 \u00c5 in t-CPV, resulting in an enlarged active site to accommodate the SAM molecule required for methyl transfer (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). In SGA-CPV and SG-CPV, the structures of MT-1 domains with bound SAM are essentially identical to those in t-CPV (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), though the outwards movement of MT-1 in SG-CPV is \u223c1.1 \u00c5 less (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), likely due to the lower rate of GTP hydrolysis by the ATPase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

                        "text": "In this study, we discovered that the large sub-domain of CPV GTase domain has an ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase. This putative viral ATPase has the conserved structural motif for recognition of the adenine base of ATP: hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Ser301, Asp302 and Tyr316 and the adenine ring, pi\u2013pi stacking between the side chain of Tyr305 with the adenine base, and the cation\u2013pi stacking between the side chain of Arg271 and the adenine base (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). However, this putative viral ATPase lacks the structural motifs of canonical nucleoside triphosphatases (NTPases) (including cellular kinases), most notably the P loop, for binding the phosphoryl moiety of NTP (<a href=\"#bib29\">Saraste et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Smith and Rayment, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Snider and Houry, 2008</a>). Instead, the phosphoryl group of the bound ATP is stabilized through hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg271 or Tyr268 from \u03b113 helix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Although the large sub-domain has an \u03b1 helices/\u03b2 sheet fold, the putative viral ATPase active site is composed of three consecutive helices of \u03b113, \u03b114, and \u03b115 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Structurally, the putative ATPase is different from all ATPase known to date, and it may thus represent a new type of ATPase."

The base and ribose of the bound GTP are less hydrogen bounded to the active site than those of the bound ATP. More importantly, while the triphosphate group of the bound GTP forms only one hydrogen bond through its \u03b2 phosphate with Tyr268 of the active site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), the triphosphate moiety of the bound ATP is better stabilized by forming two more hydrogen bonds with the protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Conceivably, the more hydrogen bonded ATP is a more efficient substrate of the putative viral ATPase for hydrolysis than GTP, consistent with the colorimetric assay of CPV NTPase activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

                        "text": "By integrating the atomic structures of six different CPV particles and correlation with NTPase assay results, we propose a viral ATPase-mediated activation of mRNA transcription and capping, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>. As a virus must rely on host cell for replication, it is to the best interest of the virus to remain quiescent outside host cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). CPV senses the entrance into host cytoplasm by detecting the presence of SAM. SAM, acting as a signal and binding to its receptor of MT-2, causes initial conformational change of the virus capsid, which activates the putative viral ATPase (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The activated viral ATPase then binds and hydrolyzes ATP to cause three major structural transformations, leading to mRNA transcription and capping (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). First, as a result of the translocation of CSP, the viral capsid is enlarged, facilitating dsRNA template movement and enabling efficient mRNA synthesis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Second, the GTase domain transforms from its closed to open state (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Although GTP binds to the GTase active site in both states of GTase domain, only in the open state can the GTase bind Mg<sup>2+</sup> and catalyze His217-mediated guanylyl transfer. Third, the MT-1 domain transforms from its closed to open conformation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Only in its open conformation can MT-1 bind SAM. While the MT-1 and GTase domains from the same molecule are separated by the bridge domain and have no direct contact with each other, the MT-1 from a neighboring TP sits atop the putative ATPase sub-domain of GTase domain (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We, therefore propose that the putative ATPase regulates the activity of MT-1 in a neighboring TP, probably through the conformational changes of the putative ATPase sub-domain upon ATP binding/hydrolysis. Notably, from S-CPV to t-CPV, the C-terminal loop of GTase domain exhibits significant movement towards the MT-1 domain of its neighboring TP molecule, presumably contributing to open the active site of the MT-1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The remarkable parallel between the ATPase activity and the transcription activity indicated that they may have also employed the ATPase-mediated activation for mRNA transcription and capping identified here. For example, reovirus cores had high level of ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Noble and Nibert, 1997</a>) and could synthesize mRNA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shatkin and Sipe, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Banerjee and Shatkin, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Drayna and Fields, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Farsetta et al., 2000</a>), but virions had little ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Noble and Nibert, 1997</a>) and could not synthesize mRNA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shatkin and Sipe, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Farsetta et al., 2000</a>).

Would its hydrolysis lead to a further change of conformation of the TP? Or how do you envision the use of the ATPase to help in transcription?

If so, you should mention this explicitly instead of citing the <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhou 2014</a> paper.

You could either choose to limit the resolution used in the model refinement (and then assess the falloff of the R-factor or the FSC between the model and the map beyond that resolution, i.e. the predictive power of the model), or you could refine a scrambled version of the model in one of the gold-standard half-maps and then calculate FSC/R-factors between that model and that same half-map as well as FSC/R-factors between that model and the other half-map. The difference between these 2 curves is an indication of the amount of overfitting in the model. In the absence of overfitting, the 2 curves should overlap."

First, our results show that CPV\u2019s ATPase activity and ATP binding to the putative ATPase sites are both SAM-dependent. Second, the two non-transcribing CPV (i.e., SGA-CPV and SG-CPV) have similar structures to that of transcribing CPV (t-CPV), indicating that the conformation changes observed in t-CPV are not a consequence, but rather a trigger of RNA transcription. Third, previous biochemical studies have shown that the mRNA transcription of CPV is SAM-dependent and is specifically coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Fourth, the removal of turret in orthoreovirus leads to loss of mRNA transcription activity (please see the subsection headed \u201cDemonstration of viral ATPase activity and its SAM-dependence\u201d). This cumulative evidence strongly suggests that the large sub-domain of CPV TP is likely an ATPase that plays a role in the activation of mRNA transcription."
