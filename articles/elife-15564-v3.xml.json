However, the Prp43 binding site in the spliceosome and its target(s) are unknown. We show that Prp43 fused to Ntr1's G-patch motif (Prp43_Ntr1GP) is as efficient as the NTR in ILS disassembly, yielding identical dissociation products and recognizing its natural ILS target even in the absence of Ntr1\u2019s C-terminal-domain (CTD) and Ntr2. Unlike the NTR, Prp43_Ntr1GP disassembles earlier spliceosomal complexes (A, B, B<sup>act</sup>), indicating that Ntr2/Ntr1-CTD prevents NTR from disrupting properly assembled spliceosomes other than the ILS. The U2 snRNP-intron interaction is disrupted in all complexes by Prp43_Ntr1GP, and in the spliceosome contacts U2 proteins and the pre-mRNA, indicating that the U2 snRNP-intron interaction is Prp43\u2019s major target."

However, the Prp43 binding site in the spliceosome and its target(s) are unknown. We show that Prp43 fused to Ntr1's G-patch motif (Prp43_Ntr1GP) is as efficient as the NTR in ILS disassembly, yielding identical dissociation products and recognizing its natural ILS target even in the absence of Ntr1\u2019s C-terminal-domain (CTD) and Ntr2. Unlike the NTR, Prp43_Ntr1GP disassembles earlier spliceosomal complexes (A, B, B<sup>act</sup>), indicating that Ntr2/Ntr1-CTD prevents NTR from disrupting properly assembled spliceosomes other than the ILS. The U2 snRNP-intron interaction is disrupted in all complexes by Prp43_Ntr1GP, and in the spliceosome contacts U2 proteins and the pre-mRNA, indicating that the U2 snRNP-intron interaction is Prp43\u2019s major target."

It undergoes a series of remodeling steps that are driven by eight conserved DExD/H-box ATPases or RNA helicases (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cordin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cordin and Beggs, 2013</a>). Initially, U1 snRNP recognizes and forms a base-pairing interaction with the 5\u2019 splice site (SS) of the intron. Recruitment of the U2 snRNP to the branch-site (BS) yields the A complex. U2 snRNA forms a base-pairing interaction with the BS nucleotides, while several U2 SF3a and SF3b proteins stabilize U2 snRNP binding to the intron by interacting with intron nucleotides upstream and downstream of the BS (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gozani et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Schneider et al., 2015</a>). The U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP associates with the A complex, and a short helix between the 5\u2019 end of U2 and 3\u2019 end of U6 snRNA (U2/U6 helix II) is formed. Subsequently, the U1/5'SS interaction is disrupted, allowing base-pairing of the 5\u2019SS with U6 snRNA, resulting in the formation of the pre-catalytic B complex. Activation of the spliceosome, yielding the B<sup>act</sup> complex, involves unwinding of the U4/U6 duplex by the RNA helicase Brr2, and displacement of U4 snRNA from the spliceosome. This allows U6 snRNA to interact with U2 snRNA to form U2/U6 helix I. The resulting U2/U6/pre-mRNA interaction network forms the heart of the spliceosome\u2019s catalytic center (<a href=\"#bib12\">Datta and Weiner, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wu and Manley, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Madhani and Guthrie, 1992</a>). Concomitant with these RNA rearrangements, more than twenty new proteins, including the Prp19 complex (NTC), are stably integrated into the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>)."

In yeast, Prp43 associates with two co-factors to dismantle the ILS, the G-patch protein Ntr1 (also termed Spp382) and Ntr2, which together form the NTR complex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boon et al.,\u00a02006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pandit et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tsai et al., 2007</a>). Ntr1 binds through its N-terminal G-patch motif (GP) to the C-terminal domain of Prp43 and thereby stimulates Prp43\u2019s ATPase and RNA helicase activity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tanaka et al.,\u00a02007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Christian et al., 2014</a>). Their productive interaction in the NTR is also required to dissociate the ILS in yeast splicing extracts, where Ntr2 is thought to recruit Ntr1 and thus also Prp43 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tsai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tanaka et al., 2007</a>)."

Thus, while the effects of NTR action on the ILS and the nature of the dissociation products have been well characterized, the mechanism how Prp43 dismantles the ILS and, most importantly, the target structure(s) that are disrupted (remodeled) by Prp43 in the spliceosome are completely unknown. As the complex RNA interaction network formed by the intron and U2/U6 snRNAs is still in place in the post-catalytic ILS (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yan et al., 2015</a>), several RNA duplexes, including the U2/BS and U2/U6 helices I and II must be dissociated during ILS disassembly by Prp43. This raises the question whether Prp43 has several RNA duplex targets in the ILS and if so, whether it dissociates them in a sequential manner. Moreover, the ILS is a large RNP complex and DEAH-box ATPases can also act as RNPases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jankowsky et al., 2001</a>). Thus the target(s) of Prp43 in the ILS may also involve protein\u2013RNA interactions."

Thus, Prp43 is also involved in the disassembly of early spliceosomes that not only differ significantly from the ILS in their biochemical composition, but also in the nature of their RNA interaction network. The role of Ntr2 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Ntr1 in facilitating Prp43\u2019s recognition of its spliceosomal target structures, is also not well understood. It has been suggested that Ntr2 may help to recruit Ntr1 and Prp43 to the ILS (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tsai et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, or in addition, they may also play a role in regulating the productive interaction of Ntr1\u2019s GP with Prp43 in the spliceosome and help to prevent dissociation of properly assembled spliceosomes other than post-catalytic ILSs."

We show that a fusion protein of Prp43 and the G-patch motif of Ntr1 (Prp43_Ntr1GP) efficiently dismantles the ILS, yielding the same dissociation products as the NTR. Thus, Prp43_Ntr1GP is a disassembly factor that recognizes its natural target structure(s) in the ILS even in the absence of Ntr1\u2019s CTD and Ntr2. Prp43_Ntr1GP also efficiently dismantles activated (B<sup>act</sup>) spliceosomes, while NTR does not. This indicates that Ntr2 and Ntr1\u2019s CTD act as a 'doorkeeper' that prevents dissociation by NTR of properly assembled spliceosomes other than ILSs. Prp43_Ntr1GP also dissociates purified B and A complexes. Characterization of the Prp43_Ntr1GP-mediated dissociation products of the B<sup>act</sup>, B and A complexes revealed that in all complexes U2 snRNP is disloged from the pre-mRNA, indicating that the interaction of U2 snRNP with the extended branch site is the major target of Prp43 in the spliceosome. The latter is further supported by our finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP binds to the pre-mRNA and contacts predominantly U2 proteins in the spliceosome. Our data are consistent with the idea that Prp43 specifically displaces U2 snRNP from the BS by moving along the intron in a 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction or acting locally by disrupting RNA structures without significant translocation."

                                "text": "Previously, it was shown that a fusion protein, in which the C-terminal amino acid of Prp43 is connected to the N-terminal amino acid of the Ntr1\u2009G-patch (termed Prp43_Ntr1GP, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), also displays high RNA-stimulated ATPase and RNA helicase activities (<a href=\"#bib7\">Christian et al., 2014</a>). Therefore we investigated whether Prp43_Ntr1GP is also sufficient to dismantle the ILS and thus represents a minimal spliceosome disassembly system. Purified ILSs were obtained as described previously (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fourmann et al., 2013</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, incubation of the ILS with ATP and recombinant Prp43 plus Ntr1 and Ntr2 (forming the NTR complex, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tsai et al., 2007</a>) resulted in the release of ~80% of the IL RNA and dissociation of the remaining spliceosomal RNP core into free U6 snRNA, 18S U5 and 20S U2 snRNPs, while in the absence of the NTR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) or in the presence of Prp43 alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), only a very low level of the ILS was released (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fourmann et al., 2013</a>). Remarkably, disassembly of the ILS by Prp43_Ntr1GP yielded the same snRNP and RNA dissociation products (i.e., IL RNA, free U6 snRNA, 18S U5 and 20S U2 snRNPs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) as those obtained when the NTR was added (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Addition of Ntr2 to the reaction mixture did not influence the efficiency of ILS disassembly by Prp43_Ntr1GP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), indicating that Ntr2 and the C-terminal domain of Ntr1 are not needed for recruiting Prp43_Ntr1GP to the spliceosome. In summary, these results demonstrate that Ntr1\u2019s GP is essential and sufficient to promote ILS disassembly by Prp43 in the same manner as the NTR complex. This in turn suggests that Prp43_Ntr1GP recognizes the same target structure(s) in the ILS as the NTR."

Indeed, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments carried out with antibodies specific for the U5 snRNP protein Snu114 and fractions across the gradient revealed that pre<b>-</b>mRNA co-precipitates together with the U5 snRNP; while very little or no U2 and U6 snRNAs were found in the IPs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, the U5 snRNA and pre-mRNA (but not U2 and U6 snRNAs), were also co-precipitated from the gradient with anti-Prp19 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, lanes 8 and 9), suggesting that the NTC proteins are bound to the U5 snRNP after disassembly of the B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> complex. This conclusion is also supported by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of the purified 35S U5-pre-mRNA complex, showing that the majority of NTC proteins migrated in fractions 13\u201316, together with U5 proteins (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Finally, a more detailed characterization of the disassembly products of the B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> complex by UV protein-RNA crosslinking and MS revealed that all U2 SF3a and SF3b proteins, which contact the BS region of the intron within the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schneider et al., 2015</a>), are dissociated from the intron and remain associated with the released 20S U2 snRNP (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2E\u2014source data 1</a>). Indeed, we found that Hsh155 (human SF3B1/SAP155) can be crosslinked to the pre<b>-</b>mRNA in the intact B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, lane 2), but after B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> disassembly, crosslinking of Hsh155 to the pre<b>-</b>mRNA was no longer observed (lane 4). This indicates that Hsh155 is completely displaced from the pre<b>-</b>mRNA by Prp43_Ntr1GP. To validate the quantitative dissociation of the U2 snRNP from the pre-mRNA, we carried out IP experiments using the Cus1-TAP extract (human SF3B145/SAP145). Disassembled B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> spliceosomes were incubated with Protein A\u2013Sepharose beads that carried IgG, to which the TAP tag binds efficiently. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> (lanes 3,4) shows a selective immunoprecipitation of the U2 snRNP, indicating quantitative dissociation of the U2 particle from the pre-mRNA, which is thus not coprecipitated together with the U2 snRNP. In conclusion, Prp43_Ntr1GP dismantles the B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> complex and ILS in a similar manner, suggesting that it also recognizes similar target structure(s) in both complexes (see also Discussion below). Furthermore, the striking finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP, but not the NTR, efficiently dismantles the B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> complex, suggests that in the B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> complex the CTD of Ntr1 and/or Ntr2 negatively regulate Prp43 and prevent disassembly of an activated spliceosome which is assembled on a wild-type pre-mRNA."

Brr2 is responsible for U4/U6 snRNAs unwinding, a critical step in spliceosomal activation, which can only occur at higher ATP concentrations (i.e. ~100\u2013200 \u00b5M ATP) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheng, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>). To exclude any effect of Brr2 RNA helicase, which is strictly ATP-dependent, we incubated purified B complexes either with the NTR or with Prp43_Ntr1GP in the presence of UTP. The vast majority of B complexes remained stable during incubation with UTP alone, and addition of the NTR did not lead to a significant increase in dissociation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). In contrast, in the presence of Prp43_Ntr1GP and UTP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), 67% of the B complexes were disassembled.

The remaining fraction of U2 snRNA migrated in fractions 7\u201311, while U1 snRNA exhibited a broad peak in fractions 10\u201315.

Likewise, no crosslinks between Prp9 and pre<b>-</b>mRNA were observed in the U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNP peak fractions (lane 6). Pulldowns using IgG-Sepharose and the Cus1-TAP extract confirmed that the pre-mRNA is not coprecipitated together with the U2 snRNP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, lanes 3,4), and only slightly from fractions 13\u201315 containing the U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNPs and some U2 and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs (lane 5). We conclude that disassembly of B complexes by Prp43_Ntr1GP involves the complete displacement of U2 snRNP from the pre<b>-</b>mRNA BS region. U2 snRNP is very probably displaced as a tetra-snRNP particle, which partially dissociates into free 20S U2 snRNPs and 25S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs during gradient centrifugation.

In contrast, after incubation with Prp43_Ntr1GP and ATP, the majority of U2 migrated in the 20S region of the gradient, whereas U1 and pre<b>-</b>mRNA co-migrated at ~27S (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). IP of gradient fractions after incubation with Prp43_Ntr1GP and ATP, using an antibody against the U1 protein Nam8, showed significant co-precipitation of pre<b>-</b>mRNA with U1 snRNP, but only negligible co-precipitation of U2 snRNP in fractions 10\u201312 and 13\u201315 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, in contrast to the U1 snRNP, U2 snRNP is displaced from the pre<b>-</b>mRNA by Prp43_Ntr1GP.

This complex cannot be catalytically activated by Prp2 and Spp2 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>). However, the vast majority of Act\u03946B<sup>act</sup> complexes were efficiently disassembled in the presence of Prp43_Ntr1GP and ATP, but not ATP alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), demonstrating that intron nucleotides downstream of the BS are not required for docking Prp43."

Thus, specific protein-protein interactions likely aid in recruiting Prp43 to its docking site on the intron close to the U2 snRNP. To identify Prp43 interacting partners in the spliceosome, we performed protein\u2013protein crosslinking experiments with the homobifunctional chemical crosslinker BS3 and B<sup>act \u0394Prp2</sup> complexes incubated with Prp43_Ntr1GP in the absence of ATP and then separated from excess Prp43_Ntr1GP by gradient centrifugation.

To address these questions we initially determined the minimal domain requirements of Ntr1 and Ntr2 to promote disassembly of the ILS by Prp43 in a purified system. A fusion protein of Prp43 and the Ntr1\u2009G-patch (Prp43_Ntr1GP) was as active as the NTR in ILS disassembly and yielded identical snRNP and RNA dissociation products, demonstrating that Prp43 plus the Ntr1 GP are necessary and sufficient, and perform the same function as the NTR during ILS disassembly."

Moreover, both Prp43 alone and Prp43_Ntr1GP could be crosslinked to the pre-mRNA in B<sup>act</sup> complexes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), indicating that their recruitment is not dependent on Ntr2 or the CTD of Ntr1. Indeed, although Prp43, Ntr1 and Ntr2 form a trimeric complex, it is not very stable and thus, NTR components can bind independently of one another, as shown previously for Ntr1/Ntr2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) and shown here for Prp43 and Prp43_Ntr1GP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

As Prp43 alone can bind the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), the lack of disassembly activity by the NTR suggests that Ntr1/Ntr2 do not bind productively or do not have an available binding site yet in the B<sup>act</sup> complex, and thus Prp43 activity is not stimulated. Accordingly, the Ntr1-bound Ntr2 protein appears to act as a 'doorkeeper', allowing a productive interaction of the Ntr1 GP with Prp43 only when a cognate binding site for Ntr1/Ntr2 exists or is available next to the Prp43-binding site in the spliceosome - as is apparently the case for the ILS."

The action of Prp43_Ntr1GP not only disrupted the base-pairing interaction between U2 snRNA and the BS, but also interactions between U2 proteins and the intron. In contrast, UV RNA\u2013protein crosslinking, IP experiments and MS showed that in all cases, the U2 SF3a und SF3b proteins remained associated with the U2 snRNA. This indicates that Prp43_Ntr1GP dislodges U2 snRNP from the pre-mRNA BS region as an intact particle and thus that the release of U2 from the BS does not result from prior disassembly of the U2 snRNP."

The presence of Ntr1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tanaka et al., 2007</a>) enhances Prp43 activity and allows it to unwind model substrates in both 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 and 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 directions. Given that Prp43 binds the pre-mRNA and the U2 snRNP proteins Cus1 and Hsh155 and can efficiently disassemble Act\u03946Bact complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), our data are consistent with the idea that Prp43_Ntr1GP translocates along the pre-mRNA in a 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction, thereby displacing pre-mRNA<i>-</i>bound U2 proteins and disrupting the U2 snRNA/BS base-pairing interaction. Thus, Prp43 likely acts as a canonical RNPase, most probably coupled with RNA duplex unwinding activity, as shown for the DExH-box RNA helicase NPH-II (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jankowsky et al.,\u00a02000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jankowsky et al., 2001</a>)."

Indeed DEAH-box proteins that translocate load onto ssRNA and translocate 3\u2019 to 5\u2019, disrupting RNA structures and displacing proteins as they translocate, as for example Prp2 and Prp22, for which targets have been identified. Prp2 requires nucleotides of pre-mRNA downstream of the BS, suggesting 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 translocation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu and Cheng, 2012</a>). Along the way, Prp2 is suggested to remodel the binding of the U2 SF3a/b proteins and a number of others (<a href=\"#bib44\">Warkocki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lardelli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ohrt et al., 2012</a>). Likely, destabilization of SF3a/b leads to the exposure of the BS and also to remodeling of the catalytic center of the spliceosome so that RNA elements can interact to initiate the first catalytic reaction. Also the action of Prp22 most likely involves directional movement 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 on the mature mRNA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wagner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tanaka and Schwer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Schwer, 2008</a>). Following splicing, Prp22 releases the mRNA from the spliceosome by disrupting base pairs between the U5 snRNP and the mRNA thus breaking several RNA\u2013RNA and RNA\u2013protein contacts (<a href=\"#bib9\">Company et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wagner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tanaka and Schwer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Schwer, 2008</a>)."

Thus, Prp43_Ntr1GP could potentially act sequentially on several targets. Alternatively, the U2/BS interaction might serve as a structural 'keystone' that once disrupted by Prp43, destabilizes other interactions in the spliceosome, leading to their passive dissociation. Although we cannot exclude the first possibility, we favor the second, as it is more consistent with the identity of the dissociation products from the various complexes. That is, U2 snRNP is completely displaced from the BS when the B complex is disassembled by Prp43_Ntr1GP, but one third of the U2 snRNP remains stably bound to the tri-snRNP in the form of a U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNP. Binding of U2 snRNP to the tri-snRNP is stabilized in part by the U2/U6 helix II base pairing interaction. If this helix, which also exists in the B<sup>act</sup> complex and in the ILS, were a target for Prp43_Ntr1GP, then one would expect complete dissociation of the tetra-snRNP into tri-snRNP and U2 snRNP \u2013 which however does not occur. Moreover, the U6 snRNA remains base-paired with the U4 snRNA, both in the tri-snRNP and in the tetra-snRNP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Finally, after dissociation of B<sup>act</sup>, the U5 snRNP remains stably bound to the pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C,D</a>). Likewise, the binding of U1 snRNP to the 5\u2019SS is not disrupted by Prp43 after dislodging U2 snRNP from complex A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The latter observations confirm that Prp43_Ntr1GP is not a promiscuous disassembly enzyme. Taken together, our results support the idea that the U2 snRNP/BS interaction is the principal target of Prp43 in the spliceosome and that all other Prp43-mediated spliceosome dissociation products are generated as a consequence of the dissociation of this main building block."

After washing with NET-150 buffer 3 times, beads were incubated with 2-times PK-mix (1 mg/ml Proteinase K, 200\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 300\u2009mM NaCl, 25\u2009mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1% SDS) for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C by mixing at 800\u2009rpm, followed by PCI extraction, chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The pellet was dried and dissolved in water."

Prp43 mediated spliceosome disassembly is catalyzed in the context of a complex between Prp43 and two other proteins, Ntr1 and Ntr2. A surprising finding here is that a Prp43-Ntr1 G-patch fusion protein can function in disassembly in the absence of Ntr1 and 2. Using this fusion protein the authors show through a careful set of experiments that the target of Prp43's helicase activity is the U2 snRNP/pre-mRNA branch site interaction. In essence Prp43 acts as an RNPase to dissociate U2 snRNP from the pre-mRNA. The fusion protein is capable of dissociating U2 snRNP in all complexes where it is bound to pre-mRNA including the earliest complex, complex A."

Fourmann et al. now report a detailed study of the biochemical properties of the Prp43_Ntr1GP fusion, and show that 1) the fusion protein promotes ILS disassembly as efficiently as the complete NTR complex; 2) the fusion protein promotes efficient disassembly of stalled B<sup>act\u0394Prp2</sup>, B or A complexes, activities that the NTR complex do not display; 3) the fusion protein does not require pre-mRNA sequences downstream from the branch point (BPS) (which are however required for Prp2 helicase-mediated spliceosome activation), while RNA-protein and protein-protein crosslinking suggest that Prp43_Ntr1GP is targeted to the pre-mRNA through interaction with U2 snRNP components and contacts with pre-mRNA sequences upstream of the BPS."

Importantly, the products of the reaction are the same \u2013 IL RNA, U6 snRNA and U2 and U5 snRNPs. The authors go on to show that Prp43_Ntr1GP can also dissociate U2 snRNP from pre-mRNA in purified A, B and B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes, which are normally not substrates for disassembly by NTR [except at specific stages of the splicing pathway (Chen et al., 2013)]. A common element in all the cases is the U2 snRNP engaged at the branchpoint and the authors suggest a model wherein Prp43_Ntr1GP binds in the intron upstream of the branchsite and translocates in the 5' to 3' direction to displace the U2 snRNP. The authors show that Prp43_Ntr1GP and, with greatly reduced efficiency, Prp43 can be UV cross-linked to pre-mRNA in purified B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes and using primer extension assays, they map crosslinks in the RNA. The basis for concluding that the crosslinks in the intron (-33 to -25) indicates Prp43_Ntr1GP binding at this position is unclear. The same primer extension stops are present in the Input lanes, independent of whether or not Prp43_Ntr1GP was added and enrichment upon immunoprecipitation with anti-Prp43 only means that Prp43_Ntr1GP is associated with the complex (IP for any of the U2 proteins would likely yield the same picture). The argument that 'no other proteins are known to interact with this region of the intron' (Results) seems rather weak without a reference to data substantiating this statement. Moreover, doesn't the finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP cross-linked more efficiently to the pre-mRNA than Prp43 indicate that binding might be via the G-patch? (Christian et al., 2014 mapped an RNA binding site within the Ntr1 G-patch)."

However, the data (using the B<sup>act</sup> complex, which is not a natural substrate for disassembly by NTR) shown in support of Prp43's interaction with the intron nucleotides upstream of the branchsite are, in my opinion, not convincing."

[\u2026] The argument that 'no other proteins are known to interact with this region of the intron' (Results) seems rather weak without a reference to data substantiating this statement. Moreover, doesn't the finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP cross-linked more efficiently to the pre-mRNA than Prp43 indicate that binding might be via the G-patch? (Christian et al., 2014 mapped an RNA binding site within the Ntr1 G-patch)."

However, the data (using the B<sup>act</sup> complex, which is not a natural substrate for disassembly by NTR) shown in support of Prp43's interaction with the intron nucleotides upstream of the branchsite are, in my opinion, not convincing."

For this reason we added a new paragraph in our Discussion were we point out that \u201cPrp43 could function similarly to DEAD-box proteins, which act locally, disrupting or in some cases promoting RNA structures without significant translocation, as suggested previously (Guenther and Jankowsky 2009; Jarmoskaite and Russell 2014). Indeed DEAH-box proteins that translocate load onto ssRNA and translocate 3\u2019 to 5\u2019, disrupting RNA structures and displacing proteins as they translocate, as for example Prp2 and Prp22, for which targets have been identified.\u201d"
