Using five autism-related mouse models, <i>Shank3+</i>/\u0394C, <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup>, <i>Cntnap2</i>\u2212/\u2212, L7-Tsc1 (<i>L7/Pcp2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup><i>::Tsc1</i><sup><i>flox/</i>+</sup>), and patDp(15q11-13)/+, we report specific perturbations in delay eyeblink conditioning, a form of associative sensory learning requiring cerebellar plasticity. By distinguishing perturbations in the probability and characteristics of learned responses, we found that probability was reduced in <i>Cntnap2</i>\u2212/\u2212, patDp(15q11-13)/+, and <i>L7/Pcp2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup><i>::Tsc1</i><sup><i>flox/</i>+</sup>, which are associated with Purkinje-cell/deep-nuclear gene expression, along with <i>Shank3</i>+/\u0394C. Amplitudes were smaller in <i>L7/Pcp2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup><i>::Tsc1</i><sup><i>flox/</i>+</sup> as well as <i>Shank3</i>+/\u0394C and <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup>, which are associated with granule cell pathway expression. <i>Shank3+</i>/\u0394C and <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup> also showed aberrant response timing and reduced Purkinje-cell dendritic spine density. Overall, our observations are potentially accounted for by defects in instructed learning in the olivocerebellar loop and response representation in the granule cell pathway. Our findings indicate that defects in associative temporal binding of sensory events are widespread in autism mouse models."

Using five autism-related mouse models, <i>Shank3+</i>/\u0394C, <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup>, <i>Cntnap2</i>\u2212/\u2212, L7-Tsc1 (<i>L7/Pcp2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup><i>::Tsc1</i><sup><i>flox/</i>+</sup>), and patDp(15q11-13)/+, we report specific perturbations in delay eyeblink conditioning, a form of associative sensory learning requiring cerebellar plasticity. By distinguishing perturbations in the probability and characteristics of learned responses, we found that probability was reduced in <i>Cntnap2</i>\u2212/\u2212, patDp(15q11-13)/+, and <i>L7/Pcp2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup><i>::Tsc1</i><sup><i>flox/</i>+</sup>, which are associated with Purkinje-cell/deep-nuclear gene expression, along with <i>Shank3</i>+/\u0394C. Amplitudes were smaller in <i>L7/Pcp2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup><i>::Tsc1</i><sup><i>flox/</i>+</sup> as well as <i>Shank3</i>+/\u0394C and <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup>, which are associated with granule cell pathway expression. <i>Shank3+</i>/\u0394C and <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup> also showed aberrant response timing and reduced Purkinje-cell dendritic spine density. Overall, our observations are potentially accounted for by defects in instructed learning in the olivocerebellar loop and response representation in the granule cell pathway. Our findings indicate that defects in associative temporal binding of sensory events are widespread in autism mouse models."

Linking two sensations that arrive within a split second of one another, such as sound and the feeling of wind, is a type of learning that requires the cerebellum, a region found at the base of the brain. When done in a laboratory setting, this particular form of learning has been dubbed eyeblink conditioning."

For example, they have trouble identifying a video that goes with a spoken soundtrack. They also do not learn eyeblink conditioning the same way that other individuals do. However, it is not known which circuits in the brain are responsible for their difficulty. Kloth et al. now investigate this issue by asking whether versions of genes that increase the risk of autism in humans also disrupt eyeblink conditioning in mice. They tested five types of mouse model, each with a different genetic mutation that has previously been linked to autism. All five of these mutations cause defects in different cell types of the cerebellum, and all mice have abnormal social and habitual behaviors, similar to autistic people."

After this had occurred dozens of times, the mice started to blink earlier, as soon as the light appeared, in anticipation of the puff of air. To test whether the mice had successfully learned to respond to just the bright light, the light was also occasionally flashed without a puff of air."

Some mice blinked too soon or too late after the light appeared; others blinked weakly or less frequently; and some did not blink at all. This suggests that autism can affect the processing of sensory information in the cerebellum in different ways."

In addition to early-life abnormal processing of single sensory modalities (<a href=\"#bib66\">Leekam et al., 2007</a>), more complex deficits become apparent as early as 2 years of age, a time when autistic children attend poorly to natural combinations of spoken stimuli and natural visual motion (<a href=\"#bib59\">Klin et al., 2009</a>), a circumstance that calls upon the ability to integrate, from moment to moment, information from two sensory modalities, hearing and vision. Abnormalities of sensory responsiveness are strongly correlated with severity of social phenotypes in high-functioning autism patients (<a href=\"#bib51\">Hilton et al., 2010</a>).

Eyelid deflection is measured using induced current from a small magnet affixed to the eyelid.

When the CS is delivered alone (blue trace), a bell-shaped CR is produced that peaks at the expected time of the US. The onset time is the time from the onset of the CS to a change in concavity of the eyeblink.

A peak in the histogram consistently occurred within the zero-amplitude bin (peak at amplitude of 0.006 \u00b1 0.001, within the bin from \u22120.0125 to 0.0125), representing failure to respond to the stimulus with either closing or opening of the eyelid.

Response <i>probability</i> was defined as one minus the failure rate.

This decreased excitability can affect learning by interfering with climbing fiber (cf)-based instruction, either by reducing PC dendritic excitability or by making the cerebellar cortex less effective at influencing the DCN, resulting in inhibited IO responsiveness to the US (<a href=\"#bib101\">Schonewille et al., 2010</a>). Reduced PC firing would also be expected to reduce response amplitudes, which we have observed. Similarly, patDp/+ mice show cf structural plasticity during development and deregulated PF-PC LTD in adults (<a href=\"#bib92\">Piochon et al., 2014</a>), echoing findings in other models (<a href=\"#bib62\">Koekkoek et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Baudouin et al., 2012</a>). It should be noted that other forms of cerebellar plasticity can contribute to learning in the absence of PF-PC LTD (<a href=\"#bib102\">Schonewille et al., 2011</a>).

For example, a study that examined de novo (i.e., no previous conditioning) delay eyeblink conditioning (<a href=\"#bib103\">Sears et al., 1994</a>) found that in high-functioning (average IQ &gt; 100) autistics, the %CR fraction rose more rapidly than in controls, reaching close to a half-maximum after only two blocks of trials.

Variations in response kinetics may depend on the specific genetic background. In idiopathic autism (<a href=\"#bib103\">Sears et al., 1994</a>), CRs came approximately 50 ms earlier, as measured using both the time to CR onset and the time to CR peak. Similarly, after two sessions of trace conditioning (<a href=\"#bib87\">Oristaglio et al., 2013</a>), delay conditioning initially leads to a decrease in response onset and latency of approximately 50 ms, followed by a convergence toward normal performance as training continues. In contrast, Fragile X patients show no differences in timing in early training sessions (<a href=\"#bib62\">Koekkoek et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Tobia and Woodruff-Pak, 2009</a>), but after average CR amplitude reaches a plateau, the peak latency to CR decreases by approximately 30 ms (<a href=\"#bib118\">Tobia and Woodruff-Pak, 2009</a>). Changes of 30\u201350 ms are comparable in size to the effects we have observed in mice with granule cell pathway perturbation. In addition, in a valproate-based rat model of autism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Arndt et al., 2005</a>), prematurely timed eyeblink responses were found for long interstimulus intervals (<a href=\"#bib82\">Murawski et al., 2009</a>). In summary, past findings suggest that perturbation of cerebellar granule cell layer activation may be common in both idiopathic and syndromic autism. The general observation of shortened latency is consistent with our findings in <i>Shank3+/\u0394C</i> mice, suggesting this line as a model for the timing deficits observed in autistic persons."

The cerebellum arises repeatedly in the study of autism (<a href=\"#bib122\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). In an analysis of gene\u2013phenotype associations (<a href=\"#bib77\">Meehan et al., 2011</a>), autism-related genes were found to be associated with a cluster of phenotypes that included social defects, abnormal motor behavior, and cerebellar foliation. A number of ASD genes are co-expressed in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib78\">Menashe et al., 2013</a>), and ASD patients show differences in many cerebellar cell types (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bauman and Kemper, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Fatemi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib124\">Whitney et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib123\">Wegiel, et al., 2010</a>) as well as gross cerebellar structure, starting at an early age (<a href=\"#bib48\">Hashimoto et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abell et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Stanfield et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Courchesne et al., 2011</a>).

That work revealed little effect on a variety of standard non-motor tasks, including social, navigational, and memory tasks. Those tasks differ from current tests of autism model face validity. For example, the social assay involved consecutive presentation of mouse/object stimuli, as opposed to the simultaneous choice that occurs in the three-chamber test (<a href=\"#bib126\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). Likewise, no test was given for perseveration such as maze reversal or grooming duration (<a href=\"#bib119\">Tsai et al., 2012</a>).

The integration of closely timed events across sensory modalities could be critical for statistical learning. Statistical learning can encompass the association of an auditory or visual stimulus to predict some other event, a capacity that is likely to be at the core of the acquisition of language (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ferguson and Lew-Williams, 2014</a>) and other cognitive capacities (<a href=\"#bib33\">Dinstein et al., 2012</a>). Such learning is commonly assumed to require neocortical plasticity via Hebbian uninstructed learning. In addition, statistical learning from unexpected events is also efficiently supported by instructed plasticity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Courville et al., 2006</a>), a phenomenon for which cerebellar circuit architecture is well-suited (<a href=\"#bib72\">Marr, 1969</a>). Since the neocortex and cerebellum communicate with one another bidirectionally, these two brain systems might play complementary roles in learning from experience. Projections to forebrain are present in early postnatal life (<a href=\"#bib31\">Diamond, 2000</a>), and early childhood disruption of the cerebellum affects the development of social cognition and language (<a href=\"#bib96\">Riva and Giorgi, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Steinlin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Bolduc et al., 2012</a>). In this context, eyeblink conditioning is an example of learning from the close timing of two events of different sensory modality, and defects in it may reflect broader difficulties in subsecond temporal sensory association. If such difficulties are present in early stages of autism, the cerebellum may be a potential target for early-life therapeutic intervention."

When comparing a single measurement across more than two groups, one-way analyses of variance were performed with Bonferroni post hoc tests with planned comparisons. Correction for potentially confounding variables (i.e., age) was performed using analysis of covariance tests with the confounding variable as the covariant and followed by Tukey's post hoc tests. Tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and SPSS 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY).

The authors point out that the cerebellar malformations are characteristic of autism and that this behavioral task depends on the cerebellum. They therefore test whether the mutation of autism linked genes alters the acquisition and execution of conditioned eyeblink responses, and demonstrate that this is indeed the case. On the one hand, one could argue that the results are obvious \u2013 if the genes are expressed in cerebellar cells (known) and the gene products have any effects on the neurons that express them (likely) then it is inevitable that changes in eyeblink conditioning will occur. On the other hand, a characterization of the specific deficits is informative, and since there has been resistance among autism experts to acknowledge a role for the cerebellum, it is valuable to gather such survey data to make the case convincingly."

Several other papers (<a href=\"#bib62\">Koekkoek et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Murawski et al., 2009</a>) have already documented deficits in eyelid conditioning in rodent models of autism and related disorders. These include a recent paper in Nature Communications from Piochon et al. (with some of the same authors as Kloth et al.) that documents eyelid conditioning deficits in one of the same mouse lines that is used in the present study. While it is true that the present manuscript shows that eyelid conditioning deficits are common to several different autism models, there doesn't seem to me any compelling pattern or mechanistic explanation for the various deficits that the authors observe in the various models. The facts that (1) the deficits are fairly subtle and vary across the different lines and (2) many of the disrupted genes are expressed outside the cerebellum and/or at multiple sites within the cerebellum make it impossible to link the phenotypes with known models/mechanisms of cerebellar learning. The authors\u2019 attempts to make such links in the Discussion were not convincing."
