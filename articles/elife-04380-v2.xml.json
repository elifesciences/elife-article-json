                    "text": "Biological homeostasis invokes modulatory responses aimed at stabilizing internal conditions. Using tunable photo- and mechano-stimulation, we identified two distinct categories of homeostatic responses during the sleep-like state of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (lethargus). In the presence of weak or no stimuli, extended motion caused a subsequent extension of quiescence. The neuropeptide Y receptor homolog, NPR-1, and an inhibitory neuropeptide known to activate it, FLP-18, were required for this process. In the presence of strong stimuli, the correlations between motion and quiescence were disrupted for several minutes but homeostasis manifested as an overall elevation of the time spent in quiescence. This response to strong stimuli required the function of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in neurons, but not that of NPR-1. Conversely, response to weak stimuli did not require the function of DAF-16/FOXO. These findings suggest that routine homeostatic stabilization of sleep may be distinct from homeostatic compensation following a strong disturbance."

Using tunable photo- and mechano-stimulation, we identified two distinct categories of homeostatic responses during the sleep-like state of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (lethargus). In the presence of weak or no stimuli, extended motion caused a subsequent extension of quiescence. The neuropeptide Y receptor homolog, NPR-1, and an inhibitory neuropeptide known to activate it, FLP-18, were required for this process. In the presence of strong stimuli, the correlations between motion and quiescence were disrupted for several minutes but homeostasis manifested as an overall elevation of the time spent in quiescence. This response to strong stimuli required the function of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in neurons, but not that of NPR-1. Conversely, response to weak stimuli did not require the function of DAF-16/FOXO. These findings suggest that routine homeostatic stabilization of sleep may be distinct from homeostatic compensation following a strong disturbance."

Collectively, the use of both mammalian and non-mammalian models has suggested that sleep is phylogenetically ancient and evolutionarily conserved (<a href=\"#bib10\">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sehgal and Mignot, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nelson and Raizen, 2013</a>).

Generally, the homeostatic drive underlies correlations between the strength and duration of a disruption and the subsequent duration and quality of sleep. Behavioral signatures of homeostasis include faster time-courses of wake-to-sleep transitions, prolonged periods of sleep, and increased arousal thresholds following a period of deprivation that increases sleep pressure (<a href=\"#bib58\">Moses et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tobler, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hendricks et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allada and Siegel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>)."

The homeostatic responses to strong stimuli required the function of the DAF-16/FOXO in neurons (see also <a href=\"#bib23\">Driver et al., 2013</a>) but not the function of NPR-1.

However, even undisturbed animals compensate for spontaneous prolonged motion with prolonged quiescence during lethargus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Iwanir et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, a mechanism that dynamically stabilizes lethargus behavior may be invoked by motion in quiet or weakly noisy environments. If so, weak stimuli should transiently skew the bout architecture by elongating motion bouts and causing a subsequent (compensatory) extension of quiescence bouts. To test this, we first exposed wild-type animals at the fourth intermolt larval stage, L4int, to pulses of blue light of intensities ranging from 0.3\u2013100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and measured their responses using the frame subtraction method. In brief, this method consists of digitally recording the behavior of the animals and assessing the levels of motion and quiescence based on the number of pixels that change their brightness between consecutive frames (see <a href=\"#bib59\">Nagy et al., 2014</a>). The observed responses depended on the light intensity and the duration of the stimulus, and we determined that a 15 s pulse of light at an intensity of 20\u201340 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> evoked weak, reproducible responses (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1,2</a>). Interestingly, we noted that 5 s pulses failed to produce a sharp response specifically during lethargus. This suggested that the animals were less responsive during lethargus and that reduced responsiveness could be assayed separately from delayed responsiveness (<a href=\"#bib66\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>)."

In contrast, during L4leth the average level of locomotion crossed its baseline 1 min after it peaked, proceeded to fall below it for 2\u20133 additional min (p &lt; 0.01), and only then stabilized at baseline levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The transient trough in locomotion resulted from an increase in the fraction of time the animals were quiescent rather than from slower motion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

The increase in the fraction of time spent in quiescence after the stimulus was removed could have been caused by an extension of quiescence bouts, shortening of motion bouts, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we turned to an accurate and computationally intensive behavioral analysis. This previously described approach was based on continuous measurements of the dynamics of body posture at high temporal and spatial resolutions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Iwanir et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nagy et al., 2014</a>). Using this analysis and a 15 s weak light stimulus, we measured the durations of bouts of motion and quiescence after the stimulus was turned off. We found that, during the first half of lethargus, the compensatory response was comprised of an increase and a decrease in the durations of quiescence and motion bouts, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, p &lt; 0.01). During the second half of lethargus, a compensatory increase in the durations of quiescence bouts was still observed. Taken together, these findings revealed that motion during non- or weakly-interrupted lethargus, but not during the L4int or YA stages, caused a compensatory transient increase in quiescence."

Having controlled for the mere durations, we found a significant effect of the level of locomotion on the duration of the subsequent quiescence bout (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, right panel). A similar analysis, performed exclusively on bouts that contained directed motion, considered the separation between the two groups based on the fraction of the bout spent in directed motion and produced similar results (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We thus conclude that enhanced or directed locomotion during a bout of a given duration positively affects subsequent quiescence."

In contrast, the strong stimulus disrupted the architecture of behavior during lethargus: it was followed by several minutes of enhanced motion and a monotonous relaxation to baseline quiescence levels. Upon return to baseline, quiescence bouts were not transiently extended such that a peak in quiescence was not observed. However, compensation took on a different form: the overall level of baseline quiescence was elevated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). This overall elevation of quiescence was consistent with previously reported compensation after strong stimulation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Driver et al., 2013</a>). These results suggested that there were two regimes of disruption and compensation. Weak perturbations resulted in a transient modulation of bout durations that did not disrupt (and could even enhance) the characteristic correlations of the bouts architecture.

The data were aligned by the time of the onset of the stimulus and then averaged. Plots depict mean \u00b1 s.e.m. In agreement with the frame subtraction measurements, the compensatory enhancement of quiescence fraction shortly after the stimulus was nearly abolished in <i>npr-1</i> mutants. N = 14 and 13 animals (<i>ky13</i> and <i>ad609</i>). (<b>D</b>) A posture-based analysis of bout dynamics of <i>npr-1</i> mutants following a weak stimulus.

Using the frame subtraction method, we could not detect significant compensation following the excess motion induced by the stimulus in either of the two mutant strains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The posture-based analysis confirmed their severe defect in modulation of bout durations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). The overall activity and, in particular, the initial response of <i>npr-1</i> mutants to the weak stimulus were similar to wild-type. This indicated that the mutants were not defective in sensing the stimulus or in their locomotory capabilities but specifically in their ability to compensate for a weak disturbance. In contrast, <i>npr-1</i> mutants exhibited wild-type-like compensation following strong mechanical stimuli: when animals carrying either of the two mutant alleles were exposed to a strong mechanical stimulus, their baseline fraction of quiescence was elevated as compared to non stimulated or weakly stimulated animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Thus, in addition to the phenotypic differences described above, homeostatic compensation during undisturbed or weakly disturbed lethargus was affected by NPR-1, while homeostatic compensation for strong stimuli was not. We concluded that the routine stabilization of lethargus behavior in low-noise environments and the homeostatic compensation for stressful disturbances were mechanistically separable. These findings are consistent with a model in which NPR-1 modulates quiescence during lethargus in response to spontaneous or induced mild variations in locomotion."

Nevertheless, pairwise correlations between subsequent bouts in these mutants were abolished (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This could indicate that the absence of a group of functional neuropeptides impaired the dynamic extension of quiescence bouts in response to variations in durations and compositions of motion bouts. Alternatively, the quiescence bouts of <i>unc-31</i> mutants may be too short to sustain detectable correlations. We favor the first explanation for two reasons. First, the Hawaiian strain (a wild isolate of <i>C. elegans</i>) exhibited quiescence bouts that were comparable in duration to those of <i>unc-31</i> mutants but nevertheless maintained wild-type correlations during minutes 45\u2013120 from the onset of L4leth (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1,2</a>).

To test this, we examined the temporal dynamics of expression during the L4int and L4leth stages of the <i>Pflp-18::flp-18::SL2::gfp</i> reporter, which contains the upstream promoter region and the entire genomic locus of <i>flp-18</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Stawicki et al., 2013</a>). As previously reported, expression was observed in several head and ventral cord (VC) neurons. We measured the total GFP fluorescence in head or VC neurons separately. Expression in head neurons was constant prior to the onset of and during L4leth (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Surprisingly, the reporter expression in VC neurons differed between two sub-populations of animals. When low levels of fluorescence were initially detected during L4int, reporter fluorescence was enhanced more than twofold during the first half of L4leth. In contrast, initially high fluorescence levels were not further enhanced. Expression levels of the reporter in the VC neurons of the two sub-populations were similar during the second half of L4leth (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The absence of a peak in fluorescence during lethargus in the initially strongly fluorescent sub-population may have resulted from non-physiological effects of overexpression. Alternatively, it may be the case that the shift in <i>flp-18</i> expression or secretion can precede the onset of lethargus or be conditioned on ambient levels during late L4int."

Although micro-homeostasis responses occur on a timescale that is too short to be regulated by changes in transcription, repeated weak stimuli may still be stressful. To test the roles of DAF-16 in regulating homeostasis during lethargus, we assayed <i>daf-16(mu86)</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Libina et al., 2003</a>) mutants under no-, weak-, and strong-stimulus conditions. These mutants were similar to wild-type in their total fraction of quiescence, their initial responses to weak stimuli and subsequent compensation, their responses outside of lethargus to weak and to strong stimuli, and their initial responses during lethargus to strong stimuli. When not disturbed, the quiescence bouts of <i>daf-16</i> mutants were shorter than wild-type (data not shown) and their pairwise correlations between subsequent bouts were smaller, but not abolished (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>).

Broad expression of a rescue gene, or even a fluorescent reporter, often results in subtle changes in locomotion and quiescence that our assays are able to detect. Nevertheless, the data raised the possibility of a ceiling effect for quiescence in these experiments. Two observations suggest that, plausibly, this is not the case: (i) similar differences in undisturbed baseline quiescence were observed between the two <i>npr-1</i> mutant alleles, yet both strains exhibited compensation for strong stimuli (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>); and (ii) undisturbed baseline quiescence in all <i>daf-16</i> strains was similar to <i>npr-1(ky13)</i> mutants and lower than wild-type. Therefore, we favor the interpretation that the function of DAF-16 was required in neurons in our assays. Importantly, the opposing phenotypes of <i>npr-1</i> and <i>daf-16</i> mutants show that micro-homeostasis, routinely used to stabilize bout architecture in weakly noisy environments, is genetically distinct from the homeostatic responses that strong and stressful disturbances invoke."

We have shown that during lethargus, motion plays a causal role in modulating the duration of subsequent quiescence. Under low noise conditions, micro-homeostasis manifested as a dependence of the duration of quiescence bouts on the duration and nature of recently preceding motion. The dynamic extension of quiescence bouts depended on the function of an NPY receptor-like protein (NPR-1). However, this did not require DAF-16/FOXO, perhaps because transcriptional level control is typically too slow to respond dynamically on timescales of 10s of seconds (<a href=\"#bib91\">Yosef and Regev, 2011</a>). Since biological mechanisms naturally function in a continuous range of conditions, it was both expected and observed that similar mechanisms regulated the compensatory responses in the presence of weak or no stimuli. However, homeostasis in the presence of strong stimuli was behaviorally and mechanistically distinct. A strong disturbance resulted in the temporary disruption of normal bout dynamics followed by a compensatory upshift of baseline levels of quiescence. These responses did require the function of DAF-16/FOXO but not of NPR-1."

Nevertheless, the sleep literature generally regards sleep homeostasis as a single mechanism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Borb\u00e9ly, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Daan et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hendricks et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Saper et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andretic et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mackiewicz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cirelli, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Crocker and Sehgal, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nelson and Raizen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Porkka-Heiskanen, 2013</a>). To our knowledge, responses to weak disturbances to sleep were not previously carefully analyzed, and the distinction between routine stabilization and compensation for stressful agitation was not examined in detail."

NPY was implicated in the regulation of sleep in humans, rats, fruit flies, and nematodes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Antonijevic et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">T\u00f3th et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dyzma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Van den Pol, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Choi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">He et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nagy et al., 2014</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, the NPY receptor homolog NPR-1 affects a range of responses to external stimuli, as well as innate behaviors such as social feeding and quiescence (<a href=\"#bib21\">De Bono and Bargmann, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">De Bono et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Davies et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Macosko et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">McGrath et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Choi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nagy et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, NPR-1 was found to play a major role in both lethargus micro-homeostasis (this study) and the homeostatic response to a motoneuron imbalance. In the latter case, NPR-1 was required to compensate for cholinergic overexcitation and GABAergic inhibition that were caused by a gain-of-function in a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<a href=\"#bib76\">Stawicki et al., 2013</a>). We hypothesize that these two types of homeostatic responses are closely linked, and further studies will be required to conclusively determine if this is the case."

The apparent discrepancy between the phenotypes of <i>egl-3</i>/<i>egl-21</i> and <i>unc-31</i> mutants suggests that quiescence may be regulated by the combinatorial action of excitatory and inhibitory neuropeptides and that this combinatorial regulation promotes responsive bout dynamics. Our findings are consistent with a model in which activity during lethargus generates a \u2018pressure\u2019 which is ameliorated during periods of quiescence. A particular balance of inhibitory and excitatory neuropeptides may be required for keeping a record of and/or for the process of alleviating this pressure."

This suggests that bouts of motion are not analogous to brief intervals of wakefulness. Rather, <i>C. elegans</i> sleep may progress through two alternating micro-states."

They find two distinct levels of homeostasis separable phenomenologically by the response to disturbing stimuli.

Thus, the routine stabilization of lethargus behavior in low-noise environments and the homeostatic compensation for stressful disturbances are mechanistically separable.

Therefore, in the data presented the distinction between \u201c5 minutes before\u201d and \u201c10 minutes after\u201d a stimulus is not a meaningful one. In the averaged data, both \u201c5 minutes before\u2026\u201d or \u201c10 minutes after\u2026\u201d would refer to the very same time point, namely the time point at 2/3 of the interval between two consecutive stimuli. In other words, the averaged data has periodic boundaries. Graphically, this can be represented by plotting this data on a circular time axis where \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d are indistinguishable (as long as the fraction of quiescence is in its steady state)."

After this short-term response was complete, the fraction of quiescence returned to a steady state characteristic of the conditions of the experiment. The fraction of time spent in quiescence during this steady state was defined as the baseline level of quiescence for the relevant experimental conditions. In this framework, baselines were compared between different conditions. Elevation of the steady state quiescence, as compared to the mean quiescence of undisturbed animals, constituted the sustained response to the presence of repeated strong stimuli."

Thus, the routine stabilization of lethargus behavior in low-noise environments and the homeostatic compensation for stressful disturbances are mechanistically separable. These findings are consistent with a model in which NPR-1 dynamically modulates quiescence during lethargus in response to spontaneous or induced mild variations in locomotion.\u201d Specifically the phrase '...regulated by NPR-1...' must be altered to something more in line with the data like '...affected by...' or '...required...' and the word 'dynamically' removed ('...dynamically modulates...')</i>."
