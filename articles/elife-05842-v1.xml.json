Previous mathematical models that invoke the mechanism of delayed negative feedback predict the oscillation period depends on the sum of delays in negative-feedback loops and the inhibitor half-lives. We develop a model to explore the possibility positive feedback also plays a role. The model predicts increasing the half-life of the positive regulator, Notch intracellular domain (NICD), can lead to elevated NICD levels and an increase in the oscillation period. To test this, we investigate a phenotype induced by various small molecule inhibitors in which the clock is slowed. We observe elevated levels and prolonged half-life of NICD. Reducing NICD production rescues these effects. These data provide the first indication tight control of the turnover of positive as well as negative regulators of the clock determines its periodicity."
