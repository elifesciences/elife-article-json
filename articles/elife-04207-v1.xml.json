In this study, we explore the targets of FOXL2 and five nuclear receptors in murine primary follicular cells. We found that FOXL2 is required for normal gene regulation by steroid receptors, and we show that estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) is the main vector of estradiol signaling in these cells. Moreover, we found that FOXL2 directly modulates <i>Esr2</i> expression through a newly identified intronic element. Interestingly, we found that FOXL2 repressed the testis-determining gene <i>Sox9</i> both independently of estrogen signaling and through the activation of ESR2 expression. Altogether, we show that FOXL2 mobilizes estrogen signaling to establish a coherent feed-forward loop repressing <i>Sox9</i>. This sheds a new light on the role of FOXL2 in ovarian maintenance and function."

In this study, we explore the targets of FOXL2 and five nuclear receptors in murine primary follicular cells. We found that FOXL2 is required for normal gene regulation by steroid receptors, and we show that estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) is the main vector of estradiol signaling in these cells. Moreover, we found that FOXL2 directly modulates <i>Esr2</i> expression through a newly identified intronic element. Interestingly, we found that FOXL2 repressed the testis-determining gene <i>Sox9</i> both independently of estrogen signaling and through the activation of ESR2 expression. Altogether, we show that FOXL2 mobilizes estrogen signaling to establish a coherent feed-forward loop repressing <i>Sox9</i>. This sheds a new light on the role of FOXL2 in ovarian maintenance and function."

Indeed, mature granulosa cells are absent in <i>Foxl2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice because pre-granulosa cells remain blocked and do not undergo further differentiation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Schmidt et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, depletion of <i>Foxl2</i> in already mature granulosa cells in mice results in their (molecular) transdifferentiation and in the upregulation of markers of Sertoli cells, the male counterpart of granulosa cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</a>). In humans, FOXL2 heterozygous mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), characterized by facial malformations often associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Crisponi et al., 2001</a>). Recent works have shown that FOXL2 mutations impairing its DNA binding and/or transcriptional activity are responsible for POI occurrence in BPES (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dipietromaria et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Todeschini et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, a specific somatic mutation of FOXL2 has been identified in more than 95% of adult-type granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) confirming the strong association of FOXL2 with granulosa cell fate and function (<a href=\"#bib23\">Shah et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Jamieson and Fuller, 2012</a>)."

This is in particular due to the difficulty to study the pre-granulosa-to-granulosa cell transition. FOXL2 transcriptional targets have been studied using various models such as GCT-derived cell lines or ovaries from constitutive knockout mice, preventing thus far to fully understand the function of FOXL2 in healthy granulosa cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Georges et al., 2014</a>). However, there are some well established facts such as the cooperation between FOXL2 and SMAD3 on several enhancers, in particular one driving the expression of follistatin, a key factor of ovarian function (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blount et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Tran et al., 2011</a>, 3). FOXL2 has also been described to interact with the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) in mouse ovaries to repress the expression of <i>Sox9</i>, an essential transcriptional regulator of Sertoli cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, mice depleted of both estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) display a transdifferentiation of granulosa cells apparently similar to that observed when <i>Foxl2</i> is depleted in mature cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Couse et al., 1999</a>). FOXL2 interacts with many other transcription factors of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, such as NR5A1 (also known as Steroidogenic factor 1, SF-1), an orphan NR critical for gonadal development; NR2C1, another orphan NR whose paralog NR2C2 is involved in folliculogenesis, and the progesterone receptor PGR (<a href=\"#bib21\">Park et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">L\u2019h\u00f4te et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ghochani et al., 2012</a>).

This work was performed in murine primary follicular cells using a knockdown approach coupled to high-throughput genomic technologies. These analyses allowed us to uncover a thorough core of FOXL2 transcriptional targets in preantral-small antral follicles, which includes many key genes of ovarian function. A ChIP-Seq analysis of FOXL2 genomic binding sites in these cells suggests that it mainly binds to regions located in the introns of its targets, and provides a resource of potential regulatory elements. We find that FOXL2 strongly influences gene regulation by estrogen and androgen receptors. Moreover, we show that FOXL2 is required for normal expression of <i>Esr2</i> through a newly identified <i>Esr2</i> intronic regulatory element and that ESR2 is the main effector of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) signaling in these cells. FOXL2 is also required for the expression of <i>Cyp19a1</i>, which encodes the limiting enzyme in estrogen production, and FOXL2, ESR2 and estradiol all participate in SOX9 repression. Our data show that FOXL2 expression establishes a coherent subnetwork allowing estrogen production and signaling in granulosa cells as well as the maintenance of granulosa identity through an indirect repression of SOX9."

Specifically, we purified preantral-small antral follicles from the ovaries of 8-week-old female Swiss mice. After an overnight culture, the follicles were dispersed using trypsin and cells were grown for a maximum of 8 days. Follicular cells are known to progressively (trans)differentiate in culture, by upregulating markers of Sertoli cells or by luteinizing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Nekola and Nalbandov, 1971</a>). We therefore verified by immunofluorescence that the expression of FOXL2, which is absent in luteinized cells, was maintained throughout culture and that SOX9 was not substantially upregulated. We observed a similar level of FOXL2 expression in follicles cultured for one night as in 9-day cultured cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). SOX9 upregulation was observed in about 20% of the cells. However, we could check that the known FOXL2-mediated repression of <i>Sox9</i> was still operant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Indeed, upregulation of SOX9 could be detected as soon as 24 hr after treating the cells with a commercial siRNA pool targeting FOXL2, and its expression continued to increase 48 hr after treatment. This stresses the importance of limiting the interval between knockdown and RNA analysis to assess the direct and indirect targets of FOXL2, as transcriptional changes can also occur because of SOX9 upregulation. We also verified that we could detect the expression of six NRs of interest (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We observed that <i>Ar, Esr2</i> and <i>Nr5a1</i> were the most expressed NRs, and in particular that <i>Esr2</i> was at least four times more expressed than <i>Esr1</i> in these cells, in agreement with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lenie and Smitz, 2008</a>). Since progesterone receptor was very poorly expressed, we removed it from the analysis. We focused instead on the targets of the androgen receptor, which is required for terminal folliculogenesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Walters et al., 2012</a>)."

We verified siRNA efficiency by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We observed a systematic decrease of more than 70% of the targeted mRNAs. We also noticed that <i>Esr2</i> expression was reduced by about 50% following <i>Foxl2</i> knockdown, suggesting that FOXL2 activates <i>Esr2</i> expression. As expected, <i>Sox9</i> expression was repressed by both FOXL2 and ESR2, as it increased in the absence of either of them, and even more in the absence of both. On the contrary, NR5A1 was required to activate <i>Sox9</i> expression. These results recapitulate well-known in vivo findings (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</a>) and confirm these primary cells are suitable to study the transcriptional regulation by FOXL2 and its interplay with NRs."

Specifically, we treated cells on the one hand with control or FOXL2-targeting siRNAs and on the other hand with control siRNAs or siRNAs targeting each of the NRs. This experimental design gave us six different conditions in which we could study the transcriptional targets of FOXL2 independently of the action of the NRs. We thus used a paired <i>Significance Analysis of Microarrays</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Tusher et al., 2001</a>). This analysis detected 863 genes whose expression was modified by FOXL2 with a median false discovery rate &lt;0.1%. Among them, we selected the genes undergoing an expression fold-change of at least 1.5. We thus obtained a list of 224 FOXL2-activated targets (i.e., with decreased expression in the absence of FOXL2) and 139 repressed genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). This list contained previously known targets of FOXL2 such as <i>Fst</i> (follistatin); <i>Ptgs2</i>, encoding a cyclo-oxygenase required for folliculogenesis; <i>Fos</i>, coding for a subunit of the AP-1 transcription factor; <i>Cyp19a1</i>, encoding the aromatase enzyme; and <i>Bmpr1b</i>, coding for a BMP receptor. Many other genes known to be critical for folliculogenesis and/or ovulation were also among the FOXL2-activated targets, including <i>Foxo1</i>, <i>Gja1</i> (a.k.a<i>. connexin 43</i>), <i>Ereg</i> (coding for the EGF-like Epiregulin), <i>Ptger2</i>, or <i>Has2</i>. Some FOXL2-repressed genes are involved in testis development, such as <i>Sox9</i>, <i>Dhh</i>, and <i>Sox8</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Yao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Georg et al., 2012</a>). An analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment showed that FOXL2 targets were characterized by keywords such as <i>cell adhesion</i> (p = 3.10<sup>\u22129</sup>), <i>regulation of cell proliferation</i> (p = 7.10<sup>\u22127</sup>), and <i>regulation of hormone levels</i> (p = 1.10<sup>\u22128</sup>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Other enriched terms were <i>reproductive structure development</i> (p = 3.10<sup>\u22125</sup>) and <i>developmental growth</i> (p = 2.10<sup>\u22125</sup>). The Panther Classification system showed that FOXL2 targets were enriched in genes involved in <i>cell communication</i> (p = 6.10<sup>\u22126</sup>) and <i>signal transduction</i> (p = 1.10<sup>\u22125</sup>). In particular, some of the most strongly activated targets are major players of important signal transduction pathways such as <i>Grem1</i> and <i>Grem2,</i> encoding BMP antagonists; <i>Rgs2</i> and <i>Rgs4,</i> encoding regulators of G-protein signaling, and the NRs <i>Esr2</i> and <i>Pparg</i>."

Out of 345 FOXL2 target genes also present in the data set of Uhlenhaut et al., 71 were similarly affected following <i>Foxl2</i> deletion in the ovary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

FOXL2 ablation in granulosa cells results in a loss of their identity and in the appearance of testis-like structures, making difficult to evaluate which genes are first affected by the loss of FOXL2. These common targets may thus represent the early responders to FOXL2 deletion and play a critical role in the maintenance of granulosa cell identity, whereas other differentially expressed genes in the ovaries of mutant mice may be affected following the transdifferentiation of granulosa cells.

Consistently, the absence of FOXL2 led to halving the average transcriptional effect of ESR2 and AR on their target genes, whereas target modulation by NR5A1 underwent only a slight decrease (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

                                "text": "To better understand how FOXL2 regulates its direct transcriptional targets, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (anti-FOXL2 ChIP-seq) in primary follicular cells. Using MACS as the peak detection algorithm, we detected about 14,000 peaks suggestive of FOXL2 binding to chromatin (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). The analysis of these peaks revealed a highly enriched sequence corresponding to the characteristic motif of <i>forkhead</i> factors (5\u2032-G/A-T-A-A-A-C/T-A-3\u2032), with a very narrow enrichment window centered at the peak summits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We analyzed the positions of FOXL2 peaks with respect to the annotated loci on the genome and found that transcription start sites (TSSs) were strongly enriched in FOXL2 peaks (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). They were especially present within \u2212300 bp and +100 bp around the TSSs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, to our surprise, when we correlated the presence of FOXL2 peaks with the transcriptional effects of the <i>Foxl2</i> knockdown, we observed that the former were not over-represented near the TSSs (or the promoter regions) of its transcriptional targets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, we detected a strong enrichment of FOXL2 peaks in the regions containing the transcription units (TUs, extending from the TSS to the annotated polyA signal) of FOXL2-activated targets, but not in the TUs of the repressed ones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This observation was even more striking considering only the 71 \u2018in vivo\u2019 FOXL2 targets (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Since the TUs of protein coding genes are largely composed of introns (in terms of sequence length), this suggests that FOXL2 acts mainly through intronic regulatory elements (as previously described for <i>Fst</i>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blount et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, a majority of FOXL2-activated targets had FOXL2 peaks in their introns (examples in the <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggestive of the existence of potential regulatory elements recognized by FOXL2, although some target genes had no peak within their TUs (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The enrichment of FOXL2 peaks in the TSSs may thus be a consequence of the decondensed chromatin state of these regions (i.e., nonfunctional binding). This observation is worth noting because the presence of ChIP peaks for transcription factors at TSSs is widely used as a criterion suggesting active transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ouyang et al., 2009</a>), although as shown here for FOXL2, it may not always be the case. Interestingly, FOXL2-repressed genes were not enriched in FOXL2 peaks, in or at the proximity (50 kb) of their TUs. This notably included the testis determining genes <i>Sox9</i>, <i>Sox8</i>, and <i>Dhh</i>, suggesting that their repression by FOXL2 may be mostly indirect, at least in these cultured cells (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

A sequence analysis of these elements showed that peak 3 contained a 20-bp DNA sequence composed of contiguous FOXL2, GATA, and SMAD elements (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and that peak 2 contained several potential FOXL2 elements. Conversely, peak 1 contained no obvious sequences corresponding to FOXL2 or SMAD3 motifs. To test whether these peaks could be regulatory elements, we cloned each of them upstream of a minimal SV40 promoter driving the expression of the luciferase gene. Next, we co-transfected these constructs with plasmids driving the expression of FOXL2 and SMAD3 in COV434 cells, human granulosa-derived cells, which are advantageous in this case as they do not express FOXL2 and very poorly express SMAD3. These cells were then treated with Activin A or a control solution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We found that neither FOXL2 nor SMAD3 could activate the expression of luciferase through the peak 1 sequence, whereas only FOXL2 could activate luciferase expression through the peak 2 sequence. Interestingly, FOXL2 and SMAD3 synergistically activated luciferase expression through the peak 3 sequence (located in the 8<sup>th</sup> intron of <i>Esr2</i>), and this effect was enhanced when the cells were treated with Activin A. This observation was confirmed when we expressed a constitutively active Activin receptor (TGFBR1-T204D), suggesting that the observed effect is mediated by the canonical TGF-\u03b2 pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This is coherent with the presence of a FOXL2/SMAD3 composite element in the peak 3 sequence. We therefore created constructs where we mutated either the FOXL2 or the SMAD3 site in the composite element, and a construct in which the whole element was removed. As expected, we observed a strong reduction of luciferase expression when the SMAD3 or FOXL2 elements were mutated or when the whole composite element was removed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, \u2018full peak 3\u2019 series). However, a weaker synergistic activation of luciferase expression by FOXL2 and SMAD3 remained even in the absence of FOXL2 and SMAD3 elements, suggesting that other non-canonical DNA elements or interactions may account for part of FOXL2/SMAD3 synergy."

                                "text": "We observed that a canonical estrogen receptor-binding site was present nearby FOXL2 and SMAD3 sites in the peak 3 sequence. We therefore tested whether ESR2 could activate its own expression, alone or in combination with FOXL2 and TGF\u03b2/SMAD3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Interestingly, we observed that the overexpression of ESR2 alone or in combination with SMAD3 and TGFBR1 (T204D) had little effect on luciferase activity. However, ESR2 was able to slightly induce luciferase in the presence of FOXL2 and more strongly in the presence of FOXL2, SMAD3, and TGFBR1 (T204D). Therefore, this experiment suggests that the induction of <i>Esr2</i> expression due to FOXL2 and TGF\u03b2 signals may be amplified by ESR2 action on its own enhancer, although ESR2 itself may not be able to stabilize alone its own expression. This further supports the idea that FOXL2 is required to establish a robust ESR2 expression in the ovary. Several observations corroborate this finding. Indeed, the transcriptional effect of <i>Foxl2</i> knockdown is well correlated with the one of ESR2 on its target genes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thirteen out of the 20 ESR2 target genes detected here are also (direct and indirect) targets of FOXL2. These shared targets represent slightly more than 10% of FOXL2 targets, confirming that FOXL2 acts upstream of ESR2. In line with this, a hierarchical clustering of FOXL2-activated targets yields two main clusters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The first cluster is mainly characterized by a strong effect of <i>Esr2</i> knockdown and includes ESR2 transcriptional targets, whereas no particular signature was observed for the second cluster (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results show that gene regulation via, or along with, ESR2 may represent an important part of the transcriptional effects of FOXL2. Moreover, a third of the ESR2 targets in cultured cells, and <i>Esr2</i> itself, had a decreased expression in the <i>Foxl2</i> conditional-knockout ovaries, suggesting that FOXL2 regulates ESR2 (and its targets) in vivo (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Finally, it is interesting to note that although FOXL2 has a strong positive transcriptional effect on ESR2 targets in control conditions, it has in average no effect on the same genes when <i>Esr2</i> is knocked down (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). FOXL2 still activates a few genes, such as <i>Fam84a</i>, although to lower extents (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). This suggests that the overall positive effect of FOXL2 on ESR2 targets is indeed due to the activation by FOXL2 of ESR2 expression, although FOXL2 may also have some positive or negative effects on individual ESR2 targets through independent pathways."

We therefore analyzed the transcriptomic changes following a 10 hr 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) treatment of primary granulosa cells pre-treated for 24 hr with either anti-FOXL2 or control siRNAs. We considered as potential targets those genes in the microarrays whose expression displayed a fold-change &gt;2 in the presence of E2. We found 41 genes responding to estradiol according to our inclusion threshold, 39 of which were activated and only 2 were repressed.

Not surprisingly, E2 activation was mostly maintained in the absence of ESR1, but it was strongly decreased upon <i>Esr2</i> knockdown. This is coherent with the correlation of the effect of E2 with only the effect of ESR2 and confirms that ESR2 is the main effector of estradiol signaling in these primary cells. The same experiment in the presence of anti-FOXL2 siRNAs showed a 40% reduction of E2-dependent gene activation, similar to what was observed on microarrays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

As expected considering our transcriptomic analyses, we observed that SOX9 expression was upregulated in the absence of either FOXL2 or ESR2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). SOX9 expression was much higher in the absence of both ESR2 and FOXL2. This confirms that estrogen receptors and FOXL2 co-regulate SOX9 expression (<a href=\"#bib27\">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, our transcriptomic analyses indicate that FOXL2 is required for the expression of <i>Cyp19a1</i> (encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in estradiol production) both in the presence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and in the absence of hormones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, FOXL2 may allow both estradiol production and enable estrogen signaling in the same cells. These data suggest the existence of a coherent feed-forward loop in which FOXL2 stimulates both estradiol production and receptivity (i.e., ESR2 expression) that might be responsible at least in part for the maintenance of granulosa cell identity by repressing the testis determinant Sox9."

We therefore deprived follicular cells of hormones for 24 hr before treating them with siRNA pools for 24 hr, and finally with E2 for 10 hr before lysis. We observed that E2 treatment induced a repression of SOX9 expression, in coherence with our transcriptomic analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). <i>Esr1</i> knockdown, on the other hand, had no clear effect on SOX9 expression or on the efficiency of SOX9 repression following E2 treatment. However, we observed that ESR2 knockdown resulted in an increase of SOX9 expression even in the virtual absence of hormones and that E2-induced repression was reduced in the absence of ESR2. Finally, SOX9 expression was much increased in the absence of FOXL2, but E2 was still efficient in repressing <i>SOX9</i> in this case. Altogether, our data show that FOXL2 and ESR2/E2 repress somewhat independently SOX9 expression in follicular cells. It has previously been suggested that FOXL2 and ESR1 bind together to a Testis-specific enhancer of <i>Sox9</i> to repress its expression. Here, we have detected no binding of FOXL2 to this sequence or to any other close sequence in our ChIP-Seq analysis. It is possible that the binding was lost during cell culture or that it occurs at a different stage of follicular development. However, the fact that FOXL2/E2 repression of SOX9 is still operant in our case suggests that several pathways orchestrated by FOXL2 cooperate to repress SOX9 expression in these cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Indeed, we show that FOXL2 is essential for Activin-dependent up-regulation of <i>Esr2</i> in follicular cells. This involves synergistic interactions between FOXL2 and SMAD3 on a regulatory element located within the 8<sup>th</sup> intron of the <i>Esr2</i> gene. Furthermore, we were able to show that ESR2 is the main vector of estradiol signaling in cells from preantral follicles, which is coherent with the fact that <i>Esr2</i> is much more expressed than <i>Esr1</i> in such growing follicles. Previous studies also suggested that ESR1 is poorly expressed in granulosa cells of growing follicles whereas ESR2 was often described as the main estrogen receptor in these cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lenie and Smitz, 2008</a>). We provide evidence that FOXL2 has a major indirect impact on estradiol signaling through its direct regulation of <i>Esr2</i>. This role of FOXL2 on ESR2 signaling is also likely to exist in vivo (i.e., in the ovary) and expands its already known role in estrogen production through the regulation of aromatase expression, confirmed here. This suggests the existence of a coherent feed-forward loop in which FOXL2 stimulates both E2 production and receptivity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) to maintain granulosa cell identity, as FOXL2, ESR2 and E2 all participate in SOX9 repression. This model is complementary of a previously proposed mechanism in which FOXL2 and ESR1 directly cooperated to repress <i>Sox9</i> expression though the TESCO enhancer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</a>). We could not detect any binding of FOXL2 nor ESR1 to this region in our cells (data not shown), whereas the ability of FOXL2 and estrogens to repress <i>Sox9</i> was still present. Moreover, this repression acted both through ESR2/E2 and independently of estrogens. This shows that FOXL2 represses <i>Sox9</i> and maintains ovarian identity through multiple pathways, some of them yet to be discovered. Our results are fully coherent with a recent study showing that <i>Foxl2</i> deletion almost fully abolishes testis feminization due to <i>Dmrt1</i> deletion, while <i>Esr2</i> deletion only partially affects feminization (<a href=\"#bib18\">Minkina et al. 2014</a>). Further work will be necessary to fully characterize this repression and to identify other signaling pathways implicated in granulosa cell differentiation. We are aware that our in vitro system is sub-optimal and that follicular cells can undergo some degree of trans-differentiation over the course of the culture period. Thus, our results will benefit from validation in vivo as methods to work with small amounts of material improve in the future."

Disruption of each of these pathways in the ovary is a cause of POI and their malfunction is commonly associated with oncogenesis and cancer progression. In this context, our finding that FOXL2 is required of proper estradiol signaling in the ovary may thus be an initial step towards a better molecular appraisal of the role of FOXL2 in global granulosa cell signaling response and its implication in tumorigenesis."

The amplified cDNAs from the 12 samples were sent to the Nimblegen expression platform (Roche NimbleGen, Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland) in biological duplicates (independent mice pools, primary cultures, amplifications, and hybridizations per RNA sample). Samples were hybridized on two high-density <i>Mus musculus</i> MM9 Gene Expression 12 \u00d7 135K array set, each one allowing the study of 12 samples in parallel and interrogating over 45K annotated transcripts of the Mm9 genome assembly. Nimblegen performed sample labeling, hybridization, and fluorescence acquisition and provided us with normalized data files.

Hybridization was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Raw fluorescence data were extracted using Genespring software v12 (Agilent technologies) and normalized using the 75th centile method in each array. To allow for an easy comparison between the two experiments, we then took for each gene the average expression value of all transcripts. We removed from further analysis the genes for which median fluorescence was under 100 (NimbleGen data) in the first experiment, under 10 in the second experiment (Agilent data). Values were then log2 normalized and subtracted of the median value for each replicate.

By using primary granulosa cell cultures, the authors have overcome some of the limitations of cell numbers involved in studying <i>in vivo</i> ovarian function. Consistent with findings from previous publications, the authors have shown that FOXL2 activates genes that are crucial for normal granulosa cell function (folliculogenesis and ovulation), and represses genes that are involved in testis development (male-determining transcription factor SOX9) and thus the maintenance of granulosa cell identity. Additionally, the results from ChIP-seq have provided further insights on how FOXL2 regulate its transcriptional targets. By correlating the ChIP-seq data with the gene expression knockdown data, the authors have demonstrated that FOXL2 acts predominantly through intronic regulatory elements, particularly for FOXL2-activated targets. Moreover, the authors were also able to show that FOXL2 directly modulates ESR2 expression via a previously uncharacterized intronic element to regulate estrogen signaling in granulosa cells. Lastly, the authors proposed a feed-forward mechanism by which FOXL2 increases estrogen production (through CYP19A gene induction) and activates ESR2 expression to reinforce its repressive effects on SOX9 expression. This manuscript is a nice addition to the current literature on FOXL2 and its role in normal ovarian function."

This is a possibility, as cells progressively change during cell culture and it has previously been shown in other fields that regulatory elements may become more or less accessible during this process. FOXL2 binding to the TESCO element was detected in whole ovaries, so it is also possible that the observed binding occurs in granulosa or theca cells not enriched in our culture system. A possible approach would be to carry ChIP on purified follicles at different stages, and ideally on purified theca and granulosa, which can be technically complex. However, the interesting point here is that we still observe that FOXL2 and estrogens/ESR2 do repress SOX9, even if we do not identify the regulatory element(s) mediating this repression. Thus, our data show that several pathways (and/or elements) are mobilized in this process."
