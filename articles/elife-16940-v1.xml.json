However, robustness of this relationship is unknown. We show that superimposition of Estrogen-related receptor gamma (<i>Err\u03b3</i>) on the myostatin (Mtn) mouse null background (<i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i>) results in hypertrophic muscle with a high oxidative capacity thus violating the inverse relationship between fibre size and oxidative capacity. We also examined the canonical view that oxidative muscle phenotype positively correlate with Satellite cell number, the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, hypertrophic fibres from <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> mouse showed satellite cell deficit which unexpectedly did not affect muscle regeneration. These observations 1) challenge the concept of a constraint between fibre size and oxidative capacity and 2) indicate the important role of the microcirculation in the regenerative capacity of a muscle even when satellite cell numbers are reduced."

However, robustness of this relationship is unknown. We show that superimposition of Estrogen-related receptor gamma (<i>Err\u03b3</i>) on the myostatin (Mtn) mouse null background (<i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i>) results in hypertrophic muscle with a high oxidative capacity thus violating the inverse relationship between fibre size and oxidative capacity. We also examined the canonical view that oxidative muscle phenotype positively correlate with Satellite cell number, the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, hypertrophic fibres from <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> mouse showed satellite cell deficit which unexpectedly did not affect muscle regeneration. These observations 1) challenge the concept of a constraint between fibre size and oxidative capacity and 2) indicate the important role of the microcirculation in the regenerative capacity of a muscle even when satellite cell numbers are reduced."

Slow fibres generally have a smaller cross sectional area (CSA), contain more mitochondria which sustain a high oxidative capacity, and a denser microvascular network than fast fibres that rely predominantly on glycolysis for ATP production. Muscle fibres can change their phenotype, such as the expression of MHC, mitochondrial content and capillary supply in response to external stimuli (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pette and Staron, 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2001</a>)."

For instance, it has been shown that the development of the slow muscle fibre phenotype is largely controlled by Protein Kinase C, Calcineurin/NFAT, AMP Activated Protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) and Sex determining region Y-box 6 (Sox6) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gundersen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">von Hofsten et al., 2008</a>). Recently, we have shown that the Estrogenrelated receptor gamma (Err\u03b3) is robustly expressed in slow muscle and can promote the formation of oxidative fibres in a PGC-1\u03b1 independent manner (<a href=\"#bib48\">Narkar et al., 2011</a>). Fast, glycolytic muscle development on the other hand seems to involve the activation of the Akt signalling pathway through the transcriptional regulation by molecules including Baf60c (also called Smarcd3) and T-box 15 (Tbx15) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Meng et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). Lifting the inhibition of Akt signalling mediated by Myostatin is also a potent means of inducing the formation of glycolytic muscle fibres (<a href=\"#bib67\">Trendelenburg et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, a recent study has shown that the DNA binding protein Nuclear Factor I X (Nfix) acts to inhibit the slow muscle phenotype (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rossi et al., 2016</a>)."

This relationship, in theory, ultimately imparts a constraint on the size that mitochondria-rich and therefore high O<sub>2</sub> -dependent oxidative fibres can attain before they become anoxic or adapt to a glycolytic phenotype less reliant on O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Desplanches et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Deveci et al., 2001</a>). The metabolic properties of muscle are believed not only to control fibre size but also the number of satellite cells. A number of correlative studies have described the number of SC increases as a muscle becomes progressively oxidative (<a href=\"#bib57\">Putman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Christov et al., 2007</a>)."

Based on the concept of a constraint between the CSA and oxidative capacity of a fibre we postulated three possible outcomes of the cross: (1) the Akt pathway that is de-repressed due to the absence of Mtn would prevail and lead to hypertrophic, but glycolytic fibres; (2) oxidative features would be imparted by the Err\u03b3 programme that would follow the inverse size relationship and lead to mitochondria-rich fibres which could be smaller than wild-type (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rangwala et al., 2010</a>); (3) the constraint is broken in this strain and results in the development of hypertrophic yet oxidative fibres."

This was attained through the activation of the Akt pathway, increased myoglobin gene expression, relocation of mitochondria to the sub sarcolemma and hyper-capillarisation of the muscle. We show that these modifications not only bring about normalization of many ultrastructural abnormalities in the hypertrophic muscles of <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>\u00a0</i>mice, but the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup>\u00a0</i>mice even outperform wild type mice during an incremental exercise test. Secondly that the hypertrophic oxidative muscles from the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup>\u00a0</i>mice do not follow the dogma regarding metabolism and satellite cells number. We actually show that the metabolic reprogramming in this study led to a decrease in satellite cell number. However, this deficit did not impact at all in terms of the muscle's ability to regenerate. We believe this highlights the importance of the microcirculation during regeneration and has major clinical implications."

First, there were significantly more myonuclei in the fibres of <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup>\u00a0</i>compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>). Secondly, we examined the distribution of myonuclei within a fibre. This is thought to be a regulated process since myonuclei position is important to minimize issues related to macromolecule movement in larger cells. Therefore the degree of regulation is inversely proportional to random positioning of the nuclei (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bruusgaard et al., 2003</a>). In order to quantify this, we calculated the distance to the nearest neighbour for the nuclei located at the periphery of single fibres from WT, <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>\u00a0</i>and <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> mice. Confocal stacks of single fibres labelled with DAPI (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>) were used to generate the 3D coordinates of each nucleus in a fibre (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>) using Imaris software. Using custom made software, a simulation of randomly and optimally distributed nuclei was compared to the actual distribution (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The WT fibres displayed an improvement from a random distribution of 20%. However <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>\u00a0</i>and <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> fibres had distributions that were more random, with significantly lower improvements of 10% and 4%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>).

Therefore, we next established if similar phenotypes could be obtained via non-genetic modifications. To do so, we inhibited Mtn at post-natal stages in <i>Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> mice (which displays an increased oxidative profile) by weekly injections of soluble activin receptor IIB protein (sActRIIB), which has been shown to antagonize signalling mediated by myostatin and related-proteins."

There was no change in the MHC fibre type composition following the injection of sActRIIB in either genotype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and F</a>).

Strikingly, sActRIIB did not cause a reduction in the proportion of SDH<sup>+</sup> fibres in <i>Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D and G</a>).

What was conspicuous, however, was the absence of normalization of the proportion of MHC I fibres. We believe that this is significant and reveals a key feature of the influence of a metabolic programme on muscle physiology. We suggest that the oxidative programme, here driven by Err\u03b3, readily converts IIB to IIA fibres but is that it is unable to induce the transition to type I MHC isoforms. Energy status (ATP/ADP or phosphocreatine) has been implicated as a determinant of the\u00a0MHC fibre type with high levels inducing ever more fast forms in keeping with their myofibrillar ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Conjard et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bottinelli et al., 1994</a>). We show here from our NMR profiling that indeed the muscle of <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>\u00a0</i>has high levels of phosphocreatine, which would be in keeping with the high ATPase activity of Type IIB fibres found in its muscle. Furthermore, we show Err\u03b3 over-expression in the muscle of <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>\u00a0</i>normalizes this feature yet does not lead to the formation of I fibres. This observation adds to a growing body of evidence that the type II programme is plastic and adaptable whereas the Type I fibres are more resistant to change (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sutherland et al., 1998</a>) and may not be\u00a0part of the IIB\u2194IIX\u2194IIA continuum. Indeed a number of studies have questioned whether the \u2018final step\u2019 (conversion of Type IIA to I) is even possible. Development of type I fibres has been described in a number of conditions, for example following Chronic low-frequency stimulation (CLFS) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Peuker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kwong and Vrbov\u00e1, 1981</a>). However, these studies never examined whether Type I were formed as a consequence of the remodeling of Type II fibres or through the formation of new fibres, a process that would require satellite cells. Indeed the development of Type I fibres following extended CLFS can only be induced to significant levels when accompanied by robust myofibre regeneration (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pette et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Maier et al., 1988</a>). Taken together, these studies imply that myostatin signalling acts at an embryonic/foetal stage of muscle development to pattern a subpopulation of satellite cells/muscle precursors in a muscle specific manner to form Type I fibres. The protocol of over-expressing Err\u03b3 used in this study is unable to influence this process."

As mentioned above, this association corresponds with the prediction of the concept of a trade-off between muscle fibre size and oxidative capacity. There could, however, also be another function for the high glycolytic capacity. For instance, the Warburg Effect is the observation that most cancer cells rely on glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (<a href=\"#bib74\">Warburg et al., 1927</a>) for the production of a intermediates essential for the building blocks of any cell including nucleic acids, lipids and proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deberardinis et al., 2008</a>). In a similar way, glycolysis in the\u00a0muscles of <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice may support the high levels of protein synthesis required for the initial muscle hypertrophy and maintenance of the large muscle mass. An interesting point is that such cells are not only dependent on glycolysis but also often have decreased oxidative phosphorylation capacity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Petros et al., 2005</a>). Where the similarities between the Warburg Effect in cancer cells and findings from this study differ is the outcome following an intervention that promotes oxidative metabolism. In cancer cells such an intervention reduces cell growth (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang and Moraes, 2011</a>) while we have shown with Err\u03b3 overexpression on a <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> background not only re-establishes the oxidative capacity but also maintains the hypertrophic state. Consistent with the oxidative metabolic phenotype of the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> mice are the higher levels of taurine and anserine observed in the NMR metabonomic analysis, since taurine is positively correlated with the oxidative capacity of muscle tissues (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dunnett et al., 1997</a>). Anserine is \u03b2-alanine and histidine related dipeptide with antioxidant properties commonly found in skeletal muscle of many animals (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kohen et al., 1988</a>). Thus, it may act as a scavenging agent of the byproducts arising from elevated oxidative activity in the muscle of <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> mice."

The large fibres with a low oxidative capacity in <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice conform to this concept and have a low capillary supply per fibre. During compensatory hypertrophy the time course of angiogenesis and fibre hypertrophy are similar (<a href=\"#bib20\">Egginton et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Plyley et al., 1998</a>) and the capillary supply to a fibre is related to the size of the fibre (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Degens et al., 1994</a>). Such a coupling between the\u00a0fibre size and capillary supply seems to be altered in the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice in such a way that they have fewer capillaries than expected for the size of the fibre. However, over-expression of Err\u03b3 in either WT or <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> drives a robust angiogenic gene programme, increases the number of capillaries per fibre and ultimately muscle blood flow as shown previously (See <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and (<a href=\"#bib48\">Narkar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Matsakas et al., 2012b</a>). An important finding here is that the angiogenesis programme promoted by muscle expression of Err\u03b3 is responsive to change in fibre size so that when a fibre grows, it stimulates the formation of blood vessels presumably to ensure optimal perfusion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). Two additional modifications take place, an increase in myoglobin transcription and increasing the density of mitochondria at the sarcolemma that would sustain large oxidative fibres developed as a consequence of Err\u03b3 in the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>\u00a0</i>background. These outcomes have been postulated to prevent a decline in maximum steady state power as an oxidative fibre increases size (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hickson, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heard et al., 2000</a>)."

The maintenance of muscle structure is largely mediated by mechanisms that remove unwanted proteins and organelles through either the proteasome or autophagic pathways (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sandri, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bonaldo and Sandri, 2013</a>). Furthermore, deregulated proteasome activity or autophagy leads to muscle wasting in a number of diseased conditions (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sandri et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carmignac et al., 2011</a>). As these pathways are involved in anabolic processes, it seems intuitive that they should be tuned down in\u00a0order\u00a0to support muscle growth. Indeed, we show that the activity of a key regulator of these processes, FoxO3 is suppressed in the absence of Mtn. However, we show that Err\u03b3 expression in muscle leads to a substantial normalization of the ultrastructure <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> skeletal muscle as well an improvement in the specific force. Most importantly, we show that a more physiological measure of muscle function- fatigability, is not only normalized but exceeds the value of WT mice. Our data demonstrate that the suppression of FoxO3 activity is alleviated by Err\u03b3. We suggest that the molecular and organelle clearance programmes being mediated by FoxO3 are generally not anabolic but are rather there to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, when its activity is attenuated, it leads to an\u00a0accumulation of structural abnormalities that compromises muscle function. Nevertheless, not all features of the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>\u00a0</i>muscle were normalised by Err\u03b3 expression; Myonuclei in <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> were more disorganized than those in WT fibres. Proper nuclear positioning is probably required for normal muscle function, possibly due to irregular size and spacing of myonuclear domains (<a href=\"#bib45\">Metzger et al., 2012</a>) and myonuclear disorganization is observed both in ageing skeletal muscle and in models of muscular dystrophies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bruusgaard et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Meinke et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, accretion of myonuclei is a prerequisite for maintaining specific force during hypertrophy and mitochondrial protein systems have been suggested to play a role in defining myonuclear domain size in rodents (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). The increased number of myonuclei and increased synthesis of mitochondria in the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup></i> mice might compensate for the observed disorganized myonuclei, restoring specific force and ultrastructure."

                        "text": "Finally, our study gives a new perspective on the relationship between metabolism, satellite cell numbers and their activity during regeneration. A number of studies have implied that slow muscles contain more satellite cells than fast (<a href=\"#bib57\">Putman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Christov et al., 2007</a>). In this study, we show that at least in the EDL as the fibres transitioned from Type IIB to Type IIA, the number of associated satellite cells was significantly reduced. One possible explanation for this finding is by taking into account the concomitant increase in the number of nuclei in the myofibre. Here, the relationship is opposite to satellite cell fibre number. We postulate that the absence of myostatin promotes myoblast fusion at the expense of satellite cell. Furthermore, that over-expression of Err\u03b3 exacerbates this relationship. Severe depletion of satellite cell numbers has been reported to severely retard the process of muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib65\">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Vasyutina et al., 2007</a>). Here, we show that the depletion of satellite cells to less than 50% of their normal levels does not impact on skeletal muscle regeneration since they have a vast capacity to generate precursors which in most situations are never realized fully (<a href=\"#bib12\">Collins et al., 2005</a>). Instead, we suggest that oxidative environment established by Err\u03b3 is the key determinant in accelerating regeneration. Our work supports previous work showing that oxidative metabolism supports muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lowrie et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Matsakas et al., 2012b</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2013</a>) and are in agreement with a number of studies showing that genetic manipulations leading to a greater oxidative capacity accelerate muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hussain et al., 2013</a>). One possible explanation for our results is our finding that Err\u03b3 promotes hyper-vascularization. Angiogenesis is a key determinant in the muscle regeneration process. We suggest that the reduction of satellite cell is off-set by the ability to promote vascularization and clearance of the necrotic tissues, allowing the small number of satellite cells to expand greatly to enact rapid repair. This hypothesis is supported by our data investigating both macrophage density and the\u00a0generation of myoblast in the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup>\u00a0</i>mice. Many studies have found that programmes of muscle repair are often at the expense of satellite cells which are not available for future cycles of degeneration/regeneration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castets et al., 2011</a>). We will investigate this avenue of research in the future by conducting a second round tissue damage in the three genetic lines described here. Encouragingly, our data show that although there was an increase in the number of myogenic precursors (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>) as well as committed cells (Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>) in the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup>\u00a0</i>compared to WT at D6, this was not at the expense of cells with satellite cell character (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup>)."

The deviation from this relationship may\u00a0be realized by the increased capillarisation and myoglobin content of the muscle and redistribution of mitochondria to a subsarcolemmal location. These adaptations were not associated with the\u00a0loss of muscle force generating capacity and in fact even resulted in improved exercise capacity. It is likely that the increased microvascular network plays a crucial role in muscle regeneration as the <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup>/Err\u03b3<sup>Tg/+</sup>\u00a0</i>mice had even lower satellite cell numbers than <i>Mtn<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, yet a regenerative capacity that even exceeded that of WT mice. In future we will determine whether it confers other advantages in particular the ability to confer resistance to obesity and sarcopenia."

The\u00a0normality of the data for two samples was checked with a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (\u03b1 =\u00a010%). Differences among groups were analysed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison tests as appropriate. In the case of non-homogeneous variances (Lavene\u2019s test; p&lt;0.05) for a variable, ANOVA was performed using the square root of the observations. Statistical analysis was performed on SPSS 18.0 (Chicago, IL). Differences were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05."
