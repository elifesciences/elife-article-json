Here, we used a single vesicle\u2013vesicle system with reconstituted SNARE and synaptotagmin-1 proteoliposomes to decipher the temporal sequence of membrane states upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection at 250\u2013500 \u03bcM on a 100-ms timescale. Furthermore, detailed membrane morphologies were imaged with cryo-electron microscopy before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection. We discovered a heterogeneous network of immediate and delayed fusion pathways. Remarkably, all instances of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered immediate fusion started from a membrane\u2013membrane point-contact and proceeded to complete fusion without discernible hemifusion intermediates. In contrast, pathways that involved a stable hemifusion diaphragm only resulted in fusion after many seconds, if at all. When complexin was included, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion network shifted towards the immediate pathway, effectively synchronizing fusion, especially at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration. Synaptic proteins may have evolved to select this immediate pathway out of a heterogeneous network of possible membrane fusion pathways."

Here, we used a single vesicle\u2013vesicle system with reconstituted SNARE and synaptotagmin-1 proteoliposomes to decipher the temporal sequence of membrane states upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection at 250\u2013500 \u03bcM on a 100-ms timescale. Furthermore, detailed membrane morphologies were imaged with cryo-electron microscopy before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection. We discovered a heterogeneous network of immediate and delayed fusion pathways. Remarkably, all instances of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered immediate fusion started from a membrane\u2013membrane point-contact and proceeded to complete fusion without discernible hemifusion intermediates. In contrast, pathways that involved a stable hemifusion diaphragm only resulted in fusion after many seconds, if at all. When complexin was included, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion network shifted towards the immediate pathway, effectively synchronizing fusion, especially at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration. Synaptic proteins may have evolved to select this immediate pathway out of a heterogeneous network of possible membrane fusion pathways."

Signals often have to pass between two neurons, or from a neuron to a muscle fiber, and the nervous system relies on a process called membrane fusion to ensure that the neurotransmitter molecules that carry the signal across the synapses are released as quickly as possible. Membrane fusion is an important process in many areas of biology, including intracellular transport and fertilization, but it occurs much faster (millisecond time scale) in the nervous system than anywhere else in the body. The reasons for this have long been a mystery, although calcium ions are known to trigger the fusion process."

When calcium ions were injected into the synthetic system, the basic characteristics of neurotransmitter release\u2014such as membrane fusion on a millisecond time scale\u2014was observed. Contrary to some theories of membrane fusion, the fastest fusion events did not begin or proceed via a discernible hemifusion intermediate state. Rather, these events proceeded from a \u2018point contact\u2019 state in which the membranes were close to each other (just 1\u20135 nm apart) without being fused, and were ready to undergo fast fusion once the calcium ions had been injected. And when Diao et al. introduced a protein called complexin, which is known to be important for fast neurotransmitter release in vivo, they observed more immediate fusion events and fewer events that involved a hemifusion intermediate."

Among these biological processes, synaptic vesicle fusion is unique in that it is both regulated and fast, in the order of a millisecond (<a href=\"#bib41\">Meinrenken et al., 2003</a>). Upon an action potential, at most one synaptic vesicle undergoes exocytosis in a synapse among the readily releasable pool (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997</a>), that is, only a small subset of docked synaptic vesicles undergo fusion. How synaptic proteins can achieve fast fusion in such a precisely regulated and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fashion is a matter of intense investigation and considerable controversy (<a href=\"#bib53\">S\u00f8rensen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Collins et al., 2012</a>). In this context, reductionist in vitro systems play an important role in uncovering the mechanism of action since they allow manipulations and observations not possible in vivo, and they establish if a particular subset of factors represents a minimal system for promoting fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release."

A hemifusion intermediate is defined as a membrane state where the outer leaflets of the two juxtaposed membranes exchange lipids; examples include an hourglass shaped \u2018stalk\u2019 and an elongated hemifusion diaphragm. Investigations of both protein-free and protein-mediated liposome fusion in model systems, along with macroscopic continuum models and atomistic computer simulations, revealed at least two pathways: a direct pathway from pre-fusion contact to complete fusion pore via a stalk, and the \u2018classical\u2019 pathway with a hemifusion diaphragm intermediate between the stalk and the fusion pore. The energetics and kinetics of these processes are dependent on many factors, including lipid composition and membrane curvature. Model calculations suggested that a hemifusion diaphragm is an energetically relatively stable, long-lived intermediate, and that the direct pathway from stalk to fusion pore may be faster (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kuzmin et al., 2001</a>)."

Exocytosis can proceed by full-collapse fusion, where the opening of a small pore continues to expand to a large pore, and \u2018kiss-and-run\u2019, where a small pore opens transiently but closes again as the vesicle stays associated with the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). There are two macroscopic models for fusion pore formation: lipid-lined where the synaptic proteins act as scaffolds for pore formation and protein-lined where the transmembrane domains of some of the synaptic proteins play a more active role by lining the pore (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jackson and Chapman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ngatchou et al., 2010</a>). However, atomistic computer simulations suggested that the molecular mechanism of pore formation is likely more complex than implied by simple macroscopic models (<a href=\"#bib46\">Risselada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lindau et al., 2012</a>)."

However, it is content mixing, that is, the diffusion between compartments of small molecules with size comparable or slightly larger to that of neurotransmitter molecules that is the correlate for neurotransmitter release. Several previous studies implied that content mixing is not necessarily correlated with lipid mixing for biological membrane fusion: neuronal SNAREs alone do not produce much content mixing, although they readily induce lipid mixing (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bowen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>), influenza virus-induced fusion content mixing occurs seconds after initial lipid mixing (<a href=\"#bib14\">Floyd et al., 2008</a>), and content mixing occurs with minutes delay after lipid mixing in vacuolar fusion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jun and Wickner, 2007</a>). Even inner leaflet mixing can occur without content mixing when fusion is induced by DNA-zippering (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chan et al., 2009</a>), although this intriguing observation will require verification with synaptic-protein induced fusion. The results presented in this work reveal an even more striking example of the difference between content mixing and lipid mixing for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion with synaptic proteins."

We investigated this fundamentally important question with our recently developed optical microscopy method that simultaneously monitors the temporal sequence of both content and lipid exchange upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering between single pairs of donor and acceptor vesicles on a 100-ms time scale (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kyoung et al., 2012</a>). Donor and acceptor vesicles mimicked synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane, respectively. Our system can discriminate between docking, hemifusion, and complete fusion. After improvements in optical instrumentation as well as protein expression and purification, here we achieved a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in the 250\u2013500 \u03bcM range. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> range is reasonably close to the physiological concentration range (starting at 10 \u03bcM and saturating at several 100 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heidelberger et al., 1994</a>) and comparable to other recent in vitro experiments (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>).

We found that all fast (immediate) fusion events start from a hemifusion-free state and proceed to full fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection without discernible hemifusion intermediates. In contrast, stable, initially hemifused states are slow to fuse, if at all.

Remarkably, no significant lipid fluorescence intensity changes (i.e., changes larger than the noise level) were observed during the incubation period for \u2018all\u2019 instances of immediate fusion events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), in other words, these events did not start from a hemifused state. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered content mixing rarely occurred during the observation period of 50 s when starting from a stable hemifused state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Since cryo-EM imaging of the membrane interfaces prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition indicated that there were only two classes, point contacts and hemifusion diaphragms, it follows that all immediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion events must start from point contacts that are not hemifused. The ability to characterize the initial membrane state and the temporal sequence of events upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection, along with the ability of controlling the constituents, is another illustration of the power of our single vesicle\u2013vesicle microscopy system."

However, few significant densities (greater than a factor of two above noise level) were actually visible near the point contacts, with some notable exceptions (e.g. red arrow in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This lack of ubiquitous protein densities could be attributed to the low number of synaptic proteins that are expected to be involved in docking and exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib60\">van den Bogaart and Jahn, 2011</a>); proteins could also be overlapping with the interface in projection and be masked by the high-contrast lipids. To support the notion that the few observed instances of significant densities could be related to synaptic proteins, we overlaid two alternative models of the synaptotagmin 1 \u2022 SNARE complex to the image of a point contact with the highest contrast, assuming that the marked density is related to the globular synaptotagmin C2 domains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). The apparent lack of density for the SNARE complex agrees with the notion of a partially folded <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex that is stabilized by repulsive forces between solvated membranes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gao et al., 2012</a>), as approximately indicated in our models. The single molecule FRET efficiency data of the synaptotagmin 1 \u2022 SNARE complex indicated multiple binding modes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Choi et al., 2010</a>), with the top solution shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>. An alterative model of this complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) was based on NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments of the complex between synaptotagmin 1 and the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dai et al., 2007</a>). Both models predict that it is the C2B domain that interacts with the SNARE complex, although the exact interface and orientation between the molecules is different. While approximate, these conceptual models may serve as guide to speculate about the involvement of synaptic proteins in forming the point contact, and setting the stage for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion. For example, the position of synaptotagmin 1 in our models would enable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered membrane juxtaposition (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ara\u00e7 et al., 2006</a>) and membrane bending (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hui et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McMahon et al., 2010</a>). Membrane bending or buckling could in turn destabilize the membrane, and in conjunction with full zippering of the SNARE complex, lead to fusion pore opening."

To test this hypothesis, we included in our system the synaptic protein complexin which has both activating and inhibiting roles for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release in vivo, respectively (<a href=\"#bib17\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Maximov et al., 2009</a>).

Strikingly, the content mixing histogram showed more pronounced short-time scale content mixing upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection than in the absence of complexin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The content mixing histogram is related to the probability of fusion vs time, a mimic for evoked postsynaptic currents. Indeed, the content mixing histogram in the presence of complexin could be fitted to a biphasic exponential decay function where the fast fraction with a time constant of 0.36 s accounts for 68% of all events. At lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (250 \u03bcM), the effect of complexin on the fusion probability time trace became even more pronounced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) with 90% in the fast fraction. In contrast, the fusion probability time trace was best fit to a single exponential decay function with a time constant of 3 s in the absence of complexin, which is a significant difference to the content mixing histogram in the presence of complexin."

We used single vesicle\u2013vesicle microscopy to discriminate and quantify the temporal sequence of changes in membrane state (docking, hemifusion, or fusion) on a 100-ms time scale. Our system starts from a meta-stable state of single docked donor/acceptor vesicles that is established by an incubation stage at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Optical tweezer pulling experiments recently revealed a partially folded intermediate state of the SNARE complex under external force conditions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). This intermediate state likely facilitates the metastable state of interacting and largely unfused vesicles during the incubation stage at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> at ambient (25\u00b0C) temperature that is the starting point for our system. On a more technical note, the incubation period at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> should reduce <i>cis</i>-interactions between the C2 domains of synaptotagmin to its own membrane that otherwise might prevent proper <i>trans</i>-interactions with acceptor vesicles in assays that use a constant non-zero Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vennekate et al., 2012</a>)."

Moreover, it is content mixing that is relevant for neurotransmitter release, not lipid mixing. As a further demonstration of this principle, complexin had little effect on the lipid mixing histogram upon 500 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). In marked contrast, complexin had a large effect on the corresponding content mixing histograms (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Likewise, at 250 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2</sup> the effect of complexin is more pronounced on the content mixing histogram compared to the lipid mixing histogram (compare <a href=\"#fig6 fig8\">Figures 6b and 8b</a>). This large difference in complexin-induced lipid mixing and content mixing effects greatly amplifies previous observations for biological membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bowen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jun and Wickner, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Floyd et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>). Taken together, these observations, and especially the results presented in this work for Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered fusion, call into question conclusions in the literature drawn from lipid-mixing assays when they were not validated by observations related to content mixing. It is thus essential that biological fusion experiments monitor a quantity that is directly related to content mixing in order to distinguish between different membrane states, such as docking, hemifusion, and full fusion."

(2) Single vesicle\u2013vesicle fluorescence intensity time traces that recorded both the initial state of the system as well as the temporal sequence of events upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

It is of course possible that this immediate pathway proceeds from point contact to fusion pore via a transient stalk, however, the lifetime of such a transient stalk would have to be faster than the 100-ms time resolution of our instrument.

Membranes containing syntaxin were washed with 10 mM Tris-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 10% (wt/vol) glycerol, centrifuged at 40,000 RPM for 1.5 hr in a Ti-45 rotor, the pellet resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 1 mM <i>tris</i>(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and centrifuged for an additional 1.5 hr in the same rotor. Membranes were suspended to a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF and EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Dodecylmaltoside was added to 2%, and after incubation at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr, the sample was centrifuged for 35 min at 55,000 RPM in a Ti-70 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) rotor, and the supernatant loaded onto a 0.75 ml column of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The column was washed with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 20 mM imidazole, 110 mM octylglucoside (OG), and the protein eluted in that buffer containing 500 mM imidazole and 1 M NaCl. 1 mM EDTA was immediately added to each fraction, and those fractions containing protein were loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) that was equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 110 mM OG. Protein fractions were pooled, and digested with TEV protease for 1 hr at ambient temperature, after which the reaction was complete and the TEV protease had precipitated. TEV was removed by centrifugation at 5000 RPM in an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) model 5804 R tabletop centrifuge."

Such phenomena may produce a large fluorescence intensity change that cannot easily be distinguished from genuine fusion. Another issue with commonly used lipid-mixing ensemble experiments is that they cannot distinguish between docking and hemifusion/fusion since the observed lipid-mixing signal depends on both processes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cypionka et al., 2009</a>). Even measuring content mixing in an ensemble experiment would not be able to discern effects caused by differences in docking and fusion since the ensemble-average fluorescence signal depends on both docking and complete fusion. On a different note, some of the first ensemble lipid mixing studies used an unreasonably high protein to lipid ratio (e.g., 1:10 for synaptobrevin-reconstituted vesicles [<a href=\"#bib65\">Weber et al., 1998</a>]); this is a concern since high protein concentrations are known to cause vesicle instabilities. Finally, ensemble measurements may obscure heterogeneous fusion pathways since they only observe averages rather than individual fusion events. This is indeed a problem for ensemble experiments since single-vesicle lipid-mixing experiments revealed multiple intermediates in SNARE-mediated fusion (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yoon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Karatekin et al., 2010</a>), and the single vesicle\u2013vesicle content/lipid mixing results presented in this work uncovered heterogeneous fusion pathways for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion in the presence SNAREs, synaptotagmin, and complexin."

Furthermore, many of these experiments were typically performed on mixtures of donor/acceptor vesicles in solution at a constant Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, rather than starting from the metastable state of interacting vesicle pairs at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> used in our system (see below). This introduces the possibility of synaptotagmin C2 <i>cis</i>-interactions with its own membrane when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present prior to docking of vesicles (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vennekate et al., 2012</a>), and thereby reducing synaptotagmin <i>trans</i>-interactions with the acceptor vesicles.

In their experiments a paradoxical \u2018decrease\u2019 of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lipid mixing from 10 to 100 \u03bcM was observed, assuming background level at 100 \u03bcM.

The size of the soluble content dye sulforhodamine B is only slightly larger to that of certain neurotransmitters, such as glutamate or serotonin. For the content dye, dequenching may occur by content mixing, leakage, or photobleaching. Complete fusion is characterized by a rapid jump in content dye fluorescence followed by relatively steady fluorescence intensity. Leakage leads to a quick spike, followed by rapid disappearance of fluorescence intensity. Photobleaching leads to slow increases and then decreases of fluorescence intensity. Thus, events that do not lead to content mixing can be easily distinguished from leakage and photobleaching for each individual vesicle pair."

We injected donor vesicles (at 50\u00d7 dilution) for 30 s followed by a buffer wash, and then immediately recorded the fluorescence intensities of the lipid dyes and content dyes for short periods (1\u20134 s). A 20 min period followed without laser illumination to prevent photobleaching. The laser illumination resumed 5 s prior to injection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the sample chamber.

These assumptions produced a reasonable overlay with the cryo-EM image. For the model shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, we estimated that four \u03b1-helical turns would be able to bridge a 3.0 nm distance (<i>R</i><sub>rms</sub>) in a random coil conformation, using a persistence length <i>l</i><sub>p</sub> of 0.9 based on single molecule FRET experiments of synaptobrevin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Choi et al., 2011</a>) (<i>R</i><sub>rms</sub><sup>2</sup> = 2<i>l</i><sub>p</sub><i>n</i> \u00d7 0.36 nm, where <i>n</i> is the number of residues which is 14 for two heptad coiled coil repeats). Thus, the last four C-terminal helical turns of synaptobrevin were modeled as a random coil in order to approximately account for the distance that a portion of the synaptobrevin polypeptide chain would have to extend in order to reach the vesicle membrane.
