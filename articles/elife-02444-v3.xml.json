This system is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and drug treatment to enhance cholinergic signaling is widely used as symptomatic therapy in AD. Defining the full morphologies of individual basal forebrain cholinergic neurons has, until now, been technically beyond reach due to their large axon arbor sizes. Using genetically-directed sparse labeling, we have characterized the complete morphologies of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the mouse. Individual arbors were observed to span multiple cortical columns, and to have &gt;1000 branch points and total axon lengths up to 50 cm. In an AD model, cholinergic axons were slowly lost and there was an accumulation of axon-derived material in discrete puncta. Calculations based on published morphometric data indicate that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in humans have a mean axon length of \u223c100 meters."

This system is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and drug treatment to enhance cholinergic signaling is widely used as symptomatic therapy in AD. Defining the full morphologies of individual basal forebrain cholinergic neurons has, until now, been technically beyond reach due to their large axon arbor sizes. Using genetically-directed sparse labeling, we have characterized the complete morphologies of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the mouse. Individual arbors were observed to span multiple cortical columns, and to have &gt;1000 branch points and total axon lengths up to 50 cm. In an AD model, cholinergic axons were slowly lost and there was an accumulation of axon-derived material in discrete puncta. Calculations based on published morphometric data indicate that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in humans have a mean axon length of \u223c100 meters."

This made it possible to distinguish these neurons from surrounding brain tissue in order to visualize their structures. The resulting pictures clearly illustrate the neurons' complexity, with individual axons in adult mice displaying up to 1000 branches."

Most, if not all, cortical and hippocampal neurons respond to cholinergic signals using muscarinic and/or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors localized to pre- and/or postsynaptic sites. Activation of postsynaptic nicotinic receptors leads to transient depolarizing currents with a high calcium:sodium ratio and activation of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors leads to a sustained reduction in potassium currents, both effects producing a general elevation in excitability (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lucas-Meunier et al., 2003</a>). Additionally, cholinergic activation of muscarinic receptors in the microvasculature leads to the production of nitric oxide, producing vasodilation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hamel, 2004</a>)."

In advanced AD, the relative loss of cholinergic innervation varies by region, with the temporal lobe showing the greatest loss of fibers and the primary sensory, motor, and anterior cingulate cortices showing the least loss (<a href=\"#bib19\">Geula and Mesulam, 1989</a>). The relative extent of cholinergic fiber loss in different cortical areas appears to correlate inversely with fiber density in the normal brain, suggesting that disease-associated fiber loss progresses at roughly equal rates throughout the cortex and that those regions that began with the fewest fibers are the first to become denuded of cholinergic input. The loss of forebrain cholinergic innervation in AD has stimulated the development of pharmacotherapy to enhance cholinergic signaling as an approach to partially ameliorate cognitive symptoms (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burns et al., 2006</a>)."

In earlier work, we demonstrated the utility of extremely sparse <i>CreER/loxP</i> labeling methods for visualizing axonal and dendritic morphologies of large neurons, including forebrain cholinergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rotolo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Badea et al., 2009</a>).

This allele expresses relatively low levels of CreER and, consequently, shows no recombination of Cre-activated reporters in the absence of tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT), a prerequisite for visualizing genetically marked neurons at densities of &lt;10 labeled neurons per brain. To visualize large axon arbors in their entirety and to efficiently survey dozens of brains, we chose the highly sensitive histochemical reporter human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP), a GPI-anchored protein that distributes relatively uniformly along dendrites and axons (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rotolo et al., 2008</a>). AP histochemistry works efficiently with relatively thick (300 \u00b5m) vibratome sections, which minimizes the number of sections required per brain and thereby simplifies the logistics of staining, imaging, and tracing. To minimize background reporter activity, we used an AP reporter knock-in at the <i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</i> locus (referred to as <i>R26</i>) in which the 3\u2032 half of the AP coding region is in reverse orientation and Cre-mediated recombination restores this segment to the correct orientation (<i>R26IAP, \u2018I\u2019</i> stands for \u2018inverted\u2019; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Badea et al., 2009</a>).

The mean axon length per neuron was 13 cm at P12 (n = 8; range 3\u201342 cm) and 31 cm at P30 (n = 4; range 11\u201349 cm), and at both ages, the density of branches averaged 4\u20135 per mm of axon length (range 3\u20137 per mm), giving a mean of &gt;1000 branch points per arbor at P30, including occasional branches along the axon's initial segment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The territory influenced by each cholinergic arbor was estimated by enclosing the axon traces from each 300 \u00b5m tissue section with the smallest possible convex polygon, calculating the area of each polygon, and summing the resulting polygonal volumes (polygon area \u00d7 300 \u00b5m) across all of the sections populated by the arbor of interest (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). Using this measure, individual axon density\u2013defined as mm of axon length per mm<sup>3</sup> of polygonal volume for an individual axon\u2014was found to vary by a factor of \u223c10 among traced arbors at both P12 (n = 8) and at P30 (n = 4; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>), reflecting significant variation in the size and compactness of cholinergic arbors. The comparison between P12 and P30 implies that there is substantial growth of cholinergic axons after the second week of postnatal life. Although the polygon method somewhat over-estimates the territory influenced by an arbor (as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), it provides a good measure of the linear extent of the arbor, giving a mean value of \u223c2 mm in the adult brain, as seen in a compilation of the mediolateral extents of forebrain cholinergic axon arbors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>)."

These population analyses are made possible by the availability of antibodies that localize to different types of axons: anti-ChAT for cholinergic axons (also visualized with acetylcholine esterase histochemistry), anti-tyrosine hydroxylase for striatal dopaminergic axons, and anti-serotonin for serotonergic axons. For example, <a href=\"#bib1\">Anden et al.

To the best of our knowledge, this simple calculation has not been performed previously. The human data for axon density and neuron counts have been published for forebrain cholinergic neurons and for serotonergic neurons projecting from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the cortex, and cortical volume estimates for humans are available from MRI analyses; forebrain cholinergic neuron data is also available for chimpanzees (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). These calculations lead to axon length estimates of 107 m and 31 m, respectively, for human and chimpanzee forebrain cholinergic neurons, and an axon length estimate of 170\u2013348 m for human serotonergic neurons. For both neurotransmitter systems, the vast majority of the visualized fibers within the cortex are presumed to derive from projection neurons because the density of cortical cell bodies labeled with anti-ChAT or anti-serotonin antibodies is extremely low (<a href=\"#bib40\">Raghanti et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2008b</a>). Even if we allow for a possible under-estimate in neuron counts or a possible over-estimate in axon density measurements by as much as 2\u20133-fold, the calculations imply that in the human brain these two classes of projection neurons have axons that are, on average, many tens of meters in length."

The calculated total axon length for human forebrain cholinergic neurons, \u223c100 meters, is larger than the \u223c30 meter length estimated for blue whale corticospinal and DRG axons, which are typically cited as the \u2018largest\u2019 neurons in the animal kingdom (<a href=\"#bib48\">Smith, 2009</a>).

If we take \u223c0.3 \u00b5m as the mean diameter of a rat cholinergic axon (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vaucher and Hamel, 1995</a>; a value typical for unmyelinated CNS fibers; see; <a href=\"#bib37\">Perge et al., 2012</a>), and temporarily neglect the volume added by varicosities, we obtain an axon volume of \u223c70.6 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> per meter of axon length. Along the length of cholinergic fibers in the rat cortex and hippocampus, varicosities occur at a mean frequency of \u223c0.4/\u00b5m and their mean internal volume is \u223c0.06 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> (the mean diameter is 0.48 \u00b5m; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mechawar et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aznavour et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Descarries et al., 2005</a>). Thus, the varicosities would add a volume of (0.4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>) \u00d7 (0.06 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>) = 24 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> per meter of axon length. The mean soma volume for rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons is \u223c14 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> (diameters are 18\u201343 \u00b5m; the mean is taken as \u223c30 \u00b5m; <a href=\"#bib10\">Butcher, 1995</a>). Using the value of 62 cm calculated here for the mean length of rat forebrain cholinergic axons (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), the axon and varicosity volumes (44 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u00b5m and 15 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>) sum to \u223c59 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>, or \u223c4.2 times greater than the soma volume. Thus, despite its great length, the axon arbor only increases the neuron's volume several-fold. By contrast, the calculated mean surface area of the axon arbor (\u223c5.84 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) is \u223c210 times greater than the calculated mean surface area of the soma (\u223c2800 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>)."

In the mouse, cortical columns are approximately 150\u2013300 \u00b5m across, the diameter of an individual barrel in the barrel cortex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jan et al., 2008</a>). Since the typical cholinergic axon arbor extends over two millimeters in the plane of the cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>), each arbor contacts multiple cortical columns. Although locally induced or locally restricted acetylcholine release is possible, it seems likely that signals originating in the dendrites and leading to action potentials at the soma of a forebrain cholinergic neuron would affect synaptic output over the entire arbor. This line of reasoning implies that cholinergic modulation of cortical and hippocampal function in response to information originating in the basal forebrain is likely to have low spatial resolution. A similar argument can be applied to nigrostriatal dopaminergic signaling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matsuda et al., 2009</a>)."

It is possible that the vulnerability of forebrain cholinergic neurons in the context of AD is related, at least in part, to the large size of their axon arbors. For example, vulnerability might be related to a particular sensitivity of the axonal transport machinery to biochemical perturbations associated with A\u03b2 toxicity. Perhaps more significantly, the requirement that all transportation processes between cell body and axon arbor funnel through a single proximal axon segment suggests that trafficking within this segment may limit the efficacy of cellular responses to axonal damage or stress. The general idea that extreme axon length increases vulnerability to neurodegeneration has been discussed in the context of motor neuron disease (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cavanagh, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ferraiuolo et al., 2011</a>), and it seems reasonable that this concept might apply to a wide variety of neurons with very large axon arbors."

The total length of an axon arbor was obtained by summing up the lengths of the traces derived from that arbor within each tissue section. (Following dehydration in ethanol and equilibration in BBBA, 300 \u00b5m thick vibratome sections of brain undergo an isotropic volume shrinkage of 3.32+/\u22120.17 [<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>]. Axon lengths reported here have been corrected for that shrinkage.) Branch points were manually scored using ImageJ/Fiji. To estimate arbor volumes, the smallest convex polygon encompassing all axon segments for a given arbor in the Z-stacked image for each 300 \u00b5m section was drawn over the image using ImageJ/Fiji, and each polygon area was calculated. Sections that contained only the subcortical axon segment were not included in the polygon analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with Excel and Graph-Pad. Error bars in the figures indicate standard deviation (SD). p-values were calculated with the student's <i>t</i> test."

In their response to the letters from the four groups that failed to reproduce their findings, the authors of <a href=\"#bib12\">Cramer et al (2012)</a> noted that they had used a micronized formulation of bexarotene and suggested that differences in pharmacokinetics may have accounted for the discrepant findings (<a href=\"#bib26\">Landreth et al., 2013</a> Science 340: 924g). We have not tried to reproduce the data of Cramer et al., so our data does not directly contradict their findings. However, our bexarotene experiment was inspired by their report, so it would be appropriate for us to note that our drug formulation differed from theirs and that the authors of Cramer et al have suggested that such differences could be biologically significant. We have now added a sentence to this effect in the Results section."

ABCA1 is a transcriptional target of RXR signaling and <a href=\"#bib53\">Veeraraghavalu et al. (2013)</a> used the increase in ABCA1 protein (monitored by anti-ABCA1 immunoblotting) to assess bexarotene activation of RXR in the brain. We have conducted this type of analysis (using the same mAb used by Veeraraghavalu et al.) to assess the effectiveness of bexarotene treatment in activating RXR in the CNS. Specifically, we compared ABCA1 levels in three vehicle-treated and three bexarotene-treated mice at 7 months of age, using the same drug administration protocol that we used for the cholinergic neuron analysis in AD model mice. The result is a robust induction of ABCA1 in the brain cortex in response to one week of bexarotene treatment, in line with what Veeraraghavalu et al. observed. This new data is now included in <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 3</a> (panels B and C)."

We think this division into main figures and supplemental figures serves the purpose of permitting data that is supportive but not central to be placed in the public domain.

We also note that in the final version of the paper on the <i>eLife</i> web site, it is easy to click back and forth between main figures and supplemental figures. We would prefer to keep the bexarotene data in the paper. It is a minor (and negative) part of the study.
