Curiously, the same conformational antibody recognizes different disease-related oligomers, despite the variations in clinical presentation and brain regions affected, suggesting that the oligomer structure might be responsible for toxicity. We investigated whether polyglutamine-expanded ATAXIN-1, the protein that underlies spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, forms toxic oligomers and, if so, what underlies their toxicity. We found that mutant ATXN1 does form oligomers and that oligomer levels correlate with disease progression in the <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> mice. Moreover, oligomeric toxicity, stabilization and seeding require interaction with Capicua, which is expressed at greater ratios with respect to ATXN1 in the cerebellum than in less vulnerable brain regions. Thus, specific interactors, not merely oligomeric structure, drive pathogenesis and contribute to regional vulnerability. Identifying interactors that stabilize toxic oligomeric complexes could answer longstanding questions about the pathogenesis of other proteinopathies."

Curiously, the same conformational antibody recognizes different disease-related oligomers, despite the variations in clinical presentation and brain regions affected, suggesting that the oligomer structure might be responsible for toxicity. We investigated whether polyglutamine-expanded ATAXIN-1, the protein that underlies spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, forms toxic oligomers and, if so, what underlies their toxicity. We found that mutant ATXN1 does form oligomers and that oligomer levels correlate with disease progression in the <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> mice. Moreover, oligomeric toxicity, stabilization and seeding require interaction with Capicua, which is expressed at greater ratios with respect to ATXN1 in the cerebellum than in less vulnerable brain regions. Thus, specific interactors, not merely oligomeric structure, drive pathogenesis and contribute to regional vulnerability. Identifying interactors that stabilize toxic oligomeric complexes could answer longstanding questions about the pathogenesis of other proteinopathies."

The disease is a caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for a protein called ATAXIN-1. In healthy individuals this protein contains up to 39 copies of an amino acid called glutamine. However, the mutant gene can encode for 40 or more copies of glutamine, which results in a longer-than-usual ATAXIN-1 protein with toxic properties."

However, closer examination revealed that these deposits form mainly in brain regions that do not degenerate, which suggests that they might instead have a protective role. This is consistent with evidence from research into other brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that the soluble form of the toxic proteins might be causing these diseases."

In Alzheimer disease (AD), for example, there are extracellular depositions of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles of tau (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glenner and Wong, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986</a>). Similarly, in Parkinson disease (PD), \u03b1-synuclein forms cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lashuel et al., 2013</a>). Although AD, PD, and other proteinopathies such as Huntington disease (HD) and the prion disorders are associated with different proteins possessing various structures, functions, and affecting different brain regions, they all involve the accumulation of \u03b2-sheet-rich entities, which suggests some commonality of pathogenic mechanism (<a href=\"#bib13\">Glabe and Kayed, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Knowles et al., 2014</a>)."

SCA1 is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat that encodes for glutamine (Q) in ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1), a protein that is expressed throughout the brain. The <i>Atxn1</i> knockin mouse model, which bears a 154 CAG repeat knocked into the murine <i>Atxn1</i> locus, faithfully reproduces the SCA1 phenotype: progressive motor incoordination due to cerebellar degeneration, cognitive deficits, premature death, and degradation-resistant deposits (nuclear inclusions, or NIs) that contain mutant ATXN1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Watase et al., 2002</a>). As with the stable fibrillar deposits first observed in AD over a hundred years ago, the prominence of these NIs led initially to the postulate that this material is the causative agent of disease (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</a>). Yet the NIs develop primarily in neurons that escape degeneration, not in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), which are the first to succumb to SCA1 pathology (<a href=\"#bib43\">Watase et al., 2002</a>). This curious observation led to the proposal that the ATXN1-containing NIs are not themselves toxic but rather might serve a protective role by sequestering the mutant protein (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cummings et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">1999</a>)."

Although toxic oligomers have been identified in HD models and their modulation relates to beneficial outcomes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Legleiter et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sontag et al., 2012</a>) their specific role in disease progression in vivo remains unstudied. Furthermore, there are not studies regarding the role of binding partners of the disease-related proteins in the oligomerization process. The inverse correlation between NIs and neuronal integrity in SCA1, however, lends appeal to the hypothesis that soluble oligomers, rather than fibrils per se, drive neurodegeneration in SCA1."

We also show that polyQ ATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new oligomers and demonstrate that Capicua (CIC), a key native binding partner of ATXN1, plays a pivotal role in the stabilization and regional toxicity of these oligomeric species."

We used the conformational monoclonal anti-oligomer antibody F11G3 to detect ATXN1 oligomers in the <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> knockin mouse model. This antibody has been extensively characterized and compared to other anti-oligomer antibodies previously developed using similar methods (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guerrero-Munoz et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2014b</a>). Oligomers were apparent in cerebellar extracts of <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> but not in wild-type or <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To confirm the anti-oligomeric nature of F11G3, we pre-incubated the antibody with different types of oligomers prior to performing IF in brain sections from <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> mice. The results verified that F11G3 is indeed highly specific to an oligomeric conformation rather than an amino acidic sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Immunofluorescence (IF) against both ATXN1 and oligomers revealed substantial co-localization in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Immunoprecipitation of oligomers from the <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> cerebellum confirmed that these metastable entities are formed by ATXN1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

Motor incoordination in the rotarod assay becomes apparent in these mice as early as 5 weeks of age and worsens throughout their life span (<a href=\"#bib43\">Watase et al., 2002</a>). Accordingly, we tested the levels of ATXN1 oligomers in these mice at an early stage of disease (8 weeks of age), a middle stage (18 weeks), and a late stage (28 weeks). There was considerable variability among animals of the same age in both motor performance and oligomer abundance, but the levels of different molecular weight oligomers in the cerebellum clearly increased as the mice aged (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The differences between individual mice, however, allowed us to search for relationships between motor impairment and different ATXN1 oligomers. We tested each mouse on the rotarod and observed a consistently strong inverse correlation between latency to fall and the level of ATXN1 oligomers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), with oligomers over 245 KDa showing the greatest inverse correlation (R = 0.89). Importantly, no significant changes in monomeric ATXN1 levels (2Q or 154Q) were observed in these mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Evaluation of individual fractions by western blot with anti-ATXN1 antibody revealed WT and polyQ monomeric ATXN1 in different fractions, as previously shown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lam et al., 2006</a>). When we analyzed the SEC fractions with the anti-oligomer antibody, we observed oligomeric species mainly between fractions 10 and 12 (ranging from 500 to 1000 KDa in size; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel). Anti-ATXN1 antibody confirmed that the oligomers in these fractions do in fact contain ATXN1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel); the range of sizes of these oligomers is thus rather broad. Fraction 11 (\u223c667 KDa) contained a peak in the signal of oligomers &gt;245 KDa in weight, as well as the presence of lower molecular weight oligomeric species (\u223c180, \u223c135, \u223c110 and \u223c98 KDa). AFM revealed that those fractions detected by the anti-oligomer antibody (particularly fractions 11 and 12) were indeed oligomeric, whereas the higher molecular weight fractions were fibrillar in nature (fraction 7, \u223c4000KDa; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). A hydrophobic interaction column, which separates proteins according to hydrophobic domain exposure, showed that fraction 11 is highly hydrophobic, as is characteristic of many oligomers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Campioni et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To establish how stable these oligomers are, SEC fractions were incubated at 37<b>\u00b0</b>C for up to 48 hr followed by immunoblot analysis using F11G3. F11G3 showed a strong affinity for fractions 11 and 12 even after 48 hr of incubation, suggesting that these oligomers are highly stable (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

These cells form nuclear inclusions, but their capacity to form oligomers had never been evaluated. We first established that these cells do form oligomers (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The anti-oligomer antibody detected the smaller inclusion bodies (350\u2013900 nm) but did not recognize the larger inclusions (&gt;900 nm), suggesting that these larger inclusions are more complex and composed of higher order aggregates, likely to be fibrillar in nature."

The antibody thus appears to block the internalization of exogenous ATXN1 oligomers rather than interacting directly with intracellular oligomeric species.

Furthermore, these higher molecular weight complexes are not oligomeric: anti-oligomer antibody did not reveal any shift to the higher molecular weight fractions upon loss of Cic (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To confirm that the high molecular weight complex present only in <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup><i>;Cic</i><sup><i>L+/-</i></sup> mice adopted a more organized fibrillar aggregate conformation, we performed Filter Retardation Assay (FRA) using the SEC fractions from <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup><i>;Cic</i><sup><i>L+/-</i></sup> and <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> mice. Probing the FRA membrane with anti-ATXN1 antibody revealed the presence of ATXN1 SDS-insoluble aggregates in fractions 7 and 8 in <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> mice. In the case of the <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup><i>;Cic</i><sup><i>L+/-</i></sup> mice, ATXN1 SDS-insoluble aggregates were also present in fraction 9 (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), confirming that in the context of reduced CIC levels, ATXN1 tends to form more organized fibrillar aggregates. We also probed FRA membranes with OC, a conformational antibody that specifically recognizes fibrillar oligomers and fibrils (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kayed et al., 2007</a>), and found fractions 7 and 8 in <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> mice, and fractions 7, 8, and 9 in <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup><i>;Cic</i><sup><i>L+/-</i></sup> mice, positive for OC (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). ATXN1 thus tends to form fibrillar oligomers, amorphous aggregates and/or fibrils when CIC levels are reduced. We detected no oligomers using F11G3 in the FRA membranes; ATXN1 oligomers detected by F11G3 are therefore soluble in 2% SDS (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and able to escape detection by FRA. To determine whether the ATXN1 complex maintains its seeding capacity in the absence of one <i>Cic</i> allele, we performed the cell-based seeding assay using mRFP-ATXN1(82Q) cells treated with SEC fractions from either <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup> or <i>Atxn1</i><sup><i>154Q/+</i></sup><i>;Cic</i><sup><i>L+/-</i></sup> cerebellum and quantified the percentage of cells containing fibrillar or oligomeric inclusions.

As a negative control, we utilized CIC with the W37A mutation which hinders its interaction with ATXN1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Increasing amounts of CIC led to increasing levels of oligomers as measured with F11G3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), but increasing amounts of mutant CIC/W37A produced no changes in the levels of ATXN1 oligomers in the cells. To determine whether polyQ-length plays a role in CIC's stabilization of ATXN1 oligomers, we repeated the same co-transfection experiments in HeLa cells as described for ATXN1(82Q), this time utilizing nonpathogenic wild-type ATXN1(30Q). When cells were co-transfected with ATXN1(30Q) and increasing amounts of CIC, oligomers were almost undetectable by western blot using F11G3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As expected, increasing amounts of mutant CIC/W37A produced no oligomeric signal. To compare the relative amounts of oligomers in the ATXN1(82Q) and ATXN1 (30Q) cells, we performed direct ELISA using F11G3 and normalized the values by the total amount of ATXN1 measured using anti-ATXN1 antibody. The ELISA quantification confirmed that increasing amounts of CIC corresponded to increasing levels of oligomers in ATXN1(82Q) cells, whereas no changes in oligomer levels were observed when cells were treated with any amount of mutant CIC/W37A. Cells transfected with nonpathogenic ATXN1(30Q) failed to produce oligomers, whether they were co-transfected with CIC, CIC/W37A, or not co-transfected at all (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

It has been shown that these fibrillar oligomers are more mature oligomers, more compact and less toxic than the soluble ones detected with A-11 and F11G3, known as prefibrillar oligomers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guerrero-Munoz et al., 2014b</a>). Despite the structural similarity of fibrillar oligomers and fibrils, the former are not positive for Thioflavine (<a href=\"#bib12\">Glabe, 2008</a>). As expected, AXH either alone or with mutant CIC W37A formed significantly more fibrillar oligomers at 24 hr than it did with wild-type CIC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This result suggests that CIC binding to ATXN1 promotes the formation of and stabilizes soluble prefibrillar oligomers and tends to divert ATXN1 from forming more mature and less toxic aggregates such as fibrillar oligomers and fibrils. To solidify this interpretation, we performed a Thioflavin T (Thio-T) assay to determine the effect of CIC on the formation of AXH fibrils. Fluorescence measurements of Thio-T showed that wild-type CIC diminished the formation of AXH fibrils (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The results obtained from our aggregation kinetics assay suggested that CIC not only promotes AXH oligomerization but also stabilizes the oligomers, retarding the kinetics of AXH aggregation to fibrils."

We measured the levels of ATXN1 and CIC in the cerebellum and cortex of wild type mice and found that, under these physiological conditions, CIC levels are higher in the cerebellum than in the cortex, but ATXN1 levels are lower (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The amount of CIC available relative to ATXN1 is thus considerably higher in the cerebellum than in the cortex. This result suggests that in brain regions containing high levels of CIC in relation to ATXN1 (such as the cerebellum), CIC stabilizes ATXN1 in its oligomeric conformation, but where the ratio of CIC to ATXN1 is lower, ATXN1 is not stabilized in its oligomeric confirmation and continues its process of forming non-toxic NIs."

Oligomers have been specifically associated with Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and frontotemporal dementia, and it has been proposed that the disease pathology could be caused solely by soluble toxic entities of A\u03b2, \u03b1-synuclein or tau, respectively (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lesne et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shankar et al., 2008</a>). Yet the molecular mechanism(s) of this toxicity have remained poorly understood. Not since Prusiner proposed the existence of a \u2018protein X\u2019 that might help form the toxic species has attention been paid to a possible requirement for interaction with another protein partner to form toxic oligomers (<a href=\"#bib41\">Telling et al., 1995</a>). Here we have demonstrated not only that polyQ ATXN1 adopts an oligomeric conformation and that this conformation is pathogenic in cellular and animal models of SCA1, but that the native binding partner of ATXN1, CIC, is essential for the stabilization of oligomeric polyQ ATXN1. We believe the data provide compelling reason to investigate the role of native partners involved in the toxicity of protein oligomers in other neurodegenerative proteinopathies."

It has been particularly perplexing that regions that develop insoluble nuclear inclusions, which were long thought to be toxic, tend to escape SCA1 pathology (<a href=\"#bib43\">Watase et al., 2002</a>). We had previously shown that polyQ ATXN1 exerts toxicity through its native complexes containing CIC rather than through aberrant interactions with novel proteins (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lam et al., 2006</a>) and that reducing CIC levels by 50% rescues the phenotype of a mouse model for SCA1, improving motor functions and increasing survival (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fryer et al., 2011</a>). The data from the current study provide insight into how CIC modulates pathogenesis and why it is particularly toxic in the cerebellum: CIC stabilizes toxic oligomers and exists in a particularly high ratio with respect to ATXN1 in cerebellar neurons. In the SCA1 knockin mice, the abundance of these oligomers correlated directly with behavioral deficits; without CIC, in vitro and in vivo, ATXN1 oligomers continue on the aggregation pathway and co-assemble into less-toxic fibrillar oligomers, amorphous aggregates and/or fibrils (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). SCA1 is therefore triggered not just by a conformational change in ATXN1 but by interactions with a specific partner in a specific brain region that brings about oligomerization and stabilization. The partner not only has to be present, but its levels have to be high enough to stabilize a considerable proportion of ATXN1 oligomers in order to drive pathogenesis. These observations do much to explain why pathology is relatively localized in SCA1 despite the ubiquitous expression of ATXN1. It seems likely that the physiological cellular environment will prove to be the determining factor in promoting and stabilizing the respective pathological proteins in their toxic conformations in other polyglutamine diseases and proteinopathies."

In light of this, we propose that CIC interacts with oligomeric polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 dimers through the exposed hydrophobic domains, which in turn stabilizes the complexes. In other words, CIC\u2014a native ATXN1 interactor\u2014does not discern between a nonpathogenic wild type ATXN1 dimer and a pathologically expanded ATXN1 dimer, and interacts with either; it simply binds to ATXN1 to form a functional transcriptional repressor complex or a dysfunctional oligomeric complex, depending on the polyglutamine tract. The length of the polyQ tract is essential to the accumulation, aggregation and oligomerization of ATXN1, as has been postulated for other polyglutamine diseases (<a href=\"#bib31\">Legleiter et al., 2010</a>). Given that CIC interacts with ATXN1 regardless of polyQ expansion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lam et al., 2006</a>) and that CIC stabilizes AXH oligomers, we believe that CIC stabilizes ATXN1 oligomers independent of the polyQ tract length. Nevertheless, a polyglutamine expansion is necessary to initiate the oligomerization process under physiological conditions, in the context of the full-length protein. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a native interactor of a toxic protein can stabilize its oligomeric form to promote its bioavailability and downstream toxicity. Furthermore, ATXN1 oligomeric complexes were able to penetrate cells and seed the formation of new ATXN1 oligomers without forming fibrillar inclusions. This could be explained by the addition of monomers to the ends of oligomers, which is kinetically more favorable than the assembly of oligomers into fibrils via sheet stacking interactions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wu et al., 2010</a>)."

It should be worthwhile, for example, to explore whether native interactors of tau and \u03b1-synuclein might promote or hinder their formation of toxic oligomers. Without ruling out the role of non-native interactors in protein aggregation, we propose that neuropathological features of a specific disease are determined by both transient and stable native protein interactions and that these interactions in turn affect the amyloidogenic properties of the disease-associated protein. Thus, blocking certain interactions that mediate the formation or stabilization of oligomeric toxic entities, or modulating the downstream effects of such interactions, could be an attractive treatment option for this class of diseases."

I think it convincingly shows, primarily using conformation specific antibodies, that the fraction of the polyQ expanded mutant protein that forms prefibrillar toxic oligomers depends on the level of a known interactor of native ATXN1. This model makes much sense for polyQ proteins since the expansion is likely to leave other domains natively folded\u2014the generality is of course unclear at this moment. The observations are important because they provide a way to understand the otherwise perplexing stereospecificity of the cytotoxcicity of aggregating proteins, which is one of the main outstanding questions in the field: why is the same aggregating protein toxic to some cells but not to others."

There are serious concerns about the variations in the properties of this antibody both batch to batch and between suppliers. Is F11G3 better behaved, or should readers worry about the same flaws (which come down to reproducibility issues)? I think in terms of the credibility of the story I would provide some more support for the robustness of this (to me) relatively new antibody."

The use of the antibody developed by Dr. Kayed is a strength. This has been a very active area of research over the last several years, having been shown for FTD, PD and other disorders and more recently in cells for HD. This is a very elegant study showing that Capicua, which was shown as critical to SCA1 previously by Zoghbi and Orr, is linked to formation of oligomers and seeding of aggregation. They convincingly show that oligomers correlate with disease progression in vivo in SCA1 transgenic mice using a multitude of assays. Any of these in isolation would be somewhat correlative, but taken together they build an extremely strong case. The data also provide support for the hypothesis that the protein interactions that drive the formation of these toxic oligomeric structures may explain some of the selectivity that drives disease in Purkinje cells."

The authors marshal an impressive range of methods and employ multiple mouse and cell models to ascertain the presence of disease protein oligomers in susceptible brain tissue/cells and explore interactions between such oligomers and a well-established disease protein interacting partner, Capicua (CIC1). There are many strengths to the paper. It serves as an important addition to the field of polyglutamine diseases specifically, and to neurodegenerative proteinopathies more generally. I have several small points of clarification and questions for the authors, but no truly major concerns."

Ideally, though not essential for this paper, the authors would analyze a set of mice of the same, intermediate age with varying degree of motor dysfunction and determine whether, at this intermediate age, levels of oligomers indeed do correlate closely with degree of motor dysfunction."

I think the authors should discuss in the manuscript how F11G3 differs from the well-known A11. There are serious concerns about the variations in the properties of this antibody both batch to batch and between suppliers. Is F11G3 better behaved, or should readers worry about the same flaws (which come down to reproducibility issues)? I think in terms of the credibility of the story I would provide some more support for the robustness of this (to me) relatively new antibody</i>."

F11G3 has been previously extensively characterized and compared with A-11 (Guerrero-Munoz et al. 2014. Neurobiology of disease 71, 14-23)."

Ideally, though not essential for this paper, the authors would analyze a set of mice of the same, intermediate age with varying degree of motor dysfunction and determine whether, at this intermediate age, levels of oligomers indeed do correlate closely with degree of motor dysfunction</i>."
