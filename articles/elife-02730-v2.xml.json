Here we reconstruct the neuronal connectome of a four-eye visual circuit in the larva of the annelid <i>Platynereis</i> using serial-section transmission electron microscopy. In this 71-neuron circuit, photoreceptors connect via three layers of interneurons to motorneurons, which innervate trunk muscles. By combining eye ablations with behavioral experiments, we show that the circuit compares light on either side of the body and stimulates body bending upon left-right light imbalance during visual phototaxis. We also identified an interneuron motif that enhances sensitivity to different light intensity contrasts. The <i>Platynereis</i> eye circuit has the hallmarks of a visual system, including spatial light detection and contrast modulation, illustrating how image-forming eyes may have evolved via intermediate stages contrasting only a light and a dark field during a simple visual task."

Here we reconstruct the neuronal connectome of a four-eye visual circuit in the larva of the annelid <i>Platynereis</i> using serial-section transmission electron microscopy. In this 71-neuron circuit, photoreceptors connect via three layers of interneurons to motorneurons, which innervate trunk muscles. By combining eye ablations with behavioral experiments, we show that the circuit compares light on either side of the body and stimulates body bending upon left-right light imbalance during visual phototaxis. We also identified an interneuron motif that enhances sensitivity to different light intensity contrasts. The <i>Platynereis</i> eye circuit has the hallmarks of a visual system, including spatial light detection and contrast modulation, illustrating how image-forming eyes may have evolved via intermediate stages contrasting only a light and a dark field during a simple visual task."

This phenomenon, known as phototaxis, is thought to help animals navigate through their environment.

One animal with a simple visual system for phototactic behavior is the marine worm <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i>."

Using a laser to destroy all four eyes abolished this behavior, as did the removal of both eyes on either side of the head. By contrast, removing one eye from each side had no effect. This was because these larvae were still able to simultaneously compare the amounts of light reaching the left and right sides of their body, and to use any difference in these levels as a directional cue to guide swimming."

Platynereis</i> larvae develop four visual eyes, the \u2018adult eyes\u2019 (henceforth \u2018eyes\u2019), that are the precursors of the adult's visual pigment-cup eyes, and are distinct from the more ventrally located \u2018eyespots\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib22\">J\u00e9kely et al., 2008</a>). These eyes consist of only 2\u20137 photoreceptors, a few shading pigment cells, and a lens, representing the simplest visual eyes described to date (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rhode, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arendt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Randel et al., 2013</a>). The <i>Platynereis</i> larval visual connectome consists of 71 neurons and 1106 synapses, and was reconstructed from a tissue block containing the larval head and trunk. Using behavioral experiments combined with eye ablations we demonstrate that the eyes mediate spatial vision, whereby light intensities at the left and right eyes are compared to mediate tail bending during phototactic turns. This combination of connectomics and behavioral analysis provides a circuit-level and mechanistic explanation for the regulation of phototactic behavior by spatial vision. The <i>Platynereis</i> visual connectome also provides insights into the origin of visual eyes, and suggests that phototaxis may have been the first visual task in evolution performed by animals."

We then manually traced all neurons lying on synaptic pathways from photoreceptors to locomotor organs (muscles and ciliary bands). We identified 21 photoreceptor cells (PRC), 42 interneurons (IN) and 8 motorneurons (MN) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1\u20134</a>), forming a \u2018minimal eye circuit\u2019 from sensors to effectors. We identified 1106 chemical synapses between these cells and their motor targets. We found further sensory neurons other than the photoreceptors providing direct or indirect input to the minimal eye circuit. These upstream circuits will be described in detail elsewhere. In this paper we focus on the analysis of the 71 neurons constituting the minimal eye circuit."

These cells form lamellae that tightly surround the primary and secondary optic neuropils from the dorsal but not the ventral side (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The main targets of the photoreceptors of the four eyes are four primary interneurons (IN<sup>1</sup>), with photoreceptors from one eye forming several (up to 30) synaptic contacts to one primary interneuron with a contralateral cell body (e.g., PRC<sup>al</sup> to IN<sup>1pr</sup>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The four eyes and the four primary interneurons show a crosswise arrangement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

One type of interneuron is intrinsic to the optic neuropil (IN<sup>int</sup>) with both ipsilateral and contralateral cell bodies and axons crossing the midline.

Due to the lack of further trunk sections we did not trace descending motorneuron axons along their entire length, therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that motorneurons have other synaptic partners in the trunk. Nevertheless, these data represent, to our knowledge, the most complete connectomic reconstruction of a visual circuit to date, from photoreceptors to effector muscles and ciliated cells."

Photoreceptor synaptic vesicles were not significantly different from neuromuscular synaptic vesicles in motorneurons. However, neurociliary synaptic vesicles in motorneurons were significantly smaller than photoreceptor or neuromuscular synaptic vesicles. These observations indicate the use of different neurotransmitters in the eye circuitry and also suggest that the dual-function muscle- and cilio-motor neurons (MN<sup>r2</sup>, MN<sup>l1</sup>) may have mixed neurotransmitter content."

This is consistent with earlier observations showing that the longitudinal trunk muscles, targets of the ventral motorneurons, are influenced by acetylcholine (<a href=\"#bib15\">Denes et al., 2007</a>). A marker for GABAergic cells, <i>glutamate decarboxlase</i> (<i>gad</i>), partly colocalizes with the ventral cholinergic domain, in the area of the motorneuron cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This suggests that some motorneurons may have mixed GABAergic and cholinergic identity. The difference in mean vesicle size at neuromuscular and neurociliary synapses in motorneurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) also supports a mixed neurotransmitter identity. Further cellular resolution mapping will be needed to confirm this and to establish the neurotransmitter identities of individual interneurons and motorneurons."

When we used alternating illumination from the two opposite sides of an assay cuvette we observed directional swimming (phototaxis) of the larvae. Larvae showed mixed behavior, with some swimming towards and others away from the light source (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Such sign-switch in directional swimming responses is common for marine larvae and can be influenced by various environmental stimuli (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thorson, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Young and Chia, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Marsden, 1990</a>). During reorientations we could observe prominent body bending in 4-day-old larvae and weaker bending in 3-day-old larvae, suggesting that larvae turn by contracting longitudinal muscles while swimming with cilia (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a> and data not shown). In agreement with the cholinergic identity of the motorneurons, treatment with mecamylamine, an acetylcholine receptor antagonist, blocked negative phototaxis. Mecamylamine treatment increased swimming speed, probably via influencing cilia (<a href=\"#bib22\">J\u00e9kely et al., 2008</a>). The effects could be reversed by washout (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Randel et al., 2014</a>)."

The visual contrast then leads to the graded contraction of the longitudinal muscles during turns. The modulation of ciliary beating, not investigated here, may also contribute to phototactic turns, as is known for younger larvae (<a href=\"#bib22\">J\u00e9kely et al., 2008</a>).

This reciprocal wiring may provide mutual inhibition and reinforce small differences in activation between the crosswise eyes, potentially representing a network motif for enhancing contrast-detection. Modularity analysis also revealed that the sub-networks of the crosswise eyes are more strongly connected than those of the pairwise eyes (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

We ablated a bilateral pair of eyes, thus eliminating inputs to one side of both crosswise mutual IN<sup>1</sup> motifs. We expect that these larvae would have a reduced bending response at the same level of contrast. We also performed crosswise eye ablations, leaving input to one of the crosswise IN<sup>1</sup> motifs intact. We then exposed larvae to a 488 nm background illumination and measured their tail bending following unilateral eye illumination with 488 nm stimulus light of varying intensity. Larvae with pairwise ablation of the anterior eyes showed significantly reduced bending relative to non-ablated controls with the average maximum tail displacement reduced to approximately half (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). In contrast, larvae with crosswise eye ablation showed stronger bending that was not significantly different from non-ablated controls. Although both crosswise and pairwise ablated larvae have only two eyes and are phototactic (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), these results show that pairwise ablated larvae have a markedly reduced motor response at the same level of contrast. We conclude that the strong mutual contacts between the crosswise IN<sup>1</sup> cells represent a circuit motif that enhances turning responses during phototaxis."

Instead, spatial vision relies on at least two eyes, pointing in different directions, and the underlying neural circuit that contrasts simultaneous light inputs at the left and right eyes. Furthermore, connectomics and modularity analysis revealed that the four eyes connect to the downstream visual circuitry in a crosswise manner, showing point symmetry. The crosswise-eye-modules show mutual connections at the level of the primary interneurons. In agreement with this, ablation experiments demonstrated that a bilateral pair of eyes elicits a smaller motor response than a crosswise pair, at the same level of light-intensity contrast. The contrast enhancement takes place in the primary optic neuropil circuitry, and the IN<sup>ton</sup> may relay a contrasted, one-sided signal to the secondary optic neuropil."

Our circuit reconstructions partly explain the bimodality of the behavior (either positive or negative phototaxis). Such switching behavior requires neuronal connections between the eyes on one body side and the muscles on both body sides. We found that indeed the circuit diverges bilaterally at the level of the Schn\u00f6rkel interneurons (IN<sup>sn</sup>), when these cells synapse to motorneurons of both the left and right body side. The Schn\u00f6rkel interneuron synapses form at axon segments either proximal or distal to the motorneuron cell bodies (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6). The spatial organization of synapses may provide an initial bias to the system, favoring bends on one body side. Further modulatory input may influence this bias, inducing a sign switch. There are several sensory neurons, not described here, that feed into the minimal eye circuit at the middle segment of the motorneuron axons (NR, LABC, and GJ, unpublished). Further work will be needed to characterize the possible roles of these neurons in sign switching."

In this vertebrate, unilateral illumination leads to a lateral turn away from the light during negative phototaxis. However, under some circumstances lampreys display positive phototaxis. Lesion experiments demonstrated the involvement of the pretectum and reticulospinal neurons in phototaxis, the latter forming the descending control system. Surgically severing connections between the pretectum and the ipsilateral reticulospinal neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>) leads to a sign switch in the phototactic response when the ipsilateral side is illuminated. Transection of the ventral rhombencephalic commissure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>) in turn reduces the turning angle during negative phototaxis. Thus both the <i>Platynereis</i> and the lamprey phototactic circuits are characterized by extensive midline crossing at several levels, bilateral divergence to allow context-dependent sign switching, and bilateral, probably inhibitory, interactions to enhance turning magnitude (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>)."

More complex image-forming eyes may have repeatedly evolved from such phototactic eyes. Larval eyes sometimes directly develop into the image-forming eyes of the adults (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cazaux, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blumer, 1994</a>). In <i>Platynereis</i>, and several other annelids and mollusks, the larval eyes develop into the adult's eyes, which harbor hundreds or thousands of photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rhode, 1992</a>) and mediate low-resolution image-forming vision. In <i>Platynereis</i>, we identified visual phototaxis as the first function during the development of the eyes. As in development, also during evolution the first images seen by animals may have consisted of a dark field at the bottom and a bright field at the top of the ocean."

Frozen samples were cryosubstituted with 2% osmium tetroxide in acetone and 0.5% uranyl acetate in a cryosubstitution unit (EM AFS-2; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) over a regime of gradually rising temperatures. Samples were embedded in Epon. 40\u201350-nm serial sections were cut starting from the anterior end of a larva (<i>Platynereis</i> HT-9-3) on a Reichert Jung Ultracut E microtome. The sections were collected on single-slotted copper grids (NOTSCH-NUM 2 \u00d7 1 mm, Science Service, Munich, Germany) with Formvar support film, contrasted with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, and carbon coated to stabilize the film. Image acquisition of serial sections was performed at a pixel size of 3.72 nm on a FEI TECNAI Spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon) equipped with an UltraScan 4000 4 \u00d7 4k digital camera using the image acquisition software Digital Micrograph (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Stitching and alignment were accomplished using TrakEM2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cardona et al., 2010</a>). The first 1245 layers were cut at 50 nm and aligned using an elastic alignment algorithm (<a href=\"#bib36\">Saalfeld et al., 2012</a>). We later found that the larva was slightly tilted, and we did not reach the muscles and the ciliary band on the right side of the animal. We therefore sectioned a further 445 sections at 40 nm, and aligned these using the rigid alignment algorithm in TrakEM2. All structures were segmented manually as area-lists or area-trees by an expert tracer (NR). Traces were exported into 3Dviewer, Imaris and Blender. Given the simple anatomy of the neurons and the large average diameter of axons tracing was in many cases unambiguous. Neurons with several short branches or with uncertain continuation were traced again by another expert tracer (LABC)."

A third group is formed by the IN<sup>ton</sup> cells, distinguished by their unique projection pattern from the primary to the secondary optic neuropil. Schn\u00f6rkel interneurons (IN<sup>sn</sup>) form a distinct class with ventral cell bodies and curved axons (\u2018Schn\u00f6rkel\u2019 is German for \u2018curlicue\u2019) projecting to the ipsilateral secondary optic neuropil and synapsing on the motorneurons. The dorsal interneurons (IN<sup>dc</sup>) have dorsally located cell bodies and axons that project to the secondary optic neuropil. The ventral interneurons (IN<sup>vc</sup>) have ventrally located cell bodies and axons that project to the secondary optic neuropil. Motorneurons were recognized based on their innervation of dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles as well as multi-ciliated cells (prototroch or metatroch). Motorneurons form two bilateral clusters. For some motorneurons we could not find motor synapses, however, we could classify these cells as motorneurons based on their cell body position and posteriorly projecting axons. Neurons of all types are labeled based on body side (left <sup>[l]</sup> or right <sup>[r]</sup>) and numbered (e.g., IN<sup>tonl1</sup>)."

Perhaps a further note is required on the fixation, staining and imaging, which seems not to give very clear membrane profiles.

However, in general it looks like strong redundancy in the upstream connections and interactions between the four primary interneurons. In contrast, connections elsewhere are diffuse and far less redundant. To me this immediately suggests there should be command nexus, i.e., a set of (perhaps not morphologically very obvious) key command synapses linking the primary INs to the rest of the circuit. If not, it would imply the downstream behavioral response should be both labile and very finely graded, i.e., subject to numerous competing secondary modulations of equal strength, which may or may not correlate with what the behavioral data is showing. A proper circuit analysis might make the alternatives clearer, without requiring readers to go back to the raw data and immerse themselves in it."

In part, because these previous papers also avoid summary diagrams, it is difficult for a non-specialist to compare those results with the cells described here. Are the some or all of the cells described here ones for which the transmitter is not known, or has this been determined? Knowing the transmitters, and even just the vesicle type, one should have some idea of the nature of the synapses, e.g., +, - or modulatory, and this would contribute to the reader's grasp of system function. For example, since histamine is the PRC transmitter in arthropods, is it the same in annelids or not \u2013 if the former then this tells us something about the likely nature of the PRC synapses in this system, which should be useful."

We found an accumulation of vesicles close to the membrane at all sites that were identified as synapses in the low-resolution scans. We also quantified synaptic vesicle diameter for several synapses. We have defined the criteria for synapse identification in the \u201cMorphology of neurons and synapses\u201d section.

However, in general it looks like strong redundancy in the upstream connections and interactions between the four primary interneurons. In contrast, connections elsewhere are diffuse and far less redundant. To me this immediately suggests there should be command nexus, i.e., a set of (perhaps not morphologically very obvious) key command synapses linking the primary INs to the rest of the circuit. If not, it would imply the downstream behavioral response should be both labile and very finely graded, i.e., subject to numerous competing secondary modulations of equal strength, which may or may not correlate with what the behavioral data is showing. A proper circuit analysis might make the alternatives clearer, without requiring readers to go back to the raw data and immerse themselves in it</i>."

Are the some or all of the cells described here ones for which the transmitter is not known, or has this been determined? Knowing the transmitters, and even just the vesicle type, one should have some idea of the nature of the synapses, e.g., +, - or modulatory, and this would contribute to the reader's grasp of system function.
