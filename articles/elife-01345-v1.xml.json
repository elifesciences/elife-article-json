Lysozyme microcrystals were frozen on an electron microscopy grid, and electron diffraction data collected to 1.7 \u00c5 resolution. We developed a data collection protocol to collect a full-tilt series in electron diffraction to atomic resolution. A single tilt series contains up to 90 individual diffraction patterns collected from a single crystal with tilt angle increment of 0.1\u20131\u00b0 and a total accumulated electron dose less than 10 electrons per angstrom squared. We indexed the data from three crystals and used them for structure determination of lysozyme by molecular replacement followed by crystallographic refinement to 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. This proof of principle paves the way for the implementation of a new technique, which we name \u2018MicroED\u2019, that may have wide applicability in structural biology."

Lysozyme microcrystals were frozen on an electron microscopy grid, and electron diffraction data collected to 1.7 \u00c5 resolution. We developed a data collection protocol to collect a full-tilt series in electron diffraction to atomic resolution. A single tilt series contains up to 90 individual diffraction patterns collected from a single crystal with tilt angle increment of 0.1\u20131\u00b0 and a total accumulated electron dose less than 10 electrons per angstrom squared. We indexed the data from three crystals and used them for structure determination of lysozyme by molecular replacement followed by crystallographic refinement to 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. This proof of principle paves the way for the implementation of a new technique, which we name \u2018MicroED\u2019, that may have wide applicability in structural biology."

In a typical X-ray crystallography experiment, a beam of X-rays is directed at a protein crystal, which scatters some of the X-ray photons to produce a diffraction pattern. The crystal is then rotated through a small angle and another diffraction pattern is recorded. Finally, after this process has been repeated enough times, it is possible to work backwards from the diffraction patterns to figure out the structure of the protein."

However, some proteins do not form crystals at all, and others only form small crystals. It is possible to overcome this problem by using extremely short pulses of X-rays, but this requires a very large number of small crystals and ultrashort X-ray pulses are only available at a handful of research centers around the world. There is, therefore, a need for other approaches that can determine the structure of proteins that only form small crystals."

However, the interactions between the electrons in the beam and the crystal are much stronger than those between the X-ray photons and the crystal. This means that meaningful amounts of data can be collected from much smaller crystals. However, it is normally only possible to collect one diffraction pattern from each crystal because of beam induced damage. Researchers have developed methods to merge the diffraction patterns produced by hundreds of small crystals, but to date these techniques have only worked with very thin two-dimensional crystals that contain only one layer of the protein of interest."

Called MicroED, this technique involves placing the crystal in a transmission electron cryo-microscope, which is a fairly standard piece of equipment in many laboratories. The normal \u2018low-dose\u2019 electron beam in one of these microscopes would normally damage the crystal after a single diffraction pattern had been collected. However, Shi et al. realized that it was possible to obtain diffraction patterns without severely damaging the crystal if they dramatically reduced the normal low-dose electron beam. By reducing the electron dose by a factor of 200, it was possible to collect up to 90 diffraction patterns from the same, very small, three-dimensional crystal, and then\u2014similar to what happens in X-ray crystallography\u2014work backwards to figure out the structure of the protein. Shi et al. demonstrated the feasibility of the MicroED approach by using it to determine the structure of lysozyme, which is widely used as a test protein in crystallography, with a resolution of 2.9 \u00c5. This proof-of principle study paves the way for crystallographers to study protein that cannot be studied with existing techniques."

Crystals are solids composed of repeated structural motifs in a three-dimensional lattice (hereafter called \u20183D crystals\u2019). The periodic structure of the crystalline solid acts as a diffraction grating to scatter the X-rays. For every elastic scattering event that contributes to a diffraction pattern there are \u223c10 inelastic events that cause beam damage (<a href=\"#bib20\">Henderson, 1995</a>). Therefore, large crystals are required to withstand the high levels of radiation damage received during data collection (<a href=\"#bib20\">Henderson, 1995</a>). Despite the development of highly sophisticated robotics for crystal growth assays and the implementation of microfocus beamlines (<a href=\"#bib31\">Moukhametzianov et al., 2008</a>), this important step remains a critical bottleneck. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, researchers have turned to femtosecond X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chapman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boutet et al., 2012</a>), in which a very intense pulse of X-rays yields coherent signal in a time shorter than the destructive response to deposited energy. While this technique shows great promise, the current implementation of the technology requires an extremely large number of crystals (millions) and access to sources is still in developmental stages."

The crystals that are used must be very thin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henderson and Unwin, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Henderson et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kuhlbrandt et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kimura et al., 1997</a>). Because electrons interact with materials more strongly than X-rays (<a href=\"#bib20\">Henderson, 1995</a>), electrons can yield meaningful data from relatively small and thin crystals. This technique has been used successfully to determine the structures of several proteins from thin two-dimensional crystals (2D crystals) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wisedchaisri et al., 2011</a>). High energy electrons result in a large amount of radiation damage to the sample, leading to loss in resolution and destruction of the crystalline material (<a href=\"#bib15\">Glaeser, 1971</a>). As each crystal can usually yield only a single diffraction pattern, structure determination is only possible by merging data originating from hundreds of individual crystals. For example, electron diffraction data from more than 200 individual crystals were merged to generate a data set for aquaporin-0 at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gonen et al., 2005</a>). While electron crystallography has been successful with 2D crystals, previous attempts at using electron diffraction for structure determination from protein 3D crystals were not successful. A number of studies detail the difficulties associated with data collection and processing of diffraction data that originates from several hundreds of 3D crystals, limiting the ability to integrate and merge the data in order to determine a structure in such a way (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>)."

We developed a strategy for data collection with extremely low electron dose and procedures for indexing and integrating reflections. We processed the diffraction data and determined the structure of lysozyme at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. Thus, a high-resolution protein structure can be determined from electron diffraction of three-dimensional protein crystals in an electron microscope."

These specks are up to 6 orders of magnitude smaller in volume than the larger crystals in the drop. The solution containing these microcrystals was applied to an electron microscopy holey-carbon grid with a pipette and plunged into liquid ethane. The grids were then imaged using a 200 kV TEM under cryogenic conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). More than 100 microcrystals were typically observed per grid preparation, and these ranged in size from several microns to sub micron.

The FEG can generate a very coherent beam with an energy-spread function of &lt;1 eV at 200 kV acceleration voltage. The electron beam wavelength is 0.025 \u00c5 at 200 kV compared with \u223c1 \u00c5 for X-rays. Under such conditions, the Ewald sphere in our experiments is nearly flat (the sphere is off the reciprocal plane by only 0.003 \u00c5<sup>\u22121</sup> at 2 \u00c5 resolution) even in the high-resolution range. Measurements of the full width at half maximum intensity for the strongest reflections indicate that the reflections in our experiments are very tight, spreading less than a 6 pixel sphere that corresponds to \u223c1/1000 \u00c5. (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) In our experiments, the shortest unit cell dimension for lysozyme in reciprocal space is a* = b* = 1/77 \u00c5. Therefore, without beam oscillation or mechanical oscillation of the crystal (microscope compustage), the lattice points on a single projection that are not exactly at the Ewald sphere surface will give partial intensities."

In electron diffraction, dynamic scattering (multi scattering events) could redistribute primary reflection intensities, reducing the accuracy of the intensity measurements by randomly contributing to the observed intensities (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grigorieff et al., 1996</a>). The lysozyme crystals have P4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2, symmetry and systematic absences are expected at (2n+1,0,0). However, very weak reflections were observed at the positions where absences were expected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). It is likely that these reflections originate from dynamic scattering events. We plotted the intensities along the a* and b* axes and compared the intensity values. The intensities of Miller indices (2n+1,0,0) and (0,2n+1,0) were measured and compared to the intensities of the four immediately adjacent reflections (2n+2,1,0), (2n+2,\u22121,0), (2n\u22122,1,0), and (2n\u22122,\u22121,0). On average, the intensity in the systematic absences was found to be 4.9% of the total intensity of the adjacent spots. (Standard deviation 2.7%, Max 12.4%, n = 17). Moreover, comparison of our experimental intensities with intensities obtained by X-ray diffraction of lysozyme of the same crystal form indicates that our data follow a similar trend and are not dominated by intensity randomness. A Pearson correlation coefficient between the two data sets was 0.63 from 6.0 to 13.5 \u00c5 (0.56 from 2.0\u201313.5 \u00c5), indicating conservation of reflection hierarchy\u2014strong intensities remain strong and weak intensities remain weak. Together, our analyses suggest that multiple scattering contributes at maximum roughly 10% to the intensity value and that at least for structure determination at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution such an error in intensity appears to be tolerable. It is possible that dynamic scattering will become a significant source of error at higher resolutions and some correction algorithm will then have to be developed."

Better programs need to be developed for accurately determining lattice parameters, indexing all reflections, extracting the intensities and correcting for incomplete intensities, dynamic scattering, and Ewald sphere curvature.

Relatively minor modifications to existing programs such as MOSFLM (<a href=\"#bib29\">Leslie and Powell, 2007</a>) should allow the handling of electron diffraction data from 3D crystals and take advantage of the large body of work already dedicated to processing X-ray diffraction data."

As the resolution increases, this event becomes increasingly unlikely.

Such phasing methods are standard in X-ray crystallography and rely on differences in intensity values between a native data set and heavy metal derivative data sets. It is possible that in electron crystallography dynamic scattering could hinder phasing by such methods, and new algorithms will need to be developed to make this possible. Phase extension from projection maps or from low-resolution density maps can also be used for direct phasing (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gipson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wisedchaisri and Gonen, 2011</a>). It is also possible that single particle cryo-EM could be used for direct phasing as previously demonstrated where a low-resolution single particle map was used to phase X-ray diffraction data (<a href=\"#bib36\">Speir et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dodson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Xiong, 2008</a>).

It must be viewed in the context of the publication 50 years ago of the 6\u00c5 X-ray structure of the same tetragonal lysozyme crystals (Blake et al., Nature, 1962), the 2\u00c5 structure 3 years later (Blake et al., Nature, 1965) and the 0.94\u00c5 structure in 2001, which is cited in the present paper. Lysozyme has been a prototype for testing out new methods and approaches ever since Roberto Poljak crystallized it in the 1950s. It has also been studied recently by electron diffraction and imaging (Nederhof et al., Acta Cryst D69, 1223-1230 (2013); Nederhof et al., Acta Cryst D69, 852-859 (2013)). It would be helpful if the authors of the current paper cited the above publications. There is also Moukhametzianov et al., Acta Cryst D, 64, 158-166 (2008) who collected a full 3D 1.5\u00c5 resolution dataset from very small microcrystals of xylanase using an X-ray microfocus beam."

As Moukhametzianov et al., showed, there is also less radiation damage in X-ray crystallography when the crystals get very small because the secondary photoelectrons that are emitted when an X-ray is adsorbed can escape without depositing all their energy inside the crystal. The central background of inelastically scattered electrons in the electron diffraction patterns the present authors show is quite high. This high background could be greatly improved by using a zero-loss energy filter to remove these electrons. The paper should discuss the issue of damage, include some damage statistics from the present work (see item 2 in the revision requests, below), and mention the longer-term value of using a zero-loss energy filter."

This would be greatly improved if the now fully established method of profile fitting that is used by the X-ray crystallographers and the methods for correcting partial reflection suggested below were implemented. (See changes in Abstract requested below.) If the work could be repeated with zero-loss energy filtering, a better detector, plus proper estimation of intensities, we might then be in a better position to see how successful the technique is, and what potential it has. Nevertheless, this is a useful step along the way."

However, once we began the analysis we found that the large number of partial intensities made it difficult to accurately track any individual spot over a complete data set of up to 90 frames. We therefore performed an additional experiment to quantify the effect of dose on spot intensities. Diffraction data was collected from a single lysozyme microcrystal using a dose of 0.1e-/\u00c52 per frame. 120 frames were collected without tilting the crystal for a total accumulated dose of \u223c12e-/\u00c52. In this way we could follow individual reflections throughout all frames and plotted the intensity values versus accumulated dose. This new data is presented as <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and discussed in the revised text. We found that the diffraction intensity is not adversely affected until the accumulated dose reaches a \u201ccritical\u201d value of \u223c9e-/\u00c52."
