This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Transcriptional amplification in tumor cells with elevated c-Myc\u2019 by <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al. (2012)</a>, published in <i>Cell</i> in 2012. The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3E and 3F. In these experiments, elevated levels of c-Myc in the P493-6 cell model of Burkitt's lymphoma results in an increase of the total level of RNA using UV/VIS spectrophotometry (Figure 3E; <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>) and on the mRNA levels/cell for a large set of genes using digital gene expression technology (Figure 3F; <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Transcriptional amplification in tumor cells with elevated c-Myc\u2019 by <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al. (2012)</a>, published in <i>Cell</i> in 2012. The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3E and 3F. In these experiments, elevated levels of c-Myc in the P493-6 cell model of Burkitt's lymphoma results in an increase of the total level of RNA using UV/VIS spectrophotometry (Figure 3E; <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>) and on the mRNA levels/cell for a large set of genes using digital gene expression technology (Figure 3F; <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

While this was thought to occur by regulation of a specific subset of genes, <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al.

The levels of c-Myc can be reduced and subsequently re-induced in a gradual time-dependent manner, as determined by western blot, which is shown in Figure 1B (<a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>). As soon as 1 hr after re-induction, the protein levels of c-Myc increased above the repressed levels, which by 24 hr were similar to the tetracycline-free condition (<a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>). This system has been used in other studies with similar results observed (<a href=\"#bib10\">Schuhmacher et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Pajic et al., 2000</a>). This experiment is important to replicate because it assesses the level of c-Myc re-induction with this system that will be used in the following experiments.

(2012)</a> reported an increase in levels of absolute RNA over the timecourse of c-Myc re-induction. This experiment shows that c-Myc increases RNA content per cell, indicating c-Myc functions primarily in transcriptional amplification. Related experiments, using mouse B cells, also observed the same c-Myc-dependent amplification of cellular RNA content (<a href=\"#bib6\">Nie et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>). However, similar experiments in 3T9 fibroblasts or U2OS cells expressing an inducible c-Myc did not observe an increase in cellular RNA content (<a href=\"#bib8\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Walz et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, an increase in total cellular RNA content was observed in 3T9 fibroblasts following serum stimulation, which was not observed when c-Myc was deleted in these cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>).

(2012)</a> examined the transcriptional profile of a large number of genes from multiple functional categories in cells before and after re-induction of c-Myc using digital gene expression. Re-induction of c-Myc increased the number of active genes (defined as greater than 1 transcript/cell), but did not alter silent genes (defined as less than 0.5 transcript/cell) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>). This key finding suggests that elevated c-Myc levels lead to an amplification of the existing transcriptional profile. This finding was observed in other experiments using mouse B cells treated with the Myc-Max dimerization inhibitor 10058-F4 and analyzed by ChIP-Seq (<a href=\"#bib6\">Nie et al., 2012)</a>. Another report using P493-6 cells also found an increase in transcription of c-Myc target genes when c-Myc re-induction was titrated to different concentrations by microarray analysis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Schuhmacher and Eick, 2013</a>). This experiment is replicated in Protocols 3 and 4. Recently, two papers were published that used primarily RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to focus on assessing if the transcriptional effects of c-Myc are direct or indirect (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alderton, 2014</a>). These studies found that RNA amplification and promoter/enhancer invasion by c-Myc were separable events in 3T9 fibroblasts and U2OS cells, suggesting that c-Myc regulates a distinct subset of genes, which indirectly lead to RNA amplification (<a href=\"#bib8\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Walz et al., 2014</a>)."

The three original custom code sets had a total of 495 genes, of which only 479 were unique, so the replication custom code set will only contain these unique genes. The nCounter GX human immunology kit from NanoString has been updated to a new version. In the second version, there are 106 new genes not present in the first version, of which 101 are unique to all genes examined in this experiment, while 38 genes that were in the first version are excluded in the second version. Thus, 63 unique genes will be added to the total gene set compared with the original study changing the total examined genes from 1346 to 1409. A separate lot of serum was included to assess if there is variability between different batches of serum. The original study analyzed these data using the Wilcoxon sum rank test, however since expressions of the same gene across different conditions are not independent, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, a non-parametric test for comparing two paired samples, will be used instead."

The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CB) aims to replicate experiments that are impactful, but does not necessarily aim to replicate all the impactful experiments in any given paper. In this case, the RP:CB core team felt that the RNA profiling experiment in <a href=\"#bib5\">Lin et al., 2012</a>, was critical as it was a key part of the reported finding that <i>Myc</i> induction increased the expression of active genes but not silent genes, indicating the predominant effect of substantially elevated levels of <i>Myc</i> is amplified transcription of the existing gene expression program. We also agree the ChIP-seq experiments are a critical component of the overall reported finding, however these types of experiments (sequencing) are excluded from all articles. As this was only a part of the paper, the other experiments were still eligible. These exclusion criteria are outlined on the project page (<a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies\">https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies</a>) and in a Feature article describing the project (recently accepted for publication by <i>eLife</i>). We agree that the exclusion of certain experiments limits the scope of what can be analyzed by the project, but we are attempting to identify a balance of breadth of sampling for general inference with sensible investment of resources on replication projects to determine to what extent the included experiments are reproducible. Therefore, we will restrict our analysis to the experiments being replicated and will not include discussion of experiments not being replicated in this study."

However, this excludes 69 genes from the analysis that fall between 1 and 0.5. Thus, in the analysis plan we have included silent genes as defined by the original authors (&lt; 0.5 transcript/cell) and also non-active genes (&lt; 1 transcript/cell)."

This can be done, a priori, by including some cross-study variation. This will be helpful for you to plan on the number of replicates and so forth. Papers by Giovanni Parmigiani and collaborators at the Dana\u2013Farber provide some estimates about cross-study variation that could be used for this purpose. Worst case, you should budget some additional variability because of cross-study reproducibility, and increase the sample size as appropriate. We also want you to compute and report power post-hoc/on-the-fly on your own data. Some minimum power should be guaranteed using summaries of your own data</i>."

The cross-study variation, such as approaches that utilize the 95% confidence interval of the effect size, can be useful in conducting power calculations when planning adequate sample sizes for detecting the true population effect size, which requires a range of possible observed effect sizes. However, the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is designed to conduct replications that have 80% power to detect the point estimate of the originally reported effect size. While this has the limitation of being underpowered to detect smaller effects than what is originally reported, this standardizes the approach across all studies to be designed to detect the originally reported effect size with at least 80% power. Also, while the minimum power guarantee is beneficial for observing a range of possible effect sizes, the experiments in this replication, and all experiments in the project, are designed to detect the originally reported effect size with a minimum power of 80%. Thus, performing power calculations during or after data collection is not necessary in this replication attempt as all studies included are already designed to meet a minimum power or are identified beforehand as being underpowered and thus are not included in the confirmatory analysis plan. The papers by Giovanni Parmigiani and collaborators highlight the importance of accounting for variability that can occur across different studies, specifically gene expression data. While it is possible for a difference in variance between the originally reported results and the replication data, this will be reflected in the presentation of the data and a possible reason for obtaining a different effect size estimate."
