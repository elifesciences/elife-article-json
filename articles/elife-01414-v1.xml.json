During transcription, an enzyme called RNA polymerase moves along a DNA template in order to produce a single strand of messenger RNA with a sequence of bases that matches the sequence in the DNA (with uracil replacing thymine). For several decades, a variety of structural, biochemical and single-molecule studies have been used to probe the details of transcription, but many open questions remain. Specifically, what are the key steps in the process that converts chemical energy into the mechanical energy that is needed to move the RNA polymerase in the required direction, and how fast are these steps? Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Carlos Bustamante and colleagues describe how a combination of single-molecule measurements and theoretical modelling has provided important insights into these questions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dangkulwanich et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "The main reaction pathway for transcription has three basic steps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). First, the RNA polymerase moves forward by one base pair along the DNA template (a process called translocation); thermal energy actually causes the polymerase to oscillate back and forth, so something needs to happen to convert this random motion into motion along the DNA template in the correct direction. Second, a nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) molecule binds to the active site of the RNA polymerase. Third, chemical catalysis results in the nucleotide being added to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA chain and pyrophosphate (which is produced when the phosphates are broken down to provide energy) being released. This whole process is then repeated to add another nucleotide. However, instead of moving forward overall, the RNA polymerase sometimes moves backwards along the DNA template and displaces the 3\u2032 end of the RNA chain from the active site of the polymerase: this process, which is called backtracking, pauses RNA synthesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Alternatively, the RNA polymerase may enter the backtracking pathway (top left to bottom) which pauses the synthesis of RNA. The RNA polymerase is part of a larger structure called the transcription elongation complex (TEC) that comprises RNA polymerase, DNA and the nascent RNA transcript. The main reaction pathway for the addition of nucleotides has three steps, and it starts (top left) with the TEC in a \u2018pre-translocated state\u2019 and with <i>n</i> nucleotides in the RNA transcript. The first step involves the RNA polymerase moving to \u2018post-translocated state\u2019 (second from left). The second step involves a molecule of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) binding to the active site of the RNA polymerase. The third step is a chemical reaction that results in the nucleotide (green dot) being added to the RNA transcript (to give <i>n</i>+1 nucleotides) and the TEC returning to a pre-translocated state; the energy needed to drive this reaction come from the nucleotide condensation reaction, with pyrophosphate (PPi) being released as a by-product of this process. The widths of the grey arrows are proportional to the rates of the various transitions reported by in Dangkulwanich et al.; it can be seen that the translocation steps are not in equilibrium, whereas the NTP binding steps are in equilibrium."

Now, by questioning the assumption that the translocation step is in equilibrium, Bustamante and colleagues\u2014including Manchuta Dangkulwanich, Toyotaka Ishibashi and Shixin Liu as joint first authors\u2014argue that a secondary NTP binding site is not needed."

Using this method, they were able to measure how the elongation velocity depended on the applied force and on the concentration of NTP, and also how pausing depended on these two variables. They also performed experiments in which a structure called a nucleosome was placed on the DNA template: this structure slows the forward motion of the Pol II, but it does not have any impact on the backward motion (<a href=\"#bib7\">Hodges et al., 2009</a>)."

First, they found that the forward motion of the RNA polymerase was much slower than previously assumed, and also much slower than the backward motion: the forward motion was faster than the catalysis step by a factor of only 2.5, whereas the backwards motion was faster by a factor of 20. Since such a simple model with the translocation steps in the main reaction pathway not being in equilibrium could explain the force-velocity results, Dangkulwanich et al. argue that there is no need to invoke a more complex model with a secondary NTP binding site. Second, they found that backtracking by one base pair is much easier than backtracking by two or more base pairs."

Both models produce similar results, and the \u2018intermediate pause state\u2019 proposed for <i>E. coli</i> plays a similar role in modelling as the one-base-pair backtracking state does for Pol II in yeast."
