While PET studies revealed maturation-related changes, maturation of metabolic connectivity of the brain is not yet understood. Here, we show that rat brain metabolism is reconfigured to achieve long-distance connections with higher energy efficiency during maturation. Metabolism increased in anterior cerebrum and decreased in thalamus and cerebellum during maturation. When functional covariance patterns of PET images were examined, metabolic networks including default mode network (DMN) were extracted. Connectivity increased between the anterior and posterior parts of DMN and sensory-motor cortices during maturation. Energy efficiency, a ratio of connectivity strength to metabolism of a region, increased in medial prefrontal and retrosplenial cortices. Our data revealed that metabolic networks mature to increase metabolic connections and establish its efficiency between large-scale spatial components from childhood to early adulthood. Neurodevelopmental diseases might be understood by abnormal reconfiguration of metabolic connectivity and efficiency."

While PET studies revealed maturation-related changes, maturation of metabolic connectivity of the brain is not yet understood. Here, we show that rat brain metabolism is reconfigured to achieve long-distance connections with higher energy efficiency during maturation. Metabolism increased in anterior cerebrum and decreased in thalamus and cerebellum during maturation. When functional covariance patterns of PET images were examined, metabolic networks including default mode network (DMN) were extracted. Connectivity increased between the anterior and posterior parts of DMN and sensory-motor cortices during maturation. Energy efficiency, a ratio of connectivity strength to metabolism of a region, increased in medial prefrontal and retrosplenial cortices. Our data revealed that metabolic networks mature to increase metabolic connections and establish its efficiency between large-scale spatial components from childhood to early adulthood. Neurodevelopmental diseases might be understood by abnormal reconfiguration of metabolic connectivity and efficiency."

Among those neuroimaging techniques, positron emission tomography (PET) provides quantitative information regarding regional metabolism or synaptic neurochemicals with high sensitivity. As <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is taken up in the brain proportional to cerebral energy consumption and neuronal activity, FDG PET studies have been used to investigate regional energy metabolism during physiologic and pathologic processes. Previous brain developmental studies using FDG PET in humans assumed that the regional increase of metabolism was accompanied by regional increase of neuronal activity during brain maturation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chugani et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Phelps and Mazziotta, 1985</a>).

These specific regional activity patterns, so-called functional brain networks, are identified by neuroimaging studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deco et al., 2011</a>). Among several imaging approaches, resting state functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI)-based connectivity analyses revealed maturation of the functional networks during childhood and adolescence (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fair et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fair et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Supekar et al., 2009</a>). FDG PET can also reveal functional metabolic network and its maturation, exploiting the coupling between neuronal activity and metabolism. While the fMRI-based functional connectivity measures correlation of fast temporal fluctuations, metabolic connectivity measured by FDG PET reflects a cumulative energy consumption in several minutes and provides relatively stable information regarding steady resting state (<a href=\"#bib5\">Choi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Di et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Toussaint et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yakushev et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, FDG PET measures metabolic activity and connection patterns during awaken states even in animals as in humans, because FDG is taken up in the brain mainly during the period after injection and before the imaging under anesthesia."

As the high energetic costs are required for brain wiring to construct and maintain hub regions with dense connections, hub regions will show high glucose metabolism (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lord et al., 2013</a>). Brain regions were found to show different regional energy efficiency so that, for instance, subcortical regions consumed relatively lower metabolic energy per connection (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tomasi et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we can say that metabolism of brain regions could be determined both by the regional complexity of functional networks and their energy efficiency for wiring. Since the developmental changes in functional networks reconfigure the metabolic demands, energy efficiency of the\u00a0brain networks are going to be changed during maturation."

Metabolic network components extracted using ICA were default-mode, limbic, motor, and somatosensory ones, which have been regarded as important functional components also in humans. Further connectivity analyses using VOIs put on these components showed connection strength increased particularly in the anterior-posterior connections during maturation. This connection strength increase was accompanied by increased energy efficiency in the midline structures including medial prefrontal and retrosplenial cortices.

In human brains, ICA for metabolic networks revealed DMN successfully (<a href=\"#bib37\">Toussaint et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yakushev et al., 2013</a>). We also found homologous patterns in rats to those of humans. According to the studies comparing the networks acquired from fMRI and PET, each DMN from these modalities shared quite the similar anatomical regions, although distinctive patterns were found on these two modalities (<a href=\"#bib8\">Di et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Wehrl et al., 2013</a>). Of note, our PET-derived IC5 shared the regions of fMRI-derived DMN including retrosplenial cortices and small clusters of bilateral posterior hippocampi. The IC1 shared the regions of anterior part of DMN derived from fMRI, medial frontal cortices (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2012</a>). Considering that DMN-related regions are deactivated during attention-demanding and working memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raichle et al., 2001</a>), DMN may be constructed during brain maturation in adolescence to learn attention-demanding tasks. Previous human studies on the fMRI-derived functional networks revealed connectivity increase in DMN regions during maturation, particularly between the anterior and posterior midline structures (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fair et al., 2008</a>), which might be closely associated with the developmental process of working memory (<a href=\"#bib26\">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, fMRI-derived DMN showed two distinctive clusters, temporal-prefrontal and parietal subsystems, which considerably corresponded to our IC1 and IC5 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2012</a>). According to our results, the metabolic connections of these two clusters of DMN developed during brain maturation in rats. In spite of homologous network patterns of rat brain, metabolic networks derived from FDG PET were partly different from fMRI-derived networks. A discrepancy in DMN between fMRI and PET was also reported in human (<a href=\"#bib8\">Di et al., 2012</a>). In PET-derived networks in the rat brain, anterior and posterior part of DMN was separately extracted (IC1 and IC5). Furthermore, cingulate cortex was rarely included in IC1 or IC5, which was different from previous fMRI-derived DMN (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sierakowiak et al., 2015</a>). Nevertheless, a hub region of posterior part of rat DMN was retrosplenial cortex and that of anterior part was medial prefrontal cortex in fMRI study, which corresponded to PET-derived IC5 and IC1, respectively."

Our results of increased energy efficiency in retrosplenial and medial prefrontal cortex imply long-distance connectivity maturation coincide with the redistribution of energy consumption. High-energy efficiency in hubs was previously reported in adult human brain (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tomasi et al., 2013</a>), which was recapitulated in our study in rats, and we also found that their high efficiency developed during brain maturation. Comprehensively, large-scale networks are formed during adolescent period accompanied by these networks\u2019 efficient energy consumption for long-distance connectivity. As deficits in these relationships are found in several brain disorders (<a href=\"#bib3\">Broyd et al., 2009</a>), metabolic network analyses might be used to find the relevant functional connectivity abnormalities. Specifically, the hub regions are well known as culprit components for several developmental and degenerative brain disorders (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fornito et al., 2015</a>). Our results could explain the underlying biological background of the vulnerability that hub regions might be easily influenced by developmental problems in reconfiguration of metabolic connectivity efficiency."

All preprocessed PET images (n = 88) were included in this spatial ICA to find spatially independent components and coherently activated regions among subjects. The group ICA approaches have been used to obtain multivariate patterns for metabolic networks (<a href=\"#bib37\">Toussaint et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yakushev et al., 2013</a>). Prior to perform ICA, the optimal number of components extracted from PET images was determined. We used the dimensional estimation algorithm implemented in GIFT software based on the assessment of entropy rate of independent and identically distributed (<i>i.i.d.</i>) Gaussian random process (<a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). The estimated optimal number was thirteen components. ICA was performed using an infomax neural network algorithm that minimized the mutual information of the outputs. The resulting independent components were z-transformed and visualized using the threshold z &gt; 1.5."

We selected these ICs to concentrate on the relationship between functional components including DMN as intrinsically coherent regions at resting state and sensory-motor networks. The total eight VOIs (3 on IC1, 1 on IC5, 2 on IC8 and IC9) were defined as spheres with a radius of 8 mm, centered at each IC (the actual size of a radius was 0.8 mm as voxels were scaled by a factor of 10). The size of VOI was determined considering initial voxel size (0.775 mm) and to a representative small cluster of a network not to overlap other networks. The VOIs were displayed in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. We compared the connectivity between rats aged 5, 10, and 15 weeks."

For statistical comparison of correlation matrices between these groups of different ages, we performed permutation tests. We tested whether there was significantly different connectivity, represented by Fisher-transformed Z values, between 5 vs\u00a010 weeks and 10 vs 15 weeks of age. At first, PET images of each age group were randomly permuted to make pseudo-random groups reassigned 10,000 times and from each paired group of rats, interregional correlation matrices were calculated. Type I errors were determined by the comparison between the observed Z score for each connection of VOI pairs and Z score distribution of VOI pairs from the permuted data (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Metabolic connectivity mapping (Cometomics) is a very new technique, and no firm standards have been established so far. The applied methodology as well as animal number is appropriate. The results, based on ICA and graph based analysis are reasonable. The Discussion is also reasonable and covers many different aspects, albeit it could be more detailed especially regarding the possible origins of metabolic connectivity. In conclusion, this article is a valuable contribution to the field of brain connectivity mapping, especially since it uses metabolic information."

Some previous studies tried to extract DMN using fMRI in a rodent brain, which extracted midline structures including medial frontal, cingulate, retrosplenial cortex and parts of hippocampus. Sireakowiak et al. (Plos One, 2015) used a seed placed on cingulate to extract DMN which naturally include cingulate cortex. Rat DMN derived from fMRI using ICA (Lu et al., PNAS, 2012) extracted quite similar structures. The ICA derived result revealed that hub regions were retrosplenial cortex (for posterior DMN) and medial prefrontal cortex (for anterior DMN), which corresponded to our ICs. Because of the results of DMN hubs in rats, task-related network patterns have been studied using these two regions (for example, Jennifer Li, et al., J Neurosci., 2015), retrosplenial and medial frontal cortices regarded as cores of DMN. The previous reports implied that these two hub regions in the rodent brain could functionally correspond to hubs of DMN in human brain, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and anterior medial frontal cortex. Therefore, in our study, ICs which include these two anatomical regions were considered for further analysis."
