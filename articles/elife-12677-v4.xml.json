However, our understanding of how to select single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that mediate efficient Cas9 activity is incomplete, as we lack insight into how chromatin impacts Cas9 targeting. To address this gap, we analyzed large-scale genetic screens performed in human cell lines using either nuclease-active or nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9). We observed that highly active sgRNAs for Cas9 and dCas9 were found almost exclusively in regions of low nucleosome occupancy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that nucleosomes in fact directly impede Cas9 binding and cleavage, while chromatin remodeling can restore Cas9 access. Our results reveal a critical role of eukaryotic chromatin in dictating the targeting specificity of this transplanted bacterial enzyme, and provide rules for selecting Cas9 target sites distinct from and complementary to those based on sequence properties."

However, our understanding of how to select single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that mediate efficient Cas9 activity is incomplete, as we lack insight into how chromatin impacts Cas9 targeting. To address this gap, we analyzed large-scale genetic screens performed in human cell lines using either nuclease-active or nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9). We observed that highly active sgRNAs for Cas9 and dCas9 were found almost exclusively in regions of low nucleosome occupancy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that nucleosomes in fact directly impede Cas9 binding and cleavage, while chromatin remodeling can restore Cas9 access. Our results reveal a critical role of eukaryotic chromatin in dictating the targeting specificity of this transplanted bacterial enzyme, and provide rules for selecting Cas9 target sites distinct from and complementary to those based on sequence properties."

These findings suggest one way that CRISPR can manipulate much of the human genome despite the widespread presence of nucleosomes. Future work will now aim to develop computational methods that take the positions of nucleosomes into account when picking DNA sites to target with CRISPR."

Most notably, the CRISPR-associated Cas9 protein from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, together with a single chimeric guide RNA (sgRNA), provides a programmable endonuclease that has revolutionized our ability to edit genomes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</a>). Cas9 has been further modified to a nuclease-dead form (dCas9) to provide a programmable DNA-binding protein that can be fused to effector domains, making it possible to turn on or off targeted genes, mark specific genomic loci with fluorescent proteins, or alter epigenetic marks (<a href=\"#bib11\">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Qi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gilbert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Maeder et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hilton et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kearns et al., 2015</a>). A central challenge in implementing these tools is identifying effective and specific sgRNAs. While much of the effort to define relevant rules has focused on the sequence of the target site and sgRNA (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chari et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doench et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2015</a>), these only partially predict Cas9 activity and suggest that additional determinants likely exist."

We found that regions of high nucleosome occupancy in vivo, as determined by MNase-seq (micrococcal nuclease sequencing) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Johnson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Valouev et al., 2011</a>), were strongly depleted of highly active sgRNAs for CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gilbert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">2014</a>) and nuclease-active Cas9. We complemented these results with in vitro experiments demonstrating that formation of a nucleosome provides a direct and profound block to dCas9 binding and Cas9 cleavage. Despite this strong barrier to Cas9 activity, we found that addition of a chromatin remodeling enzyme to chromatinized DNA in vitro can restore Cas9 access to nucleosomal DNA, highlighting one route by which CRISPR may still be able to modify chromatin in vivo. Our results reveal a fundamental aspect of the mechanism by which this transplanted bacterial enzyme interacts with eukaryotic chromatin, and provide a new dimension for selecting highly active sgRNAs."

We selected 30 screens performed in the cell line K562 expressing dCas9-KRAB (ML, BA, BB, CYP, MK, YC, JF, and JN, personal communication) and set a threshold for high-confidence hit genes, which allowed us to assess the relative strength of phenotypes for the sgRNAs targeting these genes. Specifically, we analyzed 18,380 sgRNAs targeting 1539 genes, and generated 'activity scores' by normalizing sgRNA phenotypes to the average of the 3 sgRNAs with the strongest phenotypes for each gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). To assess how CRISPRi activity varies with respect to the transcription start site (TSS), we plotted the average sgRNA activity score as a function of distance to the FANTOM-annotated TSS (<a href=\"#bib15\">Forrest et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This analysis revealed a robust, periodic pattern of activity, with peaks at ~190\u00a0bp intervals relative to the TSS.

Indeed, analysis of K562 MNase-seq data from the ENCODE consortium (<a href=\"#bib51\">Valouev et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</a>) revealed that the average nucleosome signal was strongly anti-correlated with CRISPRi activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting that high nucleosome occupancy leads to low CRISPRi activity."

Consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosomes exclude dCas9, almost all of the highly active sgRNAs targeted sites with low MNase-seq signal. However, not all sgRNAs targeting sites with low nucleosome occupancy were highly active, matching previous findings that sgRNA and target DNA sequence features also influence efficiency of the CRISPR system (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chari et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doench et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). To exclude the possibility that differences in sequence features alone between nucleosome-bound and -free regions could explain the periodicity of CRISPRi activity (rather than the presence of nucleosomes per se), we performed linear regression using MNase signal, sgRNA length (<a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gilbert et al., 2014</a>), and a validated sgRNA sequence scoring algorithm (<a href=\"#bib10\">Doench et al., 2014</a>). We found that each parameter individually correlated with sgRNA activity (p&lt;10<sup>-58</sup> for each; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Importantly, correction for sequence and length features had minimal impact on the ability of the MNase signal to predict CRISPRi activity (p&lt;10<sup>-85\u00a0</sup>after correction). Indeed, a linear fit of all three features provided a still stronger correlation (p&lt;10<sup>-221</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, far right column), suggesting that incorporating nucleosome occupancy in future sgRNA design algorithms could significantly improve predictive value. We have recently developed a comprehensive algorithm for predicting highly active CRISPRi sgRNAs that, by accounting for nucleosome occupancy, higher order sequence features, and non-linear relationships in these parameters, shows even greater correlation with this dataset that was already enriched for active sgRNAs using our original CRISPRi library design principles (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gilbert et al., 2014</a>) (cross-validation R<sup>2</sup>=0.32; Horlbeck et al., manuscript in preparation)."

Analysis of CDS-targeting sgRNAs revealed that strong phenotypes were found predominantly in regions of low MNase-seq signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), although this relationship was less pronounced than for CRISPRi. This may be due to decreased phasing of nucleosomes within the gene body (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</a>). When we analyzed all sgRNAs in the library, thus incorporating information from <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions where nucleosomes are well phased, we found the effect of nucleosome position to be even stronger (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although nucleosome occupancy was predictive of CRISPR activity independent of sgRNA sequence features, a much stronger correlation was obtained when all features were considered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Mouse histones were recombinantly expressed, purified, and assembled into a nucleosome using 147bp of the Widom 601 positioning sequence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lowary and Widom, 1998</a>). Conveniently, the 601 sequence contains numerous NGG protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) required for Cas9 recognition, spanning the full length of the DNA at different helical positions, allowing us to test the effects of position and solvent accesibility within the nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We first tested the ability of Cas9 to cleave nucleosomal DNA. We pre-loaded purified Cas9\u00a0(histidine tagged and HaloTagged) with in vitro transcribed sgRNA, then introduced either naked 601 DNA or that same DNA assembled into a nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Fluorescent labeling of the DNA allowed us to visualize the cleavage products on a denaturing Urea-PAGE gel. In agreement with our in vivo data, the nucleosome protected its DNA from cleavage by Cas9, and complete protection from cleavage was observed to be independent of target position within the nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). While our manuscript was under review, a study by Hinz and colleagues reported a similar in vitro\u00a0finding that Cas9 nuclease activity is inhibited within the nucleosome but not at adjacent linker sequences\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Hinz et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0previous single-molecule and biochemical studies have established that nucleosomal DNA undergoes transient unwrapping or breathing at the entry and exit sites, creating a gradient of accessibility along the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Widom, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Luger and Hansen, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Choy and Lee, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tomschik et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Polach and Widom, 1995</a>). This property is often credited for the observed position-dependent binding patterns of many transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, our data suggests that the cleavage activity of Cas9 in vitro is not detectably influenced by this effect, although less stable nucleosomes than the Widom 601 nucleosome or target sites closer to the nucleosome edge may exhibit more breathing and thus more accessibility than those tested here."

While our in vitro data show that full pairing and cleavage is prevented by the presence of a nucleosome, we wondered if binding without cleavage, especially at the more accessible ends of the nucleosome, might still occur. Additionally, the first step in binding, PAM recognition, may be governed by helical location within the nucleosome as well as its proximity to the more dynamic ends. Histones make contacts with the DNA at every helical turn, thus a PAM may fall on the outside of the nucleosome, exposing it to solvent, or on the inside at the DNA-histone interface. To test the influence of target location within the nucleosome on Cas9 binding, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to monitor binding of dCas9 to Cy3 end-labeled 601 DNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A,B</a>), either free or assembled into a nucleosome containing Alexa Fluor 647-labeled histone H2B (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

We superimposed the target DNA in the Cas9 crystal structure with the DNA in the nucleosome structure at a site where the two DNA paths gave the best fit. The resulting combined structure reveals that the Cas9 protein poses significant steric clashes with the histones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Given the extent of overlapping densities in the two structures, it seems unlikely that the histones and Cas9 could co-occupy the same piece of DNA. Additionally, it may be important to note that unlike other DNA binders such as transcription factors, binding by Cas9 constitutes melting of target DNA, which may pose an additional barrier to binding on a nucleosome. This hypothesis leaves two possible outcomes of targeting Cas9 to nucleosomal DNA: either Cas9 is capable of displacing histones in order\u00a0to engage nucleosomal DNA, or it is excluded altogether. Our data support the latter conclusion."

In order to model how these dynamics affect Cas9 access\u00a0to nucleosomal\u00a0DNA in vitro, we turned to a chromatinized plasmid system. We dialyzed plasmid DNA containing a single 601 nucleosome positioning sequence with a sub-saturating quantity of purified histone octamers, and confirmed the quality of the resulting chromatin assemblies by MNase digestion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A,B</a>). We tested whether a nucleosome was positioned at the 601 sequence using restriction enzyme accessibility mapping, and found that sites within the 601 sequence were protected from digestion while sites immediately adjacent were not, suggesting precise positioning of a high occupancy nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To recapitulate the effects of chromatin remodeling in vitro, we used a purified, truncated form of the Snf2-like chromatin remodeling enzyme Chd1 from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (yChd1), which had previously been shown to mediate nucleosome sliding in an ATP-dependent manner without additional co-factors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Patel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">2013</a>). To confirm yChd1 activity on our chromatinized plasmid, we used the frequent cutter, HaeIII, to digest the chromatin in the presence or absence of the remodeler. Upon addition of yChd1, we observed a shift toward lower molecular weight bands, indicative of dimished protection at HaeIII sites while still maintaining an\u00a0overall chromatinized state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Before addition of the remodeler to our chromatinized plasmid, we found that sites within the 601 nucleosome were strongly protected from cleavage by Cas9, consistent with our mononucleosome results (Figure 5E-G, PAM sites without remodeler). However, when the 601 nucleosome was remodeled by yChd1, as indicated by a loss of protection from restriction enzyme cleavage (approaching protection levels similar to those in the linker region), Cas9 cleavage efficiency was restored to around 80% of the corresponding naked plasmid control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5E\u2013G</a>). Notably, the percent protection at the EcoRI site adjacent to the positioned nucleosome did not decrease upon addition of yChd1, demonstrating that the decrease in protection along the 601 sequence was mediated by the nucleosome displacement activity of yChd1 rather than by a non-specific effect on cleavage efficiency. While our data with the chromatinized plasmid system confirm our findings that a well-positioned nucleosome provides a profound block to Cas9 cleavage, our further finding that chromatin remodeling restores access to nucleosomal DNA provides one potential mechanism by which Cas9 may efficiently modify broad portions of eukaryotic genomes. This plasmid model could be further exploited to assay the activity of Cas9 at nucleosome-free and boundary sites, and thus derive biophysical parameters governing Cas9-chromatin interactions."

Here, we show that the nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin, poses a strong barrier to Cas9, both in vitro and in vivo. By masking ~147\u00a0bp of DNA, the nucleosome effectively reduces the size of the eukaryotic genome available to Cas9. Previous studies using ChIP-seq to assay Cas9 binding have shown that off-target binding at PAM plus seed sequences more frequently occurs in regions of open chromatin (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">O'Geen et al., 2015</a>). Our data expand upon these findings to show that the discrete pattern of nucleosome organization is able to modulate the efficiency of Cas9 binding and cleavage at on-target sites. The practical implications of these observations are underscored by our finding that accounting for nucleosome occupancy offers a significant improvement in predictive power for sgRNA design."

Transient displacement of nucleosomes occurs during replication, remodeling, and transcription. By adding the chromatin remodeling enzyme yChd1 to nucleosomes in vitro, we demonstrate that this displacement can in fact restore Cas9 access to DNA. However, despite brief exposure of nucleosomal DNA during remodeling and various other cellular processes, we still observe a clear anti-correlation between Cas9 activity and nucleosome occupancy in vivo, suggesting that the barrier to Cas9 target recognition exists even in a cellular environment. Indeed, the balance between nucleosome disruption, turnover, and repositioning in the cell leads to the average level of occupancy and positioning at each site observed by MNase-seq (<a href=\"#bib51\">Valouev et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</a>).

Knock-down of transcription by CRISPRi likely requires persistent binding by dCas9 to continually block transcription, and would be largely ineffective during S-phase when transcription is globally shut down. In contrast, to make a genomic edit, Cas9 must succeed in cleaving DNA only once, and could potentially take advantage of nucleosome turnover during replication. The role these differences play in the dependence of Cas9 on nucleosome position is still not clear. We expect, however, that nucleosome position and occupancy will be of particular concern to applications that use the nuclease-dead Cas9 and require sustained binding. Future investigations into the role of cell cycle and nucleosome disruption may provide an additional piece to our understanding of the mechanism of Cas9 in eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, nucleosome organization represents only one aspect of eukaryotic chromatin, and thus, our results contribute a first step in understanding and exploiting how chromatin affects Cas9 activity to enable more sophisticated and precise rules for targeting Cas9."

The resulting cell line tested negative for mycoplasma (MycoAlert Kit, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in regular screenings, and cytogenetic profiling by array comparative genomic hybridization (not shown) closely matched previous characterizations of the K562 cell line (<a href=\"#bib37\">Naumann et al., 2001</a>). Data from 30 published (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gilbert et al., 2014</a>) and unpublished screens (ML, BA, BB, CYP, MK, YC, JF, and JN, personal communication), conducted using the CRISPRi sgRNA library described in <a href=\"#bib16\">Gilbert et al., (2014)</a> in K562 cells constitutively expressing dCas9-KRAB-BFP, were processed through a standardized pipeline adapted from <a href=\"#bib3\">Bassik et al. (2013)</a>, and <a href=\"#bib25\">Kampmann et al. (2013)</a>. Briefly, sgRNA phenotypes were calculated as the log<sub>2</sub> enrichment of sequencing read counts between two conditions (e.g. initial and final timepoints for growth screens, untreated and treated for drug/toxin screens) and normalized to cell doubling differences where appropriate. Most screens were conducted in duplicate, and sgRNA phenotypes from the duplicates were averaged. To determine hit genes, each gene was given an effect size (average of strongest 3 sgRNA phenotypes by absolute value) and a confidence value (Mann-Whitney p-value of all ~10 sgRNAs compared to negative controls), and hits were selected using a score that integrates effect size and statistical confidence (| effect Z score * log<sub>10</sub> p-value | \u2267 20 in any screen). For genes with multiple TSS, each TSS was analyzed separately and the gene was assigned the highest score. Finally, sgRNA phenotypes were extracted for hit genes from the screen in which the gene scored as a hit and normalized to the average of the strongest 3 phenotypes to generate the 'sgRNA activity score'."

All local averages were calculated in 50\u00a0bp windows centered around the indicated point. As sgRNA lengths including the PAM were ~24\u00a0bp and position was calculated relative to PAM, a window size of 50\u00a0bp captures all sgRNAs that directly neighbor the center point at either the 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 end. In order to quantify amplitude, the local averages were first smoothed using a low-pass Butterworth filter (N = 4, Wn = 0.03; SciPy signal processing module) and then peaks and troughs were calculated by determining the local maxima and minima, respectively. As described for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, Peak 0 was defined as the local maximum closest to the TSS, peak 1 was defined as the next maximum downstream of peak 0, and troughs were defined as the minima immediately downstream of the respective peaks."

To create this template, two oligos, one containing the T7 promoter and DNA target sequence, and the other encoding the invariable scaffolding of the sgRNA, were annealed and filled in using a single PCR cycle. The DNA template was ethanol precipitated, then transcribed using the T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to vendor instructions. The resulting sgRNAs were purified via 6% Urea-PAGE gel. The correct band was cut out and crushed and soaked in 0.3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. After ethanol precipitation, and resuspension in RNase-free water, aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. SgRNAs targeting the 601 sequence included 20\u00a0bp of complimentarity 5\u2019 to the targeted PAM, with the exception of PAM 4, which has room for only 19\u00a0bp of complimentarity. SgRNAs were used against PAMs 1, 3\u201315, and 17\u201320. PAM 2 did not have a long enough target sequence available within the 601.

First, the complete ribonucleoprotein complex was formed by incubating five-fold molar excess of the chosen sgRNA with (d/wt)Cas9 at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. Next, the DNA substrate (either naked DNA or nucleosome) was added to 40 nM (five-fold less than Cas9), and the reactions were returned to 37\u00ba for an hour. Reaction buffer contained 20\u2009mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1\u2009mM EDTA, and 2.5 mg/mL insulin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Importantly, we found that including a nonspecific protein such as insulin prevents the nucleosomes from falling apart and getting lost to surfaces during binding and cleavage assays (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Additionally, inclusion of insulin reduces nonspecific protein-protein interactions and aggregation. Binding reactions also contained 14.6% sucrose to allow direct loading onto a native gel. At 1\u2009hr, binding reactions were loaded onto a pre-run 6% native TBE-PAGE gel at 4\u00b0C, while cleavage reactions were stopped using a 5X stop buffer (250\u2009mM EDTA, 2% SDS), and prepared to load onto a 10% Urea-PAGE gel by adding 2X loading buffer (95% formamide, 20% DMSO, 5\u2009mM EDTA, 0.025% Orange G) and heating to 95\u00b0C for 5 min before snap cooling on ice. Binding and cleavage reactions were repeated at least twice each for most of the PAMs targeted. Gels were imaged using a PharosFX Plus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and quantified using Image Lab (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For binding and cleavage reactions, gels were scanned in the Cy3 fluorescence channel, while Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescence was also imaged for binding reactions. For cleavage reactions, labeling of either the Watson or Crick strand was chosen such that the fluorophore was always attached to the strand complimentary to the sgRNA used."

Given the widespread usage of Cas9 and catalytically inactive dCas9 proteins to modulate metazoan gene expression, it is very important to understand how histone occupancy impinges on targeting of the Cas9 module. Previous studies have suggested that nucleosomes may block accessibility of sgRNAs and Cas9, but these involved limited numbers of sgRNAs and resulted in only in the generalization that Cas9 seems to best target regions that are, for example, DNaseI accessible."

The authors show unequivocally that the organization of DNA in a nucleosome impedes access of Cas9, irrespective of the orientation of the PAMs. The in vitro experiments are technically sound and support the conclusions. Additional strengths of this work include: 1) the very nice anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and sgRNA activity shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B</a>; 2) <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, where increased nucleosome phasing is shown to increase the positional dependence on activity of sgRNAs."

While identifying the precise boundary between protected and accessible DNA is an interesting question, we feel this is outside the scope of this project, and will depend strongly on the sequence and environment of the nucleosome in question. In addition, the in vivo measurement of nucleosome position through MNase-seq captures the average nucleosome occupancy at a given site rather than reporting on fixed mononucleosomes, and this average occupancy is likely to explain our observation of differential Cas9 accessibility in vivo. We have revised the Discussion to clarify this point (second paragraph)."

The naked DNA experiments provide some control for this concern as they show that indeed, Cas9 is working as anticipated, as it, controls for the sequence dependence of Cas9 cleavage. However, we believe that our new data provides a more complete control to address the reviewers\u2019 concern. We show that in the context of a chromatinized plasmid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), we observe near-absolute protection of DNA along the 601 sequence, fully consistent with our previous in vitro results using a minimal mono-nucleosome. To modulate the accessibility of the DNA within the 601 nucleosome, we introduce a remodeler, yChd1. We observe that chromatin remodeling restores the accessibility of DNA to Cas9 at the same underlying sequences previously observed to be fully protected from cleavage. This result shows that the observed protection is due to nucleosome positioning and not another aspect of the experimental set-up (e.g., the buffer conditions)."

Again, this result is super-imposed on our v1 library design rules; application of the scoring model to our ricin gene tiling dataset, which was not subjected to the v1 rules, achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.91. This approach differs from the linear regression shown here by accounting for non-linear relationships (e.g. MNase values as displayed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> are not strictly linear) and by incorporating several other features (e.g. higher order sequence features, sgRNA secondary structure).
