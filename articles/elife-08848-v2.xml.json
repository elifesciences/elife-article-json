Yet the identity and function of these maternal factors during the gamete to embryo transition remains poorly understood. In <i>C. elegans</i>, LSD1/KDM1A enables this transition by removing H3K4me2 and preventing the transgenerational inheritance of transcription patterns. Here we show that loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A in mice results in embryonic arrest at the 1-2 cell stage, with arrested embryos failing to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition. This suggests that LSD1/KDM1A maternal reprogramming is conserved. Moreover, partial loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A results in striking phenotypes weeks after fertilization; including perinatal lethality and abnormal behavior in surviving adults. These maternal effect hypomorphic phenotypes are associated with alterations in DNA methylation and expression at imprinted genes. These results establish a novel mammalian paradigm where defects in early epigenetic reprogramming can lead to defects that manifest later in development."

Yet the identity and function of these maternal factors during the gamete to embryo transition remains poorly understood. In <i>C. elegans</i>, LSD1/KDM1A enables this transition by removing H3K4me2 and preventing the transgenerational inheritance of transcription patterns. Here we show that loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A in mice results in embryonic arrest at the 1-2 cell stage, with arrested embryos failing to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition. This suggests that LSD1/KDM1A maternal reprogramming is conserved. Moreover, partial loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A results in striking phenotypes weeks after fertilization; including perinatal lethality and abnormal behavior in surviving adults. These maternal effect hypomorphic phenotypes are associated with alterations in DNA methylation and expression at imprinted genes. These results establish a novel mammalian paradigm where defects in early epigenetic reprogramming can lead to defects that manifest later in development."

The H3K4me2 demethylase KDM1A is maternally deposited into the zygote at fertilization and required to prevent H3K4me2 from being inherited transgenerationally. Without KDM1A, H3K4me2 accumulates at gamete genes across generations and results in the inappropriate expression of these genes.

Alternatively, when associated with the Androgen Receptor complex KDM1A has been shown to demethylate H3K9me2 in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Metzger et al., 2005</a>). KDM1A is an essential gene in mammalian development, as homozygous mutants fail to develop properly after implantation and die prior to embryonic day 8 (e8) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Foster et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Macfarlan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2007</a>).

Deletion of <i>Kdm1a</i> maternally with either <i>Zp3-Cre</i> or <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> results in embryonic lethality primarily at the 1-2C stage and these embryos fail to undergo the MZT. This suggests that KDM1A plays a conserved role in maternal reprogramming. Surprisingly, deletion of <i>Kdm1a</i> maternally with <i>Vasa-Cre</i> results in an incomplete loss of KDM1A in oocytes. This uncovers a hypomorphic effect in which some surviving animals exhibit long-range developmental defects, including perinatal lethality and behavioral abnormalities. These defects are associated with disruption of the epigenetic landscape, including aberrant DNA methylation and expression at imprinted loci. These results demonstrate that defects in epigenetic reprogramming between generations can lead to abnormalities later in development."

RNA-seq datasets from ovulated oocytes and 2C-stage embryos suggested abundant KDM1A transcripts in these cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Macfarlan et al., 2012</a>). Immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an antibody raised against KDM1A confirms that KDM1A is expressed in the oocyte nucleus and in the surrounding follicle cells throughout oocyte development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013L</a>). Therefore, to determine if KDM1A functions in oocytes, we conditionally deleted <i>Kdm1a</i> by crossing <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2007</a>) to three different maternal <i>Cre</i> transgenic lines, <i>Ddx4/Vasa-Cre</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gallardo et al., 2007</a>), <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lan et al., 2004</a>) and <i>Zp3-Cre</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Vries et al., 2000</a>) (oocytes and embryos from <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/</sup></i><sup>\u0394</sup><i>::Ddx4/Vasa<sup>Cre</sup>, Kdm1a<sup>fl/</sup></i><sup>\u0394</sup><i>::Gdf9-Cre,</i> and <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/</sup></i><sup>\u0394</sup><i>::Zp3-Cre</i> mice will be referred to hereafter as <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup>, Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> and <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> respectively). <i>Vasa-Cre\u00a0</i>is expressed in the germline beginning at e18 and induces full deletion by birth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gallardo et al., 2007</a>). <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> is expressed in oocytes beginning at postnatal day 3 (P3), including in primordial follicles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lan et al., 2004</a>), while <i>Zp3-Cre</i> is also expressed in oocytes, but beginning at P5 in primary follicles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Vries et al., 2000</a>). KDM1A IHC and IF demonstrate that deletion of <i>Kdm1a</i> with either <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> or <i>Zp3-Cre</i> results in the complete loss of KDM1A from the oocyte nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013F,I</a>). Crossing the <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> allele to <i>Vasa-Cre</i> also results in complete maternal deletion, as can be determined by the 100% segregation of the maternally deleted allele to the offspring (all of offspring from <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></i> mothers crossed to wild-type fathers result in heterozygous -/+ offspring) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This demonstrates that, similar to deletion via <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> or <i>Zp3-Cre,</i> crossing the <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>allele to <i>Vasa-Cre</i> also effectively deletes <i>Kdm1a</i> maternally. However, for reasons that are not clear, deletion of <i>Kdm1a</i> with <i>Vasa-Cre</i> results in a hypomorphic effect, where 33.3% of oocytes completely lack KDM1A protein, but 66.7% retain a low level of KDM1A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>). This incomplete effect is surprising because the <i>Vasa-Cre</i> transgene is reported to be expressed earlier in the germline than either <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> or <i>Zp3-Cre</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gallardo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lan et al., 2004</a>). It is possible that the low level of KDM1A remaining in some oocytes is due to delayed deletion of <i>Kdm1a</i>, though the reason for this potential delay is unknown."

                                "text": "To determine if there is a functional requirement for maternal KDM1A in mice, we crossed <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup>, Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> and <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> females to wild-type males to generate heterozygous offspring (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In mice, zygotic transcription begins in the 1C embryo just prior to the first cleavage to the 2C stage (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aoki et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hamatani et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Xue et al., 2013</a>). The heterozygous offspring from the maternally deleted mothers have a normal <i>Kdm1a</i> gene on the paternal allele. Thus, crossing maternally deleted mothers to wild-type fathers enables us to isolate the maternal function of KDM1A (Maternal-, Zygotic+, hereafter referred to as M-Z+). M-Z+ heterozygous embryos derived from <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> mutant mothers are hereafter referred to as <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos, while M+Z+ heterozygous embryos derived from littermate control mothers that are <i>Cre</i> minus are hereafter referred to as <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M+Z+ embryos. <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos exhibit embryonic arrest at the 1-2C stage (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013I</a>). Specifically, in control <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M+Z+ embryos at embryonic day 1.5 (e1.5), we observe 7% fragmented/degraded embryos, 65% 1-cell embryos and 28% 2-cell embryos (n=135, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). In contrast, in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos at e1.5 we observe 40% fragmented/degraded embryos, 59% unfertilized oocytes or 1-cell embryos, and only 1% 2C embryos (n=134, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). The vast majority of the non-degraded <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos are clearly fertilized and arrested at the 1C stage. However, we do occasionally observe unfertilized oocytes. In addition, we sometimes observe embryos that are highly abnormal morphologically and are difficult to clearly assign to a particular category. As a result, we quantified these <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos together. Nevertheless, compared to <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M+Z+ embryos, <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos have a large increase in the number of fragmented/degraded embryos at the expense of normal 2C embryos (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). Also, the remaining 1C and 2C <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos do not progress beyond the 1-2C stage, as we never observe any later stage embryos even at e2.5 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,G,H</a>)."

At e1.5, 95% (n=20) of control <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M+Z+ embryos have reached the 2C stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast, at e1.5 only 35% (n=57) of <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos reach the 2C stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), though this is still much higher than the 1% of <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos that reach the 2C stage (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). It is not clear why there is a difference in the number of <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> versus <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos that cleave to the 2C stage. However, this may be due to subtle differences in developmental timing, strain background, or <i>Cre</i> specific differences. In addition, we have observed two <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos that develop past the 2C stage to the 3C- and 4C- stage (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J,K</a>), though like the <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos, no <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos survive to the blastocyst stage (data not shown). Taken together, the results from <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></i> and <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> mice suggest that the embryonic arrest, primarily at the 1-2C stages is the KDM1A maternal loss-of-function phenotype."

To determine if KDM1A affects transcription in the oocyte, we first compared the transcriptome of control <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>(<a href=\"#bib25\">Macfarlan et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0versus <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> mutant oocytes. We found relatively few transcriptional changes, with 195 genes over expressed and 281 genes under expressed in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> oocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In addition, amongst the 875 repeat types extracted from the RepeatMasker database (including LINEs, SINEs, etc.) there were only 2 repeat families that were activated and 2 repressed in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> oocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Manual inspection revealed that few of these genes/repeats had both large fold-changes and low p-values, with the exception of the Mt1 gene, which was very highly activated in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> oocytes. Furthermore, we found several mitochondrially encoded genes (like mtCo3 and Atpase6) that had small but significantly reduced levels in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> oocytes. These mitochondrial genes are unlikely to be directly regulated by KDM1A, but their reduced levels could indicate a subtle metabolic defect in the mutants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of KDM1A has little effect on transcription in oocytes."

To determine if this is the case, we\u00a0isolated fertilized <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ embryos that cleaved to the 2C stage, and compared them to <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl\u00a0</sup></i>M+Z+ 2C embryos (<a href=\"#bib25\">Macfarlan et al., 2012</a>). We chose to focus on embryos from <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> mothers because a substantially higher proportion of these embryos reach the 2C stage. We found a dramatic alteration of the transcriptome, with 1527 genes over expressed and 2794 genes under expressed in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ 2C embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>).

These findings are in contrast to what has been observed in <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant ES cells that display a general de-repression of both genes and repeats (<a href=\"#bib24\">Macfarlan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Macfarlan et al., 2012</a>). GO analysis of over and under expressed genes in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> 2C M-Z+ embryos demonstrated an enrichment of genes normally expressed in unfertilized oocytes, and a reduction in genes associated with embryonic development and tissue specific gene expression. This suggests that <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ 2C embryos may fail to undergo the MZT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>)."

If the <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ 2C embryos fail to undergo the MZT, then we would expect them to be more similar to <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> oocytes than <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>M+Z+ 2C embryos. In <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>M+Z+ 2C embryos relative to <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>oocytes, there are massive changes in the mRNA profile, with &gt;3,000 genes (and 387 repeat families) becoming zygotically activated and ~3000 maternal genes (and 17 repeat families) which are suppressed. This demonstrates that MZT has occurred (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1C</a>). In contrast, <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ 2C embryos fail to properly activate the zygotic genome, with only 666 genes becoming activated (and 110 repeat families), and only ~1200 maternal genes repressed (13 repeat families) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1D</a>). Hierarchical clustering of <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> oocytes, <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> oocytes, <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>M+Z+ 2C embryos and <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ 2C embryos confirms this failure to activate the zygotic genome.

GO analysis demonstrated that PC1 genes fall into two categories, those associated with unfertilized oocytes and are highly expressed in oocytes and <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> M-Z+ 2C embryos, and those associated with early embryonic development which are enriched only in <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>M+Z+ 2C embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>).

This is reflected in the large number of mouse models that exhibit perinatal lethality (<a href=\"#bib42\">Turgeon and Meloche, 2009</a>). Therefore, to determine if lower maternal KDM1A might give rise to more subtle embryonic defects, we carefully monitored the first 48\u2009hr following birth in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ progeny. Consistent with this being a major developmental transition, even in genotypically normal mice, we observe that 5% of offspring (n=216) born from littermate <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>control mothers die perinatally during the first 48\u2009hr after birth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>).

Notably, because of the embryonic arrest and the perinatal lethality, this remaining 2/3 is a very small number of animals (n=10 from 8 crosses). Since progeny from <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>mutant mothers have defects that can lead to perinatal lethality, we considered the possibility that the surviving animals from these <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>mutant mothers (hereafter referred to as <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ adults) could have phenotypic defects as well. To analyze these surviving animals, we crossed <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>mutant mothers (C57BL/6 background) to <i>M. castaneus</i> (CAST) fathers. This enabled us to use polymorphisms to examine subsequent molecular defects in a parent of origin specific fashion.

However, when we observed these <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ adults closely, we noticed that they exhibit abnormal behaviors (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These abnormal behaviors include excessive scratching and digging, along with food harassing, where animals grind up all of the remaining food in the food hopper and incorporate it into the bedding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). To quantify the food harassing behavior, we monitored both the weight of the food in the food hopper and the height of the bedding in the cage. Over a 3-day period, each individual <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ adult almost completely depleted the food in the food hopper due to food grinding and harassing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). This resulted in a correspondingly large increase in the height of the bedding over a 6-day period (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These effects are not observed in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>mutant mothers or the <i>M. castaneus</i> animals to which they were mated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,E</a>), indicating that the behavior may be due to a maternal effect. To determine if this behavior is due to a maternal effect, we intercrossed the affected <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ adults. If the food-grinding behavior is due to a maternal effect, then mating two affected <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ adults should not produce progeny with abnormal behavior. This is because the <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ adults used as mothers in these crosses have a normal <i>Kdm1a</i> allele (-/+) so the resulting intercrossed progeny (hereafter referred to as F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults) are all M+. Intercrossing affected M-Z+ F1 hybrids produced no F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults with the food-grinding behavior, suggesting that the food-grinding behavior is dependent upon a maternal effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,G</a>). Nevertheless, it remains possible that the F1 hybrid background also contributes to the abnormal behavior. To test this possibility, we crossed control littermates of <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>mothers to CAST fathers to generate control B6/CAST hybrids (hereafter referred to as B6/CAST M+Z+ controls). These control hybrids exhibit modest food-grinding behavior, suggesting that the hybrid strain background likely also contributes to the maternal food-grinding defect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,F</a>). However, <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ adults are significantly more affected than B6/CAST M+Z+ hybrid controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,F</a>), suggesting that the abnormal food-grinding behavior is predominantly due to a maternal effect. Importantly, we also do not observe any <i>Kdm1a</i> haploinsufficiency defects. For example, the F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults that are heterozygous for <i>Kdm1a</i> do not exhibit this abnormal behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,G</a>). This suggests that the abnormal behavior is not due to <i>Kdm1a</i> haploinsufficiency. Finally, behavioral defects were observed in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ survivors obtained from litters ranging from one to four animals. This suggests that the maternal behavioral abnormalities are not simply due to reduced litter size."

                                "text": "The perinatal lethality and behavioral defects observed in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ progeny are remarkable because these animals have a normal <i>Kdm1a</i> allele. Thus the defects that we observe in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ progeny must be due to a heritable effect originating from the low level of maternal KDM1A. As a result, we sought to determine the nature of this heritable defect. The <i>Kdm1a</i> homolog <i>Kdm1b</i> is expressed maternally in mice, and loss of <i>Kdm1b</i> results in a heritable embryonic lethality defect associated with a failure to maternally acquire DNA methylation at imprinted genes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ciccone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stewart et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the heritable defects could be due to DNA methylation defects at these loci, or in maternally methylated imprinted loci unaffected by the loss of KDM1B. In addition, in our RNA-seq data, we observe the misregulation of multiple genes that could potentially affect DNA methylation at imprinted loci. For example, four genes that are known to maternally affect DNA methylation at imprinted loci, <i>Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57</i> and <i>Dppa3/Stella</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dawlaty et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Messerschmidt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nakamura et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</a>), are all misregulated in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </i>M-Z+mutants (<i>Tet1:</i> -3.8\u00a0fold, <i>Trim28:</i> -3.3\u00a0fold, <i>Zfp57:</i> +3.2\u00a0fold and <i>Dppa3/Stella:</i> +.58 fold, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>, quantitative RT-PCR validation of <i>Trim28, Zfp57</i> and <i>Dppa3/Stella</i> in <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Additionally, the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 is overexpressed in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </i>M-Z+ mutants (<i>Dnmt1:</i> +2.1\u00a0fold, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>). DNMT1 is thought to primarily act as the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pradhan et al., 1999</a>), but when overexpressed, DNMT1 has been shown to have <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferase activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vertino et al., 1996</a>). Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that DNA methylation and monoallelic expression at imprinted genes could be altered in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>M-Z+ progeny, either directly or indirectly. Interestingly, despite the clear loss of KDM1A in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </i>mutant oocytes, the regulatory proteins that are affected by the loss of KDM1A are either not expressed in oocytes (Tet1) or not affected until after fertilization (<i>Trim28, Zfp57, Dppa3/Stella</i> and <i>Dnmt1,</i> <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 4</a>,<a href=\"#fig3s5\">5</a>). This is consistent with our previous observations that KDM1A primarily affects the MZT."

                        "text": "A major question in the field of epigenetics is whether histone methylation is regulated between generations, and whether potential defects in this process can lead to abnormalities in the resulting progeny. To address this question, we asked if the maternal reprogramming function of KDM1A, first demonstrated in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Katz et al., 2009</a>), is conserved in mammals. As in <i>C. elegans</i>, KDM1A is heavily deposited maternally in the mouse oocyte, suggesting that KDM1A could play a conserved role in maternal reprogramming (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). To address this hypothesis directly, we conditionally deleted <i>Kdm1a</i> maternally in mouse oocytes using three separate <i>Cre</i> drivers. Deletion of <i>Kdm1a</i> in developing oocytes via <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> or <i>Zp3-Cre</i> completely eliminates maternal KDM1A and results in embryonic arrest prior to the blastocyst stage, with the vast majority of embryos never developing past the 2C stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). This result is also observed when a second conditional <i>Kdm1a</i> allele (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>) is deleted with <i>Zp3-Cre</i> in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al.. Thus, maternal KDM1A is essential for the progression of mammalian embryogenesis."

                        "text": "The observed 1-2C embryonic arrest does not rule out an additional role for KDM1A in oocyte maturation, as we observe that a small fraction of KDM1A deficient oocytes are unfertilized, fertilized with multiple sperm, or display other gross morphological defects, including loss of the zona pellucida. These occasional defects are also observed in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. Consistent with this, Kim et al. have recently reported that deletion of a different conditional <i>Kdm1a</i> allele with <i>Zp3-Cre</i> results in defects in meiotic progression (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). However, in contrast to our results, Kim et al. find that most oocytes are affected and are not fertilized (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). It is not entirely clear why the phenotypes are slightly different, but it could reflect subtle differences in the timing of deletion due to the use of different floxed alleles, or differences in strain background. Nevertheless, in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup> </i>and <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> mutants, we find that the majority of oocytes are fertilized normally, and many embryos undergo cleavage to reach the 2C stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Also, in hypomorphic <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>animals we observe defects on the paternal allele of imprinted loci (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These results suggest a requirement for KDM1A post-fertilization in the zygote. In mammals, zygotic transcription initiates between the one and two cell stage (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aoki et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hamatani et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Xue et al., 2013</a>). As a result, the heterozygous offspring derived from our crosses likely begin to express KDM1A from paternal allele at the 2C stage. Taken together, these results pinpoint a requirement for maternal KDM1A reprogramming between fertilization and cleavage. Consistent with this conclusion, the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. demonstrates that chemically inhibiting KDM1A function post-fertilization also results in a 2C arrest. This further suggests a zygotic requirement for KDM1A immediately post-fertilization."

In contrast, when <i>Kdm1a</i> is deleted with <i>Zp3-Cre</i>, many embryos cleave to the 2C stage and we even observe rare embryos that reach the 3C and 4C stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This slight difference in phenotype is likely due to the fact that the <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> acts earlier than the <i>Zp3-Cre</i>. Nevertheless, the difference in phenotype suggests that KDM1A may act maternally at multiple discrete steps. This conclusion is reinforced by the recent demonstration that loss of KDM1A also impairs meiotic progression (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, the observation that many maternally deleted embryos undergo cleavage, suggests that KDM1A is not just required for cell-cycle progression or cell viability (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This conclusion is consistent with the observation that KDM1A null embryos survive until e8 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, the difference in phenotype between maternally deleted embryos and embryonically deleted embryos, which survive to e8, clearly delineates the maternal requirement for KDM1A from the embryonic requirement."

Compared to control 2C\u00a0embryos that have robustly activated the zygotic transcriptional program, <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </i>M-Z+ 2C embryos retain the expression of nearly 2 out of 3 oocyte genes, and fail to activate approximately 4 out of 5 zygotically activated embryonic genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This indicates that maternally deleted <i>Kdm1a</i> embryos fail to undergo the MZT. Consistent with this being the primary defect in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></i> mutants, we observe relatively few transcriptional changes in <i>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>oocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The requirement for KDM1A in facilitating the MZT is also demonstrated in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al., where it is shown that maternal KDM1A is necessary for the multiple waves of zygotic gene activation.

These include monitoring food disappearance and bedding height to measure excessive food grinding, the marble burying assay to measure excessive digging behavior, and the open-field test, to measure anxiety. In all of these assays, we observe a maternal effect on behavior due to hypomorphic maternal KDM1A from <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>mothers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

In particular, we observe a striking disruption in the allele-specific expression of both <i>Zac1</i> and <i>Impact</i>, along with decreased expression and altered DNA methylation at other imprinted loci (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This suggests that subtle defects in maternal KDM1A can alter the epigenetic landscape in a heritable fashion. Also, though KDM1A and KDM1B may have some functional overlap, the distinct imprinting defects observed in each mutant demonstrate that they have functions that are not redundant (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ciccone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stewart et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, both <i>Zac1</i> and <i>Impact</i> have been associated with nervous system defects, and loss of <i>Zac1</i> paternally results in perinatal lethality (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kosaki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pereira et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Roffe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schmidt-Edelkraut et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Varrault et al., 2006</a>).

Evidence for an indirect mechanism can be inferred from the misregulation of several genes (<i>Dnmt1, Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57,\u00a0Uhrf1 and Dppa/Stella)</i> that are known to regulate epigenetic information. For example, <i>Tet1/Tet2</i> double mutants exhibit a partial perinatal lethality phenotype that is reminiscent of what we observe in <i>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </i>progeny (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dawlaty et al., 2013</a>). Also, mice that are haploinsufficient for <i>Trim28</i> display abnormal exploratory behaviors (<a href=\"#bib47\">Whitelaw et al., 2010</a>). Alternatively, KDM1A may affect these phenomena by directly regulating histone methylation. For example, the removal of H3K4 methylation may be required to enable the activity of the DNMT3a/3b <i>de novo</i> methyltransferase complex (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ooi et al., 2007</a>). Such a model has been proposed to account for the imprinting defects that are observed when KDM1B is maternally deleted (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ciccone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stewart et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with this model, the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. demonstrates that loss of KDM1A maternally leads to global changes in both H3K4 and H3K9 methylation following fertilization. However, Stewart et al. recently demonstrated that loss of maternal KDM1A in mice does not affect H3K4me2, or the acquisition of DNA methylation at imprinted genes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stewart et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, the variable disruption of imprinting that we observe in hypomorphic animals is more consistent with a general disruption of epigenetic information. Thus, we favor a model in which the general disruption of epigenetic reprogramming, along with secondary epigenetic defects due to the misregulation of epigenetic reprogramming enzymes during the MZT, combine to give rise to the phenomena that manifest postnatally in progeny. Currently, we are engineering a hypomorphic maternal <i>Kdm1a</i> allele that can be used to generate larger numbers of hypomorphic animals to further elucidate these mechanisms."

Although these individual phenotypes may be linked, it is possible that they are separate outcomes that depend on distinct activities of maternal KDM1A during the MZT. Nevertheless, our results establish a novel mammalian paradigm in which altered epigenetic reprogramming by a histone demethylase between generations leads to defects that manifest weeks later, highlighting the potential long-range consequences of epigenetic perturbations in the early mammalian embryo."

Prior to the initial crosses, <i>Kdm1a/Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>were mated to C57BL/6 mice for several generations so that the genetic background is mostly B6. For <i>Gdf9-Cre</i> and <i>Zp3-Cre, Kdm1a/Lsd1<sup>\u0394/+</sup></i> F1 animals with <i>Cre</i> were mated directly with <i>Kdm1a/Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> females. A table is included with the litter sizes of all perinatal lethal animals and all animals assayed in the behavioral assays (See <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). All mouse work was performed under the approved guidelines of the Emory University, NIH and Salk Institute IACUC. Polymorphisms were identified through the UCSC Genome Browser and subsequently verified through sequencing of parental strains and hybrid progeny (See <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Briefly embryos were lysed in Prelude Direct Lysis buffer (Nugen, San Carlos, CA) and amplified cDNAs were prepared using the Ovation RNA-seq system V2 (Nugen,\u00a07102-32). Paired end libraries were prepared according to the Tru-seq library construction protocol starting with Covaris fragmentation step. Libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina Hi-seq 2000. For expression analysis, only first mate pair was used and reads were trimmed from 3' end to 50\u00a0bp. Trimmed reads were filtered to a minimum average base quality of 15. We combined the knownGene, ensGene and refGene annotations for mm10 (downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser) with the full RepeatMasker annotation, also from UCSC Genome Browser, to build a single gene annotation. Redundant transcripts were filtered out using the gffread utility packaged with Cufflinks. The annotation was modified to include a common gene_id value for same-name repeat elements resulting in a total of 875 repeats. Sequences for all annotated features were extracted from the mouse genome and RNA-Seq reads were aligned to them using BBMap with 95% identity, up to a single INDEL and up to 2000 equally best alignments per read. Alignments to features were quantified by counting hits to gene loci and down-weighting read alignments that mapped to multiple gene loci by 1/N<sup>2</sup> where N is equal to the number of gene loci. Reads aligned to repeat elements were counted in the same way but instead of using gene loci the repeat name was used for binning hits. If a read mapped to multiple repeat features all of the same name then it was counted as 1 hit to that repeat name. Raw read counts were loaded into R and median normalized for differential expression analysis. For each pair-wise test genes with raw counts less than 10 in all conditions were not tested. Differential expression was performed by testing the null hypothesis that a gene's fold change between conditions is zero. The observed dispersion-mean relationship was fit using a method similar to that of DESeq and the predicted dispersions were used as the minimum dispersion per gene. Fold-changes between conditions were tested by monte-carlo simulation using the observed and estimated means and dispersions to generate random negative binomial distributed count values (the rnbinom method in R). In each monte-carlo iteration N samples were simulated per condition (N = to the number of samples in each condition), averaged into conditions and the log fold-change was calculated. The resulting simulated log fold-change distributions are normally distributed. Z- scores were computed for each observed log fold-change compared to its corresponding monte-carlo simulated fold-change distribution and translated to two-tail p-values against the normal probability distribution. Raw p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction. Genes and repeats were tested together and marked significant if the adjusted p-value was less than 0.05. RNA-seq data is deposited at GEO (GSE66547). Oocyte expression data used for comparisons was previously deposited at GEO (GSE33923.) For the heat map plot, each gene found to be significantly associated with PC1 is standardized relative to its mean and scaled relative to its variance (ie each gene is scaled separately to improve visualization.) Each row is a gene which is standardized where mean is zero with standard deviation is 1. This makes each row relative to its mean. The scale is relative to its variance. Rows are sorted by a clustering of the genes. Color scale is relative to mean expression level per gene."

The mechanistic basis of these effects are not characterised in further detail. The absolute requirement of LSD1 for embryonic progression, implicating the importance of regulation of histone post-translation modifications, is an important observation. The unique aspect of this manuscript, however, is the <i>Lsd1</i> hypomorph inadvertently produced by the incomplete ablation caused by the <i>Vasa-Cre</i> (paradoxical given the earlier timing of this <i>Cre</i> transgene and remains unexplained). The imperfect ablation of <i>Lsd1</i> allows some embryos to survive through the critical pre-implantation phase, and then to term and adulthood, although there is another period of attrition at birth. The adult survivors display abnormal behaviours, which are characterised in detail. Again, I think this is a very interesting observation, which points to epigenetic imbalance in the early embryo as having potentially long-term consequences. No doubt, the authors could have chosen other phenotypes to examine, as there is no reason to suspect that the presumed epigenetic defects should be restricted to these few behaviours, but the limited numbers of surviving adults preclude a deeper phenotypic characterisation. With justification, the authors choose to analyse imprinted genes as potential mediators, although I am not aware that the specific imprinted genes examined are implicated in the behaviours tested."

It seems to me that if one expects developmental failures one should never use superovulated females as a source of the eggs. Eggs and embryos from superovulated females are going to be inferior and any negative developmental effect will be potentiated. I would recommend that at least some of described experiment be repeated using normal matings. In addition, the only significant molecular information in the manuscript is the transcriptome comparison between the maternally deleted and wt 2-cell stage embryos i.e. period of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). However, the ZGA is entirely regulated by the maternally inherited molecules; proteins and RNAs. Proteome comparison would be technically quite difficult but transcriptome comparison between maternally deleted and wt oocyte is possible, necessary and should be included and interpreted in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is one of the most important mechanisms controlling the utilization of many maternal mRNAs and it would be very important to determine how it functions during maturation of mutant oocytes and after fertilization in zygotes. In order to supplement the data on the imprinting state of several genes in perinatal pups, it would be necessary to assess and include in the manuscript the imprinting state of the same genes in the ovulated oocytes and zygotes."

For example, for the <i>Igf2r</i> DMR in MEP1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), there appears to be essentially three patterns of methylation: one fully unmethylated sequence, a set of fully methylated sequences and a set of sequences that are partially methylated in an identical pattern. Such a pattern could suggest a high rate of clonality and that very little amplifiable DNA went into the bisulphite reaction or post-bisulphite PCR, perhaps because DNA was degraded in dead pups. Alternatively, the result could suggest something of more biological interest, that these were the three methylation profiles present in cells of the early cleavage embryo at that very limited time window of maternal LSD1 deficiency, and that this limited set of profiles becomes 'fixed' when the embryonic lineage is determined from a small number of blastomeres. I think we need more detail and improved methylation analysis to be able to discriminate between technical issues and biologically interesting interpretation."

In the paper originally describing <i>Vasa-Cre</i> mice, deletion was always observed in all oocytes. The breeding schemes the authors are using indicate that there is only one functional allele of <i>Lsd1</i> in the target cells, which makes the persistence of LSD1 even more surprising. Considering that <i>Vasa-Cre</i> is most likely expressed in primordial germ cells it is extremely unlikely that, if deletion took place, the LSD1 can persist till ovulation. The authors admit that they cannot explain it, however the question remains if one should leave it like that. The authors can check how efficient deleters are the <i>Vasa-Cre</i> mice they are using (more about mice later) by crossing them with some other <i>fl/fl</i> target strain. In addition, it would be interesting to determine the level of LSD1 in maternally deleted eggs. Is it the same as in heterozygous females or significantly lower? This information would be very important in evaluating the results of behavioural tests."

Ideally, these effects would be validated by RT-qPCR. Also, this mis-regulation could be more apparent than real. For example, a two-fold up-regulation of <i>Dnmt1</i> could represent the same number of oocyte-derived <i>Dnmt1</i> transcripts, but a reduction in the total mRNA pool in the 2-C embryo owing to impaired zygotic genome activation, so it is a relative rather than absolute change."

Some connections can be made between these phenotypic outcomes, but they can be considered separate facets of the story. Thus, the reported behavioural defects could be completely unrelated to altered imprinting, but the analysis of imprinted genes offers precedent that maternal lack of LSD1 could give rise to early epigenetic errors that persist into adult life. In the revised manuscript, the characterisation of the molecular defects in early embryos is significantly improved with the addition of the RNA-seq data from <i>Lsd1:Zp3-Cre</i> oocytes. These added data allow the authors to conclude more strongly that there is a defect in zygotic genome activation, since the disruption in gene expression in oocytes is far less extensive. However, whether the ZGA defect depends upon activity of LSD1 in the zygote/embryo or other factors stored in the oocyte that depend upon LSD1 in the oocyte cannot be distinguished. The manuscript from Ancellin et al. addresses this point. Nevertheless, the informatic analysis of the RNA-seq datasets looks very robust."

It would have given this analysis far greater credibility: we would have had the confidence that pristine, freshly isolated and defined tissues were being analysed, rather than an aggregation of tissue of unknown quality from a sagittal section. On a side point, regarding the result for <i>Grb10</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), it is not clear that the authors are actually looking at the germline DMR, as this region should be fully unmethylated on the paternal allele of control animals, whereas both alleles seem to be fully methylated.

The definitive ways to get around possible confound of litter size when there seems to be such a profound effect on litter size would be to reduce the litter size of the controls groups to those of the maternal mutant class, or undertake cross-fostering to ensure control and maternal mutant groups all experience similar postnatal care. In as much as it is not possible to expect the authors to undertake the study in this way now, I do strongly urge them to include explicit statements in the Materials and methods on the postnatal history of the adults, both maternal mutant and control groups, relating to litter size (exact litter sizes for all groups).

Such a pattern could suggest a high rate of clonality and that very little amplifiable DNA went into the bisulphite reaction or post-bisulphite PCR, perhaps because DNA was degraded in dead pups. Alternatively, the result could suggest something of more biological interest, that these were the three methylation profiles present in cells of the early cleavage embryo at that very limited time window of maternal LSD1 deficiency, and that this limited set of profiles becomes 'fixed' when the embryonic lineage is determined from a small number of blastomeres.

Suggestion that possible reason may be extreme stability of LSD1 protein or RNA is not logical. If this would be the case one would expect to see even more protein or RNA in the oocytes in which deletion happens much later when mediated by Gdf9-Cre and ZP3-Cre.</i>"

They could have easily check if this is true. As it stands there is very significant difference and readers may draw all kinds of conclusions from what could be trivial fact that one lab is better in growing embryos or handling mice. However, it is also possible that the difference is caused by earlier action of GDF9 which would I turn deprive oocytes of histone demethylase few days earlier. However if LSD1 protein or RNA is so long lived this explanation is useless. One would really like to see those puzzles discussed a bit better. Reviewer #2: As before, this manuscript on the consequences of ablation of LSD1/KDM1A in mouse oocytes has three components: phenotypic and molecular characterisation of defects in oocytes and preimplantation embryos; description of behavioural effects in rare surviving adult progeny obtained after early maternal germline ablation of LSD1 (Vasa-Cre); and molecular analysis of imprinted genes in pups from such maternal germline mutants.</i> "

                    "text": "<i>Some connections can be made between these phenotypic outcomes, but they can be considered separate facets of the story. Thus, the reported behavioural defects could be completely unrelated to altered imprinting, but the analysis of imprinted genes offers precedent that maternal lack of LSD1 could give rise to early epigenetic errors that persist into adult life. In the revised manuscript, the characterisation of the molecular defects in early embryos is significantly improved with the addition of the RNA-seq data from Lsd1:Zp3-Cre oocytes. These added data allow the authors to conclude more strongly that there is a defect in zygotic genome activation, since the disruption in gene expression in oocytes is far less extensive. However, whether the ZGA defect depends upon activity of LSD1 in the zygote/embryo or other factors stored in the oocyte that depend upon LSD1 in the oocyte cannot be distinguished. The manuscript from Ancellin et al., addresses this point. Nevertheless, the informatic analysis of the RNA-seq datasets looks very robust. Regarding the other two main aspects of the manuscript, I retain some concerns. I think the authors could have gone about the expression and methylation analysis in a more robust way. Given the prominence given to this analysis in the manuscript, I would have considered that sacrificing a couple of pups for more refined molecular analysis, rather than relying on the approach adopted of extracting DNA and RNA from histological sections of deceased pups, would have been appropriate. It would have given this analysis far greater credibility: we would have had the confidence that pristine, freshly isolated and defined tissues were being analysed, rather than an aggregation of tissue of unknown quality from a sagittal section. On a side point, regarding the result for Grb10 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), it is not clear that the authors are actually looking at the germline DMR, as this region should be fully unmethylated on the paternal allele of control animals, whereas both alleles seem to be fully methylated. (The germline DMR is unmethylated on the paternal allele in all tissues and, as far as I am aware, tissue-specific expression status of Grb10 occurs without changes in the methylation of the germline DMR.) Regarding the behavioural tests, I am not sure the issue of litter size and behavioural effects is fully dealt with. Were the litter sizes similar for the various control groups, given the very small litter sizes of the maternal mutants? The definitive ways to get around possible confound of litter size when there seems to be such a profound effect on litter size would be to reduce the litter size of the controls groups to those of the maternal mutant class, or undertake cross-fostering to ensure control and maternal mutant groups all experience similar postnatal care. In as much as it is not possible to expect the authors to undertake the study in this way now, I do strongly urge them to include explicit statements in the Materials and methods on the postnatal history of the adults, both maternal mutant and control groups, relating to litter size (exact litter sizes for all groups). There remains a potential confounding factor here, and readers need to be able to appreciate it.</i>"
