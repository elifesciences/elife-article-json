Their step-wise transcriptional activation follows their genomic topology and the various states of activation are subsequently memorized into domains of progressively overlapping gene products. We have analyzed the 3D chromatin organization of <i>Hox</i> clusters during their early activation in vivo, using high-resolution circular chromosome conformation capture. Initially, <i>Hox</i> clusters are organized as single chromatin compartments containing all genes and bivalent chromatin marks. Transcriptional activation is associated with a dynamic bi-modal 3D organization, whereby the genes switch autonomously from an inactive to an active compartment. These local 3D dynamics occur within a framework of constitutive interactions within the surrounding Topological Associated Domains, indicating that this regulation process is mostly cluster intrinsic. The step-wise progression in time is fixed at various body levels and thus can account for the chromatin architectures previously described at a later stage for different anterior to posterior levels."

Their step-wise transcriptional activation follows their genomic topology and the various states of activation are subsequently memorized into domains of progressively overlapping gene products. We have analyzed the 3D chromatin organization of <i>Hox</i> clusters during their early activation in vivo, using high-resolution circular chromosome conformation capture. Initially, <i>Hox</i> clusters are organized as single chromatin compartments containing all genes and bivalent chromatin marks. Transcriptional activation is associated with a dynamic bi-modal 3D organization, whereby the genes switch autonomously from an inactive to an active compartment. These local 3D dynamics occur within a framework of constitutive interactions within the surrounding Topological Associated Domains, indicating that this regulation process is mostly cluster intrinsic. The step-wise progression in time is fixed at various body levels and thus can account for the chromatin architectures previously described at a later stage for different anterior to posterior levels."

This mechanism likely prevents <i>Hox</i> genes that direct the development of the hind end of the mouse from being switched on too early, and hence it avoids body parts being misidentified and developing incorrectly. Further, the patterns of active chromatin vs inactive chromatin can be fixed at each section along head-to-tail axis, such that it will be memorized in all daughter cells produced subsequently from each particular body section."

Over time, <i>Hox</i> genes are sequentially activated following their chromosomal order and transcripts encoded by the last <i>Hox</i> group 13 genes can be detected at around E9, that is two days after the onset of activation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deschamps et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kmita and Duboule, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deschamps and van Nes, 2005</a>). This transcriptional progression (the \u2018<i>Hox</i> clock\u2019, <a href=\"#bib12\">Duboule, 1994</a>) thus extends over several days. In the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM), this sequential activation needs to be coordinated with the time-sequenced production of body segments (the \u2018segmentation clock\u2019, <a href=\"#bib42\">Pourquie, 2003</a>), such that newly produced somites acquire distinct genetic identifiers (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dubrulle et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zakany et al., 2001</a>). Next, the various states of <i>Hox</i> gene activity are fine-tuned and memorized, ultimately leading to domains along the rostral to caudal axis where partially overlapping sets of HOX products can be observed (\u2018spatial colinearity\u2019). As a result, genes located at 3\u2032positions (e.g., groups 3, 4) are transcribed almost along the entire embryonic axis, including the lateral plate mesoderm, paraxial mesoderm and neural tube, whereas the 5\u2032-located group 10 or 11 are active in the posterior trunk and group 13 in the tip of the tail bud only (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deschamps et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kmita and Duboule, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deschamps and van Nes, 2005</a>)."

Spatial colinearity could be recapitulated by several single-gene transgenes (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib43\">Puschel et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Whiting et al., 1991</a>]), yet not in all instances (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tschopp et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, a systematic analysis of modified <i>HoxD</i> clusters <i>in vivo</i> revealed that, at a late stage, the sustained transcription of these genes at the correct body level primarily relies upon local regulatory elements (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tschopp et al., 2009</a>), which are present in transgenic constructs. In contrast, the precise timing of <i>Hoxd</i> gene activation depends on the integrity of the full cluster, a genomic situation observed thus far in all animals developing following a temporal rostral to caudal progressive strategy during their early development (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duboule, 1994</a>). The genomic clustering of <i>Hox</i> genes is thus considered as an essential feature for temporal colinearity to properly process, whereas it may not be as important for the correct distribution of HOX products along the AP-axis, at least in the late phase of spatial colinearity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duboule, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tschopp et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Noordermeer and Duboule, 2013</a>)."

In vertebrates, two conceptual frameworks have been proposed to account for this process, the first relying on bio-molecular mechanisms (e.g., <a href=\"#bib12\">Duboule, 1994</a>) and the second involving biophysical forces (<a href=\"#bib40\">Papageorgiou, 2001</a>). In embryonic stem (ES) cells, that is cells that reflect best the state of <i>Hox</i> genes before their activation, <i>Hox</i> clusters are decorated by both repressive (H3K27me3) and activating (H3K4me3) marks (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Soshnikova and Duboule, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Noordermeer and Duboule, 2013</a>). Subsequently, cells that activate these genes in a time sequence resolve this bivalent chromatin state and show two opposing distributions of histone marks over the <i>HoxD</i> cluster: transcribed genes carry large domains of H3K4me3 marks, whereas inactive genes are covered by H3K27me3 marks only (<a href=\"#bib47\">Soshnikova and Duboule, 2009</a>)."

The analysis of the 3D chromatin organization at this stage revealed a bi-modal compartmentalization, whereby active genes labeled by H3K4me3 are clustered together and physically separated from the inactive genes, labeled by H3K27me3 that are also found in a defined spatial structure (<a href=\"#bib36\">Noordermeer et al., 2011</a>). These 3D compartments, whose sizes correlate with the number of active vs inactive genes, may reinforce the proper maintenance of long-term transcriptional states at various AP levels by isolating <i>Hox</i> clusters from their surrounding chromatin and reducing interference between the active and inactive chromatin domains. Such distinct bimodal 3D organizations, associated with transcriptional regulation at <i>Hox</i> clusters, have been observed in other instances, either in the embryo (<a href=\"#bib34\">Montavon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andrey et al., 2013</a>) or in mouse and human cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fraser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ferraiuolo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rousseau et al., 2014</a>)."

Consequently, a potential association between these bimodal chromatin structures and the progressive activation of transcription along the <i>Hox</i> gene clusters, rather than its maintenance, remained to be assessed. In this study, we describe the 3D organization of <i>Hox</i> gene clusters at high resolution during the implementation of temporal colinearity in the PSM and show that their stepwise activation occurs in parallel with their physical transition from a negative to a positive domain. We also show that this process is accompanied by series of long-range contacts with the flanking gene deserts, even though these contacts remain largely invariable throughout temporal colinearity, unlike what was observed during limb development (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrey et al., 2013</a>). We discuss whether this stepwise transition of genes from one domain to the other may guide temporal colinearity or, in contrast, is a mere consequence of a sequential transcriptional activation."

These cells indeed represent early embryonic cells related to blastocyst inner cell mass cells, that is when <i>Hox</i> genes are all supposedly silent. We hypothesized that these cells reflect the ground state 3D architecture of the <i>Hox</i> clusters, which we assessed by using high-resolution 4C-seq (Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture; <a href=\"#bib36\">Noordermeer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van de Werken et al., 2012</a>) and a variety of viewpoints within all four <i>Hox</i> clusters. These various baits generated similar interaction profiles with the majority of sequence reads covering the gene clusters and extending within several kilobases (kb) on either sides, as illustrated by <i>Hoxd13</i>, <i>Hoxd9</i> and <i>Hoxd4</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>). Additional contacts were scored in the flanking gene deserts, though with significantly lower frequencies (see section \u2018Temporal colinearity within a constitutive framework of long-range interactions\u2019). The overall size of the strong interaction profiles exactly matched the distribution of bivalent chromatin marks in these cells, with a moderate level of H3K27me3 covering the cluster and rather weak H3K4me3 peaks labeling promoters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Soshnikova and Duboule, 2009</a>). Therefore, prior to their activation, <i>Hox</i> clusters are already organized into 3D chromatin compartments that physically separate the chromatin decorated by bivalent marks from the genomic surroundings, even though some contacts are established at a larger scale, outside the gene cluster itself (see section \u2018Temporal colinearity within a constitutive framework of long-range interactions\u2019)."

A more quantitative comparison in 3D architectures between ES cells and E10.5 forebrain cells nevertheless indicated that in ES cells, <i>Hox</i> genes interacted more with the outside chromatin, relative to their interactions within the cluster, as compared to forebrain cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20135</a>). Therefore, despite the fact that the clusters are presumably inactive in both situations, the presence of bivalent marks in ES cells coincided with a 3D domain that has elevated relative levels of interactions with the directly surrounding regions, when compared to its counterpart in brain cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, left and <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A</a>). This difference is more pronounced at the <i>HoxB</i> cluster (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right). In embryonic forebrain cells, <i>HoxB</i> forms a single 3D compartment, excluding the 80 kb large repeat-rich intergenic region located between <i>Hoxb13</i> and <i>Hoxb9</i>, which loops out (<a href=\"#bib36\">Noordermeer et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, both the <i>Hoxb13</i> and <i>Hoxb9</i> viewpoints revealed local 3D compartments in ES cells, matching again the extent of bivalent histone marks, yet these two compartments remained separated and did not fuse. Rather, they displayed increased interactions with the nearby chromatin, as if decreased internal interactions would increase contacts outside the cluster (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2, 3 and 5</a>). In ES cells, the <i>HoxB</i> cluster is thus organized in two 3D compartments, which have more interactions with their genomic surroundings than in forebrain cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, right and <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6B</a>)."

In both cell types, H3K27me3 marks strongly correlated with the 3D organization, suggesting a direct link between these two readouts. A considerably lower correlation was scored for <i>HoxB</i>, perhaps related to the absence of clustering of the two H3K27me3 marked sub-domains. In contrast, no particular correlation was observed between the 3D organization and the presence of H3K4me3 marks, in the bivalent state (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that H3K4me3 marks and/or the associated factors do not noticeably contribute to the formation of 3D compartments in ES cells."

We assessed whether the observed difference in the strength and homogeneity of the interaction profiles between ES cells and embryonic brain cells was associated with distinct levels of background transcription. In ES cells, RNA-seq detected transcription for most <i>Hox</i> genes, though generally at very low level (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7A,B</a>). RT-qPCR of a subset of transcripts confirmed that some of these low-level transcripts (particularly the <i>Hoxd13</i> and <i>Hoxb13</i> transcripts) constitute genuine processed transcripts (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7C</a>). In contrast, transcription of <i>Hox</i> genes in E10.5 forebrain cells was rarely detected, and no reliable spliced transcripts were detected (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Therefore, when <i>Hox</i> genes are decorated by bivalent chromatin marks, they appear more permissive for background transcription as compared to other cell types where they are covered by H3K27me3 marks only, likely illustrating the increased resistance to transcription of the latter condition. In this context, posterior <i>Hox</i> genes seems to be more prone to background transcriptional activation in ES cells than more anterior <i>Hox</i> genes, in contrast to their subsequent dynamics of activation in future embryonic tissues where anterior genes come first. This may reflect the presence of strong enhancers in their vicinity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Montavon et al., 2011</a>)."

At E8.5, these interactions extended up to <i>Hoxd8-Hoxd9</i>. In E9.5 samples <i>Hoxd10</i> was clearly contacted, and in E10.5 <i>Hoxd11</i> and <i>Hoxd12</i> were also involved (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, right column).

At this stage, <i>Hoxd9</i> is robustly transcribed, whereas <i>Hoxd11</i> has just started transcriptional activation.

In the most caudal piece of the E10.5 mouse embryo, interactions between <i>Hoxd12</i>, <i>Hoxd13</i> and the positive domain were finally detected, suggesting that the entire cluster falls into a single spatial domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, bottom ratio: purple shading). Here again, however, though the interactions were significant, they were not particularly strong, suggesting the presence of a mixed cell population. Based on these data, we propose that the bimodal distributions are frozen in those cells leaving the zone of proliferation, at the caudal aspect of the embryo where temporal colinearity is potentially processed. These 3D structures, and hence the <i>Hox</i> transcription programs, will thus be maintained and memorize the various AP levels from which they originate."

In ES cells indeed, two TADs cover approximately the gene deserts on either side and have their border at the level of the <i>Hoxd12</i>-<i>Hoxd11</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Virtual 4C from HiC data with bins that cover the <i>Hoxd</i> genes show highly similar priming of interactions with the surrounding TADs when compared to our 4C-seq analysis, confirming that both approaches score similar chromatin behavior (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sexton et al., 2012</a> for analysis strategy). During limb development, genes located near this boundary (<i>Hoxd9</i> to <i>Hoxd11</i>) change their tropism and switch their contacts from one TAD to the other, such as to interact sequentially with the appropriate enhancers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrey et al., 2013</a>). This structural re-organization is clearly illustrated in our hierarchical clustering with <i>Hoxd11</i> changing its association from <i>Hoxd4</i> to <i>Hoxd13</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). During temporal colinearity, however, such structural re-organization is not observed and hence the stepwise transcriptional activation of <i>Hoxd</i> genes appears to occur within a largely constitutive framework of long-range interactions; genes up to <i>Hoxd11</i> interact mostly with the telomeric domain, either before or after their activation, and <i>Hoxd13</i> always interacts with the centromeric domain. This opposed tropism for <i>Hoxd</i> genes in ES cells, as revealed by HiC and the consequent TAD structures, is somewhat at odds with the local clustering of <i>Hoxd</i> genes when in a negative state, which we report here by using 4C. This paradox is discussed below."

Prior to their sequential activation, <i>Hox</i> genes are organized into local 3D chromatin compartments that encompass all bivalently marked chromatin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>). In ES cells, however, these 3D compartments appear less defined than the fully inactive and H3K27me3-only marked compartments observed in differentiated cells. This difference in discreteness was paralleled by the amount of observable background transcription, which was substantially higher in ES cells that in brain cells, though the biological impact of these very low level transcripts, if any, remains to be determined. This supports the view whereby a generally relaxed chromatin organization in ES cell may accompany the plasticity required for cell-faith commitment (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mattout and Meshorer, 2010</a>). Interestingly, in ES cells grown in the presence of two kinase-inhibitors and thought to be in a somehow more na\u00efve developmental state, H3K27me3 marks are almost absent from <i>Hox</i> clusters (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marks et al., 2012</a>). Considering the high correlation between the presence of H3K27me3 marks and the existence of 3D chromatin compartments, we would anticipate <i>Hox</i> clusters within these ES cells not to group into 3D compartments as distinct as those visible in \u2018canonical\u2019 ES cells. We therefore hypothesize that structuring into fully inactive 3D compartments is a gradual process occurring over the course of several days during embryonic development."

This indicates that the presence of <i>Hox</i> genes in 3D compartments of various extents, along the developed body axis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Noordermeer et al., 2011</a>) is not an a posteriori mechanism used to fix and secure the long-term maintenance of various states of activity, fixed earlier by \u2018classical\u2019 transcriptional regulations acting <i>in trans</i>. Instead, it suggests that such spatial structures are instrumental in the precise regulation of their transcriptional timing. This is observed at least for the <i>Hoxd9</i> to <i>Hoxd13</i> genes and we infer that the same process occurs in the part of the cluster containing from <i>Hoxd1</i> to <i>Hoxd8</i>.

While our results support this idea, the transcriptional timing associated with gene clustering may not be an absolute prerequisite to achieve the proper spatial distributions of <i>Hox</i> genes products, as suggested by the multiple cases where single mammalian <i>Hox</i> transgenes could largely recapitulate the major expression specificities along the AP-axis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krumlauf, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Duboule, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tschopp et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tschopp and Duboule, 2011a</a>). In this context, it is possible that the progressive transition of <i>Hox</i> genes from an inactive to an active 3D compartment reflects the existence of a mechanism whose major aim would not be to precisely regulate a time sequence but instead, to protect the most \u2018posterior\u2019 <i>Hox</i> genes from a premature exposure to activating factors, a situation shown to block posterior elongation and hence to be detrimental to the embryo (<a href=\"#bib58\">Young et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mallo et al., 2010</a>). The necessity to actively prevent the most posterior genes from premature activation is supported by their basal transcriptional activity in ES cells, where <i>Hox</i> clusters are less discrete than in subsequent negative tissues such as fetal brain cells. Such a basal activity, which was not scored in these latter cells, may reflect the rather generic nature of the activating signals, the general mechanism underlying temporal colinearity thus relying on de-repression."

In this view, graded signals emanating from the posterior aspect of the developing embryo would lead to a progressive de-repression of <i>Hox</i> clusters, implying that these clusters would display some directional sensitivity. While the nature of the activating factors is elusive, a link with the segmentation clock was proposed (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dubrulle et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zakany et al., 2001</a>). Concerning the directional sensitivity, <i>Polycomb</i> group (Pc-G) gene products may play an important role in this process, as the distribution of H3K27me3 marks correlate with the size of the inactive 3D compartments. Recently, a somewhat graded distribution of both EZH2 and RING1B, two proteins members of the PRC2 and PRC1 complexes, respectively, was described over the <i>HoxD</i> cluster in ES cells, with the highest signals covering the most \u2018posterior\u2019 genes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Directionality may therefore derive from a weaker \u2018anterior\u2019 repression exerted by the Pc system. In this context, progressive alterations of the repressive system should sensitize the transcriptional threshold, while keeping on with directionality. This effect was observed in <i>Cbx2</i>\u2212/\u2212 mutant embryos (a component of the PRC1 complex formerly known as M33), where the efficiency of the PRC1 complex was moderately decreased: RA treatment resulted in premature yet colinear activation of <i>Hoxd</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bel-Vialar et al., 2000</a>). Alternatively, collinear activation may rely upon a different kind of model involving for example biophysical forces (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almirantis et al., 2013</a>). Future experiments where the process will be witnessed at the cellular level in real time may be informative in this context."

However, temporal colinearity does occur within a framework of constitutive long-range interactions, which may provide a scaffold helping the bimodal separation of active and inactive genes to take place. Further experiments with mice carrying large re-arrangements of these two gene deserts will be necessary to clearly weight the importance of flanking regions in the implementation of the <i>Hox</i> clock."

HiC analysis in ES cells identified a boundary between topological domains positioned around the <i>Hoxd12</i> to <i>Hoxd11</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) and such boundaries are thought to impose or reflect a physical separation between the two interaction landscapes (e.g., <a href=\"#bib37\">Nora et al., 2013</a>). As a consequence, <i>Hoxd13</i> should display more interactions with its flanking gene desert than with the other part of the <i>HoxD</i> gene cluster. Yet, by using several viewpoints in a 4C set-up, the <i>HoxD</i> cluster in ES cells appears to form a single negative compartment, despite the interspersed presence of this TAD boundary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In fact, a detailed analysis of the HiC dataset reveals that the <i>HoxD</i> cluster itself forms a \u2018micro-TAD\u2019, displaying strong internal interactions, in agreement with the 4C results reported here. As such, we consider it likely that the TAD boundary identified by HiC in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>) represents an average description of two distinct configurations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). For each allele, either the most posterior <i>Hoxd13</i> gene forms stable interactions within the TAD on the centromeric side or, alternatively, the <i>Hoxd11</i> to <i>Hoxd1</i> genes interact with the TAD on the telomeric side (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). As a consequence, for each allele the entire <i>HoxD</i> 3D compartment becomes located towards a single TAD, on one side of the cluster with a physical separation from the other side. Molecule(s) causing these interactions are elusive and may include proteins that mediate constitutive loops between <i>Hoxd</i> gene promoters and their regulatory elements. The CTCF protein, which may play a role in scaffolding TADs, binds multiple sites around the <i>Hoxd13</i> to <i>Hoxd8</i> region (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ferraiuolo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Phillips-Cremins et al., 2013</a>). Because formaldehyde crosslinking has a very short range of action (<a href=\"#bib39\">Orlando et al., 1997</a>), the system generates a graded pattern of 4C and HiC interactions from the location of the actual binding sites. Therefore, while in ES cells and for each allele, TAD borders are likely located at either side of the <i>HoxD</i> 3D compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, black lines), our analysis of a large population of cells reflects the equilibrium that exists between these two situations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). At later stages, when the <i>HoxD</i> cluster adopts a bimodal 3D organization, the tethering of interactions, as illustrated by the existence of TADs on either side, may help implement the separation between activated and repressed <i>Hox</i> genes, thereby potentially reducing deleterious regulatory interferences and premature activation of the most posterior <i>Hox</i> genes."

Here the authors focus on exploring how the temporal dynamics of Hox gene activation along the antero/posterior axis correlate with the 3D architecture of the clusters. They show that inactive Hox genes are organized in a single topological domain, as shown in brain and ES cells. However, as the collinear activation of these genes takes place, they move one-by-one, instead of in groups from an inactive to an active bimodal 3D domain. The main result is that active Hox genes occupy the same domain, and have more constant interactions with the gene desert regions. Whether the move is the consequence of gene activation, or is part of the activation process itself remains an open question. These domains coincide, with regions decorated by or depleted of H3K27me3 repression marks, respectively. Interestingly, once this bimodal 3D organization is defined for a particular A/P position, it remains fixed as development progress. Finally, they show that these internal switches within the Hox clusters are independent of the external contact that Hox genes make with the flanking gene deserts, which remain largely invariant through development and correlate with the Topological domains (TADs) defined by HiC studies. This is interesting, as the authors previously showed that these interactions do change and contribute to Hox gene expression during limb development."

Looking at the 4C-seq data from all other developmental stages, it seems is that an equilibrium between TAD constrains and the Hox interactions within the cluster could be occurring in all tissues and stages. Thus, it seems that, within the Hox clusters (that it, not considering long-range contacts), the architecture restrictions imposed by the TADs are much stronger than the 3D rearrangements caused by the progressive transition from inactive to active domains during A/P specification. Indeed, for the external genes, the increment of the contacts seen during these transitions, although detectable, is rather small compared with the number of interactions identified at their corresponding side of the TAD. It seems that genes closer to the TADs (specially Hox11 genes) are the ones showing the larger changes in their contacts as they transit from an active to an inactive state. This resembles very much with what the authors have shown for long-range contacts of these same genes during the distal limb differentiation, suggesting a more permeability of the TAD border for genes in very close proximity. It would be interesting to plot the number of reads within the cluster that lie at each side of the TADs for each gene and at each stage and A/P position. This could help to determine the putative constrains imposed by TADs onto the 3D dynamics associated to Hox gene collinear activation. This should also be discussed with more detail."

One limitation of this data is that it is less suited for identification of domains than Hi-C, as only single view points are analyzed. Typically topological domains are more readily detectable, both quantitatively and statistically, by Hi-C or 5C, because those methods provide matrices of interaction in which domains are more readily, and rigorously, identified. The authors need to describe their 4C data more quantitatively when they infer domain boundaries: in the current manuscript it seems that domain boundaries are either taken from published Hi-C data (which is from a different tissue/cell type and thus may be incorrect in certain aspects, even though many domain features may be conserved), or are based solely on visual inspection of the data, which is not quantitative. Overall the visual inspection of the data is quite satisfying and domain boundaries are certainly visible yet I think the manuscript would be strengthened by including some statistical metrics to better define a 4C domain. This will also allow more quantitative detection of the precise boundary, which is a key factor in the current work, and would allow a more quantitative comparison with domains of histone modifications. The approach to correlate 4C data with histone modifications described in Table I is a start, but it does not show whether domain boundaries coincide. For instance, 4C signal often appear to extend beyond the domain of histone modification (e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, Hoxd13 in E9.5 tail bud)."

In the former, the Hox complex is gradually excluded from CTs, which could correspond to the flanking TADs. In the latter, sequential activation of the complex would involve its translocation from a region of repression (chromatin) to activation where there would be greater access to upstream regulatory factors. Although, Spyros envokes morphogenic and electromotive (i.e., Coulomb force) components, nowhere do the authors mention these works in the content of their discussion or model."

The authors suggest an apparent paradox when comparing Hi-C data and 4C data: the Hi-C data suggest a TAD boundary around d12 in ES cells, whereas d13 interacts with the rest of the Hox locus as observed by 4C. Their interpretation could be true, but in my view a more simple explanation is that the resolution of Hi-C (20 Kb at best) may be too low, and in the Dixon et al. data the true boundary can easily be 20Kb to the right or the left. I think the argument that Hi-C detects a boundary, while 4C does not, because Hi-C represents the average of two distinct conformations is not valid: 4C should be equally detecting this same average."

Looking at the 4C-seq data from all other developmental stages, it seems is that an equilibrium between TAD constrains and the Hox interactions within the cluster could be occurring in all tissues and stages. Thus, it seems that, within the Hox clusters (that it, not considering long-range contacts), the architecture restrictions imposed by the TADs are much stronger than the 3D rearrangements caused by the progressive transition from inactive to active domains during A/P specification. Indeed, for the external genes, the increment of the contacts seen during these transitions, although detectable, is rather small compared with the number of interactions identified at their corresponding side of the TAD. It seems that genes closer to the TADs (specially Hox11 genes) are the ones showing the larger changes in their contacts as they transit from an active to an inactive state. This resembles very much with what the authors have shown for long-range contacts of these same genes during the distal limb differentiation, suggesting a more permeability of the TAD border for genes in very close proximity</i>."

One limitation of this data is that it is less suited for identification of domains than Hi-C, as only single view points are analyzed. Typically topological domains are more readily detectable, both quantitatively and statistically, by Hi-C or 5C, because those methods provide matrices of interaction in which domains are more readily, and rigorously, identified. The authors need to describe their 4C data more quantitatively when they infer domain boundaries: in the current manuscript it seems that domain boundaries are either taken from published Hi-C data (which is from a different tissue/cell type and thus may be incorrect in certain aspects, even though many domain features may be conserved), or are based solely on visual inspection of the data, which is not quantitative. Overall the visual inspection of the data is quite satisfying and domain boundaries are certainly visible yet I think the manuscript would be strengthened by including some statistical metrics to better define a 4C domain. This will also allow more quantitative detection of the precise boundary, which is a key factor in the current work, and would allow a more quantitative comparison with domains of histone modifications. The approach to correlate 4C data with histone modifications described in Table I is a start, but it does not show whether domain boundaries coincide.

The increased interactions in ES cells are therefore limited only to the surrounding TADs. This excludes the possibility that the effect is due to random ligation. The consequences of these data are now discussed in the text."

This was one of the reasons why we carried out these experiments, to see if the chromatin \u2018micro-domains\u2019 were only two or alternatively, if they were progressively installed during trunk extension. We reached the conclusion that the latter situation is observed. Yet of course this is seen <i>only</i> in the d9 to d13 part of the cluster. To verify this on the anterior part would require thousands of dissections, <i>a fortiori</i> including cell sheets, which are not as well defined (homogenous) as in later embryos. For the moment, we think this experiment is not feasible. The referees are right in mentioning that our model may <i>not</i> apply to the anterior part (<i>d1</i> to <i>d8</i>) where sequential activation may <i>not</i> be paralleled by progressive chromatin transition. The text has been clarified accordingly."

In the absence of the associated chromatin marks, this makes it hard to argue that in ES cells the HoxD cluster is less defined than in forebrain cells.

Overall, these data sets still displayed the same pattern of interactions (see <a href=\"#tbl4\">Author response table 1</a>), but with less significant p-values due to the fewer useful fragments in the analysis. This is in contrast to the comparison between replicates, which is generally not significantly different (or, in the case of the <i>Hoxb13</i> gene ES rep 1 <i>versus</i> ES rep 2: very marginally). Within the data set, we do realize there is one large outlier: the comparison between the <i>Hoxd13</i> replicate 1 <i>versus</i> replicate 2. Within the overall replicate 2 experiment, this particular viewpoint was most problematic. To keep consistency within the experiment, and not hand pick which data to include, we decided to maintain it.
