Here we mined publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomic datasets to identify 12,498 high\u2011confidence viral genomes linked to their microbial hosts. These data augment public datasets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7-38% of 'unknown' sequence space in viromes. Genome- and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that (<i>i</i>) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and (<i>ii</i>) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited. Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and co\u2011infection prevalences, as well as evaluation of <i>in silico</i> virus-host linkage predictions. Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes."
