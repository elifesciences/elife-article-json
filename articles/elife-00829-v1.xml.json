CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. In this study, we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In mitotic cells, membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be \u2018restarted\u2019 in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown."

Actin is a molecule that forms a sort of scaffolding within the cell (called the cytoskeleton), and it also guides the movement of molecules and larger structures within the cell. Further, when the cell membrane is being stretched, the actin cytoskeleton can assist the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery to pull cargo into the cell."

The answer, Kaur et al. suggest, is that all the actin in the cell is needed by the cytoskeleton during cell division, so there is no actin available to perform other tasks such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Further experiments demonstrated that this form of endocytosis can be \u2018restarted\u2019 in dividing cells by treating the cells in a way that frees up some additional actin. The work of Kaur et al. also ruled out the theory that chemical changes to the endocytosis machinery disabled it during cell division. These findings have implications for the delivery of drugs, via endocytosis, to the rapidly dividing cells that are involved in diseases such as cancer."

It has been known for decades that CME, like many other cellular processes, is inhibited during the early stages of mitosis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fawcett, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berlin and Oliver, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Warren, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fielding et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fielding and Royle, 2013</a>).

The actin cytoskeleton may assist in these latter stages of vesicle formation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Robertson et al., 2009</a>)."

In early mitotic cells, shallow clathrin-coated pits are seen at the plasma membrane suggesting that invagination and subsequent steps of CME are inhibited (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pypaert et al., 1987</a>). Two main mechanisms have been proposed. First, direct mitotic phosphorylation of the CME machinery decreases its activity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pypaert et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">He et al., 2003</a>). In support of this, numerous endocytic proteins are phosphorylated during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dephoure et al., 2008</a>), but it is not clear what effect, if any, these modifications have on CME. Second, that the increased membrane tension of mitotic cells prevents invagination during CME (<a href=\"#bib37\">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</a>). There is good evidence that the membrane tension is increased in early mitosis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stewart et al., 2011a</a>) in a process driven by osmotic changes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Habela and Sontheimer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Stewart et al., 2011b</a>). The precise mechanism for shutdown is yet to be determined."

Light and electron microscopy studies clearly show that it is recruited to a subset of CME events in human cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Merrifield et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Collins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2012</a>) and that it is important for internalisation of pathogens such as Listeria (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bonazzi et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, the requirement for actin in CME may be linked to membrane tension. Recent work has shown that in cells where membrane tension is increased, there is an increased requirement for actin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boulant et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Stachowiak et al., 2013</a>). During mitosis the plasma membrane tension is increased as a result of osmotic changes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stewart et al., 2011a</a>), so why is the actin cytoskeleton not deployed to assist CME as occurs in interphase cells?"

We began by verifying this observation in HeLa cells. To measure apparent membrane tension, a polystyrene bead coated with concanavalin A was held in an optical trap, attached to the plasma membrane, and then pulled away from the cell surface to form a membrane tether (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dai and Sheetz, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The displacement of the bead from the trap centre is the tether force and this is proportional to the plasma membrane tension (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We found that the tether force was increased from 19.2 \u00b1 1.5 pN in interphase cells to 27 \u00b1 2.8 pN in mitotic cells at metaphase (mean \u00b1 SEM, p=0.027, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These measurements are in good agreement with previous measurements in other cell types (<a href=\"#bib37\">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</a>). Tether force is related to the force required to invaginate a clathrin-coated vesicle. This means that, in mitotic cells, comparatively more energy is required from the CME machinery as it tries to overcome an increased load. The shortfall in this energy may explain mitotic shutdown of CME and the question is: what is the molecular basis of this shortfall?"

                                "text": "Clathrin-coated structures (CCSs, pits, and vesicles) are present in mitotic cells with the pits being arrested at the cell surface in a shallow state (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pypaert et al., 1987</a>). Fluorescent transferrin binding to abundant transferrin receptors on the plasma membrane can be seen in these pits but the uptake of transferrin is prevented (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fielding et al., 2012</a>). Our hypothesis was that differences in the proteomes of CCSs purified from interphase or mitotic cells would explain why clathrin-coated pits are arrested at the surface. For example, components of the CME machinery that are regulated might be present in interphase CCSs but could be less abundant in mitotic CCSs. To identify such differences, we prepared fractions enriched in CCSs from interphase or mitotic HeLa cells, according to established methods (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borner et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2012</a>). These fractions were analysed by mass spectrometry and label-free quantitation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Over four independent experiments, we compared the relative abundance of 1253 proteins, only a subset of which are confirmed CCS proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borner et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2012</a>). The list of all abundances was used to characterise the variance of the dataset and identify outliers (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We found that cortactin was the protein most consistently reduced in mitotic CCSs compared to interphase (LFQ intensity ratio = 46.2). Cortactin is an activator of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerisation. A list of bona fide CCS proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borner et al., 2012</a>) was therefore supplemented with components of the actin cytoskeleton that are recruited to CCSs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>). The relative abundance of these proteins is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>. These data show that most of the core CME machinery is not altered significantly between CCS-containing fractions from interphase and mitotic samples. Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chetrit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kozik et al., 2013</a>), Dab2 was less abundant and PICALM more abundant in mitotic fractions. HIP1 and HIP1R appeared to be differentially regulated. These two proteins link the clathrin machinery with the actin cytoskeleton and are regulated by binding clathrin light chain (<a href=\"#bib27\">Le Clainche et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wilbur et al., 2008</a>). The accumulation of HIP1R and the absence of cortactin in mitotic fractions were interesting, given that these two proteins have been shown previously to be coupled functionally (<a href=\"#bib27\">Le Clainche et al., 2007</a>). Other interesting differences, to be explored in the future, included the accumulation of NSF (N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor) in mitotic CCSs (LFQ intensity ratio = 0.077)."

Quantification of transferrin uptake demonstrated that with either of two independent siRNAs against Ect2, the mitotic shutdown of CME was reversed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>).

Note that there was no evidence of restarting CME in control mitotic cells treated with latrunculin B (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). This argues against the possibility that the remodelled actin cortex in mitotic cells directly inhibits CME, as its destruction by the drug did not result in endocytosis. These experiments show that restored CME in mitotic cells is different to CME in interphase cells: it is strictly actin-dependent.

Rap1 is an activator of \u03b21-, \u03b22- or \u03b23-containing integrins that connect to the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). At mitosis onset, Rap1 is normally inactivated, allowing the disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibres, resulting in cell rounding (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dao et al., 2009</a>). Expression of Rap1(Q63E), but not the inactive mutant Rap1(S17A), causes mitotic cells to remain flat and unable to form a rounded actin cortex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dao et al., 2009</a>).

Second, the effect could be rescued by expression of an siRNA resistant form of cortactin in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This demonstrates that \u2018restarted\u2019 CME in mitotic cells is different from CME in interphase: it is dependent on cortactin, a protein that was lost from mitotic CCSs in our proteomic analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

Inhibition of actin function by latrunculin B or cortactin RNAi demonstrate that CME in mitotic cells requires actin and that Ect2 RNAi or Rap1(Q63E)-expression permit the utilisation of actin to restore CME.

Our observations, that mitotic cells are competent for CME if the actin cytoskeleton is made available, runs counter to this hypothesis. We first tested if mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins was maintained in cells with restored CME. We analysed the phosphorylation status of Dab2 by western blotting. Dab2 is a clathrin adaptor for cargo proteins with an NPXY endocytic motif (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mishra et al., 2002</a>) and it is known to be phosphorylated in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib23\">He et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chetrit et al., 2011</a>). <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows that Dab2 is phosphorylated in mitosis and that this phosphorylation can be reversed by brief treatment of mitotic cells with the Cdk1 inhibitor flavopiridol (5 \u00b5M, 10 min) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Losiewicz et al., 1994</a>). An identical situation was seen in lysates from cells expressing GFP-Rap1(Q63E) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This suggests that CME of proteins with NPXY motifs can occur (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) despite maintained mitotic phosphorylation of Dab2 by Cdk1. Secondly, we tested whether inhibition of Cdk1 was sufficient to restart CME. Such restarting would be expected if mitotic phosphorylation inhibited the CME machinery directly. To do this, CME was measured using transferrin uptake and flow cytometry. The brief incubation of mitotic cells with flavopiridol (5 or 10 \u00b5M) did not restart CME. Together, these results indicate that the direct mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins cannot account for mitotic shut down of CME. It remains possible that phosphorylation of endocytic proteins may have a more minor, modulatory role in mitotic shutdown of CME, but we found no evidence that phosphorylation of the CME machinery renders it inactive. Moreover, it should be noted that cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity orchestrates mitosis and therefore drives the changes that result in the inhibition of CME at a higher level."

Membrane tension is elevated in mitotic cells and presents a challenge to the CME machinery: it now requires the assistance of actin to overcome this tension and internalise receptors. A proteomic survey revealed a comparative loss of cortactin from mitotic CCSs, implicating the actin cytoskeleton as being key to the inhibition. We showed that mitotic shutdown of CME can be cancelled either by the loss of Ect2 or by constitutive activation of Rap1, two manipulations that increase actin availability by affecting the formation of a rounded actin cortex in mitotic cells. Restored CME under these conditions was uniquely sensitive to latrunculin B-treatment or cortactin-depletion, respectively. This agrees with the idea that the actin cytoskeleton is required for CME in mitotic cells, but it is normally unavailable due to the formation of the cortex. The unmet actin requirement for CME in mitosis is shown schematically in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."

The forces of CME, actin and membrane tension are represented as green, red and blue arrows, respectively. In mitosis, the membrane tension is increased and actin is required to assist CME, but it is also unavailable due to the formation of the actin cortex. Increasing actin availability, either by Ect2-depletion or expression of Rap1(Q63E), can restore CME in mitotic cells. The membrane tension remains high, but actin is available to assist CME by providing additional force. If the actin cytoskeleton is considered to be a component of the endocytic machinery then its unavailability can be regarded as being due to a \u2018moonlighting\u2019 function in the formation of a rounded cortex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Royle, 2013</a>)."

The first layer of inhibition comes from an increase in membrane tension, mainly due to osmotic changes in mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stewart et al., 2011a</a>). In interphase cells, CME can overcome such increases in membrane tension by recruiting the actin cytoskeleton to assist in force production (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boulant et al., 2011</a>). However, in mitotic cells, the cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rounded actin cortex and is thus unavailable to assist the CME machinery. This lack of actin availability represents a second layer of inhibition. Local nucleation of actin could therefore provide an override mechanism for receptor internalisation in mitotic cells. Recently, F-actin-dependent internalisation of the EGF receptor has been described (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vehlow et al., 2013</a>) and this may explain how the EGF receptor can be internalised in mitotic cells albeit with delayed kinetics (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). An interesting question for the future is how the CME machinery senses increased membrane tension in order to engage the actin cytoskeleton."

This arrested \u223c80% of cells in mitosis and nine plates of mitotic cells were prepared vs seven plates for interphase.

Each lane was cut into 32 slices and then digested with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptide mixtures in 0.05% trifluoracetic acid were analyzed by nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, UK), coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer with a Proxeon nano-electrospray source. A 5 \u03bcl sample of the digest was injected into a BEH-C18 symmetry trapping column (Waters) in 0.1% formic acid at 15 \u03bcl/min before being resolved on a 25 cm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm BEH-C18 column (Waters), in a 1\u201362.5% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid, with a flow rate of 400 nl/min. Full scan MS spectra (<i>m/z</i> 300\u20132000) were generated at 30,000 resolution, and the top five most intense ions were fragmented and subjected to MS/MS in the linear quadrapole ion trap. Ions were fragmented using collision-induced dissociation (collision energy 35%, 30 ms). All spectra were acquired using Xcalibur software (version 2.0.7). RAW files were analysed using MaxQuant version 1.2.7.4 and searched against the Human IPI database, v.3.77. The proteingroups.txt file from a combined MaxQuant analysis of all four experimental runs was used to calculate the interphase/mitotic ratio of LFQ values for each protein (<a href=\"#bib50\">Waanders et al., 2009</a>). A Log2 transformation of each ratio was taken and used to construct a frequency histogram to which a Gaussian function was fitted to find the mean and variance of the entire dataset, and identify outliers (\u00b5 \u00b1 2\u03c3). MaxQuant detected the same outliers when each experiment was analysed individually. Excluded from the graph are proteins whose LFQ value for either interphase or mitosis was 0. This could be due to total loss of the protein or poor detection. The following proteins had large LFQ scores (&gt;1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>) in one sample but 0 in the other and may therefore represent genuine CCS proteins that are only present in interphase (EPN1, HEXB, CTSC, NUMB) or in mitosis (CFL2, CLTCL1)."

After 6 hr, 800 \u00b5l full DMEM was added to the cells and incubated overnight. This ensured good attachment of cells and a clean, dry surface on the underside of the glass."

This gave 20 \u00b5g of protein per 1 mg of microparticle. For trapping experiments, the bead solution was diluted (1:20) in full DMEM. A microchamber was created by sealing a small cover glass over the slide on which the cells were grown using high vacuum grease (Apiezon). Bead suspension (10 \u00b5l) was introduced by capillary action and the microchamber was mounted onto a custom-made optical trap microscope, described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carter and Cross, 2005</a>). The stiffness of the optical trap was calibrated for each experiment, typically \u223c0.3 pN/nm. A single bead was captured and held on the cell surface at a distance of 4\u20138 \u00b5m from the substrate, for several seconds. The bead was then pulled away, forming a membrane tether (&gt;10 \u00b5m length), by moving the microscope stage under computer control at a constant velocity. The displacement of the bead in the optical trap (and thus tether force) was measured using a quadrant detector at 5\u201320 kHz. Once the displacement was established, the cell was moved back towards the bead faster than the tether recovery rate to provide a zero force reference (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The cell was then moved back away and tether force was re-established. Tension values were taken from a 1 s averaged before stage manipulation. All measurements were taken less than 30 s after tether formation, because actin polymerisation into the tether introduced inconsistent measurements in older tethers. Measurements from multiple tethers pulled from the same cell indicated high reproducibility and showed that a single force measurement was representative of the membrane tension of that cell. Occasionally, double tethers visible in DIC were pulled by a single bead and these gave a twofold increase in tether force from the same cell. Data from double tethers were not included here."

Interphase cells were growing asynchronously and harvested by trypsinisation. The cells were spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in serum free DMEM, and this step was repeated. For the mitotic samples, 100 ng/ml nocodazole was added to prevent progression through mitosis. After 20 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C, flavopiridol was added for a further 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were moved to ice for 2 min then Alexa488-conjugated transferrin (50 \u00b5g/ml dilution) added on ice for 5 min. Uptake was allowed for 7 min at 37\u00b0C. Then, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in acid wash buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. After a second acid wash, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1% (wt/vol) BSA/PBS. Finally, the samples were analysed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson). The forward scatter channel (FSC) was gated at 200 in order to exclude all particles smaller than cells from analysis. The side scatter channel (SSC) was adjusted to 320 V and the fluorescent channel (FL1) to 385 V. The geometric mean of FL1 was used for the graphs."
