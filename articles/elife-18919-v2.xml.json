However, systematic screening for epigenetic regulators is challenging and often relies on laborious assays or indirect reporter read-outs. Here we describe a strategy, Epi-ID, to directly assess chromatin status in thousands of mutants. In Epi-ID, chromatin status on DNA barcodes is interrogated by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing, allowing for quantitative comparison of many mutants in parallel. Screening of a barcoded yeast knock-out collection for regulators of histone H3K79 methylation by Dot1 identified all known regulators as well as novel players and processes. These include histone deposition, homologous recombination, and adenosine kinase, which influences the methionine cycle. Gcn5, the acetyltransferase within the SAGA complex, was found to regulate histone methylation and H2B ubiquitination. The concept of Epi-ID is widely applicable and can be readily applied to other chromatin features."

However, systematic screening for epigenetic regulators is challenging and often relies on laborious assays or indirect reporter read-outs. Here we describe a strategy, Epi-ID, to directly assess chromatin status in thousands of mutants. In Epi-ID, chromatin status on DNA barcodes is interrogated by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing, allowing for quantitative comparison of many mutants in parallel. Screening of a barcoded yeast knock-out collection for regulators of histone H3K79 methylation by Dot1 identified all known regulators as well as novel players and processes. These include histone deposition, homologous recombination, and adenosine kinase, which influences the methionine cycle. Gcn5, the acetyltransferase within the SAGA complex, was found to regulate histone methylation and H2B ubiquitination. The concept of Epi-ID is widely applicable and can be readily applied to other chromatin features."

H3K79 is methylated by Dot1/DOT1L. Human DOT1L is important in a subset of leukemias that express an MLL fusion protein caused by rearrangements of the MLL gene (MLL-r) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). DOT1L inhibitors have been developed and are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of MLL-r leukemia (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stein and Tallman, 2015</a>). DOT1L has also been implicated in other cancers, and it has a role in normal development and cellular reprogramming (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib47\">McLean et al. (2014)</a> and <a href=\"#bib51\">Nguyen and Zhang (2011)</a>). Furthermore, Dot1 plays a role in meiotic checkpoint activation and the DNA damage response (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nguyen and Zhang, 2011</a>). Interestingly, the exact mechanism of action of H3K79 methylation remains poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib75\">Vlaming and van Leeuwen, 2016</a>). The discovery of the important roles of H3K79 methylation has spiked an interest in the regulation of this modification. Both H3K79 methylation and the Dot1(L) enzyme are conserved from budding yeast to humans. Although some regulators, such as MLL fusion partners AF9 and AF10, are specific to DOT1L, other regulators are conserved throughout evolution (<a href=\"#bib75\">Vlaming and van Leeuwen, 2016</a>). The best-characterized regulatory pathway is a trans-histone cross-talk: ubiquitination of H2B by Bre1 in yeast or RNF20/40 in mammals promotes H3K79 methylation (<a href=\"#bib78\">Weake and Workman, 2008</a>). Other H3K79 methylation regulators may yet be discovered and could be potential new drug targets in diseases in which DOT1L has been implicated."

Thus far, systematic analysis of chromatin regulatory mechanisms has been challenging; the available techniques are either laborious or indirect (see discussion). Here we describe a screening strategy to identify chromatin regulators in a quantitative, systematic, and high-throughput manner using a direct read-out of the chromatin status in mutant libraries. In this method, which we call Epi-ID, chromatin status on DNA barcodes in the yeast genome is directly interrogated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on a pool of cells and read out by parallel deep sequencing. With the Epi-ID protocol, it is possible to screen thousands of strains for effects on a chromatin feature of interest."

Finally, the histone acetyltransferase module in the SAGA complex was identified as an H3K79me regulator and subsequently shown to regulate H2B ubiquitination and other downstream methylation marks, probably through the stability of the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp8, which is also a member of the SAGA complex."

When counted by high-throughput sequencing, they yield quantitative information. Classically, collections of barcoded yeast knock-out strains have been used for competitive growth assays, e.g. to find genes that mediate drug toxicity or resistance (<a href=\"#bib31\">Giaever and Nislow, 2014</a>). Here we take advantage of a yeast collection with barcodes in the genomic DNA, and thus packaged into chromatin, and use the barcodes to report on chromatin modification status or binding events. By performing ChIP on pools of barcoded cells and counting the abundance of the barcodes by high-throughput sequencing, the relative enrichment of each barcode can be determined. Since each barcode corresponds to a gene deletion, the enrichment of the barcode reports on the effect of the gene deletion on the abundance of the chromatin feature assessed by ChIP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We have successfully tested this concept previously in combination with the recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) assay to find regulators of histone turnover in a small set of candidates (<a href=\"#bib74\">Verzijlbergen et al., 2011</a>). Now, we modified the technique such that it is applicable to screening the complete set of non-essential knock outs and applied Epi-ID to find regulators of H3K79 methylation by Dot1."

Dashed lines indicate estimated levels of H3K79 methylation at the loci tested in the qPCR. HML, a silent mating type locus, has very low levels of methylation, the two promoters have intermediate levels and the two ORFs have high levels of methylation. HO promoter and HO terminator have a low to intermediate level of H3K79 methylation, both an increase and a decrease of methylation are possible, making these loci suitable for a regulator screen. (<b>D</b>) It is important to start the PCR with sufficient material to minimize jackpot effects. Scatter plots showing the correlation between barcode counts after a PCR starting with approximately 2500 copies per barcode (on the x axis), with barcode counts of PCRs on diluted sample. The correlation decreases with dilution, 250 copies per barcode seems to be sufficient to have minimal jackpot effect."

Barcoder strains (~1100) harbor two unique 20-base-pair barcodes at a common location. The barcodes are upstream (UpTag) and downstream (DownTag) of a selection marker (KanMX) integrated at a safe-harbor locus, the well-studied HO gene. We obtained a set of approximately 4300 strains, divided over five subsets with unique barcodes. With this new library, chromatin structure or modification status can be measured at a common locus in many knock-out strains, avoiding possible position effects of the integrated barcoded cassette. However, the UpTag and DownTag differ in their genomic contexts, being surrounded by promoters or terminators, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, the two barcode positions will give information on Dot1 regulation in different functional contexts."

Here it is important to consider Dot1\u2019s distributive mechanism of methylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Frederiks et al., 2008</a>). This distributive mode of action leads to a characteristic shift in methylation states with changing Dot1 activity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). With increasing Dot1 activity, H3K79me1 will first increase and then decrease, as it is being converted into higher methylation states. Around the barcodes, H3K79me1 was high and H3K79me3 was low compared to coding sequences; this intermediate level of H3K79 methylation was consistent with the intergenic location of the barcodes and indicated that they should be able to report increased as well as decreased Dot1 activity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

The E3 ligase Bre1 ubiquitinates histone H2B on lysine 123, thereby promoting Dot1 activity, and in a <i>bre1\u0394</i> strain H3K79 methylation is reduced (<a href=\"#bib78\">Weake and Workman, 2008</a>).

Positive regulators of H3K79 methylation were Rad6 and Lge1, which form the H2B ubiquitination complex together with Bre1 (<a href=\"#bib78\">Weake and Workman, 2008</a>), and Rtf1, which is part of the PAF transcription-elongation complex and recruits Bre1/Rad6 to chromatin of transcribed regions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Piro et al., 2012</a>). Ubp8 and its partners in the deubiquitinase (DUB) module of the SAGA complex (Sgf73, Sgf11 and Sus1) together deubiquitinate H2B and predominantly act at the 5\u2019 ends of transcribed regions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bonnet et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Morgan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schulze et al., 2011</a>). In the Epi-ID screen, deletion of the genes encoding these proteins led to increased methylation on the UpTag, but not on the DownTag, as expected given their respective promoter and terminator context. Notably, deletion of the other H2B DUB, <i>UBP10</i>, did not increase H3K79me on the barcodes, consistent with the observation that Ubp10 preferentially acts on telomeres (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gardner et al., 2005</a>). In summary, Epi-ID identified all established H3K79 methylation regulators acting via H2Bub in euchromatin."

No H3K79 demethylases are known (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sweet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zee et al., 2010</a>) and the Epi-ID screen provided no evidence of an H3K79 demethylase either. None of the genes with a known demethylase domain was found among the negative regulators (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given the likely absence of a demethylase, the main mechanism to counteract Dot1 activity may be dilution of methylated histones. This can occur by replication-independent turnover of histones (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</a>), or by dilution during S phase when the biggest influx of new histones occurs. A negative correlation between histone turnover and H3K79me3 level has been observed in genome-wide maps (<a href=\"#bib55\">Radman-Livaja et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Weiner et al., 2015</a>). Based on these observations and computational modeling, it has been proposed that slow-growing cells accumulate more H3K79 methylation (<a href=\"#bib18\">De Vos et al., 2011</a>). To test this hypothesis without having to change temperature or carbon source, we used barcode-seq to derive growth rates for each of the knock-out clones in the pool of cells (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and determined the relation between growth rate and H3K79me level. As a single score for H3K79 methylation level, we used the H3K79me3/H3K79me1 ratio. This score was very robust, with a Pearson correlation of 0.89 between two screens. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows a negative correlation between the growth rate and the H3K79 methylation score on both UpTag and DownTag (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.4) and methylation was significantly higher for the slow growers than for the remainder of the yeast strains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

The expected shift was based on the linear model fitting the data (the red line in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The robust top outliers based on this growth-corrected methylation score are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. Rtt109 was one of the strongest negative regulators of H3K79 methylation on the UpTag (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and high H3K79 methylation upon deletion of <i>RTT109</i> could be validated by ChIP-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Rtt109 is a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates newly synthesized histone H3 on lysine 56 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Driscoll et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Han et al., 2007</a>). Through this activity, Rtt109 promotes histone transport and nucleosome assembly (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dahlin et al., 2015</a>). <i>RTT109</i> deletion directly leads to decreased turnover at \u2018hot\u2019 nucleosomes, mostly found in promoters (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dion et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kaplan et al., 2008</a>). The fact that Rtt109 was one of the strongest negative regulators of H3K79me at the UpTag, i.e. in a promoter region, indicates that histone turnover is an important determinant of the H3K79me level. Altogether, these data support the idea that no H3K79 demethylase is active in yeast and show that the deposition of new histones (replication-coupled or -independent) is an important mechanism to counteract H3K79 methylation."

The DownTag score of the <i>nat1\u0394</i> strain was filtered out in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> based on its variation between replicates, but it was a positive regulator as well. Ard1 has been reported to promote H2Bub and specifically H3K79me3, but the role of Nat1 remained uncertain (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takahashi et al., 2011</a>). We confirmed the effect of Ard1 on H2B ubiquitination and H3K79 methylation, and found an identical effect for Nat1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Also H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 were decreased in <i>nat1\u0394</i> and <i>ard1\u0394</i> strains, and again the effect was partial compared to the <i>bre1\u0394</i> strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). H3K4me3 is known to depend on H2B ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dover et al., 2002</a>), but the decrease in H3K36me3 we observed in the <i>bre1\u0394</i> strain was not reported before. We confirmed the decrease in H3K36me3 in the absence of H2B ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and observed that H3K36me2 was not affected. We conclude that the NatA complex is required for a normal H2Bub level and thereby promotes all downstream methylation events. Notably, that NatA acts upstream of Dot1 is in agreement with our previous observation that NatA and Dot1 act in the same silencing pathway (<a href=\"#bib73\">van Welsem et al., 2008</a>)."

This was expected based on the reaction scheme shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, and is in agreement with the lower histone H3 methylation levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), since SAH is a known inhibitor of methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib26\">Etchegaray and Mostoslavsky, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Richon et al., 2011</a>). However, SAM levels increased by as much as 75-fold, causing an unexpected 4-fold increase of the SAM/SAH ratio. The increase in SAM levels may be caused by a global inhibition of methyltransferases by excess SAH and therefore reduced SAM usage, or by compensatory mechanisms such as altered expression of methionine biosynthesis genes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kanai et al., 2013</a>). Although the SAM/SAH ratio is often considered to determine the activity of methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib26\">Etchegaray and Mostoslavsky, 2016</a>), our findings suggest that the absolute levels of SAH and SAM are also important."

CLIK is based on the notion that the rate of interactions among true positives in a screen is higher than for a random set of genes. The algorithm indeed identified many genetic and/or physical interactions between genes at both the low methylation and high methylation ends of the data, for both UpTag and DownTag (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and determined cutoffs based on the points in the rank list where interaction density dropped. The groups defined in this way were considered candidate regulators."

First, the built-in complex enrichment analysis in the CLIK tool identified enriched complexes in all groups of candidate regulators (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Few new complexes were identified among the positive regulators, so we focused our attention on the negative regulators. Strikingly, of the enriched complexes on the UpTag, Mms22-Rtt101-Mms1, Slx5-Slx8, and Rad51-Rad57 were all involved in DNA repair, specifically at replication forks (see below) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Branzei et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Costes and Lambert, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Duro et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Su et al., 2015</a>). Second, we used PANTHER (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mi et al., 2016</a>) to identify processes enriched among the candidate negative regulators at the UpTag (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). With the exception of two very general terms, all enriched GO processes fall into the DNA repair category. The highest enrichment scores were found for double-strand break (DSB) repair via homologous recombination (HR) and its parent recombinational repair (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

Slx5 and Slx8 form a heterodimeric SUMO-targeted Ubiquitin Ligase complex (StUbL) that is required to maintain genomic stability (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nagai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Xie et al., 2007</a>). Strains lacking Slx5 or Slx8 grow very slowly due to the amplification of endogenous 2\u00b5 circles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>), so we first relieved the growth defect of these strains by curing them (and a wild-type control) of the 2\u00b5 plasmid (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Because the substrates of the Slx5/Slx8 StUbL complex largely overlap with those of the SUMO ligase Mms21 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albuquerque et al., 2013</a>), we also generated a strain in which the SUMO ligase activity of Mms21 was compromised (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhao and Blobel, 2005</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, ChIP-qPCR showed an increase in methylation at the HO promoter, near the UpTag, in both <i>slx8\u0394</i> and <i>mms21\u0394C</i>, implicating the SUMO-ubiquitin pathway in regulating H3K79 methylation. A small global increase in methylation was observed in these strains by mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting that the effect was not limited to the barcode regions."

However, also in untreated cells homologous recombination is needed to restart replication forks that have stalled or collapsed, for instance at structure-forming sequences or replication-fork barriers (<a href=\"#bib15\">Costes and Lambert, 2012</a>). Mms22, Rtt101 and Mms1 (of which Rtt101 was not in the dataset) form a Cul4-like E3 ubiquitin ligase that sits at replication forks and promotes restart of stalled forks, presumably through homologous recombination (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buser et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vaisica et al., 2011</a>). Rad52 and its partners are central players in homologous recombination, also at replication forks (<a href=\"#bib15\">Costes and Lambert, 2012</a>). The Slx5 and Slx8 StUbL complex and Mms21 promote translocation of DNA breaks and collapsed replication forks to nuclear pores (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Horigome et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Su et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, also the nuclear pore component required for this translocation, Nup84 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Su et al., 2015</a>), was identified as a negative regulator of H3K79me in the Epi-ID screen. At the pore, Slx5/8 modulate homologous recombination by targeting protein substrates for degradation, including Rad52 itself (<a href=\"#bib64\">Su et al., 2015</a>). Other factors from the process of HR-mediated DSB repair that were among the negative regulators (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) include Sgs1, which also facilitates re-initiation of stalled replication forks (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashton and Hickson, 2010</a>), and Ctf4, which tethers Mms22 to the replisome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buser et al., 2016</a>). Taken together, among the second-level regulators of H3K79me are many factors required to allow recovery of stalled replication forks. This suggests that this process regulates H3K79me, either because the repair itself counteracts methylation or inhibits Dot1, or because unrepaired collapsed replication forks lead to accumulation of H3K79 methylation."

However, H2Bub levels were not increased (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), and neither was Dot1 expression (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Unraveling the mechanism of this regulation will require further studies. Another interesting point is the function of this regulation. Dot1 has been shown to function in several DNA repair pathways; it mediates checkpoint activation and recombinational repair after UV damage, and represses translesion synthesis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Conde and San-Segundo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rossodivita et al., 2014</a>). Dot1 has not yet been studied in the context of replication fork stalling, but our finding that H3K79 methylation is regulated in this context warrants further investigations. Finally, since homologues of all involved proteins can be found in mammals, it will be interesting to see if also the described H3K79me regulation is conserved."

These not only included subunits of the deubiquitinase (DUB) module, but also subunits of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module. Indeed, Gcn5 and its partners in the HAT module, Ada2 and Ngg1 (Ada3), were among the strongest negative regulators (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). No data was obtained on Sgf29, the last SAGA HAT module subunit. The specificity these factors showed for the UpTag is not surprising given the activity of Gcn5 at promoters (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bonnet et al., 2014</a>). Mass spectrometry measurements demonstrated that the effect of Gcn5 was not limited to the UpTag, since a <i>gcn5\u0394</i> strain also had more H3K79me3 and less H3K79me1 globally (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To investigate the role of Gcn5 in more detail, we analyzed the behavior of a specific point mutant, Gcn5-F221A. This mutant protein has previously been shown to be catalytically inactive (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kuo et al., 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Lanza et al., 2012</a>). To allow for a direct, quantitative, and sensitive comparison, we performed a custom-designed Epi-ID experiment with a set of <i>gcn5\u0394</i> strains with single-copy plasmids. In contrast to wild-type Gcn5, the Gcn5-F221A mutant was not able to rescue the knock-out phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>). This finding suggests that H3K79me regulation by Gcn5 depends on its catalytic activity. However, it cannot be excluded that the F221A mutation acts by other mechanisms such as disrupting nucleosome binding or altering the stability of Gcn5."

Since Gcn5 is found in the SAGA complex, just like the H2Bub DUB Ubp8, we wondered if Gcn5 could function through H2B ubiquitination. Indeed, <i>gcn5\u0394</i> strains were found to have significantly more H2Bub on the UpTag than wild-type strains, and this was also the case for cells expressing the inactive Gcn5-F221A protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The effect of Gcn5 on the H2Bub level at this locus was comparable to the effect of Ubp8 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Since H2Bub levels were affected, we also tested the effect on H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 in the custom Epi-ID experiment and found both to be increased in the absence of Gcn5 acetyltransferase activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, at the UpTag we found the activity of Gcn5 to negatively regulate H2B ubiquitination and, probably through its ubiquitination effect, methylation of H3K4, H3K36 and H3K79."

Indeed, acetylation on one of the DUB module components has been reported (<a href=\"#bib35\">Henriksen et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, interactions between the HAT module and the DUB module have also been observed by independent approaches in yeast and human (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atanassov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Durand et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Han et al., 2014</a>). To investigate this further, we examined the expression of H2Bub regulators and observed that Ubp8 protein expression was significantly decreased in the absence of Gcn5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013G</a>). A reduction in Ubp8 protein level was also observed in chromatin fractions (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E</a>). Thus, the lower Ubp8 levels can at least in part explain the observed change in H2Bub in <i>gcn5\u0394</i> cells. These findings suggest that Gcn5 is required for Ubp8 stability, potentially by regulating the association with its partners in the SAGA DUB module. Taken together, we identified the SAGA HAT as a negative regulator of H3K79 methylation, and then discovered that it regulates H2B ubiquitination and subsequent methylation events on three lysine residues on histone H3, at least in part by maintaining Ubp8 protein expression. The sensitivity of the Epi-ID technique allowed for identification of this regulatory mechanism, even though the global effects are small and previously went unnoticed (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). Our finding that the SAGA HAT module regulates the DUB, together with the finding that the DUB module regulates HAT activity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Han et al., 2014</a>), suggests that the two activities in the SAGA complex are highly interactive, despite being organized in distinct modules."

Second, Epi-ID is a direct method, in contrast to reporter gene assays that have been used to read out chromatin changes (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rossmann et al., 2011</a>). Third, it is a very sensitive method that is able to pick up differences that cannot be detected by immunoblot.

All known H3K79 methylation regulators were identified, as well as several new regulators. All tested candidate regulators could be validated on a global level and/or locally, by ChIP-qPCR. It is clear from our data that the well-studied H2Bub-H3K79me trans-histone cross-talk is the main Dot1 regulatory pathway. Not only the factors directly involved in H2B (de)ubiquitination were identified as regulators of\u00a0H3K79 methylation, also new H2Bub modulators were discovered. One of these was Gcn5, which is responsible for the HAT activity in SAGA and was found to negatively regulate H3 methylation and H2Bub, at least in part by maintaining Ubp8 protein abundance. No candidate H3K79 demethylase was identified and histone deposition was found to negatively regulate H3K79\u00a0methylation, supporting the hypothesis that in the absence of a demethylase histone dilution is the main mechanism to counteract Dot1 activity. Several proteins involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination were scored as negative regulators of Dot1 activity, particularly proteins required for the recovery of stalled replication forks through recombination. Finally, there are several candidate regulators that we have not yet studied further. These factors may regulate Dot1 indirectly, through one of the mechanisms described above, or through a yet to be discovered mechanism. Especially for these uncharacterized candidates, indirect effects of gene knock-outs on neighboring genes should also be considered (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</a>). Future studies will be required to clarify the mechanisms of some of these regulators. The resource on Dot1 regulation presented here can be used as a starting point for such studies."

Combining barcode libraries with libraries of temperature sensitive alleles, histone mutants, or hypomorphic (DamP) alleles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ben-Aroya et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yan et al., 2008</a>) may lead to new insights into the contribution of essential genes in regulating chromatin structure and function. Dedicated, smaller custom libraries can also be made, as illustrated by the experiment testing the rescue potential of Gcn5-containing plasmids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In this case one indexed Epi-ID experiment was an efficient and robust alternative to performing multiple replicate ChIPs and qPCR analyses."

The only requirement for an Epi-ID experiment is that a ChIP against the chromatin feature of interest can pull down one or both of the barcoded regions at the HO locus. We envision that it will be feasible to generate a library of clones with barcodes at a locus of interest in the near future, which would eliminate this limitation. Such strategies will allow for determining the regulome of many other chromatin features and investigating the cross-talk between the different networks."

The basic requirement is that mutants can be uniquely identified by a chromatinized DNA sequence, which is the case in shRNA, CRISPR and CRISPRi libraries when the genetic elements to inactivate genes are integrated in the genome (e.g. <a href=\"#bib27\">Evers et al., 2016</a>). With the recent developments in genome targeting and editing, tools are becoming available to integrate barcoded libraries at a common locus to avoid position effects.

The five plates of the collection were treated separately until after the PCR. The five plates were grown on rich media for one night and cells were scraped off and pooled in liquid media in the morning. The cultures were grown for 4\u20135 hr until in log phase and cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde, washed and harvested. Chromatin was prepared essentially as in <a href=\"#bib76\">Vlaming et al. (2014)</a>, in the presence of SDS for H3C and methyl ChIPs, but sonication of chromatin from\u00a0~5E9 cells in 1.5 mL was done in 15 mL tubes. The ChIP was also performed as in <a href=\"#bib76\">Vlaming et al. (2014)</a>, using polyclonal antibodies against H3K79me1, H3K79me3 and the H3 C terminus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Frederiks et al., 2008</a>). In the small-scale Epi-ID experiments, also antibodies against H3K4me3 (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_306649\">AB_306649</a>, lot GR273043-1) and H3K36me3 (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_306966\">AB_306966</a>, lot GF260274-1) were used, as well as an H2BK123ub antibody that will be described elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). The UpTag and DownTag were amplified separately from the purified DNA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The scale of each Epi-ID experiment was chosen such that on average an estimated number of 250 copies of each barcode was present in each PCR reaction to minimize jackpot effects (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The forward primer (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTCGCTCTTCCGATCTAGATGTCCACGAGGTCTCT/AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTCCGATCTACGGTGTCGGTCTCGTAG for UpTag/DownTag) introduced the Illumina P5 sequence and extra nucleotides for annealing of the 5\u2019 end of the custom sequencing primers. With the reverse primer (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGANNNNNNGTCGACCTGCAGCGTACG/CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGANNNNNNAACGAGCTCGAATTCATCGA for UpTag/DownTag) the Illumina P7 sequence was introduced, as well as a 6-base-pair index. The uniquely barcoded amplicons were then mixed equimolarly and purified from an agarose gel with a size selection of 100\u2013150 bp. The purified DNA was sequenced (single read,\u00a0&gt;50 bp) on a HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with High Output Run Mode, using a mix of custom sequencing primers for the UpTag and DownTag (CGCTCTTCCGATCTAGATGTCCACGAGGTCTCT/ ACACTCTTCCGATCTACGGTGTCGGTCTCGTAG). Since the above-mentioned primer sequences were not compatible with paired-end flow cells, the oligonucleotide sequences were slightly altered (see <a href=\"#SD14-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>) to sequence small-scale Epi-ID experiments on a MiSeq (Illumina)."

Growth rates that gave a goodness of fit of\u00a0&lt;0.95 were discarded. Growth rates were calculated using data of the UpTag and DownTag separately, and these values were averaged. A few cases were removed, where different rates were calculated for the UpTag and DownTag (c.o.v.\u00a0&gt;0.2). Finally, the growth rates calculated for two independent experiments were averaged. To create a growth-corrected H3K79 methylation score, the log2-transformed me3/me1 value expected based on the fitness of the strain was subtracted from the original log2-transformed me3/me1 value.

Label-free quantification was achieved by comparing the area of each methylation state to the sum of the areas of all methylation states. As the four different peptides have slightly different physicochemical properties and thus might have slightly different ionization efficiencies in the mass spectrometer, final peptide intensities were corrected using a relative response factor to obtain more accurate results. The relative response factor was obtained by measuring the peak areas of the four differently methylated peptide standards from an equimolar mixture and dividing peptide areas by the area of the unmethylated peptide."

The Epi-ID method allows pools of individual mutants, each carrying a specific integrated barcode, to be probed by ChIP. Deep sequencing of the barcodes in the precipitated samples allows quantitative assessment of the effects of a given mutation on the chromatin parameter, in this case H3K79me1 and H3K79me3. In addition to the genes previously known to regulate H3K79 methylation, either directly or indirectly, the authors identify novel genes including the Gcn5 acetyltransferase, N-terminal acetyltransferases, genes that regulate replication fork recovery, and enzymes involved in S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and SAH biosynthesis. The manuscript also makes a strong case that there is no H3K79 demethylase, with the caveat that essential strains were not tested. Overall, the reviewers found the Epi-ID method to have strong potential for identifying novel genes impacting methylation that could be readily extended to other chromatin modifications for which the appropriate antibodies are available. However, a more thorough exploration of some of the hits would make a stronger case of the utility of the approach."

However, Ubp8 protein levels are reduced in the gcn5 deletion strain, indicating that the defect in H2B deubiquitylation is a consequence of the loss of the SAGA subunit, Ubp8, rather than regulation of its catalytic activity. The authors show that a mutant of Gcn5, F221A, has a phenotype comparable to the deletion; however, F221 forms hydrophobic interactions with multiple buried residues, which raises the possibility that the strong effect of the F221A mutation results from destabilization of Gcn5, which would be predicted to lead to loss of Ubp8. To demonstrate that Gcn5 indeed regulates Ubp8 activity, as opposed to stabilizing its incorporation into SAGA, the authors should provide evidence that the levels of both Gcn5 and Ubp8 are unchanged when Gcn5 bears the F221A substitution. Without this result, the authors should soften their conclusions here. Should the authors wish to generate a bona fide Gcn5 catalytic mutant, substitution of the conserved catalytic E122 would be a better choice."

Briefly, it has been reported that both SAM and SAH levels are up in ado1d cells, but the extent of the SAH increase was not reported in previous studies. Therefore, it was not known how the SAM/SAH ratio was affected and the prediction would be that it would decrease, given where it acts on the methionine cycle. The SAM/SAH ratio is generally considered to represent the methylation potential in the cell, so also based on the reduced histone H3 methylation that we observed a reduction in the SAM/SAH ratio was expected. However, we found that the increase in SAM is actually larger than the increase and SAH, leading to a higher SAM/SAH ratio. Therefore, our results suggest that the SAM/SAH ratio cannot be taken as the sole determinant of methylation potential and that absolute levels of SAM and SAH should also be taken into consideration. We now discuss this more clearly in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection."

We discuss these results in the first paragraph of the subsection \u201cAdenosine kinase promotes histone methylation\u201d."

However, Ubp8 protein levels are reduced in the gcn5 deletion strain, indicating that the defect in H2B deubiquitylation is a consequence of the loss of the SAGA subunit, Ubp8, rather than regulation of its catalytic activity. The authors show that a mutant of Gcn5, F221A, has a phenotype comparable to the deletion; however, F221 forms hydrophobic interactions with multiple buried residues, which raises the possibility that the strong effect of the F221A mutation results from destabilization of Gcn5, which would be predicted to lead to loss of Ubp8. To demonstrate that Gcn5 indeed regulates Ubp8 activity, as opposed to stabilizing its incorporation into SAGA, the authors should provide evidence that the levels of both Gcn5 and Ubp8 are unchanged when Gcn5 bears the F221A substitution. Without this result, the authors should soften their conclusions here. Should the authors wish to generate a bona fide Gcn5 catalytic mutant, substitution of the conserved catalytic E122 would be a better choice.</i>"

In fact, we show that the level of Ubp8 is reduced in the absence of wild-type Gcn5, suggesting that the effect on H2Bub is indeed more likely to be mediated by altered Ubp8 levels rather than altered Ubp8 activity. To our knowledge, a role for Gcn5 in modulating Ubp8 stability has not been reported previously. To make this clearer and avoid any confusion, we adjusted the text, where we, for example, now explicitly mention that \u2018we examined the expression of H2Bub regulators and observed that Ubp8 showed a significant change in protein expression in the absence of Gcn5\u2026 A reduction in Ubp8 protein level was also observed in chromatin fractions\u2026 These findings suggest that Gcn5 is required for Ubp8 stability, potentially by regulating the association with its partners in the SAGA DUB module\u2019."

However, the reviewer is absolutely right that we cannot exclude that the mutation has additional effects on Gcn5 protein folding or stability, especially given the location of the F221 residue. We thank the reviewer for providing this expert insight and have made a few adjustments in the text (subsection \u201cThe SAGA HAT module negatively regulates histone methylation and H2B ubiquitination\u201d, first paragraph, and the Abstract, Introduction, fifth paragraph, and subsection \u201cThe SAGA HAT module negatively regulates histone methylation and H2B ubiquitination\u201d, second and fifth paragraphs) to discuss this possibility and soften our conclusions about the role of the catalytic activity. The main section now ends with \u2018This finding suggests that H3K79me regulation by Gcn5 depends on its catalytic activity. However, it cannot be excluded that the F221A mutation acts by other mechanisms such as altering nucleosome binding or the stability or protein folding of Gcn5.\u2019"
