To discover regulatory mechanisms in canonical WNT signaling, we conducted a systematic forward genetic analysis through reporter-based screens in haploid human cells. Comparison of screens for negative, attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling, mediators of R-spondin-dependent signaling and suppressors of constitutive signaling induced by loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli or casein kinase 1\u03b1 uncovered new regulatory features at most levels of the pathway. These include a requirement for the transcription factor AP-4, a role for the DAX domain of AXIN2 in controlling \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity, a contribution of glycophosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and glypicans to R-spondin-potentiated WNT signaling, and two different mechanisms that regulate signaling when distinct components of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex are lost. The conceptual and methodological framework we describe should enable the comprehensive understanding of other signaling systems."

For cell lines engineered using CRISPR/Cas9, when more than one clone was generated using the same CRISPR guide, the \u2018Clone Name\u2019 column indicates the generic name used throughout the manuscript to describe the genotype, and the \u2018Clone #\u2019 column identifies the specific allele in each individual clone. The \u2018CRISPR guide\u2019 column indicates the name of the guide used, which is the same as that of the oligos encoding sgRNAs (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). The \u2018Genomic Sequence\u2019 column shows 80 bases of genomic sequence (5\u2019 relative to the gene is to the left) surrounding the target site. For each group of clones made using the same CRISPR guide (separated by gray spacers), the \u2018Genomic Sequence\u2019 column is headlined by the reference WT genomic sequence (obtained from RefSeq), with the guide sequence colored blue. The site of the double strand cut made by Cas9 is between the two underlined bases. Sequencing results for individual clones are indicated below the reference sequence. Some WT clones are indicated as such and were used as controls. For mutant clones, mutated bases are colored red (dashes represent deleted bases, three dots are used to indicate that a deletion continues beyond the 80 bases of sequence shown, and large insertions are indicated in brackets), and the nature of the mutation, the resulting genotype (with the mutated amino acid number specified in parenthesis for selected clones) and any pertinent observations are also described. The figures in which each clone was used are also indicated. For the APC<sup>KO-2</sup> clone containing a GT insertion, the 80 bases of genomic sequence (5\u2019 relative to the gene is to the left) flanking the GT are shown in the \u2018Genomic Sequence\u2019 column. For double- or triple- mutant clones, the CRISPR guide or pair of guides used (if two different guides were used simultaneously to target adjacent sites in the same gene), the\u00a0genomic sequence, the\u00a0mutation, the\u00a0genotype and any\u00a0observations pertaining to each of the two or three targeted genes are designated \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 in the column headings, and are shown under green, orange and purple spacers, respectively."

To discover regulatory mechanisms in canonical WNT signaling, we conducted a systematic forward genetic analysis through reporter-based screens in haploid human cells. Comparison of screens for negative, attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling, mediators of R-spondin-dependent signaling and suppressors of constitutive signaling induced by loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli or casein kinase 1\u03b1 uncovered new regulatory features at most levels of the pathway. These include a requirement for the transcription factor AP-4, a role for the DAX domain of AXIN2 in controlling \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity, a contribution of glycophosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and glypicans to R-spondin-potentiated WNT signaling, and two different mechanisms that regulate signaling when distinct components of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex are lost. The conceptual and methodological framework we describe should enable the comprehensive understanding of other signaling systems."

For the unsorted cells, the number of GT insertions in genes (regardless of orientation) is indicated for the complete dataset and for each gene\u00a0(column\u00a0B). For the sorted cells, the number of inactivating GT insertions in genes (sense and antisense insertions in exons and sense insertions in introns), as well as the number of sense or antisense GT insertions in exons or in introns, is indicated for the complete dataset and for each gene\u00a0(columns\u00a0C-G). Three measures of GT insertion enrichment are shown: the <i>p</i>-value\u00a0and the FDR-corrected <i>p</i>-value (both derived from columns B and C), and the Intronic GT Insertion Orientation Bias (IGTIOB) score (derived from columns F and G).

For cell lines engineered using CRISPR/Cas9, when more than one clone was generated using the same CRISPR guide, the \u2018Clone Name\u2019 column indicates the generic name used throughout the manuscript to describe the genotype, and the \u2018Clone #\u2019 column identifies the specific allele in each individual clone. The \u2018CRISPR guide\u2019 column indicates the name of the guide used, which is the same as that of the oligos encoding sgRNAs (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). The \u2018Genomic Sequence\u2019 column shows 80 bases of genomic sequence (5\u2019 relative to the gene is to the left) surrounding the target site. For each group of clones made using the same CRISPR guide (separated by gray spacers), the \u2018Genomic Sequence\u2019 column is headlined by the reference WT genomic sequence (obtained from RefSeq), with the guide sequence colored blue. The site of the double strand cut made by Cas9 is between the two underlined bases. Sequencing results for individual clones are indicated below the reference sequence. Some WT clones are indicated as such and were used as controls.

Forward genetics in model organisms has been a general and unbiased way to identify new components in signaling pathways and to map their connectivity. However, since signaling pathways have often diverged between humans and these simpler model systems, their analysis in human cells becomes an important goal. Indeed, our ability to identify the best therapeutic strategy or to predict the effectiveness of drugs targeting specific proteins is often hampered by an incomplete understanding of signaling circuitry in human cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lito et al., 2013</a>). Recent methodological advances have enabled the interrogation of biological processes in human cells through powerful genome-wide screens that overcome many of the limitations associated with previous platforms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carette et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gilbert et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shalem et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2014</a>).

We took advantage of two methodologies to conduct a systematic genetic analysis of WNT signaling in human cells: forward genetics in haploid cells using gene trap (GT)-based insertional mutagenesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carette et al., 2009</a>), and targeted genome engineering by clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mali et al., 2013</a>)."

When the pathway is off, the transcriptional co-activator \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) is constitutively targeted for proteasomal degradation by the destruction complex, composed of the scaffold proteins adenomatous polyposis coli\u00a0(APC) and AXIN, and the kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1\u03b1\u00a0(CSNK1A1). The T-cell-specific transcription factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) family of transcription factors, together with transducin like enhancer of split (TLE) and histone deacetylases (HDAC), repress WNT target genes. Binding of WNT to its co-receptors frizzled (FZD) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) leads to the assembly of a receptor complex that inactivates the destruction complex through a mechanism involving recruitment of AXIN by LRP6 and the adapter protein dishevelled (DVL). Consequently, CTNNB1 accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus and promotes WNT target gene transcription in cooperation with TCF/LEF and other co-activators such as CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 protein (BCL9). R-spondins\u00a0(RSPOs) are secreted proteins that potentiate the response of stem cells to WNT ligands by blocking the degradation of FZD and LRP6 receptors. RSPO binds to leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) and neutralizes two transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, ZNRF3\u00a0and\u00a0RNF43, that clear WNT receptors from the cell surface. Other regulatory mechanisms include modulation of AXIN levels by the poly ADP-ribosylation-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146, and recruitment of DOT1L and MLLT10, two proteins involved in histone H3 K79 methylation, to WNT target genes.\u00a0(<b>B</b>) Schematic of WNT reporter-based forward genetic screens in haploid human cells using a GT-bearing retrovirus for mutagenesis, followed by phenotypic enrichment by FACS.

We identified many of the known core pathway components and found a new requirement for the transcription factor AP-4 (TFAP4). Unexpectedly, these screens uncovered a dominant allele of <i>AXIN2</i> that dissociated \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) protein stabilization, considered the decisive event in WNT signaling, from its transcriptional activity. To find factors required for amplification of WNT responses by R-spondins (RSPOs,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we devised a sensitized screen for RSPO-enhanced WNT signaling and uncovered a requirement for the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthetic machinery and glypicans. Finally, we searched for mutations that could suppress constitutive signaling in cells with compromised function of the CTNNB1 destruction complex, recapitulating the most common defect in oncogenic WNT signaling. Suppressor screens in cells lacking adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CSNK1A1), the two rate-limiting negative regulators of the pathway in haploid cells, revealed two distinct mechanisms that regulate CTNNB1 abundance and transcriptional\u00a0activity, respectively. One mechanism was specific to cells lacking CSNK1A1, but not APC, suggesting that different components of the destruction complex have different functions in WNT signaling beyond their common function controlling CTNNB1 protein abundance."

We adopted two design principles that exploited the flexibility of forward\u00a0genetics in cultured human cells. First, as a means of phenotypic enrichment, we chose a fluorescence-based, quantitative transcriptional reporter of WNT signaling. Since WNT reporter fluorescence is a continuous readout, in contrast to digital readouts such as cell viability or the presence or absence of a phenotype, it enabled us to enrich for cells with enhanced or reduced signaling phenotypes by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with complete flexibility on the stringency of selection. Second, all screens were performed in a pooled format following genome-scale insertional mutagenesis using a GT-bearing retrovirus, which contains a strong splice acceptor site and can therefore disrupt genes when it integrates in either exons or introns. This mutagenesis method is untargeted, distinguishing it from approaches in which short hairpin RNAs or single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) are designed to perturb a pre-defined set of cistrons."

While this construct has been used extensively to report on WNT responses, it may not mimic all endogenous regulatory sequences driving WNT target gene expression. In particular, the effects of proteins involved in modifying chromatin structure could differ between the reporter and endogenous target genes. Given these limitations, whenever possible we confirmed new regulatory mechanisms by measuring endogenous WNT target gene activity or assessing WNT-dependent phenotypes in model organisms."

The screens should therefore capture most genes involved in the phenotype being enriched for, except for genes required for the viability of haploid cells and genes with redundant function, since the probability of independent GT integrations disrupting redundant genes in the same haploid cell is vanishingly small.

Following two rounds of sorting (see Materials and methods), GT insertions in only three genes showed statistically significant (false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected <i>p</i>-value&lt;0.01) enrichment in the sorted cells: <i>CSNK1A1</i>, <i>APC</i> and <i>PYY</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Genes\u00a0encoding\u00a0other known negative regulators of the pathway, such as <i>GSK3A</i> and <i>GSK3B</i> or <i>AXIN1</i> and <i>AXIN2</i>, presumably did not score as hits in this screen due to redundancy, as suggested by their expression profile in HAP1 cells (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

While the mechanistic basis of this process remains to be elucidated, our results cannot be explained by previously described functions of the AXIN DAX domain. The DAX domain has been implicated in AXIN polymerization, in interactions with DVL, and in mediating an intramolecular, auto-inhibitory interaction that allows the receptor complex to inactivate the destruction complex in a catalytic manner (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fiedler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). These models predict that loss of the DAX domain would impair communication between the receptor complex and the destruction complex, leading to defective WNT-induced CTNNB1 stabilization, in contrast to our results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and F</a>). Thus, the disconnect between CTNNB1 abundance and transcriptional activity caused by deletion of the DAX domain demonstrates a\u00a0new biochemical function for this domain."

The existence of this class of genes, apparently required for WNT signaling only in cells lacking CSNK1A1, suggested a role for CSNK1A1 in WNT signaling independent of the destruction complex.

Previous work has implicated HUWE1 as a negative regulator of WNT signaling (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Groot et al., 2014</a>). However, the results of our screens suggested that in the absence of CSNK1A1, HUWE1 is a positive regulator of WNT signaling. To test the role of HUWE1 in this context, we further engineered the CSNK1A1<sup>KO-1</sup> cells used for the CSNK1A1 suppressor screen, as well as an independently derived cell line with a different lesion in <i>CSNK1A1</i> (CSNK1A1<sup>KO-2</sup>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). In each parental cell line, we used two different sgRNAs to disrupt <i>HUWE1</i> and isolated multiple double-mutant clonal cell lines (designated CSNK1A1<sup>KO-1</sup>; HUWE1<sup>KO</sup>\u00a0and CSNK1A1<sup>KO-2</sup>; HUWE1<sup>KO</sup>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>).

These results are explained by the observation that in cells lacking the DAX domain of AXIN2, CTNNB1 is appropriately stabilized and localized to the nucleus following WNT stimulation, but remains inactive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Second, genes encoding components of the GPI anchor biosynthetic machinery, such as PIGL, and the glypican GPC4 were predominantly enriched for GT insertions in the low WNT + RSPO screen (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), and we demonstrated that they indeed play a critical role in mediating signaling especially under the low WNT conditions in which RSPOs exert their strongest effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Third, the enrichment\u00a0of GT insertions in <i>HUWE1</i> only in the CSNK1A1 suppressor screen (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) revealed a unique signaling condition created by disruption of CSNK1A1, but not other destruction complex components such as APC or GSK3.

It will be interesting to explore if these phenomena can be exploited for therapeutic purposes in tumors driven by inappropriate stabilization of CTNNB1. We also provide evidence that the destruction complex does not have a unitary function in controlling CTNNB1 protein abundance, since disrupting distinct components produces different outcomes.

The number of insertions per gene was determined by intersecting each dataset of unique insertion sites with a list of the chromosomal coordinates of RefSeq-annotated genes. If an insertion was located in a genomic region shared by multiple transcripts of the same gene, it was only counted once. GT insertions in annotated genes were classified as being in the sense or antisense orientation relative to the coding sequence of the gene, and as being in exons or introns. For the unsorted (control) cells, the number of GT insertions in each gene (regardless of orientation), and the total number of insertions for all genes was determined. For the sorted cells, the number of inactivating GT insertions in each gene, defined as sense and antisense insertions in exons and sense insertions in introns, and the total number of inactivating insertions for all genes was determined. Enrichment of GT insertions for a given gene was calculated by comparing the relative frequency at which that gene harbored <i>inactivating</i> GT insertions in the sorted cells compared to the relative frequency at which the gene carried <i>any</i> GT insertion in the control dataset. For each gene, a <i>p</i>-value was calculated using the one-sided Fisher exact test and was corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

It relies on the fact that generally only sense GT insertions in introns should inactivate genes due to the directionality of the splice acceptor in the GT, and it captures the relative abundance of intronic GT insertions in the sense and antisense orientations, as well as the overall number of intronic insertions. We defined the Intronic GT Insertion Orientation Bias (IGTIOB) score as log<sub>2</sub>(S/A) x ln(S x A), where \u2018S\u2019 and \u2018A\u2019 equal one plus the number of unique sense or antisense intronic GT insertions, respectively, in a given gene.

Matrices were manually curated to remove out-of-focus optical planes and analyzed using MATLAB R2014b (MathWorks) to determine the mean fluorescence intensity of nuclear CTNNB1 staining. Briefly, the fluorescence values from the DAPI channel were smoothed using a low-pass Gaussian filter to remove fine noise, and a threshold was applied to generate a nuclear mask. The nuclear mask was eroded uniformly to prevent contamination with cytoplasmic signal and optical sections with poor nuclear masks were discarded. The fluorescence values from the irrelevant pool of CTNNB1 at tight junctions were removed from the CTNNB1 channel in each plane using a high-pass Gaussian filter. The sum of the corrected fluorescence intensity values from the CTNNB1 channel co-localizing with the nuclear mask were divided by the nuclear mask area to obtain the mean nuclear fluorescence per unit area for each optical plane. The final reported value for each field of view, referred to as \u2018nuclear CTNNB1\u2019, is the median of the mean nuclear fluorescence per unit area obtained from the three most central optical sections.

To generate the <i>pUASTattB-Axin\u0394C-V5</i> transgene, residues 705 through 745 were deleted by PCR-based mutagenesis of <i>pUASTattB-Axin-V5</i> using the oligonucleotide 5\u2019-GGTCACTTTAGGAAGCTTGGTAAACC-3\u2019. The resulting <i>Axin\u0394C-V5</i> fragment was digested with KpnI and HindIII, and cloned into the <i>pUASTattB</i> vector digested with the same enzymes. Transgenic flies were generated using site-specific integration at the <i>attP33</i> site using phiC31-based integration (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bischof et al., 2007</a>)."

Instead of siRNA-, overexpression- or genetic screens used previously, they used mutagenesis in haploid cells and an elegant analysis approach. Conducting the screen under various activation modes permitted to screen for select classes of activators/inhibitors. Via limited validation they provide evidence for new factors TFAP4, GPI-anchor biosynthetic pathway (for R-spondin signaling), SERBP1. In addition, their work identified C-terminal truncation mutants for Axin2, which act as dominant negatives and whose epistasis analysis suggest additional layers of \u03b2-catenin regulation, which is independent from its degradation. They identified HUWE1, a known negative Wnt regulator, is shown to also have a positive mode of action."

The discussion in this section has been made more concise to focus on the new information gained by the isolation of this allele, as suggested above. We have included a direct comparison of our results with current models of DAX-domain function from the literature (see aforementioned subsection) to highlight the fact that this allele uncovers an unanticipated role for AXIN in regulating \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity downstream of the destruction complex (and hence independent of \u03b2-catenin protein levels). The precise biochemical mechanism behind why \u03b2-catenin remains inactive when the DAX domains is deleted will require significant additional investigation (though we have ruled out a defect in nuclear translocation in Figure 3E,F and Figure 3\u2014Figure supplement 2), which we believe is outside the scope of this already expansive manuscript."

First, it moves the WNT signaling field forward by demonstrating an unexpected biochemical function for the DAX domain conserved from flies to humans. Second, it highlights one of the unique advantages of using untargeted mutagenesis in haploid cells over the more commonly used CRISPR/Cas9 screening system, in which mutations are targeted to specific regions of genes by the guide RNA. Indeed, our work suggests that it might be possible to isolate rare (and often informative) dominant alleles by constructing guide RNA libraries that systematically target the whole exome."

We also note in this section that we have addressed this concern by confirming new regulatory mechanisms (whenever possible) by measuring the expression of endogenous target genes (Figures 2A, 6B, F, Figure 6\u2014Figure supplement 1A and E), measuring the entirely non-transcriptional readout of \u03b2-catenin stabilization (Figures 3D,F, 6C,D,G,H, Figure 3\u2014Figure supplement 1C, Figure 6\u2014Figure supplements 6B and 6F), or assessing WNT-driven phenotypes in animals (Figures 2E,F, 3G,H, Figure 3\u2014Figure supplement 3), rather than relying solely in reporter gene activity data.
