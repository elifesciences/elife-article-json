Its \u03b11 isoform binds to all three PDZ (PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1) domains of PSD-95, the principal PSD scaffold, and can occupy as many as 15% of these PDZ domains. We present evidence that synGAP-\u03b11 regulates the composition of the PSD by restricting binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95. We show that phosphorylation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Polo-like kinase-2 (PLK2) decreases its affinity for the PDZ domains by several fold, which would free PDZ domains for occupancy by other proteins. Finally, we show that three critical postsynaptic signaling proteins that bind to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 are present in higher concentration in PSDs isolated from mice with a heterozygous deletion of synGAP."

Its \u03b11 isoform binds to all three PDZ (PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1) domains of PSD-95, the principal PSD scaffold, and can occupy as many as 15% of these PDZ domains. We present evidence that synGAP-\u03b11 regulates the composition of the PSD by restricting binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95. We show that phosphorylation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Polo-like kinase-2 (PLK2) decreases its affinity for the PDZ domains by several fold, which would free PDZ domains for occupancy by other proteins. Finally, we show that three critical postsynaptic signaling proteins that bind to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 are present in higher concentration in PSDs isolated from mice with a heterozygous deletion of synGAP."

Numerous experiments have shown that AMPARs become immobilized at the postsynaptic membrane by a three stage process involving insertion of receptors into the perisynaptic membrane, diffusion into the synapse and 'trapping' within the structure of the postsynaptic density (PSD; <a href=\"#bib47\">Opazo and Choquet, 2011</a>). The sites at which the receptors are trapped have been referred to as 'slots,' (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shi et al., 2001</a>) and they are believed to consist principally of PDZ domains on PSD-95 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Opazo et al., 2012</a>). Phosphorylation by CaMKII of TARPs (Transmembrane AMPAR Regulatory Proteins; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bredt and Nicoll, 2003</a>) increases their affinity for PDZ domains of PSD-95 suggesting that the phosphorylation may promote trapping of new AMPARs in the PSD (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tomita et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Opazo et al., 2010</a>). Indeed the PDZ domains of PSD-95 act as docking sites for several synaptic regulatory proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2B</a>); including NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kornau et al., 1995</a>), as well as neuroligins (<a href=\"#bib65\">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</a>) and LRRTMs (Leucine Rich Repeat TransMembrane proteins; <a href=\"#bib38\">Linhoff et al., 2009</a>), which nucleate new synapse formation and contribute to clustering of AMPARs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Siddiqui et al., 2010</a>).

One prominent alternatively spliced isoform, synGAP-\u03b11 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 2001</a>) contains a PDZ-domain ligand and binds to all three of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). Here we propose that association of synGAP-\u03b11 with PDZ domains of PSD-95 contributes to regulation of docking of AMPARs within the PSD and, therefore, to regulation of its overall protein composition. This function is distinct from its function as a Ras/Rap GAP (<a href=\"#bib69\">Walkup et al., 2015</a>). We support this hypothesis by showing that phosphorylation by at least two protein kinases on several sites in the regulatory region of synGAP-\u03b11 reduces the affinity of synGAP-\u03b11\u2019s PDZ-ligand for the three PDZ domains of PSD-95. One of these protein kinases is CaMKII, which is activated when synaptic plasticity is initiated by activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The other is PLK2, a constitutively active kinase that is induced by neuronal activity and mediates homeostatic scaling (<a href=\"#bib56\">Seeburg et al., 2005</a>). We further show that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to synGAP-\u03b11 selectively reduces its affinity for PDZ3 of PSD-95. Finally, we show that reduction of the total amount of synGAP in heterozygous knockout mice alters the composition of PSDs in the mutant mice in a way that is most directly explained by reduced competition from synGAP-\u03b11 for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95."

SynGAP is nearly as abundant in the PSD as PSD-95 itself (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dosemeci et al., 2007</a>).

Assuming that \u03b11 isoforms make up 30\u201350% of the total synaptic synGAP, and that one synGAP-\u03b11 molecule can bind to any one of the three PDZ domains in each molecule of PSD-95, synGAP-\u03b11 could occupy 10\u201315% of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 in an average PSD. Thus, it could help to regulate the size and strength of the synapse by limiting the availability of 'slots' that can bind AMPAR complexes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hayashi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Opazo et al., 2012</a>).

Complexes formed by PDZ domain interactions are examples of linked, multiple equilibria, the stable configurations of which are determined by the concentrations of each component and by their affinities for the relevant PDZ domains. Evidence has indicated that PSD-95 protein complexes exist in dynamic equilibrium permitting continual turnover and potential rearrangement of their composition (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sturgill et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schapitz et al., 2010</a>). Because synGAP-\u03b11 is an abundant protein in the PSD with a relatively high affinity for all three PDZ domains of PSD-95, reduction of its affinity after phosphorylation will allow other components to compete more effectively for binding; thus, the composition of the PSD-95 complex will shift to a new equilibrium."

For example, two other groups used imaging to show that phosphorylation by CaMKII in living neurons triggers movement of synGAP away from the PSD (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Araki et al., 2015</a>). In the Araki study, the authors suggested that phosphorylation of synGAP results in 'dispersion' of synGAP away from the PSD and therefore has the effect of upregulating Ras near the PSD. We propose here that an additional important consequence of the decrease in binding of synGAP to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 is readjustment of the composition of the PSD resulting from increased availability of the PDZ domains of PSD-95. Indeed, the dynamics of movements of synGAP and AMPARs visualized in living neurons following synaptic stimulation are consistent with this hypothesis. Activation of NMDARs and CaMKII causes dispersal of synGAP away from the PSD within a few minutes (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Araki et al., 2015</a>). The same stimuli produce an equally rapid increase in the rate of trapping of AMPARs at synaptic sites (<a href=\"#bib39\">Makino and Malinow, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Opazo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Opazo et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the rates of these two processes, observed in living neurons, are compatible with the notion that reduced binding of synGAP to PSD-95 during induction of LTP opens up binding slots for AMPAR complexes. Dispersal of synGAP away from the postsynaptic membrane would be expected to result in increased activation of Ras and Rap, which would lead to increases in the rates of exocytosis and/or endocytosis of AMPARs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhu et al., 2002</a>). However, experiments show that increased exocytosis of AMPARs does not contribute to their increased trapping in the minutes following synaptic stimulation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Makino and Malinow, 2009</a>). Instead, exocytosis replenishes surface AMPARs in the dendrite and perisynaptic spine membrane, and this process occurs with a slower time course than enhanced trapping."

In this study, expression of <i>wt</i>-synGAP-\u03b11 in the mutant neurons rescued all of these phenotypes; however, expression of synGAP-\u03b11 with a deletion of the five residue PDZ ligand (<i>\u0394SXV</i>) failed to rescue any of the effects of synGAP deficiency on precocious maturation of spines. In fact, expression of synGAP<i>\u0394SXV</i> caused an increase in the size of clusters of PSD-95 in spines compared to <i>wt</i> neurons. This failure to rescue the phenotypes was not a result of mislocalization of synGAP-\u03b11; synGAP<i>\u0394SXV</i> localized like <i>wt</i>-synGAP-\u03b11 to developing spine heads. Instead, the data are consistent with the idea that synGAP-\u03b11 normally competes with several proteins for binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95, and thus limits the size of clusters of PSD-95 and its associated proteins, as well as their movement into spine heads (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vazquez et al., 2004</a>)."

(2012)</a> that the \u03b11 and \u03b12 isoforms have markedly different effects on synaptic strength when expressed in primary cultures of forebrain neurons. For example, 12 to 36\u2009hr after transfection of the neurons with the A1\u03b11 isoform of synGAP, 73% of the neurons were 'silent', that is, had no miniature end-plate potentials (mEPSCs), compared with 11% of control neurons. In contrast, transfection with the A1\u03b12 isoform, which differs from \u03b11 only in its C-terminal 48 residues and lacks a PDZ ligand, had no effect on the proportion of silent neurons, which remained at 11%. Like <a href=\"#bib67\">Vazquez et al., (2004)</a>, they found that the differential effect did not arise from mislocalization of the A1\u03b12 isoform. Both isoforms of synGAP localized normally to dendrites and spines. The most straightforward explanation of this result is consistent with our hypothesis, which predicts that overexpression of the synGAP-\u03b11 isoform bearing the PDZ ligand restricts binding of AMPAR auxiliary proteins to PDZ domains and thus interfers with their localization to the synaptic site."

Mutations in a single copy of synGAP have been causally implicated in sporadic cases of non-syndromic ID, often associated with either autism (ASD) or epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berryer et al., 2013</a>). The frequency of developmental ID worldwide is estimated at 1 to 3%, and 25 to 50% of cases are sporadic, meaning that the parents are not affected. Although data is still sparse, mutations causing SynGAP haploinsufficiency appear to account for 2\u20139% of sporadic cases (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hamdan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berryer et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that its prevalence in the population could be as high as 0.03\u20130.1% and placing it in the same range of frequency as Fragile-X syndrome. The amount of synGAP in the brains of mice with synGAP haploinsufficiency is reduced by 50% (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vazquez et al., 2004</a>). We show here that this reduction leads to a shift in the composition of the PSD scaffold, apparently resulting from the decrease in synGAP\u2019s ability to compete for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95. This derangement is likely a significant factor in the human pathology leading to ID, ASD, and epilepsy."

This version of synGAP, termed r-synGAP-\u03b11, retains all of the identified functional domains, the regulatory domain, and the C-terminal PDZ ligand (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In a previous study we showed that r-synGAP-\u03b11 is phosphorylated by CaMKII at several residues including S1283, which is 7 residues upstream of the PDZ domain ligand located at residues 1290\u20131293 (<a href=\"#bib69\">Walkup et al., 2015</a>). Because this phosphorylation site is so near the PDZ ligand, we wondered whether its phosphorylation, or phosphorylation of other sites by CaMKII, would interfere with binding of synGAP-\u03b11 to PDZ domains of PSD-95. To test this, we incubated r-synGAP-\u03b11 with affinity resins substituted with recombinant PDZ domains as described under Materials and methods. The beads contained PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, a fragment containing PDZ1 and PDZ2 (PDZ12), or a fragment containing all three PDZ domains (PDZ123) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Walkup and Kennedy, 2014</a>). Binding of r-synGAP-\u03b11 to the beads was tested with or without a prior 10\u2009min phosphorylation by CaMKII. As expected, without phosphorylation, r-synGAP-\u03b11 binds specifically to each of the three PDZ domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In this assay, its binding is highest to PDZ3. Binding of r-synGAP-\u03b11 to PDZ123 reveals a substantial avidity effect; that is, the amount bound per individual PDZ domain is twice that bound to PDZ3 alone and four times that bound to either PDZ1 or PDZ2 alone."

Because, PDZ12 and PDZ123 contain more than a single PDZ domain binding site, all of which have similar affinities, we determined single 'apparent' equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>Dapp</sub>) for these two constructs. As discussed in 'Materials and methods', it is not possible to derive a unique equation incorporating two or three binding sites when the affinities of the multiple sites are similar. The best fit of the data with the equation for a single binding site provides a K<sub>Dapp</sub> that can be used to characterize the binding behavior of the constructs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>, respectively). The values are summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. We obtained an additional value of 730 \u00b1 50 nM for the K<sub>D</sub> of PDZ3 by a conventional Biacore assay, which is in good agreement with the K<sub>D</sub> measured by the competition assay. These data show that, under these conditions, PDZ1 has a higher affinity for r-synGAP-\u03b11 than does PDZ3."

We first compared binding of all of the unphosphorylated mutants by ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons by the Tukey method (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, black bars). Single or multiple mutations of the indicated serines to alanine did not significantly alter binding before phosphorylation; nor did the double mutation S1093D/S1123D. Only mutations in which site S1283 was mutated to the phosphomimetic aspartate (S1283D and S1093D/S1123D/S1283D) decreased binding of unphosphorylated r-synGAP-\u03b11\u00a0to PDZ123 with a significant p-value (p&lt;0.0001 for both). This result suggests that phosphorylation of S1283 has the most potent effect of all the sites on binding to PDZ domains. Mutations S1123A and S1283A did not significantly alter the change in binding after a brief, 0.5\u2009min phosphorylation. However, they both produced a trend toward lower reduction of binding, suggesting that both sites contribute to reduction of binding after brief phosphorylation. The effect of the double mutation S1093A/S1123A after 0.5\u2009min of phosphorylation was not significantly different from the effect of S1123A, suggesting that phosphorylation of S1093 doesn\u2019t influence binding to PDZ domains after a brief phosphorylation. In contrast, the triple mutant S1093A/S1123A/S1283A was the only S to A mutation that significantly interfered with the loss of binding (p=0.0074) compared to wild type after 0.5\u2009min of phosphorylation. This result reinforces the conclusion that sites S1123 and S1283 both contribute to reduction of binding of r-synGAP-\u03b11 to PDZ domains after brief phosphorylation."

We measured the amount of each protein bound to a fixed amount of CaM-Sepharose after incubation with increasing concentrations (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C and D</a>). Both r-synGAP-\u03b11 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) and sr-synGAP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) showed saturable binding to the CaM-Sepharose resin, and did not bind to control Sepharose beads lacking CaM (data not shown). The data were fit to hyperbolic curves and the K<sub>D</sub>\u2019s for binding of r-synGAP-\u03b11 and sr-synGAP to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM were calculated to be 31 \u00b1 3 nM and 210 \u00b1 30 nM, respectively. Thus, the high affinity site appears to be located in the regulatory disordered region of r-synGAP-\u03b11, which is missing in sr-synGAP. The K<sub>D</sub>\u2018s determined by the bead-binding assay (31 \u00b1 3 nM) and Biacore equilibrium binding (9 \u00b1 1 nM) are in the range of those reported for calcineurin (PP2B) and CaMKII, 1\u201310 nM (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hubbard and Klee, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cohen and Klee, 1988</a>) and 40\u201380 nM (<a href=\"#bib43\">Miller and Kennedy, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Meyer et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hudmon and Schulman, 2002</a>), respectively. We did not detect any binding when sr-synGAP was injected onto the CaM-substituted Biacore chip at concentrations from 10\u20132500 nM. Thus, the relatively weak binding of sr-synGAP observed in the bead-binding assay is not reproducible when measured on the Biacore chip. These data indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binds only weakly, if at all, to the N-terminal half of synGAP. A meta-analysis algorithm for detecting potential CaM-binding domains (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mruk et al., 2014</a>) predicts two Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding sites in the C-terminal half of r-synGAP-\u03b11, one from residues 1000\u20131030 and another in the putative coiled coil domain from residues 1229\u20131253. The SPR measurements do not allow us to confirm or to rule out the presence of two high affinity sites of similar affinity."

Because binding equilibria are driven not only by the intrinsic affinities of the binding partners, but also by their concentrations, one prediction of our proposed hypothesis is that synGAP haploinsufficiency, which reduces the amount of synGAP in the brain by 50% (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vazquez et al., 2004</a>), will cause a significant increase in binding to PSD-95 of other prominent PSD-95 binding proteins, such as TARPs, LRRTMs, or neuroligins. Thus, PSDs isolated from <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice would be predicted to have less synGAP and more TARPs, LRRTMs, and/or neuroligins bound to PSD-95 than do PSDs isolated from <i>wt</i> mice. We prepared PSD fractions from the forebrains of six <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice and from six <i>wt</i> litter mates and measured the ratios of synGAP, TARPs, LRRTM2, neuroligin-1, and neuroligin-2 to PSD-95 in the two fractions by quantitative immunoblot as described in 'Materials and methods' (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). The recoveries of total protein and the amount of PSD-95 per \u00b5g protein were identical in the two preparations. As predicted, the level of synGAP is decreased in relation to PSD-95 by ~ 24% in PSDs (p=0.0007, d = 1.75) from the <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Furthermore, the ratios of TARPs 2,3,4,\u02638, and of LRRTM2 to PSD-95 are significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B,C</a>; TARP/PSD-95, ~12%, p=0.017, d = 0.93; LRRTM2/PSD-95, ~14%, p=0.0035, d = 0.66). This result strongly suggests that, as predicted, the increase in availability of PDZ1/2 domains on PSD-95 in the <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice enhances steady-state binding of TARPs and LRRTMs to those sites. Interestingly, the ratio of neuroligin-1 to PSD-95 is unchanged in the <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice (d = 0.07, <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>), suggesting that increased availability of PDZ3 on PSD-95 is not a strong driver of association of neuroligin-1 with the PSD fraction. However, the ratio of neuroligin-2 to PSD-95 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>) is increased by ~9% (p=0.019, d = 0.64). Neuroligin-2 normally associates mostly with inhibitory synapses and mediates their maturation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</a>). However, <a href=\"#bib34\">Levinson et al. (2005)</a> reported that over-expression of PSD-95 in neurons causes a redistribution of neuroligin-2, increasing the proportion associated with excitatory synapses. Thus, the effect of reduction of synGAP on the distribution of neuroligin-2 shown here is the same as the effect of over-expression of PSD-95, suggesting that both manipulations increase the number of PDZ3 domains available for binding. Taken together, these results verify the prediction that a decrease in availability of synGAP in the PSD scaffold, increases the association of TARPs, LRRTMs, and neuroligin-2 with the PSD in vivo by releasing a restriction on binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95."

                        "text": "We have presented a new model for regulation of the composition of the spine postsynaptic membrane and PSD. It builds on previous findings that the PSD scaffold, in particular the PSD-95 complex, is dynamically regulated by activity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gray et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sturgill et al., 2009</a>), that activation of NMDARs and CaMKII leads to enhanced trapping of AMPARs within the PSD by binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Opazo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2012</a>), and that synGAP moves away from the PSD after phosphorylation by CaMKII (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Araki et al., 2015</a>). We propose that binding of the C-terminus of synGAP-\u03b11 to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 restricts binding of TARPs, LRRTM2, neuroligin-2, and perhaps additional proteins. As a result, regulation of synGAP-\u03b11\u2019s concentration and binding affinity for PDZ domains helps to determine the precise composition of the PSD at individual excitatory synapses (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). A corollary of this hypothesis is that synGAP plays an important role in limiting the size and strength of excitatory synapses by limiting and helping to regulate the available 'slots' that can bind AMPAR complexes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hayashi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Opazo et al., 2012</a>).We have provided support for this notion by demonstrating that phosphorylation of several sites in synGAP\u2019s regulatory domain by CaMKII or by PLK2 reduces the affinity of its PDZ ligand for all three of the PDZ domains of PSD-95. Both of these protein kinases are important regulators of synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib55\">Seeburg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hell, 2014</a>). We have also verified a strong prediction of the hypothesis which is that PSDs from mice with a deletion of one copy of the synGAP gene will contain fewer copies of synGAP and more copies of other proteins that bind to PSD-95. Indeed, we have shown that PSD fractions from young <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice have ~24% less synGAP per molecule of PSD-95 than those from <i>wt</i> mice; and, in contrast, they have significantly more TARP proteins (~12%), LRRTM2 (~14%), and neuroligin-2 (~9%) per molecule of PSD-95. The ratio of neuroligin-1 to PSD-95 is not altered."

The PDZ domains of PSD-95 are shown in blue and their numbers are indicated on the left pair of PSD-95 molecules. AMPARs that have been inserted into the extrasynaptic membrane by exocytosis associate with TARPs and with LRRTMs, both of which can bind to PDZ1 and PDZ2 of PSD-95. Neuroligin-1 (NLG-1) binds to PDZ3 of PSD-95. LRRTMs and NLG-1 also bind across the synaptic cleft to presynaptic neurexins. Induction of LTP (<i>Lower Right</i>) causes flux of calcium through NMDARs that activates CaMKII leading to phosphorylation of synGAP-\u03b11 on sites in the regulatory domain. The affinity of synGAP-\u03b11 for the PDZ domains decreases, allowing TARPs, LRRTMs, and perhaps NLG-2 to displace synGAP-\u03b11 by binding to the PDZ domains. The shift in affinity of synGAP-\u03b11 creates 'slots' that can be occupied by TARPs and LRRTMs bound to AMPARs, and by NLG-2, leading to strengthening of the synapse. SynGAP haploinsufficiency (<i>Lower Left</i>) results in a reduced amount of synGAP-\u03b11 in the PSD.

These effects are predicted by our model and do not depend on the in vivo context of the neurons. They are also not dependent on the GAP activity of synGAP and they require the PDZ ligand. While it is possible that a presently unknown direct effect on protein expression produces these changes, that effect would have to be specific for synGAP-\u03b11 and require its PDZ ligand. No evidence has emerged for a direct effect of the PDZ ligand on protein expression. Thus, the hypothesis we have put forward is the most parsimonious explanation for the specific effects of synGAP-\u03b11 on PSD composition. Similarly, the change in protein composition of PSDs in <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> animals (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>) cannot be explained by a two-fold reduction in RasGAP and RapGAP activity. SynGAP produces a much larger fold increase in GTPase activity of Rap than of Ras (<a href=\"#bib70\">Walkup et al., 2015</a> and references therein). Therefore, loss of half of the GAP activity would be predicted to increase the level of active Rap even more than that of active Ras. Thus, one would expect a relative increase in endocytosis of AMPARs compared to exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhu et al., 2002</a>). That would result in fewer AMPAR binding proteins in the PSD; not more, as we observe. For now, application of Occam\u2019s razor strongly favors the hypothesis we have presented. Future experiments will be necessary to determine the quantitative significance of synGAP-\u03b11\u2019s restriction of PDZ domain binding sites at various times during development and during acute stimulation of synapses."

Thus, acute phosphorylation of synGAP-\u03b11 by CaMKII following activation of NMDARs during induction of LTP could initiate rearrangement of the composition of PSDs of individual synapses by causing an increase in equilibrium binding in the PSD of AMPARs associated with TARPs and LRRTMs, and of other PSD-95 binding proteins, as they diffuse from perisynaptic locations. It will be important to test this prediction in future experiments."

It seems likely that the restriction by synGAP-\u03b11 of binding of neuroligin-2 to PDZ3 of PSD-95 would be more significant during development, during formation of new synapses, or perhaps in later phases of consolidation of LTP in adults. It is not clear whether a pool of perisynaptic neuroligin-2 exists at adult synapses that could be recruited to new synaptic sites over a few minutes after phosphorylation of synGAP-\u03b11. Nonetheless, the small but significant increase in neuroligin-2 that we observe in excitatory PSDs from <i>Syngap<sup>+/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice, as well as the increased steady state amounts of TARPs and LRRTMs would increase the overall excitatory/inihibitory (E/I) balance of synapses onto neurons in the mutant mice, and perhaps also in humans with <i>SYNGAP1</i> haploinsufficiency."

However, the consequences of these two effects for synaptic function are not known. Once again, the high copy number of synGAP in the PSD may provide a clue. The biochemical events initiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through NMDARs that lead to changes in synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sjostrom and Nelson, 2002</a>) are initiated by formation of transient and limiting concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in the spine (<a href=\"#bib40\">Markram et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pepke et al., 2010</a>).

The reduced amount of synGAP and resulting decrease in its ability to compete for PDZ domains are likely as significant as the reduction in synaptic Ras/Rap GAP activity in the pathology of these disorders.

Equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) for binding to PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3 were determined from the best fit curves as described in the Biacore T200 Software Handbook (p. 210). The experimental curves deviated slightly from the equation at higher concentrations of soluble PDZ domain because of a low affinity association between PDZ domains bound to the chip and soluble free PDZ domains. The deviation is most obvious for phosphorylated r-synGAP-\u03b11\u00a0which has a relatively low affinity for PDZ123. We determined that these deviations had only a small effect (&lt;~5%) on the calculated K<sub>D</sub>\u2019s by comparing K<sub>D</sub>\u2019s after fitting the curves including or excluding points for high concentrations of PDZs at which the r-synGAP-\u03b11 concentration appeared to plateau above zero. PDZ12 and PDZ123 contain more than a single PDZ domain binding site. It is not possible to derive a unique equation incorporating two or three binding sites when the affinities of the multiple sites are similar. Therefore, single 'apparent' equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>Dapp</sub>) were determined by obtaining the best fit of the data with the equation for a single binding site."

The mutant strain has been deposited in the Mutant Mouse Resource &amp; Research Center at University of California, Davis, listed as MMRRC:037374-UCD. All procedures were approved by the Caltech Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. PSD fractions were prepared as previously described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cho et al., 1992</a>) from six <i>wt</i> and six <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mouse litter mates matched by age (7\u201312 weeks), and sex (<i>wt</i>, 1 female, 5 males; <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i>, 2 female, 4 male). The mice were killed by cervical dislocation and forebrains were dissected and rinsed in Buffer A (0.32\u2009M sucrose, 1\u2009mM NaHCO3, 1\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1\u2009mM PMSF, 1 mg/l leupeptin). Forebrains from each set of six mice were pooled and homogenized with 12 up and down strokes at 900\u2009rpm in 14\u2009ml Buffer A. Homogenates were diluted to 35\u2009ml in Buffer A and centrifuged at 1400 \u00d7 g for 10\u2009min. The pellet was resuspended in 35\u2009ml Buffer A, homogenized (3 strokes), and centrifuged at 710\u2009g for 10\u2009min. Supernatants from the two centrifugations were combined and centrifuged at 13,800\u2009g for 10\u2009min. The pellet was resuspended in 8\u2009ml of Buffer B (0.32\u2009M sucrose, 1\u2009mM NaH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), homogenized with 6 strokes and layered onto a sucrose gradient (10\u2009ml each of 0.85\u2009M, 1.0\u2009M, and 1.2\u2009M sucrose in 1\u2009mM NaH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> buffer). The gradient was centrifuged for 2\u2009hr at 82,500\u2009g in a swinging bucket rotor. The synaptosome-enriched layer at the interface of 1.0 and 1.2\u2009M sucrose was collected, diluted to 15\u2009ml with Solution B and added to an equal volume of Buffer B containing 1% Triton. The mixture was stirred for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged for 45\u2009min at 36,800\u2009g. The pellet containing the PSD-enriched, Triton-insoluble fraction was resuspended in 800\u20131000\u2009\u03bcl of 40\u2009mM Tris pH 8 with a 21 gauge needle and 1\u2009ml syringe, and further solubilized by hand in a teflon glass homogenizer.

For most experiments, each blot contained 6 duplicate samples of PSD fractions from <i>wt</i> and the same number from S<i>yngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. Each blot was incubated with a mixture of two primary antibodies; mouse-anti-PSD-95 and the antibody against neuroligin-1, neuroligin-2, TARPs, LRRTM2, or synGAP. Then the blots were incubated with a mixture of the appropriate secondary antibodies. For measurement of neuroligin-1, both PSD-95 and neuroligin-1 were detected by the same goat anti-mouse secondary; the bands were physically separated on the gel and were quantified independently. Bound antibodies were visualized in the appropriate fluorescent channels with an Odyssey Classic Infared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences)."

                                "text": "Before running samples for quantification, we determined the amount of PSD sample that would result in signals for each protein that were strong enough for measurement and not saturated. To quantify the densities of the bands, each visual image was first set to high brightness in order to capture the boundaries of the signals for each band. The images were then used as a template in Li-Cor software to draw rectangular regions of interest around protein bands, and around identically sized background regions in the same lane. Background densities were subtracted from each protein signal. The digital data read by the Li-Cor software is unchanged by the visualization settings and is linear over several orders of magnitude. For each lane, the ratio of the integrated density of each of the five proteins to the integrated density of PSD-95 was calculated. For three gels, one outlier measurement (defined as greater than 2 times the standard deviation of the mean [S.E.]) was excluded from the calculation. The mean and S.E of the ratios were determined for <i>wt</i> and <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i> PSD fractions. The means were compared by t-tests performed with Prism software as indicated in the legend of <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>. The effect size was measured by Cohen\u2019s d (ratio of the difference in the mean to the pooled standard deviations of the measurements). Cohen\u2019s d between 0.5 and 0.8 is generally considered a 'medium' effect size, greater than 0.8 is generally considered a large effect size. For four of the proteins, the number of measurements was sufficient to determine a significant difference between <i>wt</i> and <i>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></i>. In the case of neuroligin-1, the means were identical after 24 individual measurements of each sample."

The main issue is that the qualitative findings of Araki et al. provide the same bottom line as this paper, but with more physiological relevance. This is not, we would like to stress, just a matter of \"publication date\". While there are new quantitative data on the sites studied in Araki (these sites were originally identified by the Kennedy group) the focus is on a new site, S1283, identified in vitro. The paper fails to provide a clear integrated discussion of the roles of these sites. The S1123/S1093 sites seem likely to be the relevant \"10 min sites\" that are causing PSD-95 release in vitro in the S1283 mutant and it seems equally likely that S1283 is the \"10 min\" site that causes release in the S1123 mutants, making it unclear why the S1123/S1283 double mutant was not examined. This paper needs to make a compelling case as to why quantitative information about S1283, an in vitro phosphorylation site which has not been shown to have a role in vivo, gives added value to the story. Secondly, there is no discussion of how the non-PDZ ligand form of SynGAP is released by phosphorylation, something a more general model should include. Thirdly, the SynGAP/+ PSD data, while suggestive and supportive of the model, are not totally compelling due to the potential for developmental effects."

The study demonstrates very convincingly that phosphorylation of SynGAP by CaMKII reduces its affinity for PSD-95 PDZ domains. The authors go on to posit that in vivo this decrease in PDZ binding frees up \"slots\" for other PSD-95-binding proteins to inhabit and allows the insertion of more AMPARs into the synapse. This idea has a certain appeal since it helps explain the initiation of the remodeling of the PSD that is caused by activity. The model is circumstantially supported by data from PSDs of WT and synGAP heterozygotes which show that the ratio of PSD-95 to SynGAP is decreased, but the ratio to other PDZ-binding partners is increased."

It clearly is the big dog with 10 mol/mol, but can other kinases cause similar losses of affinity for PSD-95? How about Cdk5 or PKA? Can they act independently or synergistically with CaMKII? Given that it appears that the affinity effect is \"bulk\" and not site-specific this may be quite biologically relevant. It at least merits discussion."

The authors identify S1283 as a critical phosphorylation site in this context. The data are largely solid. However, recent other work already showed that phosphorylation of SynGAP on S1108 and S1128 by CaMKII reduces its interaction with PSD-95 and is important for chemically induced LTP (Araki et al., 2015, as cited). The authors would have to discuss how their findings intersect with this recent other work in much more detail than they present right now. Most importantly, in the absence of any functional studies such as redistribution of postsynaptic proteins upon S1283 phosphorylation and its dependence on S1283 phosphorylation, the functional significance of this phosphorylation is not clear enough for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

Could this be due differences between experiments, perhaps due to variations in non-specific binding to resin?In this context, the fact that the point mutations of SynGAP showed more binding than WT after 0.5 min CaMKII pretreatment could potentially be due to variation in non-specific binding and, if so, there might not be a difference between the 0.5 and 10 min CaMKII incubations in that respect."

A clear statement that the mechanism described in this manuscript applies to \u03b11 containing isoforms only is warranted. Preferably, instead of referring to synGAP, the authors could refer to synGAP \u03b11 throughout the manuscript. While these changes do not detract from the importance of the main findings of the manuscript, they highlight that many synGAP isoform exist at the synapse that do not contain the sequences necessary to bind PSD-95."

However, the curves all asymptote to 0. Hence, the equation does not appear to describe the data.

This role for synGAP in regulating PSD composition is independent of it GTPase activity and changes the potential outcomes of both synGAP action in normally developing neurons as well as in the human pathology associated with SYNGAP haploinsufficiency. The biochemical findings are tightly integrated into a model of PSD plasticity that provides a new way of looking at how synapses reorganize. While not all the last details have been worked out, this is a substantially new way of looking at the PSD that should have a significant influence on the field."

Identifying direct vs. indirect effects of a given mutation is always difficult and compensation can happen at all levels, from molecular to circuit. <i>SynGAP<sup>+/-</sup></i> neurons show numerous physiological in intrinsic and circuit properties, plasticity, morphology etc. How each of these relate directly to the reduction in synGAP is not known. Since the excitability and activity of neurons is altered, so to will the activity-dependent gene expression. Hence, changes in protein expression and localisation may also arise as a secondary effect of changes in activity across development.

Our reading of the data of McMahon et al. on synGAP isoforms is that the synGAP \u03b11 isoform makes up approximately half of the synGAP in a mouse hippocampal homogenate (at the very least 30%). This fact predicts that synGAP could occupy as many as 15% of all of the PDZ domains on PSD-95. This means that a reduction in affinity of synGAP for the PDZ domains would necessarily make a relatively large number of PDZ domains available for binding to other proteins. This has not been stated in publications previously and this simple deduction has not been made in any other paper. The model is a significant advance on its own.

It is an EM study showing that synGAP \u03b12 and synGAP \u03b11 both move from inside the PSD at ~30 nm from the membrane to what they call the \u201cpallium\u201d of the PSD, at a median of ~60 nm from the membrane.

Newborns with complete deletion of synGAP appear normal, but die a few days after birth with movement defects and apparent seizure activity, indicating a defect as synapses are forming. Such developmental effects of mutations arise for molecular reasons. There is no evidence of morphological changes in synGAP heterozygous animals, nor in individuals with synGAP haploinsufficiency, that might lead to a wiring defect that could produce the result we report. The hypothesis we have put forward is by far the most parsimonious explanation for the change in composition of forebrain PSDs in the <i>synGAP<sup>+/-</sup></i> animals. Indeed, the quantitative nature of the changes is difficult to explain in any other ways. They cannot be explained by a two-fold reduction in RasGAP and RapGAP activity. SynGAP produces a much larger fold increase in GTPase activity of Rap than of Ras (Walkup et al., 2015 and references therein). Therefore, loss of half of the GAP activity would be predicted to increase the level of active Rap even more than that of active Ras. Thus, one would predict a relative increase in endocytosis of AMPARs compared to exocytosis. That would result in fewer AMPAR binding proteins in the PSD; not more, as we observe. Beyond that, the competitive role for synGAP binding explains several previously unexplained observations in the literature. Many of these were detailed in our discussion. For now, Occam\u2019s razor strongly favors our hypothesis. We point out that many experiments will be necessary to \u201cprove\u201d this model beyond a doubt.

We now indicate why the levels of free r-synGAP-\u03b11 do not appear to reach zero (binding between free soluble PDZ domain and PDZ domains on the chip at high concentration). Despite this deviation, the data allow a sufficient fit to calculate a reliable K<sub>D</sub> for a single site. We also explain why we use the term apparent K<sub>D</sub> for the numbers derived for constructs with more than one PDZ domain. Because the two or three PDZ domains have similar, but not identical, affinities the curve will not be fit exactly. There will be multiple solutions to equations derived assuming more than one binding site. Simply put, there are not good ways to use bulk methods to find the affinities of individual sites in a molecule with more than one binding site. The \u201capparent\u201d K<sub>D</sub> is, nonetheless, a useful description of the summed binding properties of the constructs with multiple sites."

Identifying direct vs. indirect effects of a given mutation is always difficult and compensation can happen at all levels, from molecular to circuit. SynGAP<sup>+/-</sup> neurons show numerous physiological in intrinsic and circuit properties, plasticity, morphology etc. How each of these relate directly to the reduction in synGAP is not known. Since the excitability and activity of neurons is altered, so to will the activity-dependent gene expression. Hence, changes in protein expression and localisation may also arise as a secondary effect of changes in activity across development. Therefore, while their data certainly are consistent with their model and their conclusions may even be the most parsimonious explanation for their data since TARPs, LRRTM2 and NLGN2 are all affected, a critical discussion of other possibilities seems warranted.</i> "

The number of animals is 6 wild type and 6 het in all cases. It is not customary or usually necessary to make biochemical measurements on individual animals. In behavioral experiments the variation from animal to animal can be large because of the many brain areas involved in expressing behaviors, and the difficulty of controlling context perfectly. Biochemical variation from animal to animal is generally much smaller, and measurements are made as averages of preparations from brain tissue pooled from several animals. In this case, the technical replicates are important because the variation in measurements from individual lanes is high. This variation results from minor differences in loading, immunoblot background, shapes of lanes, small variations in amounts of protein transferred during blotting, etc."
