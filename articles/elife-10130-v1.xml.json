How talin and kindlin contribute to these events in non-hematopoietic cells is poorly understood. Here we report that fibroblasts lacking either talin or kindlin failed to activate \u03b21 integrins, adhere to fibronectin (FN) or maintain their integrins in a high affinity conformation induced by Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Despite compromised integrin activation and adhesion, Mn<sup>2+</sup> enabled talin- but not kindlin-deficient cells to initiate spreading on FN. This isotropic spreading was induced by the ability of kindlin to directly bind paxillin, which in turn bound focal adhesion kinase (FAK) resulting in FAK activation and the formation of lamellipodia. Our findings show that talin and kindlin cooperatively activate integrins leading to FN binding and adhesion, and that kindlin subsequently assembles an essential signaling node at newly formed adhesion sites in a talin-independent manner."

How talin and kindlin contribute to these events in non-hematopoietic cells is poorly understood. Here we report that fibroblasts lacking either talin or kindlin failed to activate \u03b21 integrins, adhere to fibronectin (FN) or maintain their integrins in a high affinity conformation induced by Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Despite compromised integrin activation and adhesion, Mn<sup>2+</sup> enabled talin- but not kindlin-deficient cells to initiate spreading on FN. This isotropic spreading was induced by the ability of kindlin to directly bind paxillin, which in turn bound focal adhesion kinase (FAK) resulting in FAK activation and the formation of lamellipodia. Our findings show that talin and kindlin cooperatively activate integrins leading to FN binding and adhesion, and that kindlin subsequently assembles an essential signaling node at newly formed adhesion sites in a talin-independent manner."

The consequence of integrin-mediated adhesion is the assembly of a large molecular network that induces various signaling pathways, resulting in cell migration, proliferation, survival and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Winograd-Katz et al., 2014</a>). The quality and strength of integrin signaling is controlled by the interaction between integrins and substrate-attached ligands, which is, in turn, regulated by the on- and off-rates of the integrin\u2013ligand binding process. The on-rate of the integrin\u2013ligand binding reaction (also called integrin activation or inside-out signaling) is characterized by switching the unbound form of integrins from an inactive (low affinity) to an active (high affinity) conformation. The affinity switch proceeds from a bent and clasped low affinity conformation to an extended and unclasped high affinity conformation with an open ligand-binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib1\">Askari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Springer and Dustin, 2012</a>). This change in affinity is believed to be induced through the binding of talin and kindlin to the \u03b2 integrin cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#bib42\">Moser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shattil et al., 2010</a>) and divalent cations to distinct sites close to the ligand-binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gailit and Ruoslahti, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mould et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Xia and Springer, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mould et al., 2003</a>)."

It is not known how integrin activation is induced on these cells (no integrin-activating agonists have been identified) and it is also controversial whether talin and kindlin are required to shift their integrins into the high affinity state. While there are reports showing that talin and kindlin are required for integrin activation in epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Montanez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Margadant et al., 2012</a>), it was also shown that in myoblasts and mammary epithelial cells activation of \u03b21 integrins, adhesion and spreading on multiple ECM substrates can proceed in the absence of talin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Conti et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Likewise, it was reported that focal adhesion kinase\u00a0(FAK)-deficient fibroblasts develop small, nascent adhesions (NAs) at the edge of membrane protrusions without visible talin and that integrins carrying a mutation in the talin-binding site can still nucleate and stabilize NAs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lawson et al., 2012</a>). Also fibroblasts lacking talin-1 and -2 were shown to adhere to fibronectin (FN) and initiate isotropic spreading (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Another intriguing study demonstrated that overexpression of kindlin-2 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells inhibits rather than promotes talin head-induced \u03b15\u03b21 integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harburger et al., 2009</a>). Given the fundamental importance of talin and kindlin for integrin activation in hematopoietic cells, the findings of these studies are unexpected and imply that either integrin affinity regulation is substantially different in fibroblasts and epithelial cells or the experimental approaches used to manipulate protein expression and localization were imperfect."

To test whether the inability of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to adhere to ECM proteins is due to an integrin activation defect, we bypassed inside-out activation by treating cells with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which binds to the integrin ectodomain and induces unbending and unclasping of integrin heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mould et al., 1995</a>). Treatment with Mn<sup>2+</sup> induced partial adhesion of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to FN, while partial adhesion to LN and VN was only induced in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Time course experiments revealed that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced adhesion of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to FN was already significantly lower 2.5 min after plating and remained significantly lower compared with control cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), suggesting that talin and kindlin cooperate to initiate and maintain normal Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced adhesion to FN. In line with these findings, dose-response profiles showed that Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells have severe adhesion defects at low (1.25 \u00b5g ml<sup>\u20131</sup>) as well as high (20 \u00b5g ml<sup>\u20131</sup>) substrate concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

We quantified integrin surface levels by flow cytometry and found that the levels of \u03b21 and \u03b23 were significantly reduced in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> and unaffected in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The levels of \u03b12 and \u03b13 integrin\u00a0were reduced in both cell lines, \u03b16 was elevated in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and decreased in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, and the \u03b13 levels were significantly more decreased in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> than in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) explaining the absent adhesion of both cell lines to COL and their differential adhesion behaviour on LN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The \u03b25 levels were similarly up-regulated in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> and Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells, and the \u03b15 and \u03b1v integrin levels were slightly reduced but not significantly different between Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The differential adhesion of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to VN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), despite similar surface levels of \u03b1v integrins, points to particularly important role(s) for kindlin-2 in \u03b1v integrins-VN adhesion and signaling (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liao et al., 2015</a>). Serendipitously, the reduced expression of \u03b21-associating \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b16 subunits in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, which impairs adhesion to LN and COL enables \u03b15 to associate with the remaining \u03b21 subunits and leads to comparable \u03b15\u03b21 levels on Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) explaining their similar adhesion to FN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

To directly assess integrin activation, we made use of an antibody against the 9EG7 epitope, which specifically recognizes Mn<sup>2+</sup> and/or ligand activated \u03b21 integrins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bazzoni et al., 1995</a>). The amount of 9EG7 epitope exposure relative to total \u03b21 integrin exposure corresponds to the integrin activation index, which can be measured by flow cytometry using 9EG7 and anti-total \u03b21 integrin antibodies. These measurements revealed that Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells bound 9EG7 antibodies, while Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells lacked 9EG7 binding in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment significantly increased 9EG7 binding by Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells, which was further elevated in the presence of FN-Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligand known to stabilize the high affinity state of integrins (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells bound significantly less 9EG7 antibodies than control cells, which marginally increased with FN-RGD (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Moreover, the normalization of the 9EG7 binding to the total \u03b21 integrin surface levels also indicated a significantly lower influence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and FN-RGD on the integrin activation index of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> as compared to Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). These findings confirm that both, talin and kindlin are required for \u03b21 integrin activation and to stabilize Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced unbending/unclasping of \u03b15\u03b21 integrins."

To further analyze whether ligand-induced stabilisation of high-affinity integrin conformations (also termed \u2018ligand-induced integrin activation; <a href=\"#bib19\">Du et al., 1991</a>) can form in the absence of talin or kindlin, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS). We attached control, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> or Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to Concanavalin A (ConA)-coated cantilevers, allowed the cells to contact surfaces coated with either wild type FN-III<sub>7-10</sub> (FN-RGD) or an integrin-binding-deficient FN-III<sub>7-10</sub> fragment lacking the RGD binding motif (FN-\u0394RGD) for increasing contact times, either in the absence or presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and then detached them from the substrate by lifting the cantilever (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). In the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells developed significant adhesion to FN-RGD within 5 s contact time. After a contact time of 20 s around 2 nN force was required to disrupt adhesion to FN-RGD, and after 50 and 120 s, respectively, 3 and 6 nN were required (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells failed to develop measurable adhesions to FN-RGD after contact times of 5, 20, 50 and 120 s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Treatment with Mn<sup>2+</sup> induced a slight and similar increase of force required to disrupt adhesion of control, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to FN-RGD after 5 s contact time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, with increasing contact times, the AFM profiles of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells differ in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>.\u00a0While the adhesion force increased concomitantly with longer contact times in Tln<sup>Ctr</sup>, Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> and Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells, adhesion forces of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells plateaued after 50 s and showed no further increase towards 120 s contact time. The latter finding suggests that kindlin stabilizes integrin\u2013ligand complexes with time, by inducing integrin clustering and/or by modulating the off-rate of integrin ligand bonds, for\u00a0example, through associating with the integrin-linked kinase\u00a0(ILK)-Pinch-Parvin (IPP) complex that links kindlin to the F-actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cluzel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Ye et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Montanez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fukuda et al., 2014</a>)."

To test whether spreading can also be induced in adherent Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, we bypassed their adhesion defect with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, seeded them for 30 min on FN and stained with an antibody against total \u03b21 integrin and the \u03b21 integrin activation epitope-reporting 9EG7 antibody. As expected, Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> or Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells clustered 9EG7-positive \u03b21 integrins in NAs and focal adhesions (FAs), whose frequency and size increased upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In contrast, the sporadic and very weakly adherent Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells were small, round and formed small and finely dispersed \u03b21 integrin aggregates over the entire cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and lacked 9EG7-positive signals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment. Upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment 37 \u00b1 1% (n=684, mean \u00b1 standard\u00a0deviation of three independent experiments) of the Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells showed isotropic membrane protrusions (circumferential lamellipodia) with small, dot-like aggregates of \u03b21 integrin, kindlin-2, paxillin and ILK at the membrane periphery (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which eventually detached from the substrate leading to the collapse of the protruded membrane (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Furthermore, 9EG7-positive \u03b21 integrins accumulated along the lamellipodial edge and beneath the nucleus of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The remaining cells were spheroid, with half of them showing short, finger-like protrusions, which were motile due to their poor anchorage to the substrate. In the case of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, we analysed 652 cells in three independent experiments and found that only 7 \u00b1 1% (mean\u00a0\u00b1 standard\u00a0deviation) of the cells established lamellipodia, which formed around the entire circumference in 2 \u00b1 0.4% (mean\u00a0\u00b1 standard\u00a0deviation) of the cells. Around 93 \u00b1 1% of the Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells were spheroid (mean\u00a0\u00b1 standard\u00a0deviation) and frequently had finger-like, motile protrusions with small dot-like signals containing \u03b21 integrin and talin but rarely paxillin or ILK (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, re-expression of Tln1V in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells or K2GFP in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells normalized FA formation and spreading on FN (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These findings indicate that kindlin-2 expressing Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells can initiate the formation of large lamellipodia and assemble \u03b21 integrins in lamellipodial edges."

Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated and non-permeablized cells were seeded on FN, stained with anti-total \u03b21 integrin antibodies, and then permeabilized, immunostained for paxillin and imaged with normal resolution TIRFM and dSTORM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Each localization detected by dSTORM was plotted as a Gaussian distribution around its centre with an average spatial accuracy of ~20 nm (resolution limit of dSTORM imaging). Since two or more localizations from single or multiple dyes in close proximity cannot be distinguished, the number of localizations does not directly reflect integrin numbers. However, all antibody molecules display the same average behaviour with respect to the number of localizations per second in all areas of the cell. This allowed to average the number of localizations per second and \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> and to plot them in a heat map representation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), which directly reflects the density of stained \u03b21 integrin molecules and thus the degree of integrin clustering. The \u03b21 integrin staining of Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells revealed small round structures of ~50 nm diameter indicating clusters of integrins larger than the resolution limit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; high magnification; see arrowheads). Furthermore, high numbers of localizations were enriched in paxillin-positive FAs and in NAs at the lamellipodial edge (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; see arrowheads). In these areas, we observed a high average density of 60\u2013120 localizations s<sup>\u20131\u00a0</sup>\u00b5m<sup>\u20132</sup>, while outside of the adhesion sites ~0\u201320 localizations s<sup>\u20131\u00a0</sup>\u00b5m<sup>\u20132</sup> were detected, indicating a high degree of \u03b21 integrin clustering within and a low degree of clustering outside of adhesion sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells with circumferential lamellipodia showed a high density of blinking with up to 100 localizations s<sup>\u20131\u00a0</sup>\u00b5m<sup>\u20132</sup> at lamellipodial edges (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>; see arrowheads), which appeared less compact than in control cells. Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells showed &gt;120 localizations s<sup>\u20131\u00a0</sup>\u00b5m<sup>\u20132</sup> in the periphery and finger-like membrane protrusions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>; see arrowheads), which were also observed in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells that adopted a spheroid rather than an isotropic spread shape (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The exclusive presence of these large and entangled \u03b21 integrin aggregates on Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells with small, spheroid shapes and protrusions suggests that they were induced by spatial constraints rather than specific signaling."

To identify binding partner(s) of kindlin-2 that transduce this function to downstream effectors, we performed yeast-two-hybrid assays with kindlin-2 as bait using a human complementary\u00a0DNA\u00a0(cDNA) library containing all possible open reading frames and a human keratinocyte-derived cDNA library. Among the 124 cDNAs identified from both screenings, 17 coded for leupaxin and 11 for Hic-5. Immunoprecipitation of overexpressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged paxillin family members, paxillin, Hic-5 and leupaxin in HEK-293 cells with an anti-GFP antibody efficiently co-precipitated FLAG-tagged kindlin-2 (K2flag) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Conversely, overexpressed GFP-tagged kindlin family members (kindlin-1, kindlin-2, kindlin-3) co-precipitated Cherry-paxillin (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since fibroblasts express high levels of paxillin (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we performed all further interaction analysis with paxillin. Immunoprecipitations of GFP-tagged paxillin or kindlin-2 truncation mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) revealed that the interaction between kindlin-2 and paxillin was dramatically reduced in the absence of the Lin-11, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM)1-4, LIM2-4 or LIM3-4 domains of paxillin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), or the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (K2\u0394PHGFP; lacking amino acids 380-477) or the N-terminus of kindlin-2 including the F0, F1, and the N-terminal part of the F2 domains (K2NTGFP; terminating at the end of F1; spanning amino acids 1-229) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As expected, the interaction between kindlin-2 and ILK (<a href=\"#bib40\">Montanez et al., 2008</a>), which is mediated via a recently identified sequence in the linker domain between the end of the N-terminal F2 and the beginning of the PH domain (amino acids 353\u2013357) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fukuda et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huet-Calderwood et al., 2014</a>), was abolished by the K2NTGFP truncation but unaffected by the deletion of the PH domain (K2\u0394PHGFP) or the deletion of the N-terminal F0 and F1 domains (K2CTGFP, spanning amino acids 244-680) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Importantly, immunoprecipitation of Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> lysates with antibodies against paxillin co-precipitated kindlin-2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), confirming interactions between the endogenous proteins. Pull down experiments with recombinant full-length paxillin or paxillin-LIM3 domain and recombinant kindlin-2 demonstrated that binding to LIM3 and full-length paxillin is direct, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and abrogated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\u00a0(EDTA) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells were transduced with K2GFP or K2\u0394PHGFP expression constructs, seeded on FN for different times and stained for \u03b21 integrin, paxillin and F-actin. The experiments revealed that the expression of K2GFP in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells rescued spreading and induced robust paxillin recruitment to \u03b21 integrin-positive NAs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). In contrast, expression of K2\u0394PHGFP failed to recruit paxillin to \u03b21 integrin-positive adhesion sites at the rim of membrane protrusions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>) and induce normal cell spreading (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) despite proper, although weaker, localisation to \u03b21 integrin-positive adhesion sites (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4B,C</a>). Interestingly, mature FAs in K2\u0394PHGFP-expressing cells were prominent after 30 min and contained significant amounts of paxillin, indicating that paxillin is recruited to mature FAs in a kindlin-2-independent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

                                "text": "Our findings revealed that kindlin-2 is required to recruit paxillin to NAs. Paxillin in turn, was shown to bind, cluster and activate FAK in NAs, which leads to the recruitment of p130Cas, Crk and Dock followed by the activation of Rac1 and the induction of cell spreading, and, in concert with growth factor signals, to the activation of Akt-1 followed by the induction of cell proliferation and survival (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schlaepfer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bouchard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brami-Cherrier et al., 2014</a>). We therefore hypothesized that the recruitment of paxillin and FAK by kindlin-2 triggers the isotropic spreading and expansion of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells. To test this hypothesis, we seeded our cell lines on FN or poly-L-lysine (PLL) in the presence or absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. We found that EGF induced similar phosphorylation of tyrosine-992 (Y992) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (pY992-EGFR) in control, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells. The phosphorylation of tyrosine-397 of FAK (pY379-FAK) in Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells was strongly induced after the\u00a0adhesion of control cells on FN and was not further elevated after the addition of EGF and Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells also increased pY397-FAK as well as pY31-Pxn and pY118-Pxn levels upon adhesion to FN, however, significantly less compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A-C</a>). Furthermore, EGF and Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatments further increased pY397-FAK levels in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells and localized pY397-FAK to peripheral NA-like adhesions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A-C</a>). In sharp contrast, Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells seeded on FN or treated with EGF and Mn<sup>2+</sup> failed to induce pY397-FAK, pY31-Pxn, pY118-Pxn (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A-C</a>) and localize pY397-FAK to peripheral membrane regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Importantly, re-expression of Talin1-Venus in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kindlin2-GFP and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells fully rescued these signaling defects (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Furthermore, stable expression of K2GFP in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells rescued pY397-FAK and pS473-Akt levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and co-precipitated paxillin and FAK with K2GFP (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, stable expression of K2\u0394PHGFP in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells failed to co-precipitate paxillin and FAK (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and induce pY397-FAK and pS473-Akt (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

The unambiguity of this finding was unexpected in light of several reports showing that integrin activation and integrin-mediated adhesion still occurs in talin-depleted cells, or is inhibited when kindlin-2 is overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harburger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lawson et al., 2012</a>). The previous studies that addressed the functional properties of talin used siRNA-mediated protein depletion, a combination of gene ablation and siRNA technology, or approaches to interfere with talin recruitment to NAs either by ablating the talin upstream protein FAK or by expressing an integrin that harbors a mutation in the talin binding site. Since the majority of approaches deplete rather than eliminate proteins from cells and adhesion sites, the respective cells were most likely recruiting sufficient residual protein to adhesion sites to allow integrin activation, cell adhesion and spreading, and the assembly of adhesion- and signaling-competent NAs. It is possible that not all integrin molecules have to be occupied by talin and therefore low levels of talin suffice, particularly in NAs that were shown by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to contain only half the number of talin relative to \u03b15\u03b21 integrin and kindlin-2 molecules (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bachir et al., 2014</a>). However, when the entire pool of talin is lost or decreased below certain thresholds (<a href=\"#bib38\">Margadant et al., 2012</a>) integrins remain inactivate and consequently adhesion sites do not form. With respect to kindlin, it was reported that overexpressed kindlin-2 in CHO cells inhibits rather than promotes talin head domain-induced \u03b15\u03b21 integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harburger et al., 2009</a>). An integrin inhibiting effect of kindlin-2 is inconsistent with our study, which identified a crucial role for kindlin in integrin activation, as well as with other studies also demonstrating that kindlin-2 promotes integrin functions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Montanez et al., 2008</a>). It could well be that the reported inhibition of \u03b15\u03b21 by kindlin-2 represents an artifact that arose from protein overexpression."

We observed that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells expressed the activation-dependent epitope 9EG7 and adhered to FN, albeit at significantly lower levels and efficiencies than the normal parental or rescued cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). This observation strongly indicates that talin and kindlin also cooperate to maintain the extended and unclasped conformation of active integrins. Although it is not known how talin and kindlin keep integrins in an active state, it is possible that they stabilize this conformation by linking the unclasped \u03b2 integrin cytoplasmic domain to the plasma membrane and/or to cortical actin, which may firmly hold separated integrin \u03b1/\u03b2 subunits apart from each other. The expression of mutant talins and kindlins in our cells should allow us to examine these possibilities in future."

This initial isotropic spreading was significantly less frequent in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, and has also been observed in talin-2-depleted talin-1<sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> cells on FN, although these cells did not require Mn<sup>2+</sup> for inducing spreading, which is likely due to the presence of residual talin-2 that escaped siRNA-mediated depletion (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). These findings strongly suggest that integrin binding to FN enables kindlin-2 in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells to cluster \u03b21 integrins (as shown for \u03b1IIb\u03b23 by kindlin-3 in <a href=\"#bib68\">Ye et al., 2013</a>) and to trigger a signaling process that initiates spreading."

                        "text": "To find a mechanistic explanation for the kindlin-2-mediated cell spreading, we used the yeast-two-hybrid technology to identify paxillin as a novel and direct binding partner of kindlin-2. The interaction of the two proteins occurs through the LIM3 domain of paxillin, which was previously identified as integrin adhesion-targeting site (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 1996</a>), and the PH domain of kindlin-2. It is not unusual that PH domains fulfill dual roles by binding phospholipids and proteins, either simultaneously or consecutively (<a href=\"#bib50\">Scheffzek and Welti, 2012</a>). The expression of a PH domain-deficient kindlin-2 in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells rescues adhesion to FN and FA maturation, however, significantly impairs spreading and plasma membrane protrusions. This finding together with the observations that paxillin-null fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells have defects in spreading, adhesion site remodeling and formation of lamellipodia (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hagel et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">Wade et al., 2002</a>) indicates that the kindlin-2/paxillin complex induces the elusive signaling process, leading to initial spreading of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and talin-depleted cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, the kindlin-2/paxillin complex in NAs recruits FAK (<a href=\"#bib18\">Deramaudt et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">Thwaites et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Choi et al., 2011</a>), which cooperates with growth factor receptors (such as EGFR) to induce signaling pathways that activate Erk and Akt to promote proliferation and survival, as well as Arp2/3 and Rac1 to induce actin polymerization and membrane protrusions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,E</a>). Kindlin-2 also recruits ILK, which binds in the vicinity of the kindlin-2 PH domain and links integrins to actin and additional signaling pathways (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The short-lived nature of the initial spreading of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and talin-depleted (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) cells\u00a0shows that talin concludes the integrin-mediated adhesion process in NAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) and induces the maturation of FAs. The formation of paxillin-positive FAs in cells expressing the PH domain-deficient kindlin-2 suggests that the recruitment of paxillin to FAs occurs either in a kindlin-independent manner or through a modification of kindlin in a second binding motif."

In addition, the proposed survival defect shown in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a> is non-existent as the talin and the kindlin KO cells survive very well (only 0.5 to 1% of them undergo apoptosis). Importantly, the immunoblotting experiments in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> are superficial. They need to be extended to include cells not treated with Mn<sup>2+</sup> as well as talin KO cells reconstituted with talin. In addition, the phosphorylation of paxillin, Akt at residue T408 (the required PDK1 site), p70-S6K, S6, 4E-BP1, Raf, MEK and ERK has not been studied. Finally, that FAK kinase activity necessarily plays a role in signaling downstream of kindlins is not convincing as PF-228 is used at 5 \u03bcM (25x dose required to inhibit FAK 397 in most cells)."

The most definitive way to address the issue is to purify fibronectin-binding integrins from surface-labeled cells by affinity chromatography on Fn-CBD in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and subject the eluted proteins to IP with anti-\u03b1-v, \u03b1-5, \u03b2-1, \u03b2-3, and \u03b2-5."

Mn<sup>2+</sup> activation clearly does partially rescue the adhesion defect of both talin and kindlin deficient cells, but the AFM profiles for talin and kindlin deficient cells look completely different in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. This should be emphasized in the text. Is it assumed that only the first 5s AFM time point assesses \"activation\" and later timepoints assesses \"integrin clustering\"? It is difficult to see from the AFM figures that Mn<sup>2+</sup> induced \"stronger integrin-ligand bonds\" than non-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), as the controls (non-Mn<sup>2+</sup> treated cells) are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. If the authors assume the same degree of integrin activation in talin and kindlin KO cells in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, this should be examined directly. To assess activation, effects on 9EG7-binding in talin and kindlin deficient cells vs controls in the absence and presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, should be quantified, for example by flow cytometry. In addition, soluble binding assays should be performed (as the authors have done previously in Montanez et al, 2008). The authors have attempted to assess clustering of the integrins in talin KO and kindlin KO cells in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. It is clearly difficult to assess specific vs spatially-driven clustering in cells with such different morphology, and therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the role of kindlin in integrin clustering in these cells. In the Results section, the authors state that \"the integrin-activating compound Mn<sup>2+</sup> can only partially substitute for the adhesion promoting roles that talin and kindlin accomplish together\", however, it is stated that \"we circumvented their integrin activation defect with Mn<sup>2+</sup>\". If there is a severe activation/adhesion defect in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (especially for Kindlin-KO cells), this clearly also has implications for outside-in signaling profiles the cells."

Also, the statement about a connection between the reduced Akt signaling and proliferation \"which provides an explanation for their reduced proliferation\u2026\" is too strong, as this hypothesis has not been tested here. Kindlin deletion has also been shown to affect other signaling pathways such as TGF-\u03b2 signaling and proliferation, etc. Do cells which express kindlin that cannot bind paxillin display reduced Akt activation and proliferation? Does expression of active FAK influence Akt activation or proliferation? Does the cell survival defect of kindlin and talin KO cells unspecifically affect their adhesion and signaling profiles?"

Similarly, Mn<sup>2+</sup> increased the adhesion of the Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, although less so than the control cells. Since there is evidence that the interaction of integrins with ligands is a multi-step process with adhesion strength increasing as the time of contact between integrin and ligand increases, the interpretation of the these experiments, i.e., the kindlin stabilizes integrin ligand complexes with time by inducing or maintaining integrin clusters is not necessarily the only conclusion."

This should be emphasized in the text. Is it assumed that only the first 5s AFM time point assesses \"activation\" and later timepoints assesses \"integrin clustering\"?

To assess activation, effects on 9EG7-binding in talin and kindlin deficient cells vs controls in the absence and presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, should be quantified, for example by flow cytometry. In addition, soluble binding assays should be performed (as the authors have done previously in Montanez et al, 2008). The authors have attempted to assess clustering of the integrins in talin KO and kindlin KO cells in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. It is clearly difficult to assess specific vs spatially-driven clustering in cells with such different morphology, and therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the role of kindlin in integrin clustering in these cells.

Yes, the first 5s AFM time point assesses very early adhesion events (i.e. \"activation\") established by integrins binding to FN. At later time points (&gt;5s) cell adhesion is considerably strengthens and therefore may reflect the clustering of integrins. Such time dependency of cells establishing adhesion to ECM proteins has been frequently reported in SCFS experiments. The early binding events at short contact times between cell and substrate (within few seconds) are dominated by the binding of single integrins (or CAMs). At extended time ranges (above a few tens of seconds) the integrins (or CAMs) cluster thereby strengthening cell adhesion to the substrate (Taubenberger et al., Mol Biol Cell. 2007; Friedrichs et al., JBC 2008). Thus from insight provided previously we can safely assume that the cell adhesion increasing with higher contact times is due to integrin clustering."

These cells are small, rounded, have small finger-like protrusions and display similar distributions and aggregations of integrin localizations on their surface. It could well be that neither talin nor kindlin is required for clustering. However, these small, non-spread cells may cluster their integrins simply because of a lack of space on the cell surface. We changed the text to make this point clearer."

We therefore performed \u03b21 integrin immunoprecipitation experiments after DSP crosslinking of adherent and suspension cells and used \u03b21 YY/AA expressing cells that carry point mutations in the talin and kindlin binding sites as control. We frequently detect reduced co-IPed kindlin-2 and talin which would argue against a constitutively association with \u03b21 integrin tail. However, the results varied depending on the DSP crosslinking time and would require more time and alternative assays to fully address this issue. As the conclusions in our manuscript do not depend on the question if kindlin-2 and talin are constitutively associated with \u03b21 integrin we did not include this data into the revised manuscript."
