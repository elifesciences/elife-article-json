However, these cells harbor significant risks, including tumor formation upon transplantation. One way to mitigate this risk is to develop expandable progenitor cell populations with restricted differentiation potential. Here, we used a cellular microarray technology to identify a defined and optimized culture condition that supports the derivation and propagation of a cell population with mesodermal properties. This cell population, referred to as intermediate mesodermal progenitor (IMP) cells, is capable of unlimited expansion, lacks tumor formation potential, and, upon appropriate stimulation, readily acquires properties of a sub-population of kidney cells. Interestingly, IMP cells fail to differentiate into other mesodermally-derived tissues, including blood and heart, suggesting that these cells are restricted to an intermediate mesodermal fate."

However, these cells harbor significant risks, including tumor formation upon transplantation. One way to mitigate this risk is to develop expandable progenitor cell populations with restricted differentiation potential. Here, we used a cellular microarray technology to identify a defined and optimized culture condition that supports the derivation and propagation of a cell population with mesodermal properties. This cell population, referred to as intermediate mesodermal progenitor (IMP) cells, is capable of unlimited expansion, lacks tumor formation potential, and, upon appropriate stimulation, readily acquires properties of a sub-population of kidney cells. Interestingly, IMP cells fail to differentiate into other mesodermally-derived tissues, including blood and heart, suggesting that these cells are restricted to an intermediate mesodermal fate."

In this study, we used a multifactorial high-throughput screening technology (<a href=\"#bib14\">Flaim et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brafman et al., 2012</a>) to engineer in vitro microenvironments that allow for the homogenous expansion of a hPSC-derived mesodermally restricted progenitor population, which we refer to as mesodermal progenitors (MPs). Gene expression analysis and differentiation assays indicated that these cell lack tumor forming potential and exhibit properties associated with intermediate mesoderm, an observation that led us to re-name MP cells as intermediate mesodermal progenitor (IMP) cells. Upon modulation of their culture conditions, IMPs readily generate cell types of the renal lineage. Interestingly, IMP cells fail to differentiate into other mesodermal lineages, such as blood and cardiac muscle. Therefore, IMP cells provide a useful tool to not only study the mechanisms that regulate human mesoderm development but also a homogenous, non-tumorigenic cell source for regenerative medicine purposes."

This analysis confirmed that the combination of CHR and FGF yielded the highest level of GFP expression and cell number. Since bioactive molecules like CHR (or Wnt) and FGF often exhibit distinct effects at varying concentrations, we performed a dose response analysis to identify optimal CHR and FGF concentrations. The optimal CHR dose was 1.0 \u00b5M while the dose of FGF was less dynamic, with its effects saturating at 20 ng/ml FGF (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

We also examined to what extent this optimized culture condition could support long term growth and expansion of cells with mesodermal properties (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which we preliminarily referred to as MP cells. In addition, we extended this analysis to include two additional cell lines, BJ-RiPS and HUES9 cells. When seeded at a density of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, cells formed and grew in tight clusters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Cells with these morphological properties were expanded by serial passaging with approximate doubling rates of 60.2 \u00b1 4.2 hr (H9 = 55.4 hr, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; Hues9 = 61.8 hr, RiPS = 63.4 hr, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and expressed the proliferation marker Ki-67 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Cell counts taken at each passage revealed that 1 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> cells could theoretically be expanded to approximately 1 \u00d7 10<sup>12</sup> cells over 10 passages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These cells maintained 46 chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that cultured cells did not acquire abnormal chromosome numbers commonly associated with late passage hPSCs. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that expression of genes associated with pluripotency (<i>OCT4</i>, <i>NANOG</i>, <i>SOX2</i>) was rapidly lost during expansion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This loss of pluripotency-associated properties was further confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) staining (OCT4 and NANOG, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) and flow cytometry (TRA-1-81 and SSEA4, <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). In contrast, genes associated with the mesoderm (ME) lineage (<i>MESP1</i>, <i>MIXL1</i>, <i>LHX1</i>) were upregulated and maintained over 10 passages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). IF staining confirmed the presence of MIXL1 protein in these expanded cell cultures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Using flow cytometry, we furthermore showed that the expanded cells shared a cell surface signature of CD56+ CD326\u2212 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 8</a>), previously defined for a multipotent mesoderm-committed cell population (<a href=\"#bib13\">Evseenko et al., 2010</a>).

Among the 12 MP cell injections (2 injections per mouse ranging from 0.5 million to 1 million cells), only one site maintained a small lump (\u223c1 mm in diameter), which did not grow in size over 12 weeks. In contrast, all 6 hPSC injections (0.5 million cells per injection) produced readily visible teratomas (greater than 10 mm in diameter).

Comparison of expressed genes in MP and ME cell populations confirmed a high degree of similarity, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9522 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Although this analysis revealed that MP cells are more similar to transient ME populations than they are to other cell populations examined, they are also distinct from ME cells. In contrast to ME cells, MP cells exhibit significantly lower levels of pluripotency regulators, including <i>POU5F1</i> (<i>OCT4</i>) and <i>SOX2</i>. Several established early mesodermal markers (<i>T</i>, <i>MIXL</i>) were significantly elevated in ME cells relative to MP cells, suggesting that MP cells have progressed beyond this transient and early ME phenotype."

By using the ACME screening technology, we were able to simultaneously define and optimize derivation and expansion conditions for these intermediate mesodermal progenitor (IMP) cells. Although it was our initial intention to produce a progenitor cell population with broad differentiation potential into all mesodermally-derived tissues, we made the surprising finding that the differentiation potential of these IMP cells was restricted to the IM lineage. Consequently, we were unable to coax IMP cells to differentiate into cell types derived from LM, such as blood and CMs. This exquisite lineage restriction was particularly surprising in light of the expression of multiple pan-mesodermal marker genes, such as <i>LHX1</i>, <i>MESP1</i> and <i>MIXL1</i>. Given their ability to differentiate into cell types with gene expression patterns associated with renal lineages, we hypothesize that this IMP cell population is an in vitro counterpart to intermediate mesoderm. It will be interesting to investigate whether IMP cells are capable of differentiating into other derivatives of intermediate mesoderm, such as the Wolffian and M\u00fcllerian ducts of the developing reproductive system."

                        "text": "Generation of expandable, lineage restricted progenitor cell populations offers several advantages over the use of undifferentiated hPSCs in tissue engineering approaches. First, differentiated cultures derived directly from hPSCs often harbor undifferentiated cells, which retain the potential to seed tumor growth. Such tumor-initiating potential is problematic when cells are intended for transplantation to repair or replace damaged tissue. Based on our sub-cutaneous injections into immune-compromised mice, IMP cells do not grow into teratomas, a defining property of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells. Our gene expression analysis provides further evidence of this loss of pluripotency and hence of teratoma-seeding potential: IMP cells express nearly undetectable levels of pluripotency markers, such as <i>POU5F1</i>/<i>OCT4</i> and <i>SOX2</i>, both of which show residual expression in mesodermally differentiated hPSCs. Second, lineage-restricted progenitors require less elaborate manipulation to derive more mature cell populations. In the case of the IMP cells, early differentiation steps to usher cells into a mesodermal lineage are no longer needed, thereby truncating differentiation protocols to derive more mature cell populations. A third benefit for using expanded progenitor cells is that such cultures are often quite homogenous. In contrast, hPSC cultures instructed to differentiate into a specific lineage generally contain other cell types. Therefore, the yield of more mature cell types upon subsequent differentiation is higher when starting with a homogenous, lineage restricted cell population than when starting with undifferentiated hPSCs."

Additionally, IMP cells grown in these optimized conditions can be frozen and thawed without any detectable effect on proliferative capacity or differentiation potential. Finally, these optimized conditions allow for near unlimited expansion to quantities (\u223c10<sup>20</sup>) necessary for drug screening or regenerative medicine purposes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

Specifically, high levels of WNT signaling instructed NP cells to adopt a posterior fate, consistent with WNT's role in posterior patterning during development. In a separate study, the level of WNT activation achieved through GSK3-\u03b2 inhibition was found to directly influence the ME subtype of differentiating hPSCs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mendjan et al., 2014</a>). We speculate that continuous activation of the WNT and FGF signaling pathways is acting not only to stabilize the IMP cell state, but also to restrict its differentiation potential to cell types derived from the IM lineage."

To direct cells to the mesoderm lineage, the media was switched to serum free differentiation media (consisting of RPMI 1640, 1\u00d7 B27 minus Insulin, and 1% [vol/vol] penicillin-streptomycin). Cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M CHIR-98014 (CHR, Tocris) for the first 24 hr and then allowed to recover for an additional 24 hr without CHR. Tissue culture plates were incubated with ECMP coating buffer (PBS with 15 ng/ml Collagen I [C1], 15 ng/ml Collagen III [C3], 15 ng/ml Collagen IV [C4], 50 ng/ml FN, 15 ng/ml VN) overnight at 37\u00b0 with volume sufficient to coat the surface area of the well.

Optimal CHR concentration varied with cell line; Hues 9 MP cells propagated in colonies most efficiently at 0.25 \u00b5M while BJ RiPS cells did so at 0.05 \u00b5M. Manual picking of colonies in passage 1 improved MP/IMP expansion. Differentiated cells around colonies were scraped away before passaging. Half the media was changed the day after passaging and then full media changes were made every other day thereafter. For routine passaging, MP/IMP cell cultures reaching 85% confluency were dissociated using a 0.5 mM EDTA (in Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free PBS, pH 8.0) at RT for 5 min. MP cells were removed from the plate via gentle washing with the EDTA solution. Using this method, MP cells were routinely passaged every 5\u20138 days."

Deep sequencing was performed on an Illumina (San Diego, CA, United States) Genome Analyzer II. Analysis of genome-wide expression data was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib35\">Trapnell et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2013</a>). Briefly, raw reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19) using TopHat. Cufflinks was used to assemble individual transcripts from the mapped reads. Cuffmerge was used to merge the assembled transcripts from the two biologically independent samples. Cuffdiff was used to calculate gene expression levels and test for the statistical significance of differences in gene expression. Reads per kilobase per million mapped reads were calculated for each gene and used as an estimate of expression levels.

They use an arrayed cellular microenvironments (ACME) system to identify and optimize culture conditions to support derivation of this population of cells, and show that this MP population differentiates readily along the renal lineage, but does not generate blood or cardiac cell fates. Overall, the reviewers found the manuscript interesting and the data of high quality. The reviewers agreed that the cellular microarray technology employed is clever and of potential broad interest to other groups seeking to generate defined cell types from pluripotent cells, as establishing appropriate in vitro conditions to \u201ccapture\u201d the desired cell fate is often a bottleneck for such endeavors. While the ACME system itself has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brafman et al., 2012</a>), its application to hPSC differentiation has not previously been reported. Also, the new protocol described for the generation of expandable mesodermal precursors is novel, and likely to be useful for a number of other laboratories and studies. However, all three reviewers raised concerns that the testing done thus far of renal differentiation is inadequate. A more stringent assessment of the potential of these cells is needed for publication in <i>eLife</i>, and the reviewers have provided specific suggestions to address this point below."

Using a single cell disassociation and re-aggregation assay, the authors show that the MP cells incorporate around a cap-mesenchyme-like structure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The problem is that this by no means shows renal lineage differentiation. The MP have a location consistent with FoxD1<sup>+</sup> mesenchyme, which go on to develop into renal stroma. But there is no co-staining for FoxD1 to prove that these cells have actually differentiated into the renal lineage. Nor is there co-staining for Six2 to delineate the location of the cap mesenchyme. It is surprising that the MPs apparently do not integrate into the Six2<sup>+</sup> cap mesenchyme \u2013 which should be present in this reaggregation assay \u2013 given that the authors show the potential of these cells to express Six2, or at least a fraction of them. The embryonic rat spinal cord assay results are similarly hard to interpret. ECAD and LTL expression are evident, but there is no clear tubule-like structure. Others have published very nephron-like structures using this assay, and even glomerulus-like structures. The Six2 expression is punctate, and scattered across the cell population. In nephrogenesis, Six2<sup>+</sup> cells aggregate adjacent to one another, in the cap mesenchyme sitting on top of the ureteric-bud. These structures have all been published by others using the two assays shown here, but there is no real incorporation of the MP cells into nephron-like structures. The study therefore requires better evidence of true differentiation into renal lineage and incorporation of MP-derived cells into nephron-like structures in order to prove that this new line has actual renal potential and should examine the histogenetic potential of the MP-derived cells in both types of explant systems employed. A more informative study would be to harvest the MP-derived cells from the two types of explants and ascertain the differentiation endpoints of these cells by transcriptome analysis (e.g. RNA-Seq) against the kidney cells (as for the analysis of the MM cells in vitro, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Additionally, the developmental potency of the MP cells may be studied by testing if MP cells alone can generate both metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud/nephron progenitors, as shown previously for hESCs in other studies. The authors should consider the type of analysis published by Little (Nat Cell Bio 2014 January;16(1):118\u201326) and Belmonte (Nat Cell Bio 2013 December;15(12):1507\u201315). In these studies, researchers took their candidate cells and, using the same reaggregation assays these authors used in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>, clearly showed by high power confocal, that their human ES-derived cells integrated into differentiated structures. In Little's case, into Six2<sup>+</sup> cap mesenchyme as well as into a tubule-like structure. At present, the current manuscript shows no integration \u2013 just the presence of HuNu<sup>+</sup> cells around an epithelial structure. This reaggregation assay needs to be pushed further, i.e., (1) to generate real tubules and determine if any cells integrate, (2) to co-stain for cap mesenchyme (Six2) and determine if the cells integrate there, and (3) to co-stain for stromal progenitors (FoxD1) and ask if cells integrate there. Alternative, but also less stringent options, might be to extend the spinal cord assay in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8DE</a> to determine if tubules are formed that contain lumens, polarized expression. These studies must use high power images, as the low power ones available in the current manuscript are insufficient to discriminate the morphological features. Finally, if it proves technically difficult to evaluate the morphogenetic potential of the MP-derived cells in these explants, an in-depth molecular profiling of the MP-derived cells in the explants could be performed to establish the identity of these cells at the endpoint of the culture experiment."

These structures have all been published by others using the two assays shown here, but there is no real incorporation of the MP cells into nephron-like structures. The study therefore requires better evidence of true differentiation into renal lineage and incorporation of MP-derived cells into nephron-like structures in order to prove that this new line has actual renal potential and should examine the histogenetic potential of the MP-derived cells in both types of explant systems employed. A more informative study would be to harvest the MP-derived cells from the two types of explants and ascertain the differentiation endpoints of these cells by transcriptome analysis (e.g. RNA-Seq) against the kidney cells (as for the analysis of the MM cells</i> in vitro<i>,</i> <a href=\"#fig7\"><i>Figure 7</i>A</a><i>). Additionally, the developmental potency of the MP cells may be studied by testing if MP cells alone</i> can <i>generate both metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud/nephron progenitors, as shown previously for hESCs in other studies. The authors should consider the type of analysis published by Little (Nat Cell Bio 2014 January;16(1):118\u201326) and Belmonte (Nat Cell Bio 2013 December;15(12):1507\u201315). In these studies, researchers took their candidate cells and, using the same reaggregation assays these authors used in</i> <a href=\"#fig8\"><i>Figure 8A\u2013C</i></a><i>, clearly showed by high power confocal, that their human ES-derived cells integrated into differentiated structures. In Little's case, into Six2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cap <i>mesenchyme as well as into a tubule-like structure. At present, the current manuscript shows no integration \u2013 just the presence of HuNu</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>cells around an epithelial structure. This reaggregation assay needs to be pushed further, i.e., (1) to generate real tubules and determine if any cells integrate, (2) to co-stain for</i> cap <i>mesenchyme (Six2) and determine if the cells integrate there, and (3) to co-stain for stromal progenitors (FoxD1) and ask if cells integrate there. Alternative, but also less stringent options, might be to extend the spinal cord assay in</i> <a href=\"#fig8\"><i>Figure 8DE</i></a> <i>to determine if tubules are formed that contain lumens, polarized expression. These studies must use high power images, as the low power ones available in the current manuscript are insufficient to discriminate the morphological features. Finally, if it proves technically difficult to evaluate the morphogenetic potential of the MP-derived cells in these explants, an in-depth molecular profiling of the MP-derived cells in the explants could be performed to establish the identity of these cells at the endpoint of the culture experiment.</i>"
