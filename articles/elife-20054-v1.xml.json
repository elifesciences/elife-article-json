Marks.Brandeis University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), operating under Animal Welfare Assurance #A3445-01, approved the use of vertebrate animals (rats) in protocol #0910-09 to Suzanne Paradis.The neurons are studied by various techniques, including electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry and microscopy. Invertebrate model systems are not useful here because the proteins we study are not present in their genome. Where possible we use tissue culture cells, however, much of the work focuses on how native ion channels are expressed and regulated. Rodents are the lowest phylogenetic order in which we can carry out the experiments we propose. Rats are also the standard organism for studies of cerebellar granule neuron physiology and are well established in the field as the organism of choice for the studies proposed. Thus, there is an extensive literature against which to compare and interpret the experimental results. Rats are frequently the source of neurons for cultures due to the large size of their brains and the relative robustness of their neurons in culture. The rat is a well-accepted model for studying ischemia in vitro, providing several advantages: a) the vulnerability of the rodent nervous system to hypoxia-ischemia is well-characterized, b) that rat shares identical mechanisms of ischemia-induced neuronal death with humans and c) procedures for minimizing discomfort, distress, pain, and injury as well as for euthanasia are extensively studied and ours follow AVMA guidelines."
