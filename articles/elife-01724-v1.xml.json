In this study, we reconstitute full-length hKif15 and its microtubule-targeting factor hTpx2 in vitro to gain insight into the motors mode of operation. We reveal that hKif15 is a plus-end-directed processive homotetramer that can step against loads of up to 3.5 pN. We further show that hKif15 is the first kinesin that effectively switches microtubule tracks at intersections, enabling it to navigate microtubule networks, such as the spindle. hKif15 tetramers are also capable of cross-linking microtubules, but unexpectedly, this does not depend on hTpx2. Instead, we find that hTpx2 inhibits hKif15 stepping when microtubule-bound. Our data reveal that hKif15 is a second tetrameric spindle motor in addition to the kinesin-5 Eg5 and provides insight into the mechanisms by which hKif15 and its inhibitor hTpx2 modulate spindle microtubule architecture."

In this study, we reconstitute full-length hKif15 and its microtubule-targeting factor hTpx2 in vitro to gain insight into the motors mode of operation. We reveal that hKif15 is a plus-end-directed processive homotetramer that can step against loads of up to 3.5 pN. We further show that hKif15 is the first kinesin that effectively switches microtubule tracks at intersections, enabling it to navigate microtubule networks, such as the spindle. hKif15 tetramers are also capable of cross-linking microtubules, but unexpectedly, this does not depend on hTpx2. Instead, we find that hTpx2 inhibits hKif15 stepping when microtubule-bound. Our data reveal that hKif15 is a second tetrameric spindle motor in addition to the kinesin-5 Eg5 and provides insight into the mechanisms by which hKif15 and its inhibitor hTpx2 modulate spindle microtubule architecture."

During the division process, a structure called the spindle forms in the cell. This spindle is made of thread-like extensions called microtubules that grow from two poles at opposite ends of the cell. These microtubules are responsible for getting the chromosomes to line up in the middle of the cell, and then pulling half of the chromosomes to one end of the cell, and half to the other end. The cell then divides into two daughter cells."

A cell that does not contain Kif11 can only divide if it contains extra copies of a second motor protein called Kif15: this suggests that Kif15 can serve as some sort of back up for Kif11."

Cancer cells, on the other hand, divide in a way that is not controlled. Drugs that interfere with Kif11 have been developed in the hope that they will stop cancer cells dividing, but these drugs have not been very effective in clinical tests, possibly due to the Kif15 back up. Scientists hope, therefore, that a better understanding of the role of Kif15 may lead to improved cancer treatments."

These experiments showed that Kif15 motor proteins can travel long distances along a single microtubule, and can also switch to a different microtubule at intersections. This movement of Kif15 is stopped when they bump into Tpx2 proteins, which are sitting on the microtubules. Together, these proteins can also form links between microtubules that can withstand high forces. These properties provide a starting point to understand how Kif15 can act as a back up for Kif11 in cells. In the future, it will be important to work out how Kif11 and Kif15 motor proteins work together in teams to build the spindle."

                        "text": "The human mitotic spindle is a microtubule-based protein machine with bipolar geometry that mediates chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dumont and Mitchison, 2009</a>). Initial assembly of the spindle requires the separation of centrosomes by the homotetrameric plus-end-directed molecular motor Kif11 (Eg5)\u2014a member of the kinesin-5 family (<a href=\"#bib25\">Tanenbaum and Medema, 2010</a>). In vitro reconstitution experiments reveal that Kif11 can drive the outward sliding of anti-parallel microtubules thus providing a mechanistic basis for centrosome separation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kapitein et al., 2005</a>). Although essential for centrosome separation, Kif11 is not required to maintain subsequent spindle bipolarity due to the compensatory activity of the Kinesin-12 Kif15 (hKlp2) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, overexpression of hKif15 can overcome the absolute requirement for hKif11 in centrosome separation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</a>). This functional redundancy has led to a model in which hKif15, like Kif11, can slide apart anti-parallel microtubules. Kinesin-12 proteins from <i>Xenopus (xKlp2)</i>(<a href=\"#bib30\">Wittmann et al., 1998</a>), sea urchin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Rogers et al., 2000</a>), and rat (<a href=\"#bib12\">Liu et al., 2010</a>) are dimeric plus-end-directed motors that are targeted to the spindle by the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) Tpx2 (targeting protein for xKlp2) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wittmann et al., 1998</a>). hKif15 is also recruited to the spindle microtubules by hTpx2 in human cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>) with the interaction between dimeric hKif15 and hTpx2 hypothesised to enable the motor to cross-link and slide anti-parallel microtubules (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>). However, this model has been challenged by recent cell-biological studies showing that hKif15 localizes to kinetochore (k)-fibres (parallel microtubule bundles) and contributes to the generation of forces that counter those generated by hKif11 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Vladimirou et al., 2013</a>). Understanding how hKif11 and hKif15 cooperate during mitosis has important implications for cancer therapy because the clinical efficacy of hKif11 inhibitors, currently used as monotherapy, has proven largely disappointing (<a href=\"#bib15\">Rath and Kozielski, 2012</a>). hKif15 is therefore emerging as a potentially important therapeutic target (<a href=\"#bib5\">Groen, 2013</a>). To understand how hKif15/hKif11 operate within the spindle, we will require a detailed mechanistic understanding of how each motor interacts with microtubules and generates force. Such information is already available for Kif11. In this study, we provide the first insight into the properties of the Kinesin-12 family motor hKif15."

Analysis of His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 on native PAGE revealed that the protein migrates at \u223c730 KDa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Given the predicted molecular weight of His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 (164.8 kDa) our data suggest the presence of hKif15 tetramers, although hydrodynamic analysis of the frog (xKlp2) and Sea urchin (KRP<sub>180</sub>) Kif15 orthologues indicated that the motor is dimeric with a sedimentation coefficient of 8.1S and 8.3S respectively (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wittmann et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Rogers et al., 2000</a>). To further characterise human Kif15, we subjected His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 to glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation on 5\u201340% glycerol gradients. At physiological ionic strengths (35 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 0-150 mM NaCl) both His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 and His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15-eGFP appear to be monodispersed and have apparent sedimentation coefficients of \u223c12S (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, increasing the salt concentration to 300 mM NaCl converts hKif15 into a species that runs at \u223c8S (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Taken together, our data show that hKif15 exists as a tetramer at physiological ionic strength that can be forced to dissociate into a dimer at high ionic strength. To further confirm that hKif15 can form tetramers we performed a size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), which allows determination of the absolute molecular weight. This analysis confirmed the presence of tetrameric hKif15 motors (molecular weight of 744.4 \u00b1 14.1 kDa) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <i>1</i><sup><i>st</i></sup> <i>peak</i>, <i>blue line</i>). We could also detect a dimeric population of motors (molecular weight of 360.1 \u00b1 6.5 kDa) indicating that there is some degree of complex dissociation in solution under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <i>2</i><sup><i>nd</i></sup> <i>peak</i>, <i>orange line</i>)."

These experiments were done in buffer conditions (BRB20, 50 mM KCl) that would be expected to preserve hKif15 in a tetrameric state (from here on hKif15-eGFP refers to single tetrameric motors). The majority hKif15 motors move either by directional movement towards the plus-end of individual microtubules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, \u2018<i>P</i>\u2019) or by bidirectional 1D-diffusion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, \u2018<i>D</i>\u2019, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>right</i>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <i>right</i>) along the microtubule lattice. These types of movement are equally likely at all salt conditions tested (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and single motors can switch between both modes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Processively moving, plus-end-directed motors move at a speed of 137.8 \u00b1 4.1 nm\u2022s<sup>\u22121</sup> median \u00b1 SEM, though we observed velocities up to 550 nm\u2022s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>left</i>). The run length of hKif15 motors is 1.9 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5m median \u00b1 SEM (<i>max.</i> 9.6 \u00b5m) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>middle</i>) and their residency time 26.3 \u00b1 2.8 s median \u00b1 SEM (<i>max.</i> &gt;180 s) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>right</i>).

Additionally, when motors reach the microtubule end, more than 90% remain attached (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <i>left</i> note orange column). Motors dwell at the tip for 18.8 \u00b1 3.5 s median \u00b1 SEM (<i>max.</i> &gt;152 s) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, (asterix), <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a><i>, left</i>) and may switch to diffusional movement on the end-proximal microtubule lattice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). While the majority of hKif15 motors either moves directionally to the plus-end or diffuses along the lattice, we also observed a small proportion of motors that move processively towards the minus-end of polarity-marked microtubules (87.5% plus-end-directed motors vs 12.5% minus-end-directed motors, n = 504) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <i>right kymograph, \u2018MP\u2019</i>). Minus-end-directed motors move at a speed similar to plus-end-directed motors, but have a significantly reduced run length/residency time and do not undergo directional reversals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Furthermore, processive tetramers are evident throughout the velocity distribution (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

                                "text": "Within the mitotic spindle, motors will experience varying loads and thus it is essential to understand how a motor responds to force. We therefore investigated the mechanical properties of hKif15 motors using our single-bead laser trap set-up (<a href=\"#bib2\">Carter and Cross, 2005</a>). Single hKif15 motors were adsorbed onto 550-nm diameter polystyrene beads and steered to the microtubule surface with the laser trap at which point the motor can bind to the lattice (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). With the trap turned off (zero-load) the mean velocity of beads moving on the microtubule was consistent with our measurements of hKif15-eGFP by TIRF microscopy (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Next, we held the bead in the trap and allowed the motor to walk along the microtubule, away from the centre of the trap. The motion of the bead reports the stepping actions of the motor. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> shows two position traces in which hKif15 motors make a number of processive steps along the microtubule before detaching at relatively low loads between 1.5 and 3.5 pN. We also observed that beads move out the trap before moving back in the opposite direction without detaching (<i>green arrowhead</i>). These events may reflect the minus- and plus-end-directed diffusive motion observed in our TIRF experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Together with our TIRF microscopy, we conclude that hKif15 is a homotetramer that undergoes either diffusive movement along microtubules, processive plus-end-directed stepping over long-distances or short duration movements to the minus-end."

                                "text": "Our single molecule TIRF experiments also revealed a remarkable property of hKif15 motors as they approach microtubule intersections. The well-studied kinesin-1 will normally pass intersections and only in rare cases the motor will pause or switch microtubule tracks (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ross et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, hKif15 motors show significantly elevated pause and switch events at intersections. Every fifth motor that approaches an intersection switches its microtubule track (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1 and 2</a>). In general all events\u2014pass, switch, pause, and dissociation at intersections\u2014are equally likely. In this way, hKif15 is able to roam microtubule networks and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> demonstrates that one tetramer (see <i>bleaching steps, lower panel</i>) can indeed navigate along several different microtubules: the motor starts processive movement on microtubule #1 (trace A), eventually dissociates and rebinds to microtubule #2. On this, the motor diffuses a short distance (trace B) and dissociates again, just to rebind to microtubule #1. It processively follows microtubule #1 (trace C) and sequentially switches to microtubules #3 (trace D) and #4 (trace E), ending at the plus-end of microtubule #4 without detaching from the microtubule lattice(s) once again (see also <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Thus, Kif15 is a processive motor that is able to navigate microtubule networks by effectively switching microtubule tracks."

To establish, whether tetrameric hKif15 indeed is able to cross-link microtubules on its own, we carried out experiments, in which biotinylated HiLyte-647-labelled GMP-CPP-microtubules were attached to a cover slip followed by addition of short XRhodamin-labelled GMP-CPP-stabilized- \u2018transport\u2019 microtubules and 1.4 nM tetrameric hKif15-eGFP. By drawing kymographs, we found that hKif15 could mediate the cross-linking of microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) on its own, but that there was very little microtubule\u2013microtubule sliding activity. Besides pivoting microtubules, we did observe episodes of bidirectional short duration sliding indicating a tug-of-war (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <i>right</i>) and rarely the transport of short microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <i>left</i>): behaviours that were recently reported for the yeast Kinesin-8 Kip3 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Su et al., 2013</a>). However, we have no clear evidence to support the idea that hKif15 can drive continuous extensile sliding of anti-parallel microtubule bundles like hKif11. This is presumably because the motors frequently pause during processive excursions on the lattice and dwell at the ends for a long period (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). Consistent with this, we only observed discontinuous short distance movement and pivoting of microtubules (around their ends) on surface-bound hKif15 motors, but not continuous microtubule sliding in microtubule gliding assays (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4 and 5</a>)."

However, cell-biological experiments showed that hTpx2 is essential for hKif15 to be recruited to the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>). To resolve this contradiction, we first analysed possible complex formation of recombinant hKif15 and hTpx2 in solution by ultracentrifugation in glycerol gradients. With nanomolar concentrations of each protein, we could not observe any complex formation over a range of different salt conditions (50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 0/150/300/450 mM NaCl [data not shown] and 35 mM sodium phosphate buffer [<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>]). However, a 30-fold excess of hTpx2 dimers (2.5 \u00b5M hTpx2 [dimer] + 80 nM hKif15 [tetramer]) allowed the formation of a hKif15-hTpx2 complex of \u223c14.0S, which included approximately one third of the provided hKif15 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <i>lower gels</i>). The dissociation constant of the hKif15\u2013hTpx2 complex is likely to be in the \u00b5M range arguing that its formation in vivo is less likely. In contrast, using a microtubule sedimentation assay, we observed that at low nM concentrations, hTpx2 (30 nM, dimer) does enhance the affinity of hKif15 (15 nM, tetramer) binding to GMP-CPP stabilised microtubules when in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (the fitted K<sub>d</sub> increasing \u223ctwofold from 993 nM to 490 nM; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This observation could explain why cell-biological experiments show that association of hKif15 with the mitotic spindle depends on hTpx2 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>). It is, however, unclear why hTpx2 further increases the microtubule binding affinity of a motor that is already highly processive."

During this period, the bead can maintain microtubule attachment at forces that\u2014in the absence of hTpx2\u2014would have forced dissociation of the motor (compare also with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, hTpx2 increases the force-holding capability of microtubule-bound hKif15. We can rule out a generic \u2018roadblock\u2019 inhibition-mechanism: Firstly, kinesin-1 motility is unaffected by the presence of hTpx2 (n = 5; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <i>green traces</i>). Secondly, hTpx2 already inhibits hKif15 motility at low nanomolar concentrations when only single molecules are present on the lattice. Kinesin-1 motility in the presence of hTpx2 also shows that inhibition of bead motility in case of hKif15 is not simply mediated by hTpx2-bead-microtubule interactions. Thus, hTpx2 is a selective inhibitor of hKif15 motor stepping presumably by forming stable trimeric hKif15-hTpx2-microtubule complexes."

This finding is in line with initial cell-biological experiments that concluded that these two motors are redundant with Kif15 becoming essential for spindle assembly when hKif11 is inhibited (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, hKif15, like Kif11, is only able to step under low loads in the 1\u20133 pN range (<a href=\"#bib10\">Korneev et al., 2007</a>). However, our data show that Kif15 motors have a number of biophysical properties that distinguish it from Kif11: while both motors are able to undergo plus-end-directed movement or 1-D diffusion (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kwok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Kapitein et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, \u2018<i>A</i>\u2019), the median velocity of hKif15 is 10-fold higher than that of Kif11 and processive runs have a fourfold longer duration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Korneev et al., 2007</a>). In the case of hKif15, both these movement types occur at the same ionic strength. In contrast, processive and diffusive movement by Kif11 is exclusive and depends on the ionic strength (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kapitein et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, to our knowledge, pauses during processive runs have not been reported for Kif11."

It is easy to comprehend how dynein switches between microtubule tracks, as this motor is capable of making variable step sizes, significantly larger than 8 nm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). However, kinesins step with a step size of \u223c8 nm (<a href=\"#bib23\">Svoboda et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Valentine et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Yardimci et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Huckaba et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Jannasch et al., 2013</a>) suggesting that it is unlikely for a single hKif15 motor domain-pair to mediate switching without leaving the lattice. In this regard, we show that within our 500 ms time resolution single motors do not leave the lattice during switching (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Furthermore, switching events often include a pause at the intersection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, traces \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018E\u2019). As hKif15 is a motile tetramer, we propose that a switch starts with attachment of the second, free head-pair to the lattice of the intersecting microtubule, while the first, engaged head-pair of the same molecule stays attached to the old track. This hKif15 bridge can now pause at the intersection or resolve by detachment of the second domain-pair into a pass or by detachment of the firstdomain-pair into a switch event (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, \u2018<i>B</i>\u2019<i>+box</i>)."

Thus, even with a moderate median run length of 2 microns, a single molecule would have a high probability of reaching the plus-end (kinetochores) of the k-fibre, regardless of any discontinuity within the fibre or roadblocks owing to structural microtubule-associated elements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, \u2018<i>B</i>\u2019<i>+box</i>). In contrast, short running, non-switching hKif11, that additionally is constantly gathered at the spindle poles by a dynein-dependent minus-end-directed flux (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ma et al., 2010</a>), cannot travel far enough into the k-fibre network to reach the kinetochore/plus-end. In vivo data backs up this hypothesis, as hKif11 localises mainly to the spindle pole and fades towards the spindle midzone, while hKif15 is localised uniformly along the k-fibres (<a href=\"#bib27\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</a>). Moreover, Kif15 motors also modulate the capacity of k-fibre microtubule bundles to generate an inward-directed force within the spindle (in opposition to hKif11) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</a>). One possibility is that, due to their prolonged end dwell time, hKif15 motors may influence plus-end dynamics at kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, \u2018<i>C</i>\u2019). Such is the proposed role of the Kinesin-8 Kif18a, which is reported to dampen microtubule dynamics in vitro (<a href=\"#bib3\">Du et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Stumpff et al., 2012</a>)."

Such cross-links may be reinforced by inhibitory hTpx2 (see below) turning dynamic hKif15 crosslinks into static structural hKif15/hTpx2 crosslinks that can resist higher forces than hKif15 only crosslinks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, \u2018<i>D</i>\u2019+<i>box</i>). Our data does not, however, provide any evidence that hKif15 drives a Kif11-like continuous extensile sliding of anti-parallel microtubules in vitro, though we cannot rule out that in vivo other additional factors are involved in such an activity. This factor is unlikely to be hTpx2 since our data shows this protein to inhibit the stepping of hKif15. How this mechanism is regulated within the spindle will be an important future work, but the fact that hTpx2 and hKif11 are constantly transported to the spindle pole (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ma et al., 2010</a>) might hint to a partition of the spindle into a hKif11 active zone around the poles and a hKif15 active zone towards the spindle equator."

Polymerised microtubules were washed once with BRB80+Taxol using a Beckman Airfuge and resuspended in 35 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT. Samples were mixed in the same buffer at the indicated concentrations (16.5 nM tetrameric hKif15, 33 nM dimeric hTpx2) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 mM ATP or AMP-PNP. Samples were spun for 20 min at 45k rpm in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) using thick-wall polyallomer tubes (Beckman Coulter). The supernatants were TCA precipitated and analysed together with the resuspended pellets by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ. Since taxol stabilised microtubules are less stable in 35 mM sodium phosphate over long time periods and that hTpx2 has a stabilising effect on microtubules, we also quantified the actual amount of precipitated tubulin in order to compare both setups with and without hTpx2. This gives rise to the horizontal error bars in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>."

A bead-binding event was defined as a bead that remained attached to the microtubule for at least 2 s after the laser trap has turned off. Each bead was tested for binding on two or more different microtubules. Bead-binding data was fitted with two poisson probability curves using a linear least-squares method (<a href=\"#bib22\">Svoboda and Block, 1994</a>). This analysis showed that our experimental hKif15 and Kinesin-1 data fit a \u22651 poisson distribution (the probability that a bead binds by one or more motors), rather than the \u22652 distribution (the probability that a bead binds by two or more motors). These data confirm that we are observing single motor (i.e., tetramer) motility at the low concentrations we used in our trapping experiments (3.3 and 6.5 nM hKif15, see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

The trapped bead was focused close to the lower cover-glass surface during these solution changes, this offered some boundary layer protection during the solution flow and also greatly reduced the chances of a second bead entering the trap. Following recordings in the presence of hTpx2, a further 3\u20134 cell volumes of assay buffer were passed through the flow cell to make the final recordings following hTpx2 wash out. Bead position data were recorded at 88 kHz and averaged down to 22 kHz for analysis and storage."

This is because of the different bead binding statistics between dimeric motors and tetrameric motors in which the two dimers are part of the same molecule and therefore inter-dependent (let us call them <i>virtual dimers</i> for the moment). The binding of the virtual dimers to the bead population is inter-dependent and therefore non-random (i.e., when a bead binds a motor it will always adsorb two virtual dimers at once). This is unlike the situation with classical dimeric motors where binding to beads would be random (i.e., dimers bind independently of each other to the beads). Given this, what is the consequence, if both virtual dimers of a tetramer were required to mediate binding of a bead to a microtubule? In this situation virtual dimers would produce a higher fraction of microtubule-bound beads when compared to the same concentration of independent dimers. In our opinion the binding behavior would not fit a \u2265 2 poisson distribution. As a result, we do not think it is possible to discriminate whether one or two dimers of the tetramer contribute to microtubule binding."

In this context we would like to note that our data from the trap (like the data from TIRF) shows that the same beads can undergo different modes of motility (i.e., diffusion, processive stepping \u2013 see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These transitions may be or may be not associated with different MT-association configurations of the tetramer (one or two dimer pairs attached). This uncertainty further precludes us from making strong conclusions as how the tetrameric hKif15 motors engage the microtubule. Future work will no doubt focus on investigating how hKif15 coordinates its four motor domains."
