Previous studies have shown that altered MeCP2 levels result in aberrant neurite outgrowth and glutamatergic synapse formation. However, causal molecular mechanisms are not well understood since MeCP2 is known to regulate transcription of a wide range of target genes. Here, we describe a key role for a constitutive BDNF feed forward signaling pathway in regulating synaptic response, general growth and differentiation of glutamatergic neurons. Chronic block of TrkB receptors mimics the MeCP2 deficiency in wildtype glutamatergic neurons, while re-expression of BDNF quantitatively rescues MeCP2 deficiency. We show that BDNF acts cell autonomous and autocrine, as wildtype neurons are not capable of rescuing growth deficits in neighboring MeCP2 deficient neurons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These findings are relevant for understanding RTT pathophysiology, wherein wildtype and mutant neurons are intermixed throughout the nervous system."

Previous studies have shown that altered MeCP2 levels result in aberrant neurite outgrowth and glutamatergic synapse formation. However, causal molecular mechanisms are not well understood since MeCP2 is known to regulate transcription of a wide range of target genes. Here, we describe a key role for a constitutive BDNF feed forward signaling pathway in regulating synaptic response, general growth and differentiation of glutamatergic neurons. Chronic block of TrkB receptors mimics the MeCP2 deficiency in wildtype glutamatergic neurons, while re-expression of BDNF quantitatively rescues MeCP2 deficiency. We show that BDNF acts cell autonomous and autocrine, as wildtype neurons are not capable of rescuing growth deficits in neighboring MeCP2 deficient neurons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These findings are relevant for understanding RTT pathophysiology, wherein wildtype and mutant neurons are intermixed throughout the nervous system."

RTT patients show regression of head growth followed by various neurological symptoms including seizures, mental retardation, stereotypic hand-wringing movements, breathing irregularities, ataxia and autistic behavior (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rett, 1966</a>). Mouse models with <i>Mecp2</i> mutations display similar neurological phenotypes, and have been quite critical in defining the pathophysiology of RTT. <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> mice grow normally until 4\u20136 weeks of age, after which they display RTT-like symptoms such as reduced mobility, hindlimb clasping, abnormal breathing patterns and premature death (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Guy et al., 2001</a>). Similarly, mice engineered to express twice the endogenous levels of MeCP2 (<i>Mecp2<sup>Tg1</sup></i>) are characterized by seizures, forepaw clasping, hypoactivity, increased aggression, and around 30% die by one year of age (<a href=\"#bib17\">Collins et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jugloff et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Luikenhuis et al., 2004</a>). Loss or doubling of MeCP2 in primary mouse hippocampal neurons results in reduction or enhancement of synaptic response respectively, primarily due to the number of glutamatergic synapses formed (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chao et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, restoring MeCP2 levels rescued neurological defects associated with loss of MeCP2 the extent of which depends on timing of activation and dynamic variation in MeCP2 levels (<a href=\"#bib24\">Giacometti et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guy et al., 2007</a>). Besides MeCP2, manipulation of target genes regulated by MeCP2 by genetic means or by indirect and nonspecific mechanisms has resulted in alleviating various features of RTT (<a href=\"#bib22\">Deogracias et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kondo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kron et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ogier et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schmid et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tropea et al., 2009</a>)."

Similarly, endogenous MeCP2 knockdown reduced dendritic length in E18 hippocampal neurons, which was fully rescued upon BDNF overexpression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Larimore et al., 2009</a>). Considering that BDNF is an important regulator of neurite outgrowth and synapse formation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Finsterwald et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gottmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McAllister et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Park and Poo, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Poo, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tolwani et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), it is essential to understand effects of BDNF modulation in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons specifically in steering neuronal growth and glutamatergic synapses.

Importantly, blocking the BDNF pathway converted wildtype neurons to a phenotype that mimicked MeCP2-deficiency induced defects. These findings add to the current picture of BDNF signaling in stabilizing various features of RTT patients and are crucial for the profound understanding of BDNF-mediated therapeutic strategies and more generally, pathophysiology of the RTT disease."

We now asked if disruption of BDNF binding to TrkB could negate effects of BDNF overexpression in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons. The low molecular weight TrkB ligand, ANA-12, selectively binds to the TrkB receptor thereby blocking BDNF-induced TrkB activation and inhibiting intracellular signaling cascades downstream of TrkB (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cazorla et al., 2011</a>). Application of ANA-12 to the BDNF overexpressing <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons reverted both synaptic output (evoked EPSC amplitude: 2.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47 nA, p&lt;0.001 and RRP size: 0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 nC, p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G and I</a>) and morphological phenotypes (synapse number: 151\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010, p&lt;0.01; dendrite length: 748\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046 \u00b5m, p&lt;0.05; soma size: 93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.05 and nucleus size: 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) back to <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> control levels. Control groups included WT and <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons both with and without application of ANA-12. Interestingly, <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons treated with ANA-12 did not undergo any further loss-of-function effect and remained comparable to <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> control neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G and\u00a0I</a>) indicating that the BDNF-TrkB canonical pathway was quantitatively disrupted in MeCP2-deficient neurons. On the other hand, WT neurons treated with ANA-12 displayed morphological as well as synaptic deficits and behaved similar to <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u00a0and I</a>). As before, PPR and P<sub>vr</sub> remained unchanged in all conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J\u2013L</a>). These results strongly suggest that BDNF synthesis and an active BDNF-TrkB pathway are essential for normal neuronal growth in WT as well as RTT-like hippocampal glutamatergic neurons."

Thus, we reveal that BDNF synthesis was clearly impaired in glutamatergic neurons lacking MeCP2. To further test the specificity of phenotype rescue, an alternate neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF), was overexpressed in WT and <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We found that NGF failed to restore normal synaptic transmission, emphasizing the specificity of the role of BDNF-TrkB in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u00a0and C</a>).

If BDNF deficiency is responsible for the synaptic and growth deficits in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i>\u00a0glutamatergic neurons, does paracrine signaling play a role in ameliorating loss of synapse number and function? This is particularly relevant for RTT patients wherein neighboring WT neurons may be impaired in their ability to restore loss of synapse number in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons despite mosaic expression of WT and mutant MeCP2. In order to address this question, we designed an <i>in vitro</i> RTT model to examine putative paracrine BDNF activity. We co-cultured WT and <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> hippocampal neurons and labeled neurons and corresponding synapses. For this purpose, we pre-incubated neurons of either genotype with distinct lentiviral constructs expressing Synaptophysin-GFP tagged to nucleus-localized RFP (WT) and Synaptophysin-mKate tagged to nucleus-localized GFP (<i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i>) to identify origin of synapses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>-left panel).

These findings led us to two major conclusions. (i) Decreased synapse number and nucleus size in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons <i>per se</i> indicate a cell autonomous role for MeCP2 in regulating normal growth in glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belichenko et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blackman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kishi and Macklis, 2010</a>).

To test this, we repeated the above experiment in the presence of a TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) that binds to its extracellular domain and activates TrkB-mediated downstream signaling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jang et al., 2010</a>).

Similarly, <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> synapses already overexpressing BDNF remained unaltered indicating that sufficient TrkB stimulation was already prevalent in these neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

In our study, we find a generalized growth and differentiation defect in glutamatergic <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons with MeCP2-deficient neurons displaying reduced neurite outgrowth and soma area (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In examining causal mechanisms, we find a critical role for BDNF. The specific loss in neuronal growth can be attributed to suppression of BDNF synthesis since both synaptic output and morphological phenotypes could be restored by lentivirus-mediated and exogenous application of BDNF, in a TrkB-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Moreover, we show that blocking BDNF-TrkB signaling in wildtype neurons leads to a MeCP2-deficient state, strongly arguing for nearly complete suppression of the canonical BDNF-TrkB pathway in mutant neurons. Further, we demonstrate that the BDNF-mediated growth pathway is strictly cell autonomous since (i) neighboring wildtype neurons fail to rescue <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neuronal morphological deficits in a RTT model <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and (ii) MeCP2-deficient neurons have smaller somata as well as nuclei in both two- and eight-week old <i>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), given the reduced BDNF protein levels in <i>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2006</a>) and reduced mRNA levels in postmortem brain samples from RTT patients (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abuhatzira et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Deng et al., 2007</a>).

Along these lines, endogenous MeCP2 knockdown reduced dendritic length in E18 hippocampal neurons, which was fully rescued upon BDNF overexpression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Larimore et al., 2009</a>), which is in agreement with our rescue data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Differential BDNF function based on brain region and neuronal subtypes has been emphasized across various studies.

Additionally, several peptidergic hormones and secretory molecules including Wnt (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cadigan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Papkoff and Schryver, 1990</a>), Semaphorin 3A (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouzioukh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">De Wit et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sahay et al., 2005</a>) and BDNF (<a href=\"#bib20\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>) have been shown to remain membrane resident after secretion. Indeed, we verified this hypothesis by examining the fate of BDNF secretion in WT and <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> hippocampal neurons using the BDNF-superecliptic pHluorin (BDNF-SpH) live-cell imaging assay (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kolarow et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (Refer Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We measured activity-dependent BDNF release by 60 mM KCl-induced depolarization, and quantified surface fraction of BDNF-SpH by application of pH 5.5 MES-buffered acid solution. We found that a significant fraction of BDNF-SpH remained membrane-resident as evident from MES-buffered acid quenching experiments (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u00a0and G</a>), without affecting activity-induced BDNF secretion in both WT and <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). This complements our previous findings and shows that stable membrane deposits of BDNF could potentiate TrkB receptor activation cell autonomously and drive glutamatergic synapse number by confining activity to its own neurites. Additionally, the fact that activity-dependent regulated BDNF release was unaffected in MeCP2-deficient glutamatergic neurons suggested that the observed synaptic phenotypes were accounted for by a deficit in constitutive BDNF release. Further studies specifically measuring pre- and postsynaptic release of BDNF from WT and <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> cultured glutamatergic neurons are essential to determine the locus of activity-dependent regulation of excitatory synapses."

There seems to be a link between intrinsic activity and growth in WT neurons by allowing BDNF to work on its own neurons, coupling neuronal firing patterns to their basic growth properties. This further implies that reduced activity in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tropea et al., 2009</a>) may disrupt activity-dependent neuronal growth. This deficiency could be repaired by supplying an additional source of BDNF (or TrkB agonist) that activates WT-like TrkB signaling. BDNF has been suggested to act as an autocrine factor mainly in regulating dendrite development in adult-born granule cells (GCs) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2015</a>) and promoting axon formation in embryonic hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>). In RTT pathophysiology in particular, we show for the first time that this localized autocrine function and cell autonomy of BDNF-TrkB together offer a plausible mechanism and explain why MeCP2 mosaicism in RTT females is ineffective in restoring phenotypes at a cellular, network or behavioral level. It may be possible that BDNF released could be less efficient in reaching neighboring neurons in co-cultures; however, the cell autonomous effect observed in autaptic neurons <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in vivo</i>, as well as the autocrine BDNF dependence seen <i>in vitro</i>, argue against putative BDNF paracrine effects. However, what remains to be understood is if the predominant impact of impaired BDNF signaling on circuitry stems from the pre- or postsynaptic site. Initial morphological analysis showed axonal as well as dendritic growth deficiency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Further analysis in mixed co-culture experiments demonstrated a presynaptic deficit wherein densities of <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> glutamatergic synapses onto the postsynaptic neuron remained independent of genotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This points towards a major \u2018propagation\u2019 defect specifically in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons in a mosaic circuit wherein they receive synaptic input similar to WT neurons. However, MeCP2-deficient glutamatergic neurons show reduced capacity to communicate output signal to a postsynaptic neuron thereby reducing efficiency of innervation across specific brain regions and dampening synaptic output. In fact, one could postulate that glutamatergic neurons lacking MeCP2 are essentially not \u2018deaf\u2019 but \u2018mute\u2019. Interestingly, there is evidence of non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to neuronal development (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braunschweig et al., 2004</a>) and dendritic arborization of cortical pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kishi and Macklis, 2010</a>). In a mosaic brain, MeCP2-deficient mute neurons may contribute to reduced overall activity, which in turn could reduce activity-dependent BDNF secretion and thereby result in putative non-cell autonomous effects as well. Hence, future studies comparing wildtype and heterozygous <i>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice may help reveal additional non-cell autonomous effects <i>in vivo</i>."

For example, MeCP2-deficient GABAergic neurons show decrease in inhibitory quantal size with reduced Gad1 and Gad2 levels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chao et al., 2010</a>) while BDNF released from postsynaptic target neurons acts locally to modulate GABAergic synapse formation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kohara et al., 2007</a>). More generally, besides providing a mechanistic role for BDNF in MeCP2 mutant neurons, our results substantiate the significance of manipulating BDNF-TrkB interaction as a potential therapeutic strategy in alleviating the course of the RTT syndrome."

BDNF release was analyzed from both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. Background subtraction was done using Rolling Ball (50 pixel radius, ImageJ) for all image stacks and ROIs were marked to measure \u0394F, using ImageJ. 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 pixel regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and peak change in fluorescence (\u0394F) in response to KCl-induced stimulation normalized to initial fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub> = average of five frames immediately before onset of stimulus) was measured as a function of time and averaged in Axograph X (Axograph). Baseline subtraction was done for each ROI per cell in Axograph X, and \u0394F and \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> values for all groups were analyzed in Prism (GraphPad). Release events were characterized by their abrupt increase in fluorescence upon application of KCl followed by a rapid or gradual decrease of fluorescence back to baseline levels, and normalized to their corresponding peak NH<sub>4</sub>Cl events. The same ROIs were probed in recordings upon application of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or MES-buffered acid solutions. Acid quenched BDNF fraction was normalized to corresponding peak NH<sub>4</sub>Cl response, reflecting the non-internalized pool of BDNF vesicles that are either found on the neuronal surface or easily accessible from the extracellular space around the cell membrane."

At the very least, some of the observations should be repeated with an additional postsynaptic marker and the degree of correlation between pre-/post- identified synapses and pre-only synapses should be stated (for example Vglut and PSD95 would be good markers). In addition, it is important to rule out the possibility that synapse counts are influenced by the level of expression of the synaptic markers, as opposed to changes only in the physical presence or absence of synapses."

In addition, it was felt that the authors need to clearly articulate a plausible hypothesis as to why autocrine, but not paracrine BDNF signaling would rescue the phenotypes they measured. It was suggested that characterizing TrkB phosphorylation under the conditions of bath application, and BDNF overexpression may help reveal the difference between autocrine and paracrine effects."

Please also see Results subsection \u201cBDNF overexpression in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> autaptic neurons restores evoked EPSC magnitude, RRP size, synapse number, dendrite length, soma and nucleus size\u201d (for autaptic data) and \u201cBDNF-induced TrkB activation regulates glutamatergic synapse number in a cell-autonomous and autocrine manner\u201d (for co-culture data). In autaptic cultures, we found that nucleus size is smaller in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> glutamatergic neurons and restored to WT levels by BDNF overexpression in a TrkB-dependent manner. In co-cultured neurons, we found that nucleus size remains reduced in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> glutamatergic neurons although they are co-cultured with WT neurons. Furthermore, BDNF overexpression specifically in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons restored nucleus size up to WT levels. These findings demonstrate that change in nucleus size upon loss of MeCP2 is cell autonomous as well as BDNF-dependent in vitro. The analyses were done blind to genotype and treatment of neurons."

We found that the soma of neurons lacking MeCP2 were 20% and 14% smaller than those of MeCP2+ neurons in 2- and 8-week old <i>Mecp2</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice, respectively. This phenotype is similar to that of nucleus size data in vivo. These data suggest that both soma area and nucleus size were reduced upon loss of MeCP2 in a cell autonomous manner in vitro and in vivo. Since both in vitro and in vivo data on nucleus and soma show significant reduction in MeCP2-deficient neurons in a mosaic condition, it is safe to conclude that cell autonomy (both in vitro and in vivo data) and BDNF dependence (from in vitro data) play a critical role in regulating neuronal growth and glutamatergic synapse formation. Because of the short time frame for revisions, we were only able to analyze soma area of MeCP2+ and MeCP2- neurons in <i>Mecp2</i><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygous mice and uncovered further cell autonomous effects. Nevertheless, we have discussed the role of putative non-cell autonomous effects in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section."

We found that both VGLUT1 and Homer1 synaptic densities were reduced to a similar degree in MeCP2-deficient neurons and rescued to WT levels upon both BDNF overexpression and exogenous BDNF application. To check specificity, we treated WT and BDNF overexpressing <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> glutamatergic neurons with the anti-neutralizing BDNF antibody and found that restored pre- and postsynaptic densities were reverted to <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> levels. We also measured VGLUT1-Homer1 colocalized puncta as well as rate of colocalization of VGLUT1 to Homer1 and found decrease in colocalized puncta upon loss of MeCP2, rescued by BDNF overexpression and exogenous BDNF in a BDNF-dependent fashion. In congruence, Chao 2007 analyzed colocalized VGLUT-PSD95 synaptic puncta as well as rate of colocalization in <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons, and observed reduced VGLUT1-PSD95 puncta and reduced rate of colocalization, similar to our findings.

(ii) Specific restoration of glutamatergic synapse number and nucleus size in BDNF overexpressing <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons co-cultured with WT neurons shows that these phenotypes are regulated in a cell autonomous manner via autocrine BDNF signaling.

This indeed seems to be the case as seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, where BDNF overexpression in autaptic <i>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></i> neurons convincingly rescued both morphological and physiological phenotypes. Furthermore, this rescue mimicked exogenous BDNF application data, as seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, in a BDNF- and TrkB-dependent manner as shown by BDNF neutralization and TrkB antagonist experimental data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Additionally, commercial BDNF antibodies did not work effectively in our hands. Other elegant approaches to test specificity in future studies besides BDNF overexpression, neutralization and TrkB antagonist experiments, may include characterizing BDNF knockdown and rescue with exogenous BDNF. In the case of mixed co-cultures, we have strong proof of sufficient BDNF expression based on glutamatergic synapse number and nucleus size rescue data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>). These data also mimic the in vitro autaptic data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) as well as in vivo soma and nucleus data (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This co-culture data is particularly significant since we designed a unique in vitro experimental labeling technique to closely mimic Rett in vivo mosaicism, wherein we were able to locate synapse origin based on genotype. To our satisfaction, results matched autaptic and in vivo data, hence confirming robustness of the experimental design."

We were not able to label additionally for the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT since all 4 channels were utilized for MAP2, VGLUT1, Syp-mKate and Syp-GFP. However, in all fields of view analyzed from three hippocampal cultures, we observed that the vast majority of Syp+ synapses were also VGLUT1+.
