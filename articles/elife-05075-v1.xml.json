Such tinkering is responsible for the huge variations in the ways that organisms carry out their essential functions. We have become aware of species differences in DNA content (<a href=\"#bib1\">Atkin et al., 1965</a>), DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bird, 2002</a>), sex determination (<a href=\"#bib17\">Sander van Doorn, 2014</a>), staging of embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ginis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Silva et al., 2008</a>), length of gestation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Migeon, 2014</a>), dosage compensation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Migeon, 2011</a>), telomere length (<a href=\"#bib19\">Tackney et al., 2014</a>), the repair of chromosome breakage (<a href=\"#bib4\">Doseth et al., 2011</a>), ease of transformation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Rangarajan and Weinberg, 2003</a>) and expression of inborn errors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Elsea and Lucas, 2002</a>) among many other variations. This is true not only for different evolutionary kingdoms, classes, phyla, orders, but also for genera, and even among species. Such variations are attributable not only to random mutations, but also to the striking disparity in the staging of embryonic development between species. Species differences should not be ignored because they tell us so much about the determinants of these developmental events. Therefore, a mouse is a mouse and not a human surrogate."

Many readers cannot help but assume that it does, even when other published evidence indicates that such an assumption is erroneous. Not even <i>Xist</i>, the mammalian non-coding RNA that recruits chromatin modifiers to inactivate X chromosomes, is present in all mammals (<a href=\"#bib5\">Duret et al., 2006</a>). During mammalian evolution, invasions of repetitive DNA sequences have destroyed some genes in the X inactivation center, and other genetic elements have arrived on the scene (<a href=\"#bib11\">Migeon et al., 2001</a>)."

Therefore, I examined the tables of contents of various journals to find articles and reports concerning biological subjects, scoring each with respect to inclusion of the species studied in the title and in the abstract of the paper. If the species was not mentioned in the title I looked for it in the abstract. If not mentioned there, I then looked at the experimental methods or supplementary material to find the true subjects of the study. Note, my analysis did not require a specific species, only the kind of organism studied; the words <i>Bacteria</i> or <i>Yeast</i> were as acceptable as <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. When I repeated this exercise 2 years later I also asked if the experimental models were mentioned in other summary material provided by the journal.

The \u2018<i>In Brief</i>\u2019 statements published in <i>Cell</i> and the \u2018<i>Impact Statements</i>\u2019 published in <i>eLife</i> were even less likely to reveal the species studied: 72% of <i>In Brief s</i>tatements and 86% of <i>Impact Statements</i> did not mention the species examined (data not shown). Moreover, 45% of \u2018<i>Digests</i>\u2019 published by <i>eLife</i> did not mention the species being studied (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Table 1\u2014Source data 1</a>).

Although information about species can be captured by searching databases, readers should not have to. Species variation is key to the interpretation of findings, so the species used for the investigation should be a fundamental part of the resulting research paper and not something that can be discovered by searching an outside database."

Although in some cases, the function studied may be highly conserved and non-variant, often, species variations should be expected, even in conserved developmental processes. In some cases authors may be trying to make it difficult for those who abhor animal experimentation to know the subject of their study. This is most evident when non-human primates are used for the studies. But, my data suggest that often, the investigators, even if aware of species variation, do not consider it relevant enough to include in title or abstract. We need to be mindful that not including the subject of the study in the title or abstract implies that the results of the study are generally applicable to all species."

I know best the upshot in my own field: It took more than 30 years for the scientific community to accept valid evidence that humans are not like mice with respect to the details of X inactivation. Because of expectations that this developmental process would be similar among mammals, it has taken too many years and costly repetitive experiments for the community to accept the evidence that humans, unlike mice do not have paternal imprinting of X-linked genes in their placental tissues (<a href=\"#bib10\">Migeon and Do, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Moreira de Mello et al., 2010</a>). Papers that do not mention mice, the species being studied, in their title or abstract (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chelmicki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Payer and Lee, 2014</a>) continue to report mechanisms that have no consequence for humans or other mammals as the targeted non-coding RNA being reported in rodents is not functional in other mammalian species."

To test whether this might be true of other fields, she then asks whether the species examined in experimental studies is specifically mentioned in the titles and abstracts of recent publications in several prominent journals. She reports that species are not mentioned in the titles of the majority (63%) of articles and are often (25%) not mentioned in either the title or abstract. She suggests that this has had 'detrimental consequences for the scientific community'."

However we are not convinced that the failure to mention a species name in the title and abstract necessarily indicates that the importance of species differences has been neglected (see points 1 and 2 below).
