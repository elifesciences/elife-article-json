In the early 1970s, Ronald Konopka and Seymour Benzer discovered that mutations in the <i>period</i> gene in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i> caused its circadian clock to change (<a href=\"#bib5\">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</a>). Different versions of this gene resulted in flies with circadian clocks that ran fast, slow or not at all, but the flies were otherwise normal. Genetic and biochemical studies since then\u2014looking at a range of species including <i>Drosophila</i>, <i>Neurospora</i> fungi, hamsters and mice\u2014have revealed the existence of a relatively well conserved timekeeping mechanism."

This established the SCN as the \u2018master circadian pacemaker\u2019, and remains one of the best examples of a brain nucleus having a single dedicated function. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Satchidananda Panda and colleagues at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies\u2014including Megumi Hatori and Shubhroz Gill as joint first authors\u2014identify a gene that appears to give the SCN some of its circadian properties."

The clock of the SCN has characteristic responses to light exposure at different times of the day. It also produces a remarkably robust and stable oscillation, which can continue with the same period and phase in cells cultured in the laboratory for many months. It is clear that the individual SCN neurons can act as pacemakers; when dispersed in culture they independently continue to keep time (<a href=\"#bib8\">Welsh et al., 1995</a>). However, the unique circadian properties of the SCN appear to emerge from all the cells that make up the SCN as a whole. These properties depend on the SCN cells communicating with each other, largely through neuropeptide molecules that couple the neurons. This raises a question\u2014are there specific genes that confer this unique communication behavior on the SCN?"

Of particular interest were genes that are regulated by light at times when the animal's behavioral circadian phase is sensitive to light exposure, and which are also expressed preferentially in the SCN."

Hatori, Gill et al. then compared the set of transcripts present in the SCN with those of 82 other tissues, including 14 neural tissues, in order to find which genes are more common in the SCN. This revealed a single gene of interest: <i>Lhx1</i>. This gene expresses a transcription factor with a circadian rhythm, and the rate of transcription of <i>Lhx1</i> in a cell reduces dramatically when mice are exposed to light during the night."

Mice without any Lhx1 die during embryogenesis. Bedont et al. therefore used a \u2018floxed\u2019 version of <i>Lhx1</i>, which could be deleted from part of the brain called the ventral hypothalamus (which includes the SCN) early in development. In the absence of hypothalamic <i>Lhx1</i>, the SCN develops into a loosely connected group of individual oscillators, incapable of driving strong circadian patterns of behavior without a daily light signal coordinating their activity. Cells in the SCN are still able to function independently as pacemakers, but their ability to express neuropeptides is largely lost, so they struggle to communicate with each other. Only when the cells are able to express these peptides correctly do the cells coalesce to create the robust self-sustained oscillations characteristic of the SCN."

Every day, there are times at which the phase of the SCN is sensitive to light exposure (typically during dusk, night, and dawn) and other times of day when the phase is unaffected by light (the middle of the day). Two neuropeptides\u2014vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and arginine vasopressin\u2014are thought to contribute to this effect. When levels of these peptides (or their receptors) are reduced in mice, the SCN network becomes \u2018looser\u2019 and can more rapidly adapt to large jumps in the phase of the clock in response to altered lighting (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aton et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">An et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</a>). The cost of this weakened coupling, however, is a weaker output signal to the systems under clock control, resulting in weaker circadian rhythms when in free-running (constant) conditions\u2014for example, when in constant darkness."

These mice also displayed erratic free-running behavior in the absence of light cues, but adapted almost immediately to new light\u2013dark cycles that caused \u2018jetlag\u2019 in normal mice. It may be that the acute down-regulation of <i>Lhx1</i> after exposure to light causes a temporary weakening in the coupling between the neurons in the SCN by preventing them from communicating, which makes phase shifting easier."

At the tissue level this peptide expression allows the coupling of the SCN neurons that produces the circadian behavior of the SCN. When Lhx1 is active, the circadian rhythms are strong; without Lhx1, the rhythms are weaker. At the behavioral level the more robust clock that results from Lhx1 activity (middle row) is slower to adapt to shifted light schedules. The white and grey boxes indicate times when lights are on (white) or off (grey). Black marks are the hypothetical daily activity of a mouse in a running wheel. The mice are normally active when it is dark. When Lhx1 is expressed, the mice find it more difficult to adapt to a sudden change in the light cycle, which results in a lot of activity when it is light. When Lhx1 is absent (bottom), the mice are better able to adjust to restrict their activity to the hours of darkness."

These results highlight the continued power of genetic approaches to reveal the mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity, even as the unanswered questions move on from \u2018how do the circadian oscillators inside individual cells work?\u2019 to \u2018how does the coupling of clocks within the SCN occur?\u2019. These results also strongly suggest that Lhx1 and its downstream targets may be an attractive target for drug development, as temporarily inhibiting Lhx1 activity might significantly accelerate recovery from jet lag."
