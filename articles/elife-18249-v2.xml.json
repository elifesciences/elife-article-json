Although there is only 18% sequence identity between ubiquitin and SUMO1 (the founding member of the SUMO family [<a href=\"#bib27\">Okura et al., 1996</a>]), their structured domains share a common fold known as \u03b2-grasp, in which five \u03b2-strands wrap around an \u03b1-helix (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bayer et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). SUMOylation, like ubiquitination, is through an isopeptide linkage between a conserved Gly-Gly motif at the C-terminus of SUMOs and a lysine sidechain on target proteins. All SUMOs are translated as precursors that are first processed by the SENP family of SUMO-specific proteases, whereby a short C-terminal extension is cleaved to expose the reactive Gly-Gly motif. Like the much better-known posttranslational modification phosphorylation, SUMOylation is reversible, and de-SUMOylation is also catalyzed by SENPs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yeh, 2009</a>). The catalytic activity of SENPs on short peptide substrates is low, likely to avoid off-target cleavage, and is substantially enhanced by the \u03b2-grasp domain of SUMOs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mikolajczyk et al., 2007</a>). The mechanism of this allosteric activation has remained poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the allosteric mechanism through extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations."

SENPs belong to the cysteine protease superfamily, and regulate both physiological and pathological processes mediated by SUMOylated proteins (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yeh, 2009</a>). As an example, hypoxia (i.e., low oxygen), a condition common to fetal development and tumorigenesis, induces the nuclear entry and SUMOylation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2007</a>). SUMOylated HIF1\u03b1 is subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation, and hence deSUMOylation of HIF1\u03b1 by SENP1 is central to hypoxia response. For this and other reasons SENP1 is overexpressed during the development of prostate cancer, and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bawa-Khalfe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2013</a>).

The therapeutic value of these inhibitors is limited by covalent linkage with the catalytic cysteine residue, low specificity, or low potency. Better understanding of the mechanism for the allosteric activation of SENPs may lead to new avenues for drug development."

In SENP1, the catalytic triad comprises residues His533, Asp550, and Cys603 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The catalytic domain (residues 419\u2013644) consists of eight \u03b1-helices and seven \u03b2-strands, divided into two subdomains. The lower subdomain contains the \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b18 helices and the \u03b21-\u03b22 hairpin, while the upper subdomain contains the \u03b14-\u03b16 helices and the \u03b23-\u03b27 sheet. The two remaining helices, \u03b13 and \u03b17, glue the two subdomains and also form the bottom of a channel where the extended C-terminus of SUMO1 lies and the catalytic triad is situated. Three loops, including residues 464\u2013466 between \u03b12 and \u03b13, residues 530\u2013533 between \u03b24 and \u03b25, and residues 599\u2013602 between \u03b27 and \u03b17, line the channel and likely undergo transient motions during the entrance of the SUMO C-terminus into the channel. Hereafter these loops are referred to as loopA, loopB, and loopC, respectively. One tryptophan residue, Trp534, floors the substrate while another, Trp465, forms a lid over its conserved Gly-Gly motif. The burial of the catalytic center in the channel and consequently the transient motions around the channel necessary for proper alignment of the substrate with respect to the catalytic center may contribute to the low catalytic activity of SENPs on short peptides."

An insertion in the \u03b21-\u03b22 hairpin of SENP2 that extended the interface with SUMO2 resulted in no other change in the structure of the catalytic domain but nevertheless increased its catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alegre and Reverter, 2014</a>). Given that SENPs generally lack major conformational changes upon binding SUMOs, there is no simple explanation for the allosteric activation of SENPs by the \u03b2-grasp domain of SUMOs. In this context, we note that, in addition to conformational changes, the possibility that changes in conformational dynamics can mediate allosteric effects has received attention in the recent literature (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo and Zhou, 2016</a>)."

These authors confirmed the ability of a pre-bound \u03b2-grasp domain, as contained in a truncated SUMO1 construct (residues 1\u201392, hereafter referred to as trunSUMO1), to enhance the SENP1 catalytic activity on a short peptide substrate, and further traced the enhancement solely to an increase in <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>. Their NMR data showed that trunSUMO1 binding yielded a gradient in backbone amide chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) emanating from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center. Significant sidechain methyl CSPs were also observed on six residues that dotted the region from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center, which indicated to the authors that the allosteric effect was propagated through the hydrophobic core. Their Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion data showed that trunSUMO1 binding enhanced microsecond-millisecond (\u03bcs-ms) dynamics for residues around the catalytic center, suggesting a realignment of these residues. Chen et al.\u2019s NMR data provided residue-level information, but their sparseness precluded a full picture on how the allosteric communication occurred in SENP1 upon binding trunSUMO1."

The simulations showed that trunSUMO1 binding induces significant conformational and dynamic changes in SENP1, including widening of the exosite cleft and quenching of nanosecond (ns) dynamics in all but a distal region. Calculated backbone amide and sidechain methyl CSPs are in broad agreement with the experimental data of <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al. (2014)</a> but more pronounced, and our sidechain CSPs clearly identify two hydrophobic pathways, each within a subdomain, for allosteric communication from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center. The \u03b2-grasp domain, by serving as a bridge that links the two exosite interface regions, strengthens intra- and inter-subdomain motional coupling, which in turn may be the underlying reason for the quenching of ns dynamics and potentially may also be the instigator of inter-subdomain \u03bcs-ms dynamics (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guo et al., 2015</a>). The concerted action of the \u03b2-grasp induced conformational and dynamic changes is captured by a dock-and-coalesce mechanism for SENP-catalyzed SUMO cleavage, whereby the wedging of the \u03b2-grasp domain into the exosite cleft enables the docking of the proximal portion of the C-terminus, and the strengthened cross-channel coupling initiates inter-subdomain correlated motions to allow for the distal portion to coalesce around the catalytic center."

The movement of loopA (toward \u03b17) leads to stronger inter-subdomain contact; the <i>x</i> component of loopB\u2019s movement has a similar effect, while the <i>y</i> component may create space for the docking of the proximal portion of a C-terminus when tethered to the \u03b2-grasp domain."

The calculated backbone amide CSPs spread all the way to the back, in both subdomains. The calculation identifies three of the six experimentally detected residues as well as 12 others as having significant sidechain methyl CSPs (&gt;0.08 ppm). Interestingly, with the 12 additional residues, two hydrophobic pathways emerge, each connecting an exosite interface region in one subdomain to the catalytic center. Chemical shifts are a measure of both conformational and dynamics effects. Hence the sidechain methyl CSPs are a manifestation of the conformational and dynamic changes induced by \u03b2-grasp binding, and the hydrophobic pathways may represent short paths over which allosteric effects are propagated from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center."

This pattern was explained by a dynamic model of allostery. According to this model, fast motions (e.g., those on a ns timescale) are uncorrelated; an allosteric activator strengths inter-community coupling, which in turn leads to quenching of fast motions. The strengthened coupling here comes about because the \u03b2-grasp domain serves as a bridge that links the two interfacial regions. The model further predicts another dynamic effect, i.e., slower (e.g., \u03bcs-ms), cross-community correlated motions are initiated.

The binding of a substrate-containing SUMO (i.e., a precursor or SUMO conjugate) likely occurs in a sequential manner: the \u03b2-grasp domain first wedges into the exosite cleft and the C-terminus then docks into the catalytic channel. Tethering can facilitate this binding by correctly orienting the C-terminal substrate. This effect and the \u03b2-grasp induced widening of the exosite cleft together may speed up the docking of the C-terminus into the catalytic channel sufficiently as to make the full binding step rate-limited by the initial wedging of the \u03b2-grasp into the exosite.

Here we adapt this mechanism to describe the steps of SENP-catalyzed SUMO cleavage reaction just before the actual cut of the (iso)peptide bond (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The process starts with the wedging of the SUMO \u03b2-grasp domain into the SENP exosite cleft. This wedging widens the separation between and also tightly links the two exosite interface regions. The widening of the exosite cleft enables the docking of the proximal portion of the C-terminus into the catalytic channel. Moreover, the wedged \u03b2-grasp domain strengthens the motional coupling within and between the two subdomains of SENP, and the newly docked proximal portion of the SUMO C-terminus reinforces this coupling. According to a theoretical model (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guo and Zhou, 2015</a>), the strengthened coupling sets up the condition for the emergence of inter-subdomain correlated motions, which finally allow for the distal portion of the SUMO C-terminus to align properly around the catalytic center for bond cleavage."

For example, SENP1 processes preSUMO1 and deconjugates SUMO1 and SUMO2 conjugates with similar rates, but processes the SUMO2 precursor with a 25-fold lower <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shen et al., 2006a</a>). The decrease in <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> was attributed to a compromised fit between the C-terminal extension and the catalytic channel. On the other hand, in either processing or deconjugation, SENP2 discriminates between SUMO1 and SUMO2 not by <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> but by <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Reverter and Lima, 2006</a>). An approximately 10-fold lower <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> for SUMO2 was attributed to an extended exosite interface."

Two consequences can be expected of the more extensive exosite interactions of SENP2 with SUMO2 than with SUMO1. First, stronger electrostatic attraction across the exosite interface quickens the initial wedging of the SUMO2 \u03b2-grasp domain into the exosite and slows down the reverse process. Second, the more extensive exosite interactions likely cause stronger allosteric effects of the wedged \u03b2-grasp domain, resulting in faster docking of the SUMO2 C-terminus into the catalytic channel. These two consequences together may explain the lower <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> for SUMO2 than for SUMO1. A precedent of the second consequence occurred in Pin1, where peptides bound at an inter-domain exosite were identified to serve a bridging role similar to the one proposed here for the \u03b2-grasp domain; a peptide with more extensive across-domain interactions indeed induced stronger allosteric effects (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Guo and Zhou, 2015</a>)."

A similar causal link between strengthened exosite interactions and strengthened allosteric effects may be at play for a SENP2 mutant that was designed by grafting an insertion in the \u03b21-\u03b22 hairpin from SENP6 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alegre and Reverter, 2014</a>). The insertion extended the exosite lower interface and increased the proteolytic activity of SENP2 for some SUMO2 conjugates."

The foregoing discussion suggests that the exosite may be another potential target site for drug development. Suppression and elevation of SENP activities may both be desired (under different pathological conditions) and can be achieved by disrupting and strengthening exosite SENP-SUMO interactions, respectively. Small molecules that bind at sites deeply into the SENP-SUMO interface can have a disruptive effect (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kumar and Zhang, 2013</a>), whereas those bind over both SENP and SUMO can lock and strengthen their interactions."

The design of the simulations was motivated in part by previous NMR studies and in part by previous simulation study by the authors of a different system (PIN1). The mechanism that emerged from the simulations, referred to as a \"dock-and-coalesce\" mechanism, suggests that the binding of SUMO1 quenches fast (nanosecond) dynamics while stimulates slow (microsecond-millisecond) collective motions that couple distal regions together. In particular, the collective motion may facilitate structural rearrangements in the active site, therefore impacting the catalytic efficiency of SENP1."

The proposed mechanism is qualitatively consistent with reported experimental data (distinct effects on fast and slow dynamics), and it provides novel physical insights into the allosteric activation of SENP1 and related systems (e.g., DUB). The mechanism also provides new clues to the design of small molecules that target SENP1 activation."
