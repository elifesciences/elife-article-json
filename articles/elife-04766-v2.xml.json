                    "text": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a robust genome editing technology that works in human cells, animals and plants based on the RNA-programmed DNA cleaving activity of the Cas9 enzyme. Building on previous work (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jinek et al., 2013</a>), we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells. Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized. This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells."

Building on previous work (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jinek et al., 2013</a>), we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells. Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized. This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells."

Cells repair DSBs using the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. The NHEJ pathway generates variable insertions or deletions (indels) at the DSB, while HDR employs homologous donor DNA sequences from sister chromatids, homologous chromosomes or exogenous DNA molecules to produce precise insertions, deletions or base substitutions at a DSB site or between two DSBs. Such precise modifications are desired for targeted genome engineering."

NHEJ dominates DNA repair during G1, S and G2 phases, whereas HDR is restricted to late S and G2 phases when DNA replication is completed and sister chromatids are available to serve as repair templates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Heyer et al., 2010</a>). Impediments to HDR include competition with NHEJ in S and G2 phases and specific down-regulation of HDR at M phase and early G1 to prevent telomere fusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Orthwein et al., 2014</a>). Although chemical or genetic interruption of the NHEJ pathway can favor HDR (<a href=\"#bib24\">Shrivastav et al., 2008</a>), such manipulations can be difficult to employ, harmful to cells or both. Consequently, high cleavage activity of programmable nucleases does not necessarily correlate with efficient HDR-induced genome editing."

After 24 hr, cells were analyzed for HDR (specifically, exogenous donor template mediated HDR) or total editing (TE, defined as the sum of all NHEJ and HDR events that give rise to indels) at the Cas9 cleavage site within EMX1, showing that both aphidicolin and nocodazole led to pronounced increases in Cas9-mediated editing frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). The enhancement is more evident at lower Cas9 RNP concentration (30 \u03c1mol), improving HDR rates from \u223c9% in unsynchronized cells to \u223c14% with aphidicolin and \u223c20% with nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The highest HDR frequency achieved was 31% with nocodazole synchronization and 100 \u03c1mol of Cas9 RNP.

Strikingly, nocodazole synchronization enhanced the TE frequencies more than twofold and HDR frequencies over sixfold at all doses of Cas9 RNP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, nocodazole synchronization reduced the requirement for high Cas9 RNP concentrations, producing 5\u20136% HDR at 10 \u03c1mol of Cas9; 10-fold more Cas9 RNP was required to achieve the same HDR frequency in unsynchronized cells."

We reasoned that the short-lived Cas9 RNP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kim et al., 2014</a>) and timed delivery would minimize off-target editing and that potential toxicity might be minimized by using lower RNP amounts. We compared the TE and HDR frequencies at the EMX1 and DYRK1 target loci to those occurring at the top two predicted off-target loci (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hsu et al., 2013</a>) respectively by deep sequencing a representative biological replicate experiment from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>.

Most importantly, there was no detectable HDR at the off-target loci.

Although nocodazole synchronization increased the HDR/TE ratio by twofold at the EMX1 locus and fivefold at the DYRK1 locus, this ratio reached a maximum value of \u223c33% across all RNP doses, suggesting that the maximum capacity of the HDR machinery in HEK293T cells is to repair \u223c33% of DSBs.

To avoid signal saturation and better distinguish the HDR frequencies of different templates, we reduced the Cas9 RNP and HDR template concentrations to 30 \u03c1mol and 50 \u03c1mol, respectively. As observed previously, nocodazole synchronization produced higher HDR frequencies than observed in the unsynchronized cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Nocodazole blocks cells at M phase when the DNA is fully replicated and the nuclear membrane is broken down. One explanation may be that delivery of Cas9 RNPs into a nocodazole-synchronized cell effectively targets two cells because they divide upon release. Another possibility is that once the nuclear envelope is broken down, Cas9 RNPs can gain easy access to the DNA. The resulting high HDR frequencies without off-target editing provide an important advance for generating scar-less genetic modifications, including epitope-tagged alleles, reporter genes, precise insertions and deletions and point mutations. Together these results expand the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering in human cells and provide a foundation for further advances using Cas9 RNP delivery methods."

Cells were treated with aphidicolin (2 \u03bcg/ml) or thymidine (5 mM) for 17 hr, washed with media to remove the drugs, grown for 8 hr, and treated with a second dose of drugs for 17 hr. In the experiment in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, third panel, a single dose of aphidicolin (2 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the nocodazole synchronized cells immediately after nucleofection. Hydroxyurea (2 mM), lovastatin (40 \u03bcM), mimosine (200 \u03bcM) and nocodazole (200 ng/ml) require only one treatment for 17 hr. Two synchronization conditions were tested in the human ES cell experiment as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Human ES cells were cultured in 6 well dishes, split 1:10 3 days before adding nocodozole. The first condition was a simple nocodazole treatment for 16 hr. The second condition was modified from <a href=\"#bib21\">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</a>. The cells were treated with nocodazole for 16 hr, washed to remove the drug, and then treated with aphidicolin for 3 hr before nucleofection. We shortened the duration of aphidicolin treatment, because we noticed a substantial drop in cell viability at 10 hr. After transfection cells were either seeded at high density in a 96 well plate for analysis of editing or low density, 6-well plate, for imaging and long term growth."

The product was resolved on 2% agarose gel containing SYBR gold (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The band intensity was quantitated using Image Lab. The percentage of HDR was calculated using the following equation (b + c / a + b + c) \u00d7 100, where \u2018a\u2019 is the band intensity of DNA substrate and \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019 are the cleavage products."

First, the genomic DNA from the edited and control samples was isolated and PCR amplified 15 cycles using Kapa Hot start high-fidelity polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting amplicons were purified by AMPure beads to remove primers and subjected to five cycles of PCR to attach Illumina P5 adapters as well as unique sample-specific barcodes followed by bead purification. Berkeley Sequencing facility performed the AMPure bead cleanup. Barcoded and purified DNA samples were quantified by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), size analyzed by BioAnalyzer, quantified by qPCR and pooled in an equimolar ratio. Sequencing libraries were sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq Personal Sequencer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)."

This generated sample specific paired end raw read files (R1 and R2 fastq files). Adapter and windowed adaptive quality trimming was performed on the raw reads (using Trim Galore). Reads containing bases with a PHRED quality score of less than 30 were removed. R1 and reverse complemented R2 reads were then merged into sample specific fasta file. Smith Waterman alignments (EMBOSS Water) were performed for each sample reads against the corresponding 53 nucleotide reference locus. These 53 nt for each locus included the 23 nt target sequence with 15 nt flanking sequences. Alignments were filtered to assess presence of indels and homologous recombination. Reads were considered to have indels if their alignments were at least 53 nt long and had any gaps. Reads were considered non-indels if their alignments were at least 53 nucleotides long without any gaps. TE frequency was calculated as 100 x #indel reads/(#indel reads + #non-indel reads). Reads were considered to have homologous recombination if alignments were at least 53 nucleotides long and had a AAGCTTGCTAGC insertion for the EMX1 loci (both on and off target) and a GCTAGCAAGCTT insertion for the DYRK1 loci (both on and off target). HDR frequency was calculated as either 100 x #HDR reads/(#indel reads + #non-indel reads). Deep sequencing data is available at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA, BioProject: 269153)."

The ability of a cell to repair a DSB generated by Cas9 through HDR-mediated incorporation of exogenous DNA templates has recently been exploited to engineer several modifications to endogenous loci, such as novel knock-in alleles, point mutations and fluorescent tags, among others. However, the frequency of NHEJ is usually higher than HDR due to the fact that NHEJ does not require any homologous or exogenous DNA molecules to repair the DSB. Therefore, developing experimental methods that increase the frequency of HDR is important in order for this technology to fulfill its full potential in various laboratory studies as well as in clinical applications."

Using six pharmacological agents and further narrowing the list down to two (nocodazole, which is reported to block cells at late G2/M phase, and aphidicolin, which blocks cells at S phase), the authors convincingly demonstrate that these treatments, coupled with timed delivery of Cas9 RNPs and exogenous DNA templates, significantly increased the rate of HDR across two loci in two different cell types.

While this is clearly shown, the cell cycle effects that are associated with this treatment are not well characterized. Although the drugs employed are commonly used in the field, it is important to characterize them in the particular cell lines studied. The authors show cell cycle analysis in of HEK293T cells in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. However, for both nocodazole and aphidicolin treatment, the data appear to show significant 2n as well as 4n peaks. Thus, it is unclear what cell cycle phase might be associated with the increased HDR observed following release from these treatments. Regarding the experiments with H9 human ES cells, in which a combination of nocodazole and aphidicolin was used, there is no cell cycle analysis shown at all. It will be important to address both of these issues prior to publication."

Importantly, the rate of HDR reported was significantly lower in drug-treated H9 cells compared to drug-treated HEK293T cells. Moreover, induction of HDR in ES cells required a modification of the protocol to incorporate a 16-hour pulse of nocodazole followed by a 3-hour pulse of aphidicolin before Cas9 RNP nucleofection. One wonders how generalizable these methods will be to other cell types. Therefore, the manuscript would be strengthened with the addition of analysis of a panel of cell lines."

Using six pharmacological agents and further narrowing the list down to two (nocodazole, which is reported to block cells at late G2/M phase, and aphidicolin, which blocks cells at S phase), the authors convincingly demonstrate that these treatments, coupled with timed delivery of Cas9 RNPs and exogenous DNA templates, significantly increased the rate of HDR across two loci in two different cell types. Importantly, they also convincingly demonstrate that off-target editing is negligible using this approach</i>."

Regarding the HEK293T nocodazole cell cycle block, we have redone the cell cycle analysis and find that indeed the majority of cells are 4N. The same is true for primary fibroblasts and hES cells. Some 4N HEK293T cells are slipping through the M-phase checkpoint and initiating S-phase. This mitotic slippage phenomenon has been observed before in various cell lines treated with nocodazole and other anti-microtubule drugs (Riffell et al., 2009).

Although these findings indicate some variability according to cell type, the cell cycle synchronization procedure itself is often not generalizable across different cell types. Due to variations in physiology, growth rate and duration of cell cycle phases, one needs to determine and optimize the synchronization protocol empirically.
