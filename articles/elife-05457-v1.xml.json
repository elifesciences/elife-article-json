Here, in rats performing an auditory evidence accumulation task, we inactivated the frontal orienting fields (FOF) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), two rat cortical regions that have neural correlates of accumulating evidence and that have been proposed as central to decision-making. We used a detailed model of the decision process to analyze the effect of inactivations. Inactivation of the FOF induced substantial performance impairments that were quantitatively best described as an impairment in the output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long integration time constant (&gt;240 ms). In contrast, we found a minimal role for PPC in decisions guided by accumulating auditory evidence, even while finding a strong role for PPC in internally-guided decisions."

Here, in rats performing an auditory evidence accumulation task, we inactivated the frontal orienting fields (FOF) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), two rat cortical regions that have neural correlates of accumulating evidence and that have been proposed as central to decision-making. We used a detailed model of the decision process to analyze the effect of inactivations. Inactivation of the FOF induced substantial performance impairments that were quantitatively best described as an impairment in the output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long integration time constant (&gt;240 ms). In contrast, we found a minimal role for PPC in decisions guided by accumulating auditory evidence, even while finding a strong role for PPC in internally-guided decisions."

Now, by performing a series of experiments on rats, Erlich et al. have clarified the precise roles of two of these regions: the frontal orienting fields in prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex. In the experiments the rats listened to a series of clicks from two speakers, one to the left and one to the right, and then had to decide if more clicks came from the left or the right speaker."

So in the computer example, without the help of the frontal orienting fields, you would choose the laptop if the most recent piece of evidence was for the laptop, even if older evidence argued strongly for the desktop."

On accumulation trials, clicks play from the right and left speakers (right + left click rate = 40 clicks/s), terminating with the go cue. After the go cue reward is available at the side port associated with the greater number of clicks. The stimulus duration on each trial is set by the experimenter to be in the range 0.1\u20131 s.

Accumulation of evidence involves both maintaining a memory of evidence accrued so far and addition of new evidence to the memory, and is therefore linked to short-term memory processes. The rat FOF has delay activity that correlates with short-term memory, and plays a causal role in short-term memory for future orienting responses (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erlich et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the rat FOF is well-situated to play an important role in perceptual decision-making, since it receives inputs from multiple sensory cortices (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cond\u00e9 et al., 1995</a>), and it projects to the superior colliculus (SC; <a href=\"#bib78\">Stuesse and Newman, 1990</a>), a subcortical region that, in both rodents and primates, is involved in controlling orienting motions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Isa and Sasaki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Felsen and Mainen, 2008</a>) and is thought to be involved in decisions reported through such orienting motions. Moreover, the rat FOF is reciprocally connected with the rat PPC (<a href=\"#bib71\">Reep et al., 1987</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">1994</a>), which is currently considered a critical, central node in rodent perceptual decision-making (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</a>). The rodent PPC itself also has neural correlates of accumulating evidence (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>), and it shares with the FOF some of the key properties that suggest a causal role in decisions driven by accumulation of evidence. The rodent PPC has delay activity that correlates with performance on short-term memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakamura, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>), and, as shown through inactivations, plays a causal role in short-term memory for orienting acts (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>) and like FOF receives input from many sensory cortices as well as top-down input from prefrontal cortex, including FOF (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wilber et al., 2014</a>). For these reasons, the FOF and the PPC are the most prominent candidate regions in rodent association cortex for being important nodes in orienting decisions guided by accumulation of evidence. We focus on these two areas here."

Consistent with expectations drawn from neural correlates in the rat FOF, inactivation of the FOF impaired performance in the task. We used quantitative modeling to characterize which aspect of the accumulation and decision process was impacted by inactivation of the FOF. The results of these analyses revealed a specific location for the FOF in the causal circuit underlying the Poisson Clicks behavior: the behavioral impairment caused by FOF infusions could be parsimoniously and quantitatively explained as an impairment in the premotor output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long accumulation time constant (240 ms or more). It is possible that the decision itself (i.e., the categorization of the graded accumulator value into a discrete choice, which is a process subsequent to graded evidence accumulation) could occur in the FOF."

Different parameter value regimes of this model can implement many different strategies, such as responding based on the first few clicks, or last few clicks, or to a burst of clicks, and many others. Consistent with previous results, maximum likelihood fits resulted in best-fit parameters associated with a gradual evidence accumulation strategy. Most importantly for this study, this strategy was characterized by a long accumulator time-constant, just under 1 s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which is the duration of the longest stimuli used here. As expected for a gradual accumulation strategy in which clicks from the entire stimulus are weighted equally, performance improved for longer stimuli with the same underlying click rates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Usher and McClelland, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al., 2013</a>), and a psychophysical reverse correlation analysis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Raposo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al., 2013</a>) indicates that rats used clicks from all times of the stimuli to make their decision (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

We subsequently used a smaller dose of 75 ng per side (Note: this is half the dose used in the bilateral PPC experiment described below).

This indicates that the effect of FOF inactivation was not simply an overall motor effect. Furthermore, the inactivations produced no observable effects outside of the behavioral task. Infused animals appeared normal in their home cages both immediately after the infusion and after the behavioral session. Our localized inactivations thus contrast with previous literature, in which large permanent unilateral lesions of the rat prefrontal cortex (including but extending well beyond the FOF), produced persistent, ipsiversive circling in the lesioned animals (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crowne and Pathria, 1982</a>)."

                                "text": "Which aspects of the evidence accumulation and decision process were impaired by the FOF inactivations? To address this question, we took advantage of the accumulator model of <a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al. (2013)</a>, which uses the knowledge the precise time of each click in each individual trial, as well as the rat's decision on each trial, to estimate 9 parameters that characterize the accumulation and decision processes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Each parameter quantifies a specific aspect of the decision process. For example, <i>\u03c4</i>, the time constant of the accumulator (also described by the parameter <i>\u03bb</i> = 1/<i>\u03c4</i>), characterizes the time period over which the subject accumulates evidence. A negative value of <i>\u03bb</i> indicates a leaky accumulator, a positive value of <i>\u03bb</i> indicates an unstable accumulator, and perfect accumulation would have <i>\u03c4</i> = \u221e (i.e., <i>\u03bb</i> = 0). Another example parameter is the lapse rate, which quantifies the fraction of trials in which the subject behaves as if it had ignored the clicks that were played and had instead made its decision randomly. Deviations from the perfect values (<i>\u03bb</i> = 0, lapse = 0) in either of these parameters can give rise to psychometric curves with shallow slopes, and both types of imperfections can produce curves qualitatively similar to the experimental curve obtained after bilateral FOF inactivation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). But the similarity between the psychometric curves for the two imperfections is partly due to the fact that these psychometric curves ignore the specific timing of individual clicks. In contrast, because the two imperfections would have very different signatures in terms of how clicks at different times affect the rats' decisions, and click timing is fully taken into account in the behavioral model, the model can clearly distinguish the two imperfections. Using the control data, the best-fitting parameter values for the behavioral model had <i>\u03c4</i> \u2248 0.8 s\u2013indicating that subjects accumulated information over almost the entire stimulus duration but were on average slightly unstable\u2013and a lapse rate of \u22480.1 (black cross, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). For data from bilateral inactivation sessions, the maximum likelihood parameter values (center of blue likelihood peak, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) changed significantly. The inactivation data now had a dramatically different and much shorter accumulation time constant of the opposite sign to the control data, <i>\u03c4</i> \u2248 \u22120.24 s (leaky accumulation over only a quarter of a second). In contrast, the best-fitting lapse rate remained essentially unchanged from control. As described above, attempting to fit the inactivation data by keeping the time constant unchanged and increasing the lapse rate could qualitatively match the psychometric curve (magenta line, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), but it produced an extremely poor fit relative to the full behavioral model (magenta cross in low likelihood region, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, after bilateral FOF inactivation, the subjects behaved as if their lapse rate was unchanged, and their accumulator had become much leakier (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The change in <i>\u03bb</i> is both significant and substantial, and accounts for most of the change in performance. The change in decision boundary, \u00de (pronounced \u2018sho\u2019) is significant but very small, corresponding a horizontal shift in the psychometric curve of only one click. It is largely due to the difficulty of performing a perfectly balanced bilateral infusion. In particular, one rat, A077, was strongly biased during the bilateral FOF inactivations (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). On average, the noise and lapse parameters also increased but due to large covariance between these parameters, it is not possible to say which of them was significantly shifted (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>)."

The log likelihood of the best \u00de model was \u22121221.6, substantially worse than the model in which all 9 parameters were allowed to vary (\u22121102.5). Using Bayesian or Akaike Information Criteria (BIC or AIC; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burnham and Anderson, 2004</a>), we find that the extra parameters are indeed justified (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Second, we fit the bilateral FOF data to a 1-parameter <i>\u03bb</i> model where only the accumulation time-constant could change. For this model, the best-fit value of <i>\u03bb</i> was \u221212.4 and the log likelihood of the model was \u22121121.1 compared to \u22121102.5 for the best 9-parameter model, a difference of only 18.5.

(<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) contains only one parameter, the decision boundary \u00de, that can generate a left/right bias. We therefore extended the model with three additional parameters, each of which represented a possible imperfection that could generate a side bias. Simultaneously fitting all 12 parameters substantially increased the computational difficulty of the fitting process. In particular, efficiently fitting the original model was made possible by analytical computation of the gradient (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al., 2013</a>). Determining the gradient for 12 parameter model was outside the scope of this manuscript. We consequently took the strategy of first fitting the original 9-parameter model to the control data from 1 day before infusion sessions, and then, starting from those best-fitting parameter values, asking which of the bias-inducing single-parameter changes would best fit the data from the unilateral FOF inactivations (other parameters were held fixed at the control data best-fit values). In other words, we asked, \u2018if we changed only one parameter, which one would it be to best fit the data?\u2019 Finding the maximum likelihood value was made practical by the fact that each of the four fits performed was a single-parameter fit."

                                "text": "The four single-parameter changes we considered corresponded to hypotheses regarding possible functions of the FOF, and are conceptually illustrated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. (a) First, we considered the possibility that the FOF is part of the output pathway of the accumulator, perhaps part of computing or representing the animal's discrete choice after having categorized the accumulator value (into \u2018Go Right\u2019 vs \u2018Go Left\u2019 categories) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>), potentially in the service of preparing a motor action (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erlich et al., 2011</a>). Unilaterally perturbing the FOF might then bias this post-categorization representation. To implement this idea in the model, we added a parameter that biased outcomes after the R/L decision was made on each trial. Independently of the stimulus that led to the decision, we let a randomly-chosen fraction, <i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>R</i></sub>, of right decisions and a randomly-chosen fraction <i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> of left decisions be reversed (i.e., R \u2192 L and L \u2192 R; see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These reversals scale the vertical endpoints of the psychometric curve towards the Went Right = 50% level. The scaling is biased when <i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>R</i></sub> \u2260 <i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>L</i></sub>. (b) Next, we considered the possibility that since the FOF has been suggested as analogous to primate FEF, perturbing it might affect attentional processes, perhaps causing a lateralized sensory neglect that would bias the perceptual impact of auditory clicks from the two different sides. In other words, during unilateral inactivation, right and left clicks could have different magnitudes of their impact on the accumulating evidence (<i>C</i><sub><i>R</i></sub> and <i>C</i><sub><i>L</i></sub>, instead of the single common <i>C</i> of <a href=\"#equ4\">Equation 1</a> in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We described this as a \u2018unbalanced input gain\u2019 (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). (c) We next considered the possibility that the FOF plays a role in the accumulation process itself, and quantified biases in accumulation through an \u2018accumulation shift\u2019 that shifts the value of the accumulator, <i>a</i>, at the end of the stimulus (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, equivalent to \u00de in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Changes in this parameter will cause horizontal shifts in the psychometric curve. (d) In the fourth and final model, we considered a second possible form of lateralized sensory neglect, in the form of \u2018unbalanced input noise\u2019 (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In this version of the model, right and left clicks could have different signal-to-noise ratios by having different values of the sensory noise parameter (<math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>L</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>, instead of the single common <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> of <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For each of models (a), (b), and (d), the original fit to the control data was constrained to be balanced. To fit the bias generated by unilateral FOF inactivation, that constraint was relaxed. For each model, we kept the corresponding ipsilateral parameter fixed, and let the contralateral parameter be free to best fit the data. The difference between the best-fitting contralateral parameter minus the ipsilateral parameter was then defined as the bias for that model."

This surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) clearly demonstrated that fitting the data requires a large shift away from the balanced control value in the post-categorization bias, but not in input gain. Thus, the dominant effect of unilateral FOF inactivation could be parsimoniously explained by a post-categorization bias, consistent with the known role of the FOF in movement planning (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erlich et al., 2011</a>). As described above, a feature of the post-categorization model is that the psychometric curve after unilateral inactivations should be a vertical scaling of the control psychometric curve. This scaling was found in the data, with a tight correspondence between the curve generated by the quantitative model and the experimental psychometric curve (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). A similar tight correspondence between model and data were also found for the chronometric curves (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and the reverse correlation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

Using the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm, we estimated the best-fit posterior distribution for an 8-parameter model. This model contains the four bias parameters, as well as <i>\u03bb</i>, <math id=\"inf7\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>, <math id=\"inf8\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>I</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>, and <i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>I</i></sub>. For computational tractability, the remaining 4 parameters (initial noise, bounds, and the two click adaptation parameters) were fixed at the values of the best-fit control model. With 40,000 samples of this 8 dimensional distribution (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we estimate that four parameters changed significantly from their control values. First, accumulator noise increased from 5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> to 0.746 (95% C.I. = [0.125 12.123], p = 10<sup>\u22124</sup>), which is still a small value and would have a negligible impact on behavioral performance. Second, accumulator shift changed from 0.065 to 0.323 ([0.136 0.890], p = 0.013), which would also have a minimal effect on overall reward rate. Third, <i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>I</i></sub>, the changes from ipsi to contra choices decreased from 0.102 to 0.029 ([0.002 0.071], p = 10<sup>\u22124</sup>). Finally, supporting our earlier analysis, <i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>C</i></sub>, increased from 0 to 0.498 ([0.176 0.536], p &lt; 10<sup>\u22123</sup>) which results in a very substantial behavioral impact, since this sets the asymptotic performance on the easiest contralateral trials to \u224850%. As in the 2D model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) the gain of contralateral clicks increased (although not significantly). The likelihood of the best 8-parameter model was only marginally higher than the best 1-parameter post-categorization model (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), consistent with the small shifts in the other parameters (log likelihood of the 8-D model: \u22121957.52; log likelihood of the 1-D model: \u22121963.08). Using AIC and BIC we find that the increase in likelihood is too small to justify the increase in number of parameters."

Consistent with the post-categorization bias hypothesis, the unilateral FOF inactivations produced a vertically-scaled ipsilateral bias in these single-sided trials that was similar to that seen during the accumulation trials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, compare to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> data): that is, the bias was independent of how easy or how difficult the trials were."

In this case, bilateral inactivations of the PPC should produce a behavioral impairment markedly larger than any small impairment found after unilateral inactivations. To probe this hypothesis, we initially used a high dose (300 ng per side) for bilateral PPC infusions in group 1 rats, but only 2 of 6 rats completed trials, with inconsistent results. The maximum dose at which subjects still performed substantial numbers of trials was 150 ng per side, double the dose per side for the bilateral FOF inactivations described above. During the bilateral PPC inactivation sessions there was a very small but significant 3.6% decrease in performance on accumulation trials (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, p &lt; 0.02 vs isoflurane, GLMM test). This effect was not individually significant in any rat (0/4). Critically, the effect size we found was not bigger\u2013in fact, it was slightly smaller\u2013than the average unilateral PPC effect, and thus does not provide support for the hypothesis of hemispheric compensation. Performance on side LED trials was not significantly different between bilateral PPC infusion and control sessions (<i>t</i>-test, p &gt; 0.4; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Fitting the accumulator model to the bilateral PPC data, we find that the only parameter to change was the lapse (but the confidence intervals overlapped with the control value), suggesting that the effects on performance were unrelated to any specific aspect of the accumulation process."

This motivated us to seek a positive control task. The primate literature suggested an internally-guided decision task whose trials could be readily intermixed with our evidence accumulation task. <a href=\"#bib89\">Wilke et al. (2012)</a> interspersed regular memory-guided saccade trials (\u2018instructed\u2019 trials), in which a single saccade target was presented on each trial, with internally-guided \u2018free choice\u2019 trials, in which both an ipsilateral and a contralateral target were presented, and the monkey was rewarded regardless of its response choice. By design, subjects were free to respond as they pleased in free choice trials, and they typically displayed a bias towards one side or another in these trials. Wilke et al. found that muscimol inactivation of area LIP within PPC produced no effect on choices in the instructed memory-guided saccade trials, but produced a profound ipsilateral bias during intermixed free choice trials. Inspired by Wilke et al.'s results, we modified the task for seven of our group 2 and group 3 cannulated rats (The six group 1 rats and one group 3 rat had been already sacrificed for histology). We randomly intermixed 25% free choice trials with 65% accumulation trials and 10% Side LED trials (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Free-choice trials were indicated by a lack of auditory click stimuli, and by illumination of both side LEDs after the animals had withdrawn from the center port. We refer to sessions with interleaved accumulation, side LED, and free-choice trials as \u2018free-choice\u2019 sessions. After a few free-choice sessions with no infusions, rats performed the mix of trials reliably, and expressed a consistent bias on free choice trials but no detectable bias on accumulation trials."

We also compared inactivation effects on the Poisson Clicks task (\u2018accumulation trials\u2019) to three types of control trials: free-choice (in which the animal was free to choose either of two visual stimuli to obtain a reward); single-sided (in which decisions were guided by a simple auditory stimulus that did not require gradual evidence accumulation, and rats had to withhold their response for several hundred milliseconds after receiving enough information to make their decision); and side LED trials (in which decisions were guided by a simple visual stimulus that did not require gradual evidence accumulation, and rats were free to report their decision as soon as they made it)."

In contrast, inactivating larger regions is much more readily achieved with muscimol, for which the radius of inactivation can be increased simply by increasing the infusion dose. In addition, muscimol directly inactivates all neurons within its radius of effect, not only infected neurons. Moreover, in some tasks, including the Poisson Clicks task, we find that the behavioral effect of optogenetic silencing begins to decay after a few weeks, while the effect of muscimol is stable. This stability in particular was essential for the current study, which used within-subject manipulations over hundreds of days. Optogenetic and pharmacological silencing therefore have complementary advantages and disadvantages. Here we focused on pharmacological inactivation."

Unilateral FOF inactivations had a strong effect on both accumulation trials, signaled by auditory clicks, and on free choice trials, signaled by a bilateral visual stimulus (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), indicating that the effects are not specific to a single sensory modality. Critically, the model-based analyses suggested a specific location for the FOF within the functional process chain required by our accumulation of evidence task. The specific suggestion is that the FOF is not part of the accumulator but is instead part of the premotor output pathway that leads from the graded evidence accumulator to the decision-reporting motor act. This suggestion is derived from (a) the sharp reduction in the accumulation time constant induced by bilateral FOF inactivations (from slightly unstable <i>\u03c4</i> \u2248 +0.8, to very leaky <i>\u03c4</i> \u2248 \u22120.24 s), which demonstrates that the FOF is either involved in the accumulation process itself, or is part of the output pathway of the accumulator (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>); (b) the effects induced by unilateral inactivation of the FOF, which are captured in quantitative detail, for both accumulation trials and single-side trials, as having induced a post-categorization bias that is subsequent to the accumulation process (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>); and (c) the lack of an effect of FOF inactivations on side LED trials, which rules out a simple motor role for the FOF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). A parsimonious explanation of this set of results is thus that the FOF is a requisite premotor component of the output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long time constant (&gt;0.24 s). This suggestion is different from, but consistent with, the FOF's known role in short-term memory, as well as the FOF's greater importance in memory-guided (i.e., long time constant) vs sensory-guided (short time constant) orienting decisions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erlich et al., 2011</a>). In decisions driven by gradual accumulation of evidence, the gradual accumulation process occurs prior to the binary decision. An intriguing possibility suggested by our results that the decision process itself\u2013that is, the categorization of the gradually accumulated evidence into a binary choice\u2013might be performed in the FOF, perhaps in conjunction with the superior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lo and Wang, 2006</a>)."

We favor this interpretation first, because of its parsimony; second, because parallel electrophysiological work from our laboratory found that the representation of the accumulated evidence in the FOF could be approximately described as the answer to the categorical question \u2018if the GO signal came now, which side port should I choose?\u2019; third, using AAV-CaMKII-eNpHR3.0 for optogenetic inactivation we found that transient unilateral silencing of the FOF was unable to cause an effect on behavior if it occurred during the evidence accumulation period, sufficiently prior to the GO signal (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>)."

Such decisions, including perhaps decisions that require auditory evidence accumulation over only short times (&lt;0.24 s), may depend on pathways that bypass the FOF, perhaps involving direct connections from auditory cortex to the striatum (<a href=\"#bib91\">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</a>)."

We based the volume and concentration of our infusions on previous literature to achieve inactivation volumes of 1 mm radius for our small doses and 3 mm radius for our largest doses (<a href=\"#bib53\">Martin, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Krupa et al., 1999</a>). This spread is within the anterior-posterior bounds of FOF, but could have spread medially to cingulate cortex (CG1) or laterally to M1 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</a>). The white matter below FOF prevent spread ventrally into the basal ganglia. In a previous study, we directly tested the effects of M1 inactivation and found them to be weaker than FOF inactivations and also they affected sensory-guided and single-sided trials equally (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erlich et al., 2011</a>). As such, it is unlikely that the effects we are attributing to FOF are due to M1 inactivation. We targeted our inactivations to 2 mm anterior and 1.25 mm lateral to Bregma. According to the Rat Atlas (<a href=\"#bib61\">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</a>) CG1 may be within the spread of the drug. However, according to a recent cell-based mapping technique the medial boundary of FOF has been underestimated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brecht et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that most of spread of drug would be within FOF. Moreover, the CG1 is thought to play a role in cost-benefit decisions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hillman and Bilkey, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Holec et al., 2014</a>), cognitive flexibility (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ragozzino and Rozman, 2007</a>), or emotional reactivity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bissi\u00e8re et al., 2008</a>), not in movement planning.

Compensation from the unperturbed hemisphere did not explain the lack of an effect, because bilateral inactivation of the PPC caused a minimal decrease in performance (3.6%) that was not significantly different from unilateral inactivations.

The anatomical characteristics of the PPC pose two possible confounds: insufficient inactivation of the PPC in the medial-lateral direction and potential spread to adjacent regions in the anterior-posterior direction. If we assume the spread of muscimol across the cortical is isotropic (white matter acts as a physical barrier, so we assume that the ventral spread is restricted), then an individual injection, due to the wide and thin shape of PPC, will either fail to inactivate all of PPC or spread to adjacent regions. Based on the literature (<a href=\"#bib53\">Martin, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Krupa et al., 1999</a>) we expect our smallest infusion to have a \u22481 mm radius and our largest to have a &gt;3 mm radius. This technical limitation would have posed a serious challenge for our results if we observed very different effects of our small and large infusions. However, despite using a wide range of doses, we observed no significant dose\u2013response effect with unilateral PPC infusions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). A clear dose\u2013response relationship (as we found in the FOF) would indicate that bigger infusions were silencing more and more PPC neurons required for behavior in the task. Instead, the fraction of inactivated PPC neurons had no impact on the magnitude of the behavioral effect, which is what we would expect if PPC neurons were not required for choice behavior in the task. Nonetheless, further experiments would be required to completely rule out the possibility that a small number of PPC neurons, in the most medial or lateral edge of the PPC, were spared and that these few neurons were sufficient to support intact behavioral performance on the Clicks task."

Immediately anterior to the PPC is the somatosensory cortex (for the trunk). Particularly in light of the intact motor capacities, as indicated by the intact side LED trials, the somatosensory cortex is not expected to have caused any of the observed effects. Immediately posterior to the PPC are a set of individually small visual areas, collectively referred to as secondary visual cortex (V2; <a href=\"#bib15\">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Montero, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>). These visual areas are unlikely to be involved in auditory click accumulation trials, and are therefore not expected to have caused the effects we saw after simultaneous unilateral PPC and bilateral FOF inactivations (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). However, the bias we observed on free-choice trials may have been partly due to an effect in one or more of these small secondary visual areas. Nevertheless, ipsilateral biases in untrained orienting responses (potentially analogous to the free-choice task) due to PPC lesions have been observed in the rat even when those choices were to tactile or auditory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib17\">Corwin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burcham et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1998</a>). We also note that our free choice results closely parallel the results from primate PPC free choice experiments (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wilke et al., 2012</a>), which do not suffer from this spillover concern."

But it contrasts with Harvey et al.'s finding of a severe performance impairment after PPC inactivation in a mouse visually-cued, memory-guided navigation task (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>). Following our own preliminary reports of PPC inactivations in the Poisson Clicks task (<a href=\"#bib26\">Erlich et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2014</a>), <a href=\"#bib63a\">Raposo et al. (2014)</a> reported an impairment after rat PPC inactivations in a visual, but not in an auditory, version of a closely related task. This contrasts with a preliminary report from Yates et al. that suggested no effect from primate PPC inactivation in a visual accumulation of evidence task (<a href=\"#bib90\">Yates et al., 2014</a>), as well as with multiple reports of no effect from primate PPC inactivation in visual memory-guided saccade tasks (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Wardak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wilke et al., 2012</a>). The Raposo et al. results therefore suggest that rodent PPC may be unlike primate PPC in being required for accumulation of evidence for a specific modality, vision. Nevertheless, the precise location of the border between rodent PPC and visual cortex, as well as the amount of inter-animal variability in this location, remain active research questions (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wilber et al., 2014</a>; see, for example, <a href=\"#bib69\">Reep et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Corwin and Reep, 1998</a> for definitions from the same authors, based on the same data, that alternately describe the border as located at \u22125.0 mm from Bregma or \u22124.4 mm from Bregma). The uncertainty in the location of the PPC/visual cortex border raises an alternative possibility, which is that the impairments in memory-guided visual tasks observed by Harvey et al. and Raposo et al. (and potentially the free-choice effects seen here) could have been due to inactivation spillover into one of the immediately adjacent small secondary visual areas, as described above, rather than inactivation of the PPC itself. This would make all the inactivation results (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63a\">Raposo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Yates et al., 2014</a>; and the results presented here.), including mouse, rat, and primate, fully consistent with each other. While such a reconciliation of results across multiple species may have some intellectual appeal, we emphasize that experiments that would either clearly support or rule out this possibility remain to be done."

Each accumulation trial began with a visible light-emitting diode (LED) turning on in the center port. This cued the trained rat to place its nose in the center port, and keep it there until the LED was turned off. We refer to this period as the \u2018nose in center\u2019 or \u2018fixation\u2019 period. The duration of fixation was 2 s for all accumulation trials. During the fixation period a variable duration auditory stimulus (0.1\u20131 s, experimenter controlled) would play, consisting of two randomly timed trains of clicks, playing simultaneously, one from the left and one from the right speaker. At the end of the auditory stimulus, the LED in the center port would extinguish, which was the signal to the rat to make their response by poking into one of the side ports. The timing of the clicks from each speaker was generated by two independent Poisson processes. The total generative click rate (left + right rate) was held constant at 40 clicks/s, and trial difficulty was controlled by adjusting the relative left vs right rates, as well as the duration of the stimulus. Trials where rats exited the center port during the fixation period were considered violation trials, aborted, and a new trial was started. These trials are not included in any analyses."

Caps and dummy cannula were removed and cleaned. Injectors were placed into the relevant guide cannula and extended 1.5 mm past the end of the guide, into cortex. We used a hamilton syringe connected via tubing filled with mineral oil to the injector to infuse 0.3 \u00b5l of muscimol (of various concentrations\u2013see \u2018Results\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) into cortex. After injection, we left the injector in the brain for 4 min to allow diffusion before removal. After 4 min, cleaned dummies were placed into the guide cannula and capped and the rat was removed from isoflurane. After 30 min of recovery from isoflurane the rat was placed into a behavior box as usual.

If rats only used the early clicks for their decision (a primacy strategy), the lines would begin separated and come together. Likewise, if they only used the clicks at the end of the stimulus (a recency strategy) the lines would start together and separate towards the end of the trial. To generate the accumulator model's reverse correlation, each trial was assigned as the left and right trial, according to the model's prediction for that trial.

The only difference is the side of the infusion. As such, this within-subject design is effective at testing biases to respond toward or away from the side of the infusion. The simplest way to estimate bias resulting from unilateral inactivations is to subtract the contralateral % correct from the ipsilateral % correct for each infusion session. To compute the overall bias we averaged the bias across sessions for each rat and then tested using a <i>t</i>-test whether the bias across rats was significantly different from 0. However, this statistical test is conservative, since it collapses across all trials of differing difficulty levels and different sessions.

It stands to make a significant contribution to the decision-making literature. The manuscript investigates the causal contributions of rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in accumulation-based decision making. It provides a strong synthesis of many kinds of inactivations (bilateral vs unilateral, PFC vs PPC, and some combinations) with a detailed computational model of the decision making process. Despite some important caveats (described below) with the inactivation experiments and with their modeling, the experiments make up a very useful data set. Moreover, the follow-up manipulations to test predictions from the results of the analyses (single-sided trials, free choice trials) demonstrate the success of the method and the depth of understanding of the role of these structures."

This is unconvincing, especially given the importance of the negative results in PPC to the main points of the paper. It would be useful to see more anatomical characterization to show that what is being called PPC has the appropriate input characteristics. This could be done fairly easily in a few na\u00efve animals using retrograde tracers showing that their identified region receives inputs from multiple sensory regions, lateral posterior thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and contralateral PPC."

It is nice that there is a positive control in the 'free choice' experiments, but it is not clear that one can rule out a more subtle influence of PPC in the evidence accumulation task. The experiment one would really like to see is a characterization of the extent of PPC using anatomical tracers, followed by inactivation of the entire region. This would require significantly more work, and may be beyond the scope of a reasonable revision of this paper, but at the very least the paper should address this issue in the Discussion and reduce the strength of the claims accordingly."

(2014)</a> shows similar lack of effects on an auditory task, but profound effects in a visual task. The manuscript relates to this study in one paragraph (eighth paragraph of Discussion) to suggest that PPC may be mostly visual rather than auditory, but seems to prefer the rather harsh interpretation that other investigators had results in visual tasks due to experimental error. It is dangerous to criticize others for possible technical errors (muscimol spreading unintentionally far) when one's paper may suffer from the same limitations. It would be interesting to see a more balanced discussion of those results, perhaps starting in the Introduction. For instance, there may be some tension about whether those results point to an evidence accumulation deficit for visual information, or just a visual deficit. More generally, this paper should make sure not to overreach in its conclusions about the role of PPC in all sorts of perceptual decisions, and limit itself to auditory ones."

In addition, muscimol directly inactivates all neurons within its radius of effect, not only infected neurons. Moreover, in some tasks, including the Poisson Clicks task, we find that the behavioral effect of optogenetic silencing begins to decay after a few weeks, while the effect of muscimol is stable. This stability in particular was essential for the current study, which used within-subject manipulations over hundreds of days. Optogenetic and pharmacological silencing therefore have complementary advantages and disadvantages. Here we focused on pharmacological inactivation.\u201d"

In other words, there is substantial uncertainty in the location of the border even within a single data set from a single set of authors. Using a -4.4mm definition, the Raposo et al. inactivations would have extended well into visual cortex. Our point is not that the Raposo et al. inactivations necessarily extended into visual cortex. Our point is that our reading of the current state of the literature, suggests that it is very difficult to rule out the possibility that they did."

That single trial could thus, on its own, completely skew the results. To address this issue, the model includes a \u201clapse\u201d parameter, a fraction of trials in which the animal appears to ignore the stimuli and performs randomly. At the very easiest trials, rat behavior in our task seems to asymptote at 90% correct, so the lapse parameter typically has values of \u223c 0.1.
