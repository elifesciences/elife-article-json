A mechanistic understanding of assemblies requires accurate measurement of their stoichiometry, affinity and cooperativity, and frequently consideration of multiple co-existing complexes. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation equipped with fluorescence detection (FDS-SV) allows the characterization of protein complexes free in solution with high size resolution, at concentrations in the nanomolar and picomolar range. Here, we extend the capabilities of FDS-SV with a single excitation wavelength from single-component to multi-component detection using photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (psFPs). We exploit their characteristic quantum yield of photo-switching to imprint spatio-temporal modulations onto the sedimentation signal that reveal different psFP-tagged protein components in the mixture. This novel approach facilitates studies of heterogeneous multi-protein complexes at orders of magnitude lower concentrations and for higher-affinity systems than previously possible. Using this technique we studied high-affinity interactions between the amino-terminal domains of GluA2 and GluA3 AMPA receptors."

A mechanistic understanding of assemblies requires accurate measurement of their stoichiometry, affinity and cooperativity, and frequently consideration of multiple co-existing complexes. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation equipped with fluorescence detection (FDS-SV) allows the characterization of protein complexes free in solution with high size resolution, at concentrations in the nanomolar and picomolar range. Here, we extend the capabilities of FDS-SV with a single excitation wavelength from single-component to multi-component detection using photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (psFPs). We exploit their characteristic quantum yield of photo-switching to imprint spatio-temporal modulations onto the sedimentation signal that reveal different psFP-tagged protein components in the mixture. This novel approach facilitates studies of heterogeneous multi-protein complexes at orders of magnitude lower concentrations and for higher-affinity systems than previously possible. Using this technique we studied high-affinity interactions between the amino-terminal domains of GluA2 and GluA3 AMPA receptors."

However, only tags of a single color can be detected because of physical constraints of the fluorescent detection system. This meant that only one kind of fluorescent signal could be tracked at any one time. However, a group of fluorescent tags called photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (psFPs) offer new opportunities for detecting multiple signals. This is because these psFPs switch between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states while being detected in the ultracentrifuge."

In SV the spatio-temporal evolution of macromolecular concentration profiles in a sample solution after application of a strong centrifugal field is optically monitored in real-time. SV has unique opportunities for studying protein interactions, since\u2014different from separation techniques\u2014faster sedimenting protein complexes will always remain in a bath of slower-sedimenting constituent components, such that the association/dissociation of non-covalent complexes is maintained throughout the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Since sedimentation takes place free in solution, the analysis can be based on first principles and mathematical models for the sedimentation/diffusion process, and modern size-distribution analysis results in sedimentation coefficient distributions with high hydrodynamic resolution. Thus, SV has emerged as a powerful technique in the study of the solution state behavior of complex interacting systems of macromolecules, including ion-channels, adaptor proteins, membrane proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kumar and Mayer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Houtman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">le Maire et al., 2008</a> <a href=\"#bib38\">Niewiarowski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Padrick and Brautigam, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Harding et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jose et al., 2012</a>). Extended to multi-signal analysis SV can distinguish different sedimenting components from characteristic extinction properties, directly revealing binding stoichiometries and resolving co-existing complexes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Houtman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coussens et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Padrick and Brautigam, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balbo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barda-Saad et al., 2010</a>).

The velocity of sedimentation normalized relative to the centrifugal field strength is expressed in the molecular sedimentation coefficient <i>s</i>. With time, transport clears the region of the solution column closest to the center of rotation and a moving front is formed -- the sedimentation boundary \u2013 that separates the cleared zone from a zone of constant concentration named the solution plateau region. While the boundary moves with time (dashed vs solid line), the concentration in the plateau region continuously decreases, solely due the radial geometry of sedimentation resulting in an increase in intermolecular distances (for a detailed description, see <a href=\"#bib46\">Schuck et al., 2015</a>). If protein interactions cause complexes to form, these generally sediment faster and therefore migrate through a bath of slower sedimenting free constituent components. This allows association/dissociation reactions to continuously occur in a way that reflects equilibrium and kinetic properties of the interaction, at the same time as the complex boundaries are hydrodynamically resolved (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schuck, 2010</a>).

The psFPs make up a class of fluorescent proteins that can be actively switched between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states using different wavelengths of illumination. While they have been engineered for entirely different purposes in nanoscience and fluorescence imaging, we have previously observed that under the illumination conditions of FDS-SV they are induced to slowly switch by virtue of the excitation light when radially scanning the spinning sample (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhao et al., 2014b</a>). Even though the mechanism of photoswitching in psFPs generally may involve multiple states, in the low-power exposure that occurs during sedimentation using the FDS the process is quantitatively modeled very well as a single exponential. This is exploited and further developed in the present work. Different classes of psFPs exhibit different time-courses of photoswitching in FDS-SV, and may be switched on to a fluorescent state or switched off to a dark state. We show that this process is highly quantitative, and how this signal change can be manipulated spatially and temporally during sedimentation. The new spatio-temporal signal dimension is folded into the computational analysis of the sedimentation process, and thus offers an avenue for monochromatic multi-component (MCMC) detection. Using existing commercial FDS instrumentation, the MCMC approach allows us to simultaneously determine separate sedimentation coefficient distributions for each class of fluorophore, which can be used to determine the identity and binding stoichiometry of hydrodynamically resolved complexes of psFP-tagged proteins."

This is caused by the 488 nm excitation beam of the FDS scanner which induces photoswitching between fluorescent and dark states. But in contrast to typical power densities of ~ kW/cm<sup>2</sup> for photoswitching on the millisecond time-scale (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grotjohann et al., 2012</a>), the transient exposure in FDS-SV during radial scanning and sample rotation leads to a time-averaged incident power density that is ~10<sup>5</sup>-fold weaker. This slows the photoswitching kinetics down to the time-scale of hours, commensurate with the sedimentation process in SV. A prerequisite for exploiting this new temporal dimension for the multi-component decomposition of fluorescence SV data is the ability to precisely describe the signal evolution of the individual psFPs. We have developed a model <a href=\"#equ4\">Equation 4</a> that assumes a single-step process with constant quantum efficiency for switching, while accounting for the radially non-uniform exposure during scanning (caused by psFPs transitioning through the beam in a shorter time as they migrate to higher radii at the same angular velocity). Combined with a description of molecular sedimentation and diffusion, the model predicts signal boundaries to be subject to an exponential overall signal modulation with slightly radially sloping solution plateaus, with a small positive slope for those switching off (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>) and a small negative slope for FPs switching on (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>) under 488 nm illumination. As shown in the examples of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, fits of this model to within the noise of data acquisition can routinely be achieved for the fluorescence sedimentation data of diverse FPs, including, for example, the rapidly de-activating rsEGFP (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grotjohann et al., 2012</a>) and the strongly activating Padron (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andresen et al., 2008)</a> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,d</a>). From the fits of the single component samples, we can obtain the relative amplitude and time-constant of photoswitching for different fluorophores, which serves as a highly reproducible, characteristic temporal tag. For example, for rsEGFP with a scanning beam of 13 mW we measure a depletion rate of 5.08 [4.97\u20135.19; 95% CI]\u00d710<sup>\u20134</sup>/sec, approaching a final fluorescence of 13.4 [13.0\u201313.9; 95% CI]% its initial value, associated with a particle sedimentation coefficient of 2.50 [2.45\u20132.54; 95% CI] S and apparent molar mass of 29.5 [26.5\u201333.0; 95% CI] kDa. By contrast, as previously established (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhao et al., 2014b</a>), no photophysical processes are detectable under this illumination for other fluorophores such as fluorescein-based DL488 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) and standard EGFP."

Application of the MCMC decomposition produces an excellent fit, with component sedimentation coefficient distributions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a> solid lines) again being highly consistent with the results from the separately measured Padron and rsEGFP2/mAb mixture (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a> dashed lines).

In fact, in modeling the data of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, the time-constants of rsEGFP2 were initially constrained to the separately measured values, but subsequent refinement led to a significantly better fit: As may already be visually discerned from comparison with <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, a portion of the fast-moving boundary of the rsEGFP2/mAb complex in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a> remains fluorescent after long time (\u03b1 = 0.2070 [0.2052\u20130.2088, 95% CI]), whereas free rsEGFP2 shows nearly complete conversion to the dark state (\u03b1 = 0.0274 [0.0270\u20130.0281, 95% CI]). Clearly, when bound by the anti-GFP antibody, the contrast of rsEGFP2 is lower than in the unbound state. Similar observations were made with rsEGFP, which exhibits slightly altered photoswitching kinetics in the presence of the anti-GFP antibody (data not shown). These observations were confirmed by rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 fluorescence measurements in a benchtop fluorimeter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), where we found marked alterations in the off rates and on/off contrast ratios for both rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 in the presence of antibody as compared to their unbound state. At the same time, their emission spectral properties changed little with the addition of the antibody (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). These effects point to possible conformational changes induced by antibody binding impacting the equilibrium of photophysical states (see Discussion). In general, however, such effects should be irrelevant in applications of this approach where the psFP will be designed as an inert tag rather than offering a binding site."

However, rapid photoswitching can be advantageous if we exploit the reversibility of the process to switch it back on. Stopping the 488 nm exposure will cause rsEGFP to spontaneously relax back into the equilibrium fluorescent state on the time-scale of an hour. Thus, passive restoration of the fluorescent signal by simply pausing the data acquisition is possible (data not shown) but presents a viable approach only for slowly sedimenting species. However, rapid and virtually complete restoration of the initial psFPs signal is possible by illumination at 405 nm. In this way, for example, rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 can undergo hundreds of on/off cycles with very little loss (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grotjohann et al., 2012</a>). To this end, we took advantage of the window in the rotor chamber that usually forms part of the interference optical system, and modified it to allow illumination of the spinning rotor with a high-power 405 nm LED at ~10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. To achieve a quantitatively uniform reset of fluorescence, a sector-shaped mask was used to produce constant 405 nm exposure times for molecules rotating through the beam at all radii. SV experiments were carried out with several cycles of rapid signal depletion under 488 nm illumination at 25 mW (producing a depletion rate of 9.7\u00d710<sup>\u20134</sup>/s for rsEGFP2), alternating with a 2\u2009min pulse of 405 nm illumination (leading to &gt; 98% recovery of the fluorescence signal of rsEGFP2). The sequence of exposure and scanning events is schematically represented in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>. An example for the resulting \u2018blinking\u2019 boundary for rsEGFP2 is shown in the <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>. An experiment with Padron exhibiting the opposite blinking behavior is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>. With signal recovery time-points included into the model, blinking SV data could be fitted within the noise of data acquisition, and blinking has been fully implemented in the MCMC decomposition of signals from mixtures with different fluorophores. However, on the basis of the theoretical analysis of information content in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> (magenta line), for switching processes at rates below 3\u00d710<sup>\u20134</sup>/sec, blinking can be detrimental to component discrimination, because it does not allow the fluorophore to ever significantly populate the dark state."

During the data acquisition cycles the fluorescence signal increases, due to switching on of Padron, but the increase is reversed each time in the 405 nm light that switches Padron to the off state. At these time points, gaps in the boundary overlay can be visually discerned; these appear largely due to the decreasing signal magnitude of the boundary.

                                "text": "For the slow switching case, we followed a different approach to enhance discrimination by creating a spatially localized trough in the psFP fluorescence signal. In contrast to blinking, this can be executed without any instrument modification, simply by positioning the existing FDS detector at a fixed radius for an extended period of time at the beginning of the sedimentation process. Based on the size of the focal spot we estimate the stationary exposure to be on the order of 100-fold stronger as compared to the time-averaged exposure during scanning across the standard radial scan range. Localized switching to the dark state causes a trough in the fluorescence signal (or a peak for molecules switching on at 488 nm). Much like the well-known technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), molecules in the dark state that are located initially in the trough will diffuse and exchange with fluorescent molecules from outside, diminishing the trough. In contrast to FRAP, the diffusion processes are coupled to size-dependent migration from sedimentation, which translates and stretches the shape of the trough as it diminishes. Simultaneously, this process is superimposed by the same uniform photoswitching of psFPs that sets in with radial scanning (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Even though this appears to be a more complicated process, the evolution of the trough is naturally modeled in the same framework developed above for the sedimentation in quasi-uniform exposure: Since SV models already account for diffusional spread superimposed to sedimentation, the FRAP-like SV model solely requires the additional application of appropriate boundary conditions (<a href=\"#equ8\">Equation 8</a>) at early times. However, in comparison to standard sedimentation boundaries, the resulting data are enriched in several ways, as (1) additional information on diffusion becomes available; (2) two additional sedimentation boundaries are generated to improve the precision of sedimentation coefficients; and (3) in data from mixtures of psFPs with stable fluorescent molecules, the depth of the trough will provide a landmark at early times reporting directly on the concentration of psFPs-tagged components. In applications to the analysis of experimental data, excellent fits were achieved with this model with residuals close to the noise of data acquisition. For example, with the single-species model fitted to the rsEGFP2-GluA3 data shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>, the <i>s</i>-value is 4.59 [4.50\u20134.68, 68% CI] S, consistent with the value obtained from blinking and from constant illumination experiments."

It is thought that the strength of homo- and hetero-dimerization of the amino-terminal domains of different iGluRs governs their assembly and tetrameric architecture (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rossmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kumar et al., 2011)</a>. Therefore, the binding affinities of iGluRs have been of significant interest (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rossmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Karakas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Clayton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kumar et al., 2009</a>). In a pioneering study, homo- and hetero-dimerization affinities for different AMPA receptor amino terminal domains (ATDs) were determined by standard FDS-SV (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rossmann et al., 2011</a>). However, for analysis of hetero-oligomerization only one component could be monitored, and the FAM-label used in that study was later found to induce artificially strong homo-dimerization of GluA2 ATD (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhao et al., 2013c</a>), with its effect on interactions with the other AMPA receptor subunit ATDs unknown. Recent work, which has resulted in structures of full length heteromeric AMPA receptors assembled from GluA2 and GluA3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herguedas et al., 2016</a>) provides a compelling reason for accurately measuring the affinity for assembly of GluA2/GluA3 ATD heterodimers. Using Dylight488-labeled GluA2-ATD (DL488-GluA2) and a fusion protein of GluA3-ATD and rsEGFP2 (rsEGFP2-GluA3), we take advantage of the component discrimination in MCMC to monitor simultaneously the homomeric and heteromeric complexes, which consist of GluA2 monomers and homodimers, GluA3 monomers and homodimers, and GluA2/GluA3 heterodimers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In the initial control experiments, a dilution series of DL488-GluA2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a,b</a>) yielded a homo-dimerization K<sub>d,22</sub> of 24 [9\u201359; 95%CI] nM; no homo-dimerization was detected for rsEGFP2-GluA3 at concentrations up to 30 nM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). These results are consistent with previously measured K<sub>d22</sub> and K<sub>d33</sub>-values for the homo-dimerization of GluA2 and GluA3, 20.5 nM [15.9\u201326.4; 95% CI] (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao et al., 2013a</a>) and 5.6 [1.7\u201314] \u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2012)</a>, respectively, while by contrast, the homo-dimerization K<sub>d,22</sub> of 1.8 nM for FAM-labeled GluA2 was 11-fold lower (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rossmann et al., 2011</a>)."

Representative raw data sets and MCMC fits to the sedimentation boundaries are shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, leading to calculated component sedimentation coefficient distributions shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10a</a>. At a high concentration of 30 nM, the sedimentation coefficient distributions rsEGFP2-GluA3 and DL488-GluA2 both show a single co-sedimenting peak at ~5.9\u2009S, consistent with a saturated 1:1 hetero-dimer complex, moderately extended with a frictional ratio of 1.42. With decreasing concentrations the peaks occur at lower sedimentation coefficients, characteristic for a rapid association/dissociation equilibrium relative to the time-scale of sedimentation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schuck, 2010</a>). Due to the decreasing signal/noise ratio peaks also broaden at lower concentrations. Further, at concentrations below 1 nM a separate slower sedimenting peak of DL488-GluA2 can be discerned, consistent with the s-value of free GluA2 monomer, co-existing with a faster-sedimenting dimeric fraction of GluA2. Due to the smaller difference between the s-value of the hetero-dimeric complex and free rsEGFP2-GluA3, the latter cannot be resolved at the low signal/noise ratios below 1 nM. However, the signal-weighted average sedimentation coefficient s<sub>w</sub> can still be determined as a function of concentration for both components (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10b</a>). The Monte-Carlo error analysis shows s<sub>w</sub> to be well-defined at all concentrations for the constant signal component, but for the decaying signal component statistical errors increase at lower concentrations, with the lowest useful data point at 0.3 nM.

Although psFPs were designed to serve a very different purpose, we have embarked on the quantitative analysis of their switching kinetics as a novel temporal tag to substitute for spectral discrimination. In the low-power illumination conditions of FDS-SV the time-course of photoswitching can serve as a finger-print for different psFPs and permit quantitative multi-component analysis. Thus, the study of heterogeneous interactions can be carried out with mixtures of psFP-tagged proteins, proteins labeled with stable fluorophore dyes, and/or non-fluorescent proteins. This opens the possibility for the same fusion proteins observed co-localizing in microscopy to be overexpressed and purified for in vitro binding studies in FDS-SV, to provide information of number, size, and stoichiometry of complexes. Further, there is a potential for FDS-SV to be applied to more crowded solutions such as cell extracts and serum (<a href=\"#bib40\">Polling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kokona et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hill and Laue, 2015</a>), in which the hydrodynamic interpretation of complex sizes is less quantitative, but complex stoichiometries derived from multi-component detection should be invariant. Exploiting the switchable signal further, we have demonstrated that additional spatial and temporal modulation of the psFPs signal in FDS-SV is possible. This has the potential to further improve discrimination of different psFPs and to enhance hydrodynamic analysis, for example, in the FRAP-like configurations used in the present study."

                        "text": "The switchability of signal and localized optical manipulation afforded by psFPs can be envisioned to expand the toolbox of analytical ultracentrifugation in many other unexpected ways. For instance, the creation of lamella-like signal configurations within the concentration plateau region may enable novel assays, for example, to observe subunit exchange rates of size-resolved macromolecular complexes from the lamella migration and signal amplitude changes, or to study complex formation in crowded solutions within the plateau region of rapidly sedimenting co-solutes. Even though the present work was focused on SV, sedimentation equilibrium (SE) analytical ultracentrifugation would be expected to equally benefit from the use the new temporal tag: for example, once molecules are in thermodynamic equilibrium of sedimentation, psFPs may be reset or depleted, for example, by uniform 405 nm or 488 nm illumination, and the ensuing temporal signal evolution could reveal the equilibrium distribution specifically of psFPs in a mixture. Further, one could envision FRAP-like localized switching in SE to complement thermodynamic with hydrodynamic information obtained while maintaining SE. Beyond analytical ultracentrifugation, quantitatively exploiting the characteristic dynamics of photoswitching arising from different switching quantum yields may prove useful in other techniques."

These generally offer greater flexibility in solution conditions and can be carried out in vivo. However, the strongly size-dependent migration of molecules in the gravitational field is a unique feature of FDS-SV that can lead to significantly higher resolution of macromolecular complexes. We believe this has great potential for the study of systems that exhibit polydisperse mixtures of different complexes, which would elude traditional structural characterization, and only display population-averaged features in spectroscopic techniques."

This suggests that subtle binding-induced conformational changes of the GFP \u03b2-barrel occur that can lead to changes in the equilibrium populations of photophysical states of the chromophore. For Dronpa, NMR studies have revealed flexibility of the \u03b2-barrel allowing non-radiative decay processes in the dark state (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mizuno et al., 2008</a>), and viscosity-mediated reduction of flexibility has been proposed as a mechanism for the viscosity sensitivity of its fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kao et al., 2012</a>). Also, structural flexibility mediating conformational changes from the protein exterior to the chromophore environment inside the \u03b2-barrel has been exploited for GFP as a sensor (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg et al., 2009</a>). It seems conceivable that a similar mechanism may be at work in the binding sensitivity of its photoswitchable variants. Even though the psFPs will typically be designed to be an inert tag, rather than offering binding sites, this reveals the potential for an additional, more subtle source of information in temporally modulated FDS-SV, if the equilibrium of photophysical states is altered through occupation of a binding site."

Using the MCMC approach we find that the process is much more efficient, with a K<sub>d,23</sub> for heterodimer assembly of 0.32 nM, 85-fold smaller than the 27.1 nM K<sub>d,22</sub> for homodimer assembly by GluA2, and four orders of magnitude smaller than the K<sub>d,33</sub> for GluA3 homo-dimerization, which is consistent with the obligate formation of GluA2/GluA3 heterodimer in neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rossmann et al., 2011</a>)."

The availability of size-distributions for all components distinguishes MCMC FDS-SV from methods such as SPR or ITC often used for studying bimolecular reactions. Considering that, from large-scale proteomic experiments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gavin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Krogan et al., 2006</a>), on average more than four components are in cellular protein complexes, it is necessary to develop methods that can elucidate their stoichiometries, architectures, and driving forces. We believe MCMC FDS-SV offers a powerful new approach to study such multi-component complexes in solution."

Setup of the AUC followed standard protocols (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhao et al., 2013b</a>), using an 8-hole An-50 TI rotor. In order to minimize local exposure of the samples during FDS adjustment and magnet angle locking, radial calibration and PMT settings were evaluated at 3000\u2009rpm, followed by temperature equilibration at 20\u00b0C, and acceleration to 50,000\u2009rpm.

The rsEGFP\u2013GluA3 ATD fusion construct was created as follows: The cDNA for the GluA3 signal peptide residues Met1\u2013Gly22, followed by an SGSG tetrapetide linker, was inserted upstream of the cDNA for rsEGFP residues Val2\u2013Lys239, and connected by an SGS tripeptide linker to the cDNA for GluA3, residues Gly23\u2013Ser408, followed by a C-terminal LELVPRGS-His<sub>8</sub> linker, thrombin cleavage site and affinity tag, cloned into the pRK5 mammalian expression vector. Both constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells by transient transfection of suspension cultures using PEI MAX 40000 (Polysciences Inc.). The secreted constructs with native complex glycosylation were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Pellicon 10\u2009kDa MW cutoff cassettes (Millipore) and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using a HiTrap NTA column (GE Healthcare), followed by proteolysis with thrombin, and then ion exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare).

The authors describe a new method to extract multi-component information from fluorescence-based sedimentation velocity data based on definable fluorescence bleaching or photoswitching rates of fluorophores. They present an analytical framework that enables a quantitative analysis of the data and show that their method can be used to measure equilibrium dissociation constants of homo- and heterodimeric GluA2/GluA3 complexes. The manuscript describes a very clever and creative advance and further extends from the large leaps of innovation in this methodology driven by Peter Schuck over the last 15-20 years."

(Although radial-invariant time-dependent baseline changes are an important component of Rayleigh interference data, there is no physical reason for allowing such time-varying offsets in the analysis of FDS-SV data, and usually excellent fits can are achieved with a constant baseline if the correct model is used.) The large misfit of this impostor model, especially in the initial boundaries, emphasizes the impact of the psFP signal change on the measured boundary amplitudes, not only the plateaus, and is therefore a very useful extension in particular of the discussion of the data from the rsEGFP2/FITC-BSA mixture.
