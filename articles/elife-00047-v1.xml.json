Here we identify DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a DNA sensor that activates innate immunity. We show that DNA-PK acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding cytoplasmic DNA and triggering the transcription of type I interferon (IFN), cytokine and chemokine genes in a manner dependent on IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Both cells and mice lacking DNA-PKcs show attenuated cytokine responses to both DNA and DNA viruses but not to RNA or RNA virus infection. DNA-PK has well-established functions in the DNA repair and V(D)J recombination, hence loss of DNA-PK leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, we now define a novel anti-microbial function for DNA-PK, a finding with implications for host defence, vaccine development and autoimmunity."

Here we identify DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a DNA sensor that activates innate immunity. We show that DNA-PK acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding cytoplasmic DNA and triggering the transcription of type I interferon (IFN), cytokine and chemokine genes in a manner dependent on IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Both cells and mice lacking DNA-PKcs show attenuated cytokine responses to both DNA and DNA viruses but not to RNA or RNA virus infection. DNA-PK has well-established functions in the DNA repair and V(D)J recombination, hence loss of DNA-PK leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, we now define a novel anti-microbial function for DNA-PK, a finding with implications for host defence, vaccine development and autoimmunity."

Many different cell types contribute to the innate immunity, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. Once alerted to injury or infection, these cells release proteins called cytokines, interferons and chemokines into the blood or directly into tissue. These proteins act as messengers and interact with receptors on the surfaces of other cells in the immune system, stimulating them to join the battle against the infection."

This enzyme, called DNA-PK for short, is best known for its ability to repair broken DNA inside the nucleus. Now Ferguson et al. have found that it is also present at high levels within fibroblasts, cells that are often primary targets of viral infection, and they go on to explain how the detection of DNA by DNA-PK triggers a sequence of events that leads to the innate immune response being activated. These events include the transcription of type I interferon, chemokines and cytokines in a manner that depends on the presence IRF-3, a transcription factor that has a central role in the response of the immune system to viral infection."

                        "text": "The innate immune response is mediated by the production of cytokines, including type I interferons (IFNs), and chemokines following the detection of pathogen-specific molecules by host cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akira et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Medzhitov, 2007</a>). Detection of nucleic acids is crucial in triggering the innate immune to pathogens, particularly in response to viruses (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</a>). Various double and single stranded RNA substrates are recognised directly by the DExD/H box RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5) in the cytoplasm and by the endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</a>). The engagement of such RNA receptors leads to the rapid transcription of genes encoding anti-viral proteins via the activation of transcription factors belonging to the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) families. It has been recognised for some time that intracellular DNA can activate a similar IRF-3-dependent innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</a>) and it is known that this signalling pathway depends on both the IRF-3-activating kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ishii et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2008</a>) and the adaptor protein stimulator of IFN genes (STING\u2014also known as MITA, ERIS and TMEM173) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ishikawa et al., 2009</a>). Only more recently, however, have some candidate receptors for these pathways been identified. DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Takaoka et al., 2007</a>), RNA polymerase III (RNA-Pol III) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ablasser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chiu et al., 2009</a>), IFN inducible gene 16 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Unterholzner et al., 2010</a>) and DDX41 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2011b</a>) have been described as cytoplasmic DNA sensors that activate IRF-3. Nonetheless, the in vivo relevance of these sensors remains unknown and the normal immune response to DNA stimulation of <i>Dai</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and <i>Ips1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ishii et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2008</a>) and sensing of plasmodium DNA independent of these receptors (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>) indicates other IRF-3-activating cytoplasmic DNA sensors exist. In addition, although TBK1 and STING are essential for activation of IRF-3 following DNA stimulation, the molecular details of this signalling pathway are poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib41\">Paludan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barber, 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "The presence of unidentified DNA sensors in fibroblasts is especially pertinent to virus infection since these cells are often a primary target of virus infection in vivo. These cells should have sentinel innate immune receptors in place to detect the presence of foreign nucleic acid and respond by producing IFN, cytokines and chemokines to initiate the anti-viral state in the surrounding tissue as well as to attract immune cells to the site of infection. In this study we identify DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a novel DNA sensor in fibroblasts where it is present at high levels enabling it to respond to incoming infection without the need for prior stimulation. DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of three proteins, Ku70, Ku80 (also known as Ku86) and the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs (encoded by the <i>xrcc6</i>, <i>xrcc5</i> and <i>prkcd</i> genes respectively). Ku70 and Ku80 themselves form a heterodimer and the absence of one subunit de-stabilises the expression of the other (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nussenzweig et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gu et al., 1997</a>). Both the Ku heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib56\">Walker et al., 2001</a>) and DNA-PKcs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hammarsten and Chu, 1998</a>) can bind directly to DNA but, in the absence of Ku the affinity of DNA-PKcs for DNA is greatly reduced (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yaneva et al., 1997</a>). DNA-PK has a well described role in the nucleus where it is necessary for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and so has a key role in repairing double-strand DNA breaks (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lieber et al., 2003</a>). DNA-PK has also been detected in the cytoplasm by immunofluorescence and cell fractionation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huston et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Balazs et al., 2012</a>), although prior to this study no function has been assigned to DNA-PK in this localisation. Here we found that, in the cytoplasm, DNA-PK signals via IRF-3 to activate an anti-microbial innate immune response to DNA mediated by the production of IFN, cytokines and chemokines. We show that DNA-PK co-localises with sites of viral DNA replication during VACV infection and the innate immune response to DNA and to infection with vaccinia virus (VACV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) was impaired in both cells and mice which lack components of DNA-PK."

We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation of both proteins (data not shown). In the study of <a href=\"#bib26\">Karpova et al.

To test whether phosphorylation of IRF-3 is necessary for the DNA-sensing function of DNA-PK, two approaches were taken. First, we tested <i>Prkdc</i><sup><i>SCID</i></sup> MEFs, which express a kinase-dead form of the DNA-PKcs protein lacking its C terminal 83 amino-acids (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blunt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Guimar\u00e3es-Costa et al., 2009</a>), for their ability to produce <i>Ifnb</i>, <i>Cxcl10</i> and <i>Il-6</i> in response to DNA or RNA.

Second, we used the DNA-PKcs-specific inhibitor NU7026 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Veuger et al., 2003</a>) to inhibit DNA-PKcs kinase activity in wild type MEFs. Cells treated with NU7026 showed no impairment in production of <i>Cxcl10</i> in response to DNA transfection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

To do this we developed an inducible system to study the DNA sensing signalling pathway. HEK293 cells do not activate IRF3 in response to DNA stimulation due to a defect in STING, but by introducing an inducible version of STING into these cells, and then inducing STING expression with doxycycline, the cells activate IRF-3 as shown by its phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) and produce cytokines (not shown) in response to double stranded ISD DNA concatamers. Using this system, immunoprecipitation showed that prior to DNA stimulation, STING exists in a complex with Ku70 but this interaction is abrogated following transfection of DNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>).

The absence of DNA-PK severely impaired induction of <i>Ifnb</i> and <i>Il6</i> in response to MVA but not to influenza virus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Similarly, <i>Prkdc</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice exhibited severe impairment of <i>Il6</i> induction in response to HSV-1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>): no <i>Ifnb</i> induction could be detected in this experiment. Overall these data confirm that the innate immune response to DNA viruses immediately after infection is significantly dependent upon DNA-PK, despite the presence of other DNA sensors reported hitherto."

In this study we show that the three proteins which constitute the DNA-PK complex; Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs, bind in significant amounts to DNA transfected into the cytoplasm of resting cells leading to an IRF-3-dependent innate immune response. Consistent with this, we found DNA-PK and TBK1 localised to sites of DNA replication during virus infection. Previous studies have ruled out a role for DNA-PK in the production of <i>Ifnb</i> in response to DNA in monocytic cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</a>) and HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2011a</a>). However, although DNA-PK components are expressed at high levels in a wide range of tissues and cell types, they are absent in primary macrophages ((<a href=\"#bib35\">Moll et al., 1999</a>) and data not shown), and we now show that in fibroblasts and in mice the innate immune response to DNA and DNA viruses is dependent on DNA-PKcs. The in vivo deficiency in DNA sensing in the absence of DNA-PKcs is observed despite the presumed presence of other DNA sensors. The observation that this defect is not extended to RNA, LPS or to RNA viruses shows that DNA-PK loss does not confer a general defect on intracellular innate immune signalling, and the same is true in cultured <i>Prkdc</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs which respond normally to RNA. It was noticed that the defect in the innate immune response to DNA was greater in cells lacking DNA-PKcs than in cells lacking Ku, even though Ku can still bind DNA in the absence of DNA-PKcs. This suggests that signalling can progress with DNA-PKcs interacting with DNA in the absence of Ku but that Ku enhances the signalling process by increasing the affinity of the protein complex for DNA. The phenotypic defect in DNA sensing was consistent in cells from four separate genotypes, ruling out the possibility that it was caused by a second site mutation. Consistent with this reintroduction of Ku80 into <i>Xrcc5</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells restored DNA sensing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>)."

Although kinase activity is essential for DNA-PKcs to function in DNA repair, and therefore V(D)J recombination, this mutation did not affect the ability of DNA-PK to function as an innate immune DNA sensor. The functional significance of the interaction of DNA-PK with IRF-3 and its subsequent N-terminal phosphorylation reported by <a href=\"#bib26\">Karpova et al. (2002)</a> remains unknown. However, we show here that Ku interacts with STING in resting cells and that this interaction is abrogated upon DNA stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). In the future, further work is necessary to understand how TBK-1 and STING contribute to the full activation of IRF-3 following binding of DNA to DNA-PK to allow IRF-3 translocation to occur."

DNA vaccination relies on DNA sensing to invoke a powerful innate immune response that, in turn, assists the adaptive response (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ishii et al., 2008</a>). Understanding how to optimise such vaccines, therefore, relies on understanding the mechanisms of detection of DNA by the immune system. Furthermore, one of the most common vaccine adjuvants, alum, acts by stimulating the release of DNA from neutrophils (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2011b</a>). Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) consist of webs of DNA with globular proteins, are released by a specific form of cell death (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fuchs et al., 2007</a>) and function as antimicrobial traps, thereby contributing to the innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brinkmann et al., 2004</a>)."

The ability of DNA to act as a DAMP may also link nucleic acid sensing to several autoimmune disorders. In general, autoimmune conditions are characterised by immune responses against host molecules and tissues and are frequently associated with inflammation. Although the causative factors of many such conditions are incompletely understood, it is clear that deregulation of immune signalling may lead to autoinflammation and autoimmunity in some instances (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rioux and Abbas, 2005</a>). Indeed, the accumulation of DNA and its subsequent detection by DNA sensing pathways can result in the initiation of autoimmune diseases. Mice which lack either of two enzymes responsible for degradation of DNA, 3\u2032 repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1) and DNaseII, develop spontaneous autoimmune disorders associated with the initiation of IRF-3-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kawane et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stetson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Okabe et al., 2008</a>). The absence of DNaseII results in chronic polyarthritis which is thought to be a result of the inflammation caused by a lack of clearance of DNA from macrophages (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kawane et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Okabe et al., 2008</a>). Trex1 deficiency or mutation, on the other hand, is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chilblain lupus and the human disease Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee-Kirsch et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stetson et al., 2008</a>) and in this case inflammation is initiated from non-haematopoietic cells via a STING-dependent pathway (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gall et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, defects in the clearance of NETs have also been suggested to contribute to the initiation of SLE (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hakkim et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, the up-regulation of the inflammasome-activating DNA sensor absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) in a mouse model of lupus and in patients with SLE-associated nephritis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roberts et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kimkong et al., 2009</a>) and the presence of anti-DNA-PK and anti-RNA-Pol III antibodies in patients with SLE and systemic sclerosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cavazzana et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2009</a>) makes the link between DNA sensing and autoimmune disorders worthy of further investigation."

This redundancy is not surprising given the tendency of pathogens to evolve escape-mechanisms for evading host immune mediators (<a href=\"#bib54\">Versteeg and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bardoel and Strijp, 2011</a>) in turn inducing the host to evolve further pathogen recognition mechanisms. In the context of DNA sensing this is exemplified by the relatively recent evolution of the PYHIN domain proteins, such AIM2 and IFI16 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schattgen and Fitzgerald, 2011</a>), which are a mammalian addition to the ancient innate immune system. Furthermore, a function of DAI was recently uncovered by identifying murine cytomegalovirus protein, vIRA, which interacts with DAI and inhibits its ability to initiate DNA-induced necroptosis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Upton et al., 2012</a>). The biological function for DAI may therefore be in the initiation of a cell death pathway, rather than an IRF-3 dependent inflammatory response. This indicates there are at least three outcomes to cytosolic DNA sensing, the induction of cytokine expression via IRF-3 and NF-kB activation, the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 via the AIM 2 inflammasome and the induction of necroptosis by DAI. What is not clear though, is how these different responses contribute to the overall immune response to infection by DNA pathogens and to what extent they are cell and tissue-type dependent. Further work is necessary to uncover the relative contributions of these different DNA sensing mechanisms in specific cell types and to different DNA structures as well as to understand how these sensors co-ordinate with STING and other adaptor proteins to activate TBK1 and IRF-3 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Paludan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barber, 2011</a>)."

Membranes were probed with antibodies against Ku70 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Ku80 (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), DNA-PKcs (Millipore, Billerica, MA), tubulin (Millipore, Billerica, MA), histone H3 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), hIRF-3 (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), p-IRF-3 (serine 396, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), HMGB1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MI) or VACV strain Western Reserve (<a href=\"#bib30\">Law et al., 2006</a>) and bound immunoglobulin was detected with horse-radish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Ku80, IRF-3 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) or control antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation from HeLa cell lysates expressing IRF-3. FLAG-agarose matrix (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MI) was used for immunoprecipitation of STING from STING-293Trex cells. For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded onto 15 mm glass coverslips, infected with MVA at 5 pfu per cell for 6 hr or transfected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilised with PBS containing 0.2% Triton-X100 and blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 hr at 20\u00b0C. Incubation with primary antibodies against Ku70 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), DNA-PKcs (Millipore, Billerica, MA), mIRF-3 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) hIRF-3, p65 (both Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) or TBK1 (Cell Signalling, Danvers, MA) diluted in PBS with 1% milk, for 1 hr at 20\u00b0C was followed by detection with alexa-fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cells were counterstained with DAPI and mounted with Mowiol. Images were obtained with a Zeiss Pascal 510 confocal microscope and processed with Zeiss LSM software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For quantification of translocation or IRF-3 or NF-\u03baB into the nucleus 50 cells were counted in random fields of view, in biological triplicates, for each condition and scored for the presence of nuclear staining."

Specifically, more than one MEF line needs to be used to avoid MEF specific artifacts, and complementation experiments need to be performed to rule out contribution of cell transformation status and other possible effects specific to the MEF lines used. In addition, the mechanism of kinase activity independent effect of DNA-PK needs to be clarified \u2013 if it does function as a scaffolding protein, there should be some evidence provided to substantiate this hypothesis.

The mutant cells do not activate IRF3 in response to DNA, but they do respond normally to DNA to activate NF-kB, normally to RNA stimulation, normally to LPS, and normally to RNA virus infection. The suggestion that the defect observed in DNA sensing leading to an IRF3 dependent innate immunity might be due to a general signalling defect is refuted by the data submitted."

HEK293 cells are defective in responding to DNA and this is shown to be overcome by inducible expression of STING (Figure 5E). Using this inducible cell line we show that STING interacts with Ku, and when the pathway is activated by transfection of DNA, the interaction with STING is lost (Figure 5F). This provides additional insight into how DNA-PK components engage the STING / TBK1 / IRF3 pathway, but the full elucidation of how this works is outside the scope of this paper."
