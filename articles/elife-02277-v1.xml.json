Peptidoglycan, the principal constituent of virtually all bacterial surfaces, is a specific molecular signature recognized by dedicated host receptors, present in animals and plants, which trigger an immune response. Here we report that autolysins from Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, enzymes capable of hydrolyzing peptidoglycan, have a major role in concealing this inflammatory molecule from <i>Drosophila</i> peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). We show that autolysins trim the outermost peptidoglycan fragments and that in their absence bacterial virulence is impaired, as PGRPs can directly recognize leftover peptidoglycan extending beyond the external layers of bacterial proteins and polysaccharides. The activity of autolysins is not restricted to the producer cells but can also alter the surface of neighboring bacteria, facilitating the survival of the entire population in the infected host."

Peptidoglycan, the principal constituent of virtually all bacterial surfaces, is a specific molecular signature recognized by dedicated host receptors, present in animals and plants, which trigger an immune response. Here we report that autolysins from Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, enzymes capable of hydrolyzing peptidoglycan, have a major role in concealing this inflammatory molecule from <i>Drosophila</i> peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). We show that autolysins trim the outermost peptidoglycan fragments and that in their absence bacterial virulence is impaired, as PGRPs can directly recognize leftover peptidoglycan extending beyond the external layers of bacterial proteins and polysaccharides. The activity of autolysins is not restricted to the producer cells but can also alter the surface of neighboring bacteria, facilitating the survival of the entire population in the infected host."

This is achieved through specific PGRPs: PGRP-LC specifically recognizes DAP-type PGN, usually found in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacilli, and activates the Imd pathway (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leulier et al., 2003</a>), while PGRP-SA recognizes lysine-type PGN, which surrounds most Gram-positive bacteria, and activates the Toll pathway (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>). Activation of either pathway results in a series of multiple defense reactions that include the production and secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph of flies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>). In mammals, PGRPs can act as antibacterial agents due to their bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic activity, mediated by PGN hydrolytic activity (e.g. PGLYRP-2 [<a href=\"#bib13\">Dziarski and Gupta, 2006</a>]) or by the binding of PGRPs to targets on the bacterial cell surface, which causes the activation of specific bacterial two-component systems, resulting in bacteria killing through a mechanism that includes membrane depolarization and production of hydroxyl radicals (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kashyap et al., 2011</a>)."

In the fly survival assay for the pathogenicity rescue of <i>atl</i> null mutants, 100 \u03bcl of each bacterial cell suspension were incubated with cell-free supernatants of wild type or \u0394<i>atl</i> mutants (prepared as described above) for 30 min at 30\u00b0C. Treated bacterial cells were washed twice, resuspended in an equal volume of PBS and further diluted so that approximately 100 CFUs would be injected per fly. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, on different days. Following injection, flies were kept at 30\u00b0C and survival assessed every 12 h over a period of 3 days. Since the trends in survival were the same for each sample of a triplicate (i.e., survival curves were positioned similarly, relative to one another), the three independent biological repeats were combined (n = 75) and estimates of survival curves were plotted."

In this way, the cell can better evade the fly's innate immunity. The authors not only show the effect of autolysin mutants on binding by purified fly protein, they also work with purified autolysin and fragments. Importantly, they show effect on adult flies and they extend the findings to Streptococcus. From the perspective of an outsider (I am no expert in cell wall nor innate immunity) these results do appear to have wide implications.

The authors extend their observations from their model organism <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> to <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i> and present a model for their results. The model proposes that autolysins trim the exposed peptidoglycan to remove any potential binding sites for innate immune receptors of the PGRP family, in this particular case, PGRP-SA. The authors conclude that it is rather binding to the exposed peptidoglycan than detection of release peptidoglycan that is important for host response. I do not agree with their conclusion and model. The authors can only conclude that autolytic activities such as amidases are important for innate immune escape (not novel) but not on the structural nature of the peptidoglycan relevant for detection in vivo (soluble versus surface attached). PGRPs such as PGRP-SA require the stem peptide for detection. Hence, amidase activities are bound to reduce the biological activity of the peptidoglycan, both of the attached as the release one. Amidase treated peptidoglycan or peptidoglycan fragments are no longer ligands for PGRP-SA due to the absolute requirement of both the stem peptide and the sugar backbone for binding. In fact, the Drosophila produces also amidases to dampen the biological activity of circulating peptidoglycan such as PGRP-LB. To conclude that it is PGRP-SA binding to the outer layers of the peptidoglycan rather soluble circulating peptidoglycan fragments that are important for innate immune detection by PGRP-SA, the authors should perform a series of experiments:"

The Filipe group analyzes the mechanism allowing this bacterium to be hidden from pattern-recognition detection. They have previously shown that teichoic acid protects <i>S. aureus</i> from being detected by PGRP-SA, a secreted pattern-recognition receptor of Drosophila that interacts with peptidoglycan. In this study Atilano et al. report the identification of one gene, <i>atl</i>, encoding an autolysin that reduces the binding of PGRP-SA to <i>S. aureus</i>. They also show that the <i>S. aureus atl</i> mutant is less virulent towards Drosophila in vivo (as previously reported by another paper, Tabuchi et al.). They also show that both teichoic acid and Atl synergistically reduce the immunogenicity of <i>S. aureus</i>. Based on their data, they propose a model in which the autolysin Atl trims peptidoglycans, reducing its exposure to secreted pattern-recognition receptors. To my knowledge, this work uncovers a new mechanism for autolysin in preventing the detection of Gram-positive bacteria by host peptidoglycan sensors. The paper is a very interesting and contains many striking results. However, it still lacks critical experiments to clearly establish that Atl affects Toll activation by <i>S. aureus</i> in vivo."

As mentioned by the reviewer one other such factor is phagocytosis.

We also don\u00b4t think opsonisation is happening here. In our PLoS Pathogens paper (<a href=\"#bib5\">Atilano et al 2011</a>, PLoS Pathog 7, e1002421) we described how during host defence against another <i>S. aureus</i> mutant (TagO) that binds more PGRP-SA, bacterial killing by the host is dependent on PGRP-SA but not on Toll/NF-kB. This shows that as long as there is good access to peptidoglycan for PGRP-SA to bind around the cell surface of the bacterium, bacteria can be eliminated quickly and so Toll signalling is dispensable. Evidence from other insects (especially the very detailed work on the beetle <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> by the Lee lab over a number of years \u2013 for a very nice review of their work see Park et al Adv Exp Med Biol 708, p163, 2010) point towards the assembly of a \u201ckilling\u201d complex that has to do with melanisation, an insect-specific response resembling complement activation. Ligoxygakis and Atilano are actively pursuing this line of research but we believe that it is beyond the scope of the present study."
