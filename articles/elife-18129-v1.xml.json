The initial step in eukaryotic DNA replication is the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, including the formation of two head-to-head hexameric helicases around the replication origin. How these hexameric helicases interact with their origin dsDNA remains unknown. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the SV40 Large-T Antigen (LT) hexameric helicase bound to its origin dsDNA. The structure shows that the six subunits form a near-planar ring that interacts with the origin, so that each subunit makes unique contacts with the DNA. The origin dsDNA inside the narrower AAA+ domain channel shows partial melting due to the compression of the two phosphate backbones, forcing Watson-Crick base-pairs within the duplex to flip outward. This structure provides the first snapshot of a hexameric helicase binding to origin dsDNA, and suggests a possible mechanism of origin melting by LT during SV40 replication in eukaryotic cells."

The initial step in eukaryotic DNA replication is the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, including the formation of two head-to-head hexameric helicases around the replication origin. How these hexameric helicases interact with their origin dsDNA remains unknown. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the SV40 Large-T Antigen (LT) hexameric helicase bound to its origin dsDNA. The structure shows that the six subunits form a near-planar ring that interacts with the origin, so that each subunit makes unique contacts with the DNA. The origin dsDNA inside the narrower AAA+ domain channel shows partial melting due to the compression of the two phosphate backbones, forcing Watson-Crick base-pairs within the duplex to flip outward. This structure provides the first snapshot of a hexameric helicase binding to origin dsDNA, and suggests a possible mechanism of origin melting by LT during SV40 replication in eukaryotic cells."

The initiation of DNA replication involves crucial steps in the assembly of replication proteins at the origin and in the subsequent melting of the origin DNA. For DNA replication in prokaryotic cells, the initiator protein, DnaA, first binds to the replication origin to initiate origin melting. The replicative DnaB-family of hexameric helicases are then loaded onto the fully melted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for replication fork unwinding [reviewed in <a href=\"#bib39\">O'Donnell et al. (2013</a>)] and references therein). For DNA replication in archaeal and eukaryotic cells, replicative helicases, such as minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) and SV40 Large T Antigen (LT), load onto the origin dsDNA as head-head (or N-N) double hexamers [reviewed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Fanning and Zhao (2009</a>); <a href=\"#bib17\">Gai et al. (2010</a>); <a href=\"#bib39\">O'Donnell et al. (2013</a>); <a href=\"#bib46\">Slaymaker and Chen (2012</a>) and references therein]. The origin bound\u00a0by the double hexameric helicases, together with other replication factors, will eventually melt the duplex and produce a pair of replication forks. Despite extensive efforts, the molecular interactions of these hexamer helicases in archaeal and eukaryotic replication systems with their origin dsDNA have yet to be defined."

As a result, the SV40 replication system serves as a model for studying the eukaryotic replication process [reviewed by\u00a0<a href=\"#bib5\">Bullock and Simmons\u00a0(1997</a>); <a href=\"#bib15\">Fanning and Zhao (2009</a>) and references therein]. To initiate DNA replication, MCM helicase proteins from archaeal and eukaryotic cells assemble a double hexamer at the origin dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib14\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fletcher et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mendez and Stillman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Remus et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ticau et al., 2015</a>), a process that requires the cellular origin recognition complex (Orc) as well as additional protein factors. By contrast, the SV40 LT helicase alone is sufficient in recognizing its origin and assembles as a\u00a0double hexamer at the origin dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Borowiec et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cuesta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Valle et al., 2006</a>). On linear blunt-ended dsDNA, containing the SV40 origin sequence, purified LT alone can generate bi-directional unwinding forks from the dsDNA origin region, producing 'rabbit ear'-like single-stranded DNA loops emanating out of the LT complex (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wessel et al., 1992b</a>). These studies, together with other reports (<a href=\"#bib2\">Borowiec et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Borowiec and Hurwitz, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Joo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Valle et al., 2006</a>), demonstrate that LT alone can sufficiently assemble as a double hexamer at the origin, melt the origin DNA, and generate bi-directional unwinding forks.

LT helicase domain consists of a Zn-domain and an AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

The core replication origin DNA of SV40 consists of 64 base pairs (bps) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) that can be divided into two halves, the AT-half and the early palindrome half (EP-half),\u00a0each containing two GAGGC penta-nucleotide sequences (PEN) plus a stretch of AT-rich sequence (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dean et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deb et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sreekumar et al., 2001</a>).

This co-crystal structure, the first for\u00a0a hexameric helicase bound to its origin dsDNA in its central channel, reveals detailed molecular interactions between the six subunits and the origin sequence.

Previously, using electron microscopy (EM), we showed that a slightly longer LT108 construct can assemble as a double hexamer on dsDNA containing the full 64-bp core origin in the presence of ATP or ADP, and can support the replication of such DNA in HeLa cell extract (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cuesta et al., 2010</a>). To the best of our knowledge, LT is unique in that it can unwind blunt-ended dsDNA containing its origin sequence, whereas the\u00a0other hexameric helicases characterized to date are not capable of unwinding blunt-ended dsDNA efficiently without the aid of additional protein component(s). We previously also showed that purified LT131 alone, like the full-length LT, can efficiently unwind blunt-ended dsDNA containing the origin sequences in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a>). LT131 also forms stable hexameric complexes bound to the 32-bp AT-half of the origin along\u00a0with ADP or ATP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interestingly, these stable pre-formed hexamers/double hexamers on origin dsDNA are also capable of unwinding the DNA when Mg<sup>2+</sup> is supplied (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), which is consistent with previous reports for full-length LT (<a href=\"#bib51\">Uhlmann-Schiffler et al., 2002</a>). This result suggests that the LT double hexamers assembled at the origin sequence are fully competent in generating the initial local origin melting to promote the complete unwinding of the dsDNA."

This is clearly different from the previously reported co-crystal structure of the dimeric LT131 in complex with the EP-half of the origin sequence (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a>), in\u00a0which one of the two OBDs binds to the canonical PEN in the same way that\u00a0has\u00a0been reported by others (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bochkareva et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Meinke et al., 2007</a>), and the other OBD binds to a newly identified pseudo-PEN (GC) sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

The dsDNA segment bps 1\u201324 is in B-form, while a stretch of A-T base pairs, most of which are within the AAA+ channel lined by the \u03b2-hairpins and DRF loops, is severely deformed (bps 25\u201332, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,D</a>), disrupting the base paring to yield locally melted duplex DNA.

One major consequence of the closer phosphate backbone distance within the stretch\u00a0of\u00a0deformed DNA is the disruption of normal Watson-Crick base-paring within the duplex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Interestingly, each of the two DNA backbones interact with nearly identical sets of amino acid residues (N267, K331, N332, K334\u00a0and\u00a0T335) that come from different subunits (subunits i-vi) and that\u00a0are\u00a0arranged in different orientations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Specifically,\u00a0the 5\u2019\u21923\u2019 ssDNA interacts with a set of residues\u00a0from N\u2192C domain of the helicase\u00a0containing: N267 of subunit i and ii, K331 of i, ii, and iii, N332 of ii, iii, and iv, and\u00a0T335 of iv and v (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>). Its complementary strand (also from 5\u2019\u21923\u2019 direction), interacts with a similar set of residues but from different subunits: K334 of i and ii, T335 of i and vi, N332 of v and vi, and\u00a0N332 and K331 of v (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>). Therefore, despite their\u00a0opposite orientations, the two antiparallel ssDNA strands of the B-form DNA interact with two different sets\u00a0of but chemically identical,\u00a0amino acids along the channel surface of the Zn-domain. In other words, these two sets of amino acid residues make near identical bond interactions with\u00a0DNA phosphate backbones running in\u00a0either the 5\u2019\u21923\u2019 or 3\u2019\u21925\u2019 orientation."

Because this stretch of channel is clearly narrower than the dimension of B-form dsDNA, the dsDNA bound inside has to be deformed in order to fit through the smaller channel. As a result, the two backbones in this segment are closer to each other than in standard B-form dsDNA; this deformation is a consequence of compression by two opposing subunits of the hexamer around the narrow channel. The deformation of DNA should also be assisted by its interactions with residues on the \u03b2-hairpins and DRF loops in the channel walls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>). When the two phosphate backbones are compressed by the \u03b2-hairpins and the DRF loops, the base-pairs within the duplex are forced to flip outward, leading to the local melting of the dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>)."

While the majority of the origin dsDNA in the larger N-terminal portion of LT hexamer is in B-form, the AT-rich sequence bound within the narrow AAA+ channel segment is partially melted, revealing a\u00a0probable origin-melting mechanism."

This includes both the small opening of the hexamer channel in the AAA+ domain and the near-planar arrangement of the six subunits, \u03b2-hairpins, and DRF loops in the central channel. Several DNA-free hexameric structures of the LT helicase domain have been reported\u00a0previously, including\u00a0the structures\u00a0of\u00a0three different nucleotide (nt)-bound states: the empty form alone or in complex with other proteins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lilyestrom et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>); the ADP-form, with all six nt pockets occupied by ADP, and the ATP-form, with all six nt pockets occupied by ADP-BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gai et al., 2004b</a>). These different DNA-free hexameric structures reveal substantial concerted conformational changes for the six \u03b2-hairpins and DRF loops within and along the central channel of LT hexamer, but\u00a0the overall conformations of these hexamers are quite similar (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gai et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lilyestrom et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). Subsequent\u00a0comparisons\u00a0of the dsDNA-bound and DNA-free LT hexameric helicase structures, both in the ADP-form, show that these structural features are essentially maintained regardless of DNA binding. This strongly suggests that the binding of dsDNA in the central channel, per se, has no major impact on the overall conformation of the protein hexamer. Obviously, it is the conformational state of the protein hexamer that determines the conformation of the bound dsDNA. By extension, the cyclic conformational changes of hexameric LT are expected to drive the remodeling of the bound dsDNA, as shown by the different nt-bound states:\u00a0ATP-binding shrinks the central channel further than ADP-binding and triggers large \u03b2-hairpin movement inside the central channel (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gai et al., 2004b</a>)."

One simple explanation could be that planar \u03b2-hairpins in the LT-dsDNA structure and staircase \u03b2-hairpins in the E1-ssDNA structure represent two distinct stages of DNA replication. The LT-dsDNA structure may correspond to a pre-initiation hexameric complex that\u00a0is\u00a0assembled at the origin before it\u00a0propagates into full replication forks;\u00a0whereas, the E1-ssDNA structure may represent a hexameric helicase encircling a single strand of DNA for later-stage replication fork unwinding (<a href=\"#bib12\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). This simple explanation would then imply an ability\u00a0of\u00a0LT and E1 to\u00a0switch between the planar and staircase conformations, even though only one conformation has been consistently observed in structures of\u00a0either protein\u00a0determined to date. It is possible that the crystallographic packing somehow selectively traps the \u03b2-hairpins in the planar conformation for LT and the staircase conformation for E1, despite the crystallization buffer condition. One other major difference between E1 and LT is that E1 requires the assistance of an E2 protein for origin assembly [reviewed by\u00a0<a href=\"#bib32\">McBride (2013</a>) and references therein], whereas LT alone is sufficient\u00a0for origin assembly. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of other potential mechanistic differences in origin assembly and origin melting by LT and by\u00a0E1 helicases."

It is apparent that the helicase conformations dictate the conformation of the bound DNA inside the hexameric channel. Specifically, when the origin dsDNA is bound inside the narrower segment of the channel lined by the \u03b2-hairpins and DRF loops of LT, the two phosphate backbones will be remodeled according to the size and shape of the hexameric channel. The remodeling process involves the 'squeezing' or compressing force of the \u03b2-hairpins and DRF loops pushing the two phosphate\u00a0backbones closer to each other, forcing the Watson-Crick base-pairs between the two backbones to flip outwards, leading to\u00a0base-pair disruption and base flipping in the AT-rich region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>). Therefore, the co-crystal structure suggests that these locally melted origin base-pairs are probably the consequence of a 'squeezing' by the narrower channel formed upon the completion of the hexamer assembly, rather than a more intuitive pulling or prying apart\u00a0of the two strands. The K512/H513 residues on the \u03b2-hairpins and the D455/R456/F459 residues on the DRF loops of the AAA+ domain not only apply the 'squeezing' action to the two phosphate backbones\u00a0directly, but also interact with the DNA from both the major and minor groove to generate the deformation and local melting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

The\u00a0helicase domains of each hexamer then\u00a0bind to the AT-rich sequences, while the six OBDs take on dynamic conformations, loosely interacting with the limited number of PEN/pseudo-PEN sites. Upon completion of LT hexamer/double hexamer assembly, the helicase domains of the six LT subunits form a tight, near-planar ring,\u00a0rather\u00a0than a spiral conformation, around the dsDNA. Concurrent with the assembly of this ring with a narrow central channel\u00a0around the AT-rich sequences , local origin melting within the helicase domain may be achieved as a result of the formation of the narrow channel, which\u00a0consists of the \u03b2-hairpins and DRF loops.\u00a0The narrow channel compresses (or squeezes) the two phosphate backbones of the dsDNA to distort\u00a0and\u00a0melt the origin DNA. It is possible that more helical\u00a0subunits are added to adimer intermediate, which converts to a planar arrangement once a full hexamer is formed, a\u00a0process\u00a0that could provide further energy for distorting/melting the oriDNA."

Several co-crystal studies of the isolated OBD domain of LT (or E1) have\u00a0revealed how individual OBD recognizes the PEN DNA sequences (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bochkareva et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Enemark et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Meinke et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Meinke et al., 2013</a>):\u00a0individual OBDs do not interact with each other, but bind tightly to the PENs using the same interactions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). However, the OBDs in the hexameric LT131-oriDNA complex structure do not bind to the PENs and are disordered (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The disordered OBDs in the hexamer complex also differ from the well-ordered OBDs of the LT131 dimer-oriDNA complex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a>), in\u00a0which one OBD (OBD1) binds to PEN1 and the other OBD (OBD2) bind to a pseudo-PEN site with about 180\u00b0\u00a0rotation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), with no interactions between the two OBDs. However, the helicase domains of the same two LT molecules bind to the AT-rich oriDNA as a tight dimer with about 60\u00b0\u00a0rotation to each other. This structure of LT131 dimer-oriDNA suggests that, when OBD is linked to the helicase domain, the binding of two OBDs to PEN/pseudo-PEN probably functions to coordinate with the binding of\u00a0the\u00a0helicase domain\u00a0to the AT-rich sequences where the initial melting occurs. Furthermore, when a complete closed hexameric ring is assembled around each half origin, it creates a problem of six OBDs with only three available binding sites (PEN1, PEN2 and one pseudo-PEN). The disordered OBDs in the hexamer-oriDNA structure indicate that OBD1 and OBD2 of the initial dimer-oriDNA intermediate no longer bind to oriDNA tightly, probably\u00a0because\u00a0of competition for limited binding sites among the six OBDs. This provides an explanation for the lack of well-defined electron density for the six OBDs in the hexamer structure, which is also consistent with our prior low-resolution EM studies showing the flexibility of the OBDs in the central part of the double hexamer structure (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cuesta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Valle et al., 2006</a>)."

To\u00a0convert\u00a0this partially melted origin to a fully opened origin, represented by a pair of replication forks, the melted ssDNA must find a way to exit the hexameric channel, as LT has been shown to translocate\u00a0preferentially\u00a0along one ssDNA during unwinding (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yardimci et al., 2012</a>) and E1 has been shown to bind ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</a>). But LT unwinding activity can bypass a polypeptide road-block (similar to the size of a ssDNA) cross-linked to DNA substrates, suggesting that LT hexamers have sufficient plasticity to alter their\u00a0conformation around DNA and allow the passage of ssDNA without falling apart (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yardimci et al., 2012</a>). At present, we have no data regarding this process that\u00a0might\u00a0reveal how the\u00a0initial melting of oriDNA propagates into fully open replication forks. Nevertheless, the partially melted AT-half origin within the LT helicase channel may represent a snapshot of the initially melted origin primed for further propagation into two bi-directional forks in the SV40 viral replication system and in other related eukaryotic replicons."

As a control, the unwinding assay was also conducted side-by-side with un-preformed LT-oriDNA complex, in which reaction cocktails missing LT and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were mixed on ice right before the unwinding assay (to prevent formation of LT-oriDNA complex), with the MgCl<sub>2</sub> and LT protein added last to initiate the reaction."

The electron density map calculated using the MR solution model of LT revealed some DNA electron density in the central channel, which was not very well featured at this stage. We improved the electron density map through six-fold multi-domain NCS averaging (i.e. separating the helicase domain into\u00a0the\u00a0Zn-domain and\u00a0the\u00a0AAA+ domain for two-domain six-fold NCS averaging)\u00a0with solvent flattening prior to any DNA model building, using the CCP4 program DMMULTI. For NCS averaging, the residues on these \u03b2-hairpins and the loops (in particular, residues 330\u2013340 of the\u00a0Zn-domain, 509\u2013518 of the \u03b2-hairpins, and 452\u2013463 of the DRF loop) facing the central channel were deleted from the MR model for two major purposes. The first purpose was to avoid model bias because these \u03b2-hairpin and loop residues may have different conformations due to interactions with DNA. The second purpose was to\u00a0calculate a tight mask (1.0\u2009\u00c5 radius from atoms) covering the LT model with the central residues/loops deleted for NCS averaging. This was done so that the central channel space, where the DNA is located, would be completely masked out for NCS averaging, crucial for revealing the unbiased DNA density in the NCS averaged map. The mask was smoothed and islands inside the mask were removed using program MAMA in the\u00a0RAVE suite (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kleywegt and Jones, 1999</a>). The six-fold NCS averaging (50 cycles) using the improved tight mask yielded a greatly improved electron density map in the central channel,\u00a0which revealed clear base-pair steps in the\u00a0helical nature of the DNA density in the central channel (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This NCS averaged map was used to\u00a0build the model ofthe DNA and the deleted residues/loops of LT in the central channel using program 'O'. However, for the fuzzy density of the N-terminal OBD, no significant improvement was achieved. The six OBD domains\u00a0were only be visible as six blobs of density at low sigma level near, but not touching, the DNA density in the center. As a result, OBDs could not be built into the structure model."

SV40 LTag is required for recognition and unwinding of SV40 origin of replication DNA. SV40 LTag and the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, the Mcm2-7 complex, both form a double hexamer around the dsDNA prior to replication initiation. Thus, how SV40 LTag initiates DNA melting could be related to the same event in eukaryotic cells. Similar to previous structures of SV40 LTag, the authors observe a hexameric structure in a planar configuration with each subunit being in a similar conformation. The associated DNA is in a typical B-form conformation across most of its length but becomes deformed and partially melted in a narrow portion of the AAA+ domain of SV40 LTag, a region that would be near the interface of the two hexamers in the double hexamer (but the structure reported is of a single LTag hexamer). This deformation suggests that DNA melting is caused by a \"squeezing\" rather than a \"pulling\"/\"prying\" mechanism. By providing a view of a hexameric helicase surrounding well-defined dsDNA, this structure offers important new insights and the mechanism for DNA melting proposed has interesting implication for the mechanisms involved in DNA replication initiation for both SV40 (and related viruses) and eukaryotic cells."

It is important to note, however, that specific interactions between the protein and the bases could have occurred prior to the structure captured. The best way to address this possibility would be to test mutants in DRF loops or K512/H513 amino acids and see how they effect initial DNA unwinding (e.g. using KMnO4 sensitivity). Without such mutants, the authors should discuss the possibility that there are more specific pushing or prying mechanisms that drive the partial melting but are not observed in the structure captured."

Given the similarity between E1 and SV40 origin binding proteins, the authors should compare their findings to those made addressing DNA unwinding by the E1 helicase (e.g. Schnuck and Stenlund, 2010 and Liu et al., 2007). Finally, the authors should do a better job of explaining where initial DNA melting occurs at the SV40 origin and how this corresponds to their findings."

Although the squeezing model is intriguing and is a potentially powerful solution to how viral helicases solve the initial unwinding problem, the authors need to provide a more even-handed discussion of other potential models. There is substantial evidence that other mechanisms may contribute to the DNA melting event. Several lines of evidence in the literature indicate that the stepwise assembly \u2013 from a dimer to two hexamers \u2013 occurs sequentially via interaction of the OBDs at adjacent dsDNA recognition sites. This leads to a situation where the proteins spiral around the dsDNA helical axis. This is true for LT and also for E1 (for structures, see: 2ITL, 4FGN, 1KSX, 1KSY)."

By describing LT assembly as planar at all points in time, the authors avoid making a significant comparison to the work of Stenlund on DNA melting. Although it is possible that E1 and SV40 LT function by different mechanisms, because the authors are only looking at the final outcome of the assembly, it is not possible to eliminate a role for a switch between a spiral and planar conformation as contributing to the distorted DNA structure observed.

We used biochemistry to show that, upon adding Mg++, the pre-formed ring-shaped LT complex on origin DNA unwinds the origin with similar efficiency as the un-preformed complex on origin DNA. This suggests that the melted ssDNA region must become increasingly larger upon cyclic ATP binding/hydrolysis and that the melted ssDNA must exit the hexameric channel either fully or partially to achieve full origin melting and unwinding. We stated in the revision that the melted ssDNA must find a way to exit the hexameric channel, as LT has shown to preferentially translocate along one ssDNA during unwinding (Yardimci et al., 2012) and E1 has shown to interact with ssDNA (Enemark, 2006; and 2008). The exact details of how LT and other archaeal/eukaryotic replicative helicase interact and unwind fork DNA is still lacking. However, the action of LT unwinding can bypass a polypeptide road-block (similar to the size of a ssDNA) cross-linked to DNA substrates, suggesting that the LT hexamer has sufficient plasticity to alter its conformation around DNA and allow the passage of ssDNA without falling off the unwound substrate (Yardimci et al., 2012). Also, the mutational results for the potential role of the \u03b2-hairpin His residue in LT (Kumar, 2007) and E1 (Schnuck and Stenlund, 2010 and Liu et al., 2007) in origin melting are discussed here. We also stated that, at present, we have no data regarding the process of how this initial melting of oriDNA propagates into fully open replication forks, and that a more comprehensive understanding of this process will require future high-resolution information regarding LT interactions with different types of DNA substrates such as the origin dsDNA to partially melted origin to the final replication fork.

While no spiral assembly of hexamer helicases on dsDNA has ever been reported, the spiral assembly of hexameric motors on ssDNA has been reported for E1, DnaB, and Rho\u2026\u201d. We hope this revision has achieved a more even-handed discussion of other possibilities, as suggested by this comment."

The DNA free hexamer forms in different nucleotide states (empty, ADP, or ATP bound) all have central channel smaller than the B-from dsDNA. When LT hexamer assembles on the origin dsDNA with ADP bound, the hexamer conformation and narrow central channel opening of the AAA+ domain is very similar to that of the ADP-bound hexamer without DNA in the central channel. Therefore, the assembly of the LT hexamer around the origin dsDNA with ADP binding will form a narrow channel on the AAA+ domain to provide \u201csqueezing\u201d on the dsDNA that may result in local melting. When binding to ATP, the AAA+ domain channel is about 3-5 \u00c5 narrower than that in the ADP-bound form (Gai et al., Cell, 2004), consistent with the much more extensive local origin melting when ATP is used instead of ADP (Borowiec and Hurwitz, EMBOJ, 1988)."
