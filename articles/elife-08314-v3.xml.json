                    "text": "Within the confines of tissues, cancer cells can use blebs to migrate. Eps8 is an actin bundling and capping protein whose capping activity is inhibited by Erk, a key MAP kinase that is activated by oncogenic signaling. We tested the hypothesis that Eps8 acts as an Erk effector to modulate actin cortex mechanics and thereby mediate bleb-based migration of cancer cells. Cells confined in a non-adhesive environment migrate in the direction of a very large \u2018leader bleb.\u2019 Eps8 bundling activity promotes cortex tension and intracellular pressure to drive leader bleb formation. Eps8 capping and bundling activities act antagonistically to organize actin within leader blebs, and Erk mediates this effect. An Erk biosensor reveals concentrated kinase activity within leader blebs. Bleb contents are trapped by the narrow neck that separates the leader bleb from the cell body. Thus, Erk activity promotes actin bundling by Eps8 to enhance cortex tension and drive the bleb-based migration of cancer cells under non-adhesive confinement."

                    "text": "Within the confines of tissues, cancer cells can use blebs to migrate. Eps8 is an actin bundling and capping protein whose capping activity is inhibited by Erk, a key MAP kinase that is activated by oncogenic signaling. We tested the hypothesis that Eps8 acts as an Erk effector to modulate actin cortex mechanics and thereby mediate bleb-based migration of cancer cells. Cells confined in a non-adhesive environment migrate in the direction of a very large \u2018leader bleb.\u2019 Eps8 bundling activity promotes cortex tension and intracellular pressure to drive leader bleb formation. Eps8 capping and bundling activities act antagonistically to organize actin within leader blebs, and Erk mediates this effect. An Erk biosensor reveals concentrated kinase activity within leader blebs. Bleb contents are trapped by the narrow neck that separates the leader bleb from the cell body. Thus, Erk activity promotes actin bundling by Eps8 to enhance cortex tension and drive the bleb-based migration of cancer cells under non-adhesive confinement."

Cells move by orchestrating their extracellular interactions with intracellular cytoskeleton-dependent changes in shape and force generation; protruding forward, grasping sites in the environment, and pulling themselves along (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Papusheva and Heisenberg, 2010</a>). Although the pulling forces driving cell movement are well known to be mediated by myosin-based contraction (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</a>), recently it has become clear that migrating cells can utilize multiple mechanisms to drive protrusion and interaction with their environment (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</a>). Protrusion of the cell's plasma membrane boundary can be driven by either actin polymerization or by pressure-driven membrane blebbing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charras and Paluch, 2008</a>), while grasping the environment can be mediated by specific adhesion receptors that bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or other cells, or by non-specific friction (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bergert et al., 2015</a>). These multiple modes of migration are adopted by different cell types in different contexts. For example immune cells utilize adhesion-independent migration during tissue surveillance (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lammermann et al., 2008</a>), while endothelial cells utilize polymerization-driven protrusion during angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lamalice et al., 2007</a>)."

Indeed, intravital imaging revealed that melanoma and breast cancer cells migrate by blebbing in live mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tozluoglu et al., 2013</a>). Thus, metastatic cancer cells are hypothesized to be susceptible to MAT in vivo, with the plasticity of their migration modes and lack of specificity in adhesion contributing to their high invasivity and difficulty targeting (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</a>)."

In mesenchymal migration, actin polymerization initiated by localized activation of a filament-nucleating factor drives the formation of actin networks or bundles that mediate lamellipodial or filopodial membrane protrusion (<a href=\"#bib49\">Skau and Waterman, 2015</a>). In contrast, in blebbing cells, membrane protrusion is mediated by myosin II contractility-induced hydrostatic pressure that drives a bubbling-out of the plasma membrane at a site of local weakness in the cortical actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charras et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Charras and Paluch, 2008</a>). While the molecular mechanisms mediating polymerization-based protrusion and contractility-induced pressure are reasonably well understood, the molecules responsible for local changes in the actin cortex that allow bleb formation are not known. It is hypothesized that blebs could form either by local down-regulation of membrane-cytoskeleton linkers such as those of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family (<a href=\"#bib13\">Estecha et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lorentzen et al., 2011</a>), or by local weakening of sites in the cortical actin network itself (<a href=\"#bib6\">Charras et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, experiments using actin depolymerizing drugs have shown cortex integrity to be an important factor in regulating blebbing (<a href=\"#bib6\">Charras et al., 2006</a>). Local inhomogeneity in cortical integrity could be mediated by regulation of actin filament number or organization. In turn, filament number could be controlled by modulating the activity of filament nucleators, cappers or depolymerizers, while actin organization could be regulated by filament crosslinkers, bundlers or motor proteins. However, the proteins critical to regulating actin cortical organization and mechanics during blebbing are not known."

It is well-known that Erk-mediated activation of myosin II promotes cell contractility (<a href=\"#bib23\">Klemke et al., 1997</a>).

Additionally, the actin filament capping activity of Eps8 is inhibited by Erk through phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Menna et al., 2009</a>). Thus, the dual actin regulatory functions and targeting by Erk make Eps8 a good candidate for regulating the cortex downstream of oncogenic signaling."

We find that Eps8 bundling activity promotes cortex tension and pressure to drive MAT in non-adherent, confined cells, which migrate with a characteristic \u2018leader-bleb\u2019 morphology. Within leader blebs, Eps8 capping and bundling activities act antagonistically, and phosphorylation by Erk mediates this effect. Using a FRET biosensor for Erk, we document a massive concentration of kinase activity within leader blebs and find that leader bleb contents are trapped by the bleb neck that separates the bleb from the cell body. Our results identify a mechanism by which Eps8 may promote the transition to rapid, unregulated migration of cancer cells in confinement that may be critical to their highly invasive behavior in vivo."

We imaged Eps8 and the actin cytoskeleton by spinning disk confocal microscopy in cells that were fixed and stained with fluorescent phalloidin and either immunolabeled with antibodies to Eps8 or expressing Emerald-tagged mouse Eps8 (Emerald-mEps8). When cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips to promote adhesion and spreading, actin formed a dense meshwork in the lamellipodia near the cell edge, and circumferential arcs and stress fibers in the lamella and cell body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Both endogenous and Emerald-mEps8 localized primarily to lamellipodia and arcs, but were absent from stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To determine Eps8 distribution in a non-adhesive environment, A375 cells co-expressing Emerald-mEps8 and FusionRed-tagged F-tractin (an actin filament binding peptide, [<a href=\"#bib42\">Schell et al., 2001</a>]) were plated on uncoated glass. Here, cells were rounded, and confocal sections midway through the cell Z-axis revealed a dense band of cortical actin at the periphery of the cell body. From this cortical band extended many blebs that possessed thin, continuous rims of cortical actin at their membranes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Eps8 was absent from the dense cortical band of the cell body, but localized with actin in punctae along the peripheral rim of actin in blebs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). Co-expression of FusionRed-F-tractin and EGFP-tagged myosin II regulatory light chain (GFP-MII-RLC, a marker of myosin II isoforms) in non-adherent cells showed that myosin II was concentrated on the dense cortical band and was at very low levels or absent from the bleb periphery (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Thus, Eps8 shows differential localization to actin structures in adherent spread and non-adherent blebbing melanoma cells."

Previous studies have shown that shortly after bleb protrusion, the membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein ezrin is recruited to the bleb membrane, followed by the assembly of actin, then myosin II, which induces bleb retraction (<a href=\"#bib6\">Charras et al., 2006</a>). To determine the timing of Eps8 arrival at the bleb membrane relative to these proteins, we subjected A375 cells expressing EGFP tagged mEps8, ezrin, F-tractin, or MII-RLC to time-lapse confocal imaging at 5 s intervals. To mark the position of the cell membrane in negative-image, cells were mounted in media containing red fluorescent dextran (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Analysis of time-lapse image series showed that similar to previous studies, ezrin appeared rapidly on the newly protruded bleb membrane at \u223c5 s after bleb formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Recruitment of Eps8 and actin to the membrane occurred on a similar timescale as ezrin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E,H</a>). In contrast, MII-RLC appeared \u223c30 s after protrusion, and coincided with the onset of bleb retraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>). These results indicate that in non-adherent cells, Eps8 recruitment to bleb membranes occurs concurrently with actin assembly."

Strikingly, cells in these conditions had reduced blebbing on the cell body, but formed a single very large sausage-shaped bleb that generally excluded the nucleus, and which was defined by a thin neck at the junction between the large bleb and the spherical cell body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This morphology was very similar to the \u2018A2\u2019 or \u2018stable bleb\u2019 phenotypes recently described for non-adherent cells migrating under confinement (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bergert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>).

Indeed, A375 cells adhered to fibronectin-coated coverslips (either 5 or 50 \u00b5g/ml) did not migrate, while leader bleb-based migration of confined non-adherent cells was very fast at 1.15 \u00b1 1.02 \u00b5m/min (mean \u00b1 SE, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1N</a>)."

To analyze the spatial distribution of actin and Eps8 within the leader bleb, we determined their average intensities within five regions of interest (ROIs), each representing 20% of the length of the leader bleb from neck (region 1) to distal tip (region 5) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). This showed that actin was distributed as circumferential bundles around the short axis of most of the length of the leader bleb, but was reduced at the bleb tip (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Eps8 localized in a punctate manner along actin bundles, forming a gradient, with the highest concentration near the neck connecting the bleb to the cell body and the lowest level at the distal tip of the leader bleb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Time-lapse imaging and kymograph analyses showed that Eps8 and F-actin underwent coordinated retrograde movement from the distal leader bleb tip towards the bleb neck (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Similar imaging of EGFP-MII-RLC showed that myosin II was distributed around the cortical band of the cell body, highly concentrated in the narrow neck at the bleb neck where the bleb connected to the cell body, and nearly absent from the distal half of the leader bleb, similar to previous reports (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bergert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>). Together, these results show that in non-adherent cells, Eps8 localizes rapidly to bleb membranes as actin assembles. When non-adherent cells are confined, actin and Eps8 concentrate in leader blebs where they exhibit a directional assembly gradient and rearward flow towards the contractile bleb neck, and this cortical flow is coordinated with rapid cell movement directed by the leader bleb."

To test this, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to human Eps8 that resulted in 76 \u00b1 2.1% (mean \u00b1 SE) depletion of the protein in A375 cells after 24 hr (Eps8-KD, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Expression of FusionRed-F-tractin in non-adherent Eps8-KD cells confined under an agar pad followed by confocal imaging revealed that Eps8 depletion generally inhibited the formation of large leader blebs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Instead, confined non-adherent cells resembled unconfined non-adherent cells, with a distribution of various-sized protruding and retracting blebs around their perimeter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and the fraction of cells that underwent leader bleb-based migration was reduced by nearly half (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To quantify the effects of Eps8-KD on bleb size, we used a simple definition of a leader bleb as the single largest bleb made by the cell, expressed as a percent of cell body area. This showed that Eps8-KD decreased leader bleb area by nearly half compared to non-targeting siRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Expression of Emerald-mEps8 fully rescued leader bleb size and migration in Eps8-KD cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>).

When plated on uncoated glass, both U20S and A549 cells rounded up and exhibited blebbing around their peripheries (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). When transfected with EGFP as a soluble marker and confined between uncoated glass and agar and subjected to time-lapse confocal microscopy, 36% of U20S cells and 46% of A549 cells took on a leader bleb morphology (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and underwent rapid migration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

For filament density, we measured average F-tractin intensity in both the dense cortical actin band of the cell body and in the leader bleb (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). To quantify bundle organization, we determined the local alignment (\u2018anisoptropy\u2019) of F-tractin bundles within the leader bleb via the ImageJ plugin, FibrilTool, which uses the concept of nematic tensor to provide a local quantitative description of the anisotropy of fiber arrays and their average orientation in cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boudaoud et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). To quantify the spatial variation in these parameters, we determined their values in five ROIs along the leader bleb length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). This showed that compared to control, Eps8-KD induced a slight but significant reduction in the density of the cortical actin band in the cell body (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,G</a>), but had no significant effect on the density or distribution of actin within leader blebs, where actin exhibited a gradient with the highest concentration at the neck (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,H</a>). Regional analysis of F-tractin anisotropy showed that in control cells, actin bundle alignment also formed a gradient in the leader bleb, but in the opposite direction as the density gradient, such that bundles consistently were most highly aligned towards the distal regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2033</a>), and decreased towards the neck. Knockdown of Eps8 did not destroy the anisotropy gradient, but made actin bundle organization highly variable along the largest bleb (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2033</a>). Examination of the localization of EGFP-MII-RLC in Eps8-KD cells showed that similar to control, myosin II concentrated in the dense cortical band of actin around the cell body and at the neck of the largest bleb (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In agreement, western blotting for myosin II regulatory light chain phosphorylated on serine 19 (pS19 MLC) as a marker of activated myosin II showed no significant difference in myosin II activity between control and Eps8-KD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Together, these results show that in confined, non-adherent cells, Eps8 promotes enlargement of leader blebs independent of myosin II activity, where it acts to promote actin bundling towards the distal bleb tip, and is required for leader bleb-based migration."

                                "text": "Since leader bleb formation is mediated by intracellular pressure induced by contractility in the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bergert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>), we next sought to determine the role of Eps8 in regulation of cortical cytoskeleton mechanical properties. We utilized an atomic force microscope (AFM)-based assay in which rounded, non-adherent cells are subjected to a minimal deformation with a tipless cantilever (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fischer-Friedrich et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ramanathan et al., 2015</a>), and cortex tension and intracellular pressure can be extracted from the resulting force\u2013displacement curves using measurements of the cell radius and actin cortex thickness (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2013</a>) and a theory derived from a simple force balance of the applied cantilever normal force with the force due to intracellular pressure and the force from cortex tension (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We first validated the approach using cells treated with the myosin II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin. This showed that inhibition of myosin II did not significantly affect cell radius or cortical actin thickness, but cortex tension and intracellular pressure were both significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tinevez et al., 2009</a>). Similar measurements showed that compared to non-targeting control, Eps8-KD resulted in significant decreases in cortex tension and intracellular pressure, although these effects were not as strong as those induced by blebbistatin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The effects of Eps8-KD on mechanical properties could be rescued by re-expression of Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Thus, Eps8 promotes cortex tension and increases intracellular pressure. Together with our above results, this suggests that Eps8 regulates cortical cytoskeletal organization to enhance cortical tension and increase intracellular pressure to mediate leader bleb-based migration."

                                "text": "We next sought to test whether the actin bundling activity of Eps8 is required for leader bleb formation and migration, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular mechanical properties. To accomplish this, we made alanine substitutions within the C-terminus of Emerald-tagged mouse Eps8 (L757A/K759A, referred to as Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) which have been previously shown to specifically block Eps8 bundling activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hertzog et al., 2010</a>). We co-expressed this together with FusionRed-F-tractin or FusionRed-MII-RLC in either wild type or Eps8-KD cells in a non-adherent, confined environment. This showed that Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund co-localized with actin at the thin cortical rim on bleb membranes, similar to wild type Eps8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in confined Eps8-KD cells, expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund failed to rescue the defect in leader bleb size induced by loss of Eps8, and these cells remained round and exhibited small blebs around their periphery with no dominant leader bleb (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Accordingly, Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund exhibited a more than 50% decrease in the fraction of cells migrating under confinement compared to Eps8-KD cells reconstituted with Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Even stronger effects on leader bleb size were observed in wild-type A375 cells over-expressing Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), indicating it acts as a dominant negative, likely by dimerizing with endogenous Eps8 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kishan et al., 1997</a>). We thus used a dominant negative approach where appropriate to negate the possibility of off-target effects induced by siRNAs. Because cells carrying defects in Eps8 bundling activity lacked a large bleb, we were unable to determine the effects of this mutation on actin density or anisotropy in the leader bleb. However, analysis of actin density in the cortical band of the cell body showed that over-expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund had no effect compared to over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 alone, and caused no detectable changes in the organization of MII-RLC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). AFM analysis showed that while over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 had no effect on cortical tension and intracellular pressure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), over-expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund significantly reduced cortex tension and intracellular pressure compared to untreated controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These results show that the actin bundling activity of Eps8 facilitates the formation of large leader blebs by promoting cortical tension and intracellular pressure."

We over-expressed the actin bundling protein \u03b1-actinin (<a href=\"#bib38\">Podlubnaya et al., 1975</a>) tagged with EGFP together with FusionRed-F-tractin in either WT or Eps8-KD cells under non-adherent confinement. Confocal imaging of EGFP-\u03b1-actinin in either WT or Eps8-KD cells showed a remarkably similar localization as Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>), with \u03b1-actinin concentrated in leader blebs where it was localized in a gradient along circumferential actin bundles, although the labelling of the bundles was more continuous and less punctate than that of Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Quantitative analysis showed that in Eps8-KD cells, over-expression of \u03b1-actinin was sufficient to partially rescue their defect in leader bleb size, but not to the same extent as expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In addition, \u03b1-actinin over-expression in Eps8-KD cells partially rescued the effects of loss of Eps8 in cell migration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). AFM analysis showed that over-expression of \u03b1-actinin increased cortical tension and intracellular pressure by more than 50% compared to either untreated cells or cells over-expressing Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These results demonstrate the critical role of actin bundling in promoting cortical tension and generating intracellular pressure to mediate the formation of leader blebs, however they show that other functions or regulation of Eps8 cannot be compensated by \u03b1-actinin."

We made aspartic acid substitutions within the C-terminus of Emerald-tagged mouse Eps8 (V689D/L693D, referred to as Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap) which have been previously shown to specifically block Eps8 capping activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hertzog et al., 2010</a>) and regulate blebbing during cell division (<a href=\"#bib50\">Werner et al., 2013</a>). Strikingly, when confined under agar, Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap formed significantly larger leader blebs and the proportion of cells migrating nearly doubled compared to either untransfected controls or to Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Over-expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap similarly increased leader bleb area compared to over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Confocal imaging of confined Eps8-KD cells and analysis of re-expressed protein distribution together with FusionRed-F-tractin or -MII-RLC showed that unlike the gradient of Emerald-mEps8 with the highest level at the leader bleb base, Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap was equally distributed along the length of the leader bleb or slightly concentrated at the tip (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>). Analysis of actomyosin organization showed that compared to expression of Emerald-mEps8, expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap in Eps8-KD cells decreased the level of actin in the dense cortical band of the cell body, although the density gradient of actin along the leader bleb and the distribution of MII-RLC was unchanged (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F,G\u2032</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the actin bundle anisotropy gradient in the leader bleb was highly enhanced, with Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap exhibiting nearly fivefold higher actin bundle anisotropy near the tips of their leader blebs compared to Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2033</a>). AFM analysis of cortex mechanics showed that compared to over-expression of Emerald-mEps8, over-expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap significantly increased cortex tension and intracellular pressure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Together, these results show that the capping activity of Eps8 decreases actin density and mechanical properties of the cortex in the cell body, but acts to antagonize actin bundle formation in the distal region of leader blebs, and together this limits leader bleb size. This further suggests that the capping activity of Eps8 may be regionally regulated to maintain a gradient of actin bundle organization in the leader bleb."

Because A375 cells are known to have hyperactivation of the Erk pathway, we sought to test whether Erk activity or phospho-regulation on S624 and T628 of Eps8 regulates leader bleb formation, actin organization, and cortex mechanics. We first exploited the highly specific inhibitor U0126 to block Erk activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We validated that U0126 inhibited Eps8 phosphorylation in A375 cells by expressing either Emerald-mEps8 or EGFP as a control in cells treated with or without 10 \u03bcM U0126 for 90 min, performing immunoprecipitation of the expressed proteins with anti-GFP antibodies from cell lysates, followed by western blot analysis with antibodies specific to Erk, activated Erk phosphorylated on T202/Y204, or phospho-serine and phospho-threonine (pS/T). This analysis showed, as expected, that U0126 inhibited Erk activation independent of the expression of Eps8 constructs. Similarly, U0126 strongly reduced the pS/T level in immunoprecipitated Emerald-mEps8 compared to untreated cells. This indicates that U0126 blocks Erk-mediated Eps8 phosphorylation."

We localized endogenous Eps8 and actin in cells plated on poly-L-Lysine to mediate non-specific adhesion during immunostaining. This showed that U0126 treatment caused cells to flatten out at their base where they attached to the coverslip and to form actin bundles in the cell center and lamellipodia and filopodia with Eps8 on their tips, although they still possessed small blebs containing Eps8 on their dorsal surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When cells co-expressing FusionRed-F-tractin and EGFP-MII-RLC were confined under non-adherent conditions and perfused with U0126, this remarkably induced rapid retraction of leader blebs and formation of actin bundles in the center of the cell body that lacked myosin II (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Quantification showed that compared to untreated control, U0126 significantly reduced leader bleb area and density of the cortical actin band in the cell body, and completely blocked leader-bleb based migration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E,F</a>). AFM analysis of cortical mechanics showed that U0126 reduced both cortical tension and intracellular pressure compared to control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These results illustrate two important points. First, they show that Erk activity mediates spatial regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such that it promotes actin density in the cortex and inhibits actin bundling in the cell center. Second, Erk activity is required for maintaining cortical tension and intracellular pressure to drive leader bleb formation for adhesion-independent migration under confinement."

We generated a non-phosphorylatable mutant of Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, S624A/T628A, referred to as Emerald-mEps8-SATA) that has been shown to have constitutive capping activity in vitro and inhibit filopodia formation in neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Menna et al., 2009</a>). We expressed Emerald-mEps8 or Emerald-mEps8-SATA in either control or Eps8-KD cells and subjected them to confinement under non-adhesive conditions. This showed that either reconstitution of Eps8-KD or over-expression with Emerald-mEps8-SATA blocked leader bleb formation, significantly reducing leader bleb size by \u223c50% and strongly inhibiting cell migration compared to expression of Emerald-mEps8 in either wild type or Eps8-KD cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Thus, S624 and T628 in Eps8 are required for leader bleb formation and migration under non-adhesive confinement.

Interestingly, expression of Emerald-mEps8-SATA together with FusionRed-F-tractin showed that the Eps8 phospho-mutant was depleted from the cortex and instead formed thick bundle structures in the cell center (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), similar to the actin bundles seen in cells treated with U0126 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), but the bundles were not labeled with F-tractin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). However, fixation and staining with antibodies to vimentin or with fluorescent phalloidin showed that the Emerald-mEps8-SATA cables did not co-localize with intermediate filaments, but were dense with actin, suggesting that F-tractin and Eps8 may compete for the same binding site in actin bundles (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Analysis of fluorescent phalloidin intensity in the cortical band of the cell body showed that Emerald-mEps8-SATA did not alter actin density compared to Emerald-mEps8 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In addition, co-expression of Emerald-mEps8-SATA together with FusionRed MII-RLC in Eps8-KD cells showed that myosin II continued to localize to the peripheral cortex, but the central Eps8/actin bundles lacked myosin II (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Quantification of the percentage of cells with Eps8/actin bundles showed that expression of F-tractin did not induce bundle formation, while over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 or Emerald-mEps8-SATA induced bundles in \u223c30% or \u223c70% of cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). This indicates that Emerald-mEps8-SATA promotes the formation of excessive non-contractile actin bundles in the cell center. Together with our previous results, this suggests that the S624 and T628 Erk phosphorylation sites in Eps8, are required for suppressing central actin bundles, while other targets of MEK/Erk regulate cortical actin density."

We first tested whether this was due to a lack of Erk-mediated regulation on these sites. Treatment of non-adherent cells expressing either Emerald-mEps8 or Emerald-mEps8-SATA with 10 \u03bcM U0126 for 90 min followed by fixation and phalloidin staining showed that Erk inhibition induced Eps8/actin cables to the same extent, independent of the S624A/T628A mutations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). Because phosphorylation of S624 and T628 are known to inhibit the actin capping activity of Eps8, and yet non-phosphorylatable mutation of these sites (which would be expected to have constitutive capping) produced an ectopic actin cable effect, we wondered if the formation of Eps8/actin cables induced by Erk inhibition required either the capping or bundling activities of Eps8. Over-expression of either Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap or Emerald-mEps8\u0394bund in either the presence or absence of U0126 did not induce Eps8/actin cables, indicating that both capping and bundling activities are required for cable formation induced by Erk inhibition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). Furthermore, over-expression of Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap in cells treated with U0126 and confined under agar could not rescue the loss of leader blebs induced by perfusion of Erk inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that Erk promotes leader blebs by other mechanisms in addition to down-regulation of Eps8 capping activity. Finally, we found that over-expression of an S624E/T628E Eps8 mutant (<a href=\"#bib34\">Menna et al., 2009</a>) could not recapitulate the effects of Emerald-mEps8\u0394cap in cells, suggesting that the E substitutions do not act as phospho-mimics to inhibit Eps8 capping activity in cells (not shown). However, together our results show that MEK/Erk-mediated phosphorylation of Eps8 on S624 and T628 inhibits the bundling- and capping-dependent formation of central actin cables by Eps8. This also suggests that in addition to directly regulating actin capping (<a href=\"#bib34\">Menna et al., 2009</a>), these sites may affect the bundling activity of Eps8 in cells by an indirect mechanism."

AFM analysis showed that compared to untreated or cells expressing Emerald-mEps8, Emerald-mEps8-SATA expression reduced cortex tension and intracellular pressure to a level similar to treatment with U0126 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 7I,J, 6G,H</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). This was surprising, considering that this mutant had no effect on cortical actin density. However, it is possible that the cortical mechanics could be altered by the redistribution of mutant Eps8 from the cortex to central actin bundles. Together, these results suggest that Erk-mediated phosphorylation of S624 and T628 coordinates the local co-regulation of Eps8 capping and bundling activities to control cortical tension and intracellular pressure to mediate leader bleb formation and migration of confined cells."

Because immunofluorescense (of phospho-Eps8 or active Erk) is not possible in cells confined under agar, we turned to a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based biosensor of active Erk called \u2018Erk Kinase Activity Reporter containing EV linker\u2019 (EKAREV) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harvey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Komatsu et al., 2011</a>). In short, a CFP-tagged phospho-peptide-binding domain is connected by a FRET-optimized \u2018EV linker\u2019 to a YFP-tagged Erk substrate peptide, and FRET is obtained when the substrate is phosphorylated by Erk. We first used the reporter to localize Erk activity in cells adhered to fibronectin-coated glass. Confocal imaging showed that EKAREV (CFP channel) was soluble, excluded from membranous organelles, and diffusely localized throughout the cell, while YFP/CFP ratio imaging revealed a low FRET signal indicating low Erk activity throughout the cell (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). In contrast, in non-adherent, blebbing cells, although the EKAREV reporter was evenly distributed, the ratio image showed heightened levels of FRET indicating higher Erk activity specifically in blebs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Importantly, treatment with U0126 reduced the EKAREV FRET ratio to minimal levels (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Remarkably, time-lapse ratio imaging at 5 s intervals showed that a flash of high FRET appeared in the bleb periphery just after protrusion, and was maintained until bleb retraction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Thus, EKAREV reveals spatially and temporally localized Erk activity in blebs of non-adherent cells."

Strikingly, confocal YFP/CFP ratio imaging revealed a strong concentration of high FRET signal indicating high Erk activity within leader blebs compared to the cell body (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). Quantification of the magnitude of FRET signal in the leader bleb relative to the cell body showed &gt;250% enrichment of Erk activity in the leader bleb (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). Furthermore, regional analysis of the magnitude of FRET signal distribution within leader blebs showed a shallow gradient, with Erk activity highest at the distal tip (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). To determine if this effect could be caused by an enrichment of signaling proteins within leader blebs, we localized either soluble EGFP, or EGFP tagged versions of Erk, MEK or activated B-Raf (V600E) in cells confined under agarose (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Quantification showed that EGFP alone as well as EKAREV were enriched by \u223c10\u201312% in the leader bleb relative to the cell body (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). Although Erk, MEK and B-Raf (V600E) were all enriched within leader blebs by 15\u201320% relative to the cell body (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F,G</a>), this was not significantly higher than the enrichment of EGFP alone. Therefore, slight enrichment of soluble proteins within leader blebs may be a general phenomenon, likely because membranous organelles that exclude cytoplasmic markers are largely excluded from the leader bleb and maintained in the cell body. Together, our results show that in confined non-adherent cells, Erk activity is highly concentrated in leader blebs where it forms a gradient with peak activity at the bleb tip."

Using a localized pulse of 405 nm light, we photo-converted mEos in a rectangular region within the leader bleb a short distance away from the neck and then imaged the redistribution of red fluorescence by diffusion within the bleb and cell body.

We demonstrate that, in contrast to cells adhered to ECM where Eps8 associates with filopodia and lamellipodia, in non-adherent melanoma cells, Eps8 localizes to bleb membranes as actin assembles. A novel, bleb-based mode of migration was recently described by several labs that occurs when non-adherent, highly contractile cells are squeezed in 3D confinement. The pressure induced by such an environment induces cells to undergo a MAT and adopt a characteristic polarized morphology where rapid cell motility is driven by cortical cytoskeletal flow that generates extracellular friction along a large sausage-shaped \u2018leader bleb\u2019 that drags along the cell body (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bergert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>). We show here that in cancer cells, the actin capping and bundling scaffold protein Eps8 is required to promote this morphological transition under confinement by enhancing cortical tension and promoting increased intracellular pressure. Our manipulations of Eps8 level and activities that defined its requirement for leader bleb formation and migration did not perturb the organization or activity of myosin II. This, together with previous work (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bergert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>), indicates that both contractility and proper organization of the cytoskeleton are critical to generating the cortical mechanical properties conducive to leader bleb-based migration under non-adhesive confinement."

We find that the bundling activity of Eps8 is required for promoting the mesenchymal-to-leader bleb transition in confined, non-adherent melanoma cells. This identifies a critical role for actin bundles in promoting the cortical inhomogeneity and cellular pressure that have been postulated to mediate symmetry breaking to drive this drastic polarized cell shape change (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>). Once the morphology transition occurs, we find that Eps8 and actin both form a gradient within the leader bleb, decreasing with distance from the neck, but absent from the very tip. Our demonstration the Eps8 localizes to bleb membranes on a similar timescale as ezrin suggests that their interaction (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zwaenepoel et al., 2012</a>) may be critical to Eps8 cortical recruitment. Analysis of actin bundle anisotropy shows that actin bundling forms an opposing gradient, with the most organized actin bundles towards the bleb tip. Actin bundles wrapping around the short axis of the bleb are likely responsible for maintaining the sausage/allantoid shape. Our demonstration that inhibition of Eps8 capping activity further enhances actin bundle organization towards the leading bleb tip suggests that Eps8's bundling and capping activities act antagonistically, such that when capping is down-regulated, Eps8 may be a more efficient bundler. Thus, local regulation of Eps8 capping activity could promote polarization of actin organization with opposing gradients in actin density and bundling along the leader bleb. However, by manipulating Erk activity or the Erk phosphorylation sites in Eps8, we demonstrate that Erk-mediated phosphorylation of S624 and T628 not only down-regulates the capping activity of Eps8 as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib34\">Menna et al., 2009</a>), but may in fact coordinate the regulation of Eps8 capping and bundling activities. Our use of a FRET biosensor surprisingly shows that Erk activity is massively concentrated in leader blebs, although the mechanism for this concentration is not clear. However, the high activity is likely trapped there by a diffusion barrier at the bleb neck, and within the leader bleb forms a shallow gradient with peak activity at the bleb tip. This suggests that Erk-mediated down-regulation of Eps8 capping activity at the leader bleb tip could drive the formation of opposing gradients in actin bundling and density along the bleb length. This gradient in actin organization, in turn, may be required for spatial organization of cortical tension, which we predict would mirror the gradient in actin bundling, to maintain the allantoid shape and drive cortical flow in the leader bleb. The increased cortical tension at the bleb tip would be opposed at the bleb neck by myosin II contractility, and the depletion of myosin II and actin from the very tip of the leader bleb would provide a site where high intracellular pressure could promote local protrusion of the leading membrane to mediate the leader-bleb-based migration of confined cells. Thus, our results identify a mechanism by which spatial regulation of Eps8 actin regulatory activities by Erk may promote the rapid, unregulated migration of melanoma cells that may be critical to their highly invasive behavior in vivo."

Additionally, leader bleb-based migration may be important to migration between tightly packed cells found in solid tumors. Our observation that inhibition of Erk activity is capable of blocking formation of large leader blebs is consistent with the notion that effectors of the pathway, such as Eps8, are important to the migration of confined cancer cells. The Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway is one of the most frequently upregulated pathways in cancer. In melanoma, this pathway is particularly active because of a commonly found activating mutation in B-Raf V600E (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davies et al., 2002</a>) that bypasses Ras and the negative feedback that normally restrains MEK/Erk activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Logue and Morrison, 2012</a>). This feature predisposes melanoma cells to blebbing by supporting a Raf/MEK/Erk/MLCK/RLC/myosin contractility cascade. Drugs that target B-Raf V600E (e.g., vemurafenib) have been shown to have remarkable effects in the short-term. Compensatory upregulation of the pathway by cancer cells frequently limits their effectiveness (<a href=\"#bib31\">Logue and Morrison, 2012</a>). However, our work shows that other mechanisms for activating Erk, including via oncogenic Ras mutations in lung cancer cells or via serum factors in osteosarcoma cells also lead to Eps8-dependent bleb-based migration. The work described here elucidates the importance of a specific Erk effector, Eps8, in the migration of confined melanoma cells. Therefore, targeting specific effectors as opposed to canonical signaling enzymes may have therapeutic value. Effectors that impact cell architecture through the regulation of the cytoskeleton could be particularly attractive targets especially for prevention of metastasis."

After gelation, a hole was punched in the agarose using a 5 ml plastic test tube. Prior to confining cells, 3 ml of media was pipetted into each well and equilibrated with the agarose overnight. Before use, media was thoroughly vacuumed off and 200 microliters of media containing cells was added to the empty hole punch. To get cells under the agarose, a 1 ml pipette tip was placed into the hole punch containing media and cells and slid just under the agarose to gently lift a portion of the agarose, sucking the cells underneath, and the pad was gently set down. The remaining media and cells were then thoroughly vacuumed out of the hole punch. To prevent drying, the plate was sealed using parafilm. Prior to imaging, the plate was brought up to temperature for 1 hr in an incubator."

Illumination for confocal imaging was provided by solid state lasers (40 mW 442 nm for CFP; 100 mW 488 nm for EGFP; 100 mW 523 nm for YFP and 500 mW 561 nm for FusionRed) that were directed to the microscope by a custom-designed optical fiber-coupled laser combiner (Spectral Applied Research, Canada; <a href=\"#bib44\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). For phase contrast imaging, illumination was provided by a quartz-halogen lamp using a 546 nm bandpass filter. Images were acquired using either a CoolSNAP HQ2 or MYO cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using either a 100\u00d7 or 60\u00d7 (1.4 NA, Plan Apo PH) oil immersion objective lens and 0.9 NA condensor. Illumination, image acquisition, and microscope functions were controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For time-lapse FRET imaging of the EKAREV biosensor, a confocal image through the central plane of the cell was first acquired using 442 nm excitation and the YFP emission filter (FRET image), followed by an image acquired using 442 nm excitation and the CFP emission filter (CFP image). For photo-activation of mEos2, a Nikon A1R laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with dual resonant scanners was used with a 60\u00d7 (1.4 NA Plan Fluor) oil immersion lens. A 0.5 s pulse of the 405 nm laser at 50% power within a defined region was used to photo-convert mEos2. Images were then acquired using the 488 and 561 nm lasers in the red and green channels at 130 ms intervals to image the redistribution of fluorescence after photo-conversion. For all experiments, a stage-top incubator (Tokai-Hit, Japan) was used to maintain samples at 37C."

Spinning disk confocal images through the central Z-plane of the cell were acquired using a 100\u00d7 (1.4 NA) objective lens.

Illumination was provided by a mercury arc lamp and wavelengths selected by a Sedat filterset (Semrock, Rochester, NY). The hybrid microscope instrument was placed on an acoustic isolation table (Kinetic Systems, Boston, MA). A heating stage (Veeco) was used to maintain cells at 37C. Cells were located by EGFP fluorescence while cell radii were measured using bright-field images taken with a 40\u00d7 (0.6 NA Plan Fluor) objective lens and a QuantEM EMCCD camera (Photometrics). After location of cells, a soft and tipless rectangular silicon nitride cantilever (length: 350 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m, width: 32.5 \u00b1 3 \u00b5m, thickness: 1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m; MikroMasch, Bulgaria) was brought to close proximity. The cantilever stiffness was first calibrated by performing a force curve on the stiffer glass-bottom dish to estimate the photodetector deflection sensitivity, and then by using the thermal noise fluctuation method (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hutter and Bechhoefer, 1993</a>). The estimated spring constants for cantilevers used in force curves were 0.08\u20130.11 N/m. After calibration, the AFM cantilever was moved on top of a cell and lowered to gently deform it. Approximately ten successive force curves were performed in the same location on each cell per condition using 4 \u00b5m ramps with up to \u223c1 nN applied force at 0.5 Hz."

Many cancer cells apply bleb-based amoeboid migration in tissue environment, but the mechanisms controlling the organization and mechanics of cortical actomyosin structures during blebbing are incompletely understood. Here Logue et al. provide evidence that actin filament bundling and capping protein, Eps8, has an important role in bleb formation. A375 cells, under confined migration, undergo a switch toward a blebbing type of locomotion characterized by the extension of a prominent large bleb that drives cells forward. Eps8 concentrates to and forms a gradient along the leader bleb, and depletion of this protein leads to defects in proper organization of actin filament bundles and bleb-based migration. RNAi-rescue and over-expression studies further demonstrated that both actin filament bundling and capping activities are important in regulation of leader bleb dynamics, and provided evidence that spatiotemporally controlled phosphorylation of Eps8 through Erk is important in coordinating these activities in cells. The data thus support a model whereby Eps8 is a major target of Erk activity in the MAT switch of migration."

We tested whether these mutations affected the ability of Eps8 to bind to ezrin, and found that they had no effect on the ability of Eps8 to co-IP with ezrin. When we expressed the mutant in cells, we found that it exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic localization and did not concentrate on the cortex. These are interesting preliminary results suggesting that Eps8 may be recruited to the cortex by binding directly to actin, however whether this is through ezrin is not possible to rule out. In the text, we state: \u201cOur demonstration the Eps8 localizes to bleb membranes on a similar timescale as ezrin suggests that their interaction (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zwaenepoel et al., 2012</a>) may be critical to Eps8 cortical recruitment.\u201d"
