Likewise, a heterochromatin-like structure in budding yeast, termed \u2018silent chromatin\u2019, controls the yeast's sexual identity via faithful gene silencing.

They introduced the coding sequence of an enzyme called Cre recombinase into the hidden <i>MAT</i> loci (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). On a different chromosome, Dodson and Rine assembled a reporter construct from the genes for red and green fluorescent proteins (i.e. RFP and GFP) that works as follows: if silencing is lost in a cell, the recombinase removes the RFP gene and causes that cell, and all its descendants, to permanently switch from red to green fluorescence. Recombinases have been used similarly in the past to detect gene expression in bacterial pathogens during infection (<a href=\"#bib2\">Camilli et al., 1994</a>)."

Each green sector marks when silencing was briefly lost, and looking at how often these sectors appeared suggests that such events are rare, occurring roughly once out of every 1000 cell divisions. The assay was used to reveal that Hst3, an enzyme closely related to Sir2 that also modifies histones, also contributes to silencing of the hidden <i>MAT</i> loci. Mutants without the gene for Hst3 develop seven times as many green sectors as wild-type yeast, but fail to register derepression in conventional assays (<a href=\"#bib11\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). This illustrates the sensitivity of the recombinase approach."

In most cells, they detected nothing more than background. However, in about one in every 2500 cells (about as often sectors formed in their colony assay), they found Cre recombinase was expressed at roughly 25% of the level reached in cells that cannot silence at all. The data indicate that rare, sub-maximal bursts of transcription occur within chromatin that has been silenced."

Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4 participate in all three steps, but Sir1 is different. In mutant yeast without Sir1, silencing is lost and not restored efficiently in some cells, whereas in other cells silencing is propagated from generation to generation. This suggests that silencing cannot be established well without Sir1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Pillus and Rine, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Xu et al., 2006</a>). Dodson and Rine revisited the role of Sir1 using their sensitive sector-based assay and found that silencing cannot be properly maintained and/or inherited without Sir1 either. But how might this work? It's possible that Sir1 counteracts common disruptions to silent chromatin, like DNA replication, and rapidly re-establishes the silent state each cell cycle. Alternatively, Sir1 might continuously replace any silencing proteins that are normally lost from heterochromatin. In this regard, it is significant that silencers, where Sir1 binds, also continuously maintain the silent state, even in the absence of DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cheng and Gartenberg, 2000</a>)."

Silent chromatin must be flexible enough to permit the passage of the DNA replication machinery and allow mating-type switches. Moreover, if the Sir protein complex could associate with histones tightly enough to block all gene expression, then non-specific binding by the complex might silence the wrong genes elsewhere in the genome. Instead, evolution settled upon a heterochromatin-like structure at the hidden <i>MAT</i> loci that is dynamic and permits breaks in the silence that had never been heard before now."
