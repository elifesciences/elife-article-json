Here, we identify cooperative non-cell-autonomous functions of a single gene that together provide a novel mechanism of tumor suppression in basal keratinocytes of zebrafish embryos. A loss-of-function mutation in <i>atp1b1a</i>, encoding the beta subunit of a Na,K-ATPase pump, causes edema and epidermal malignancy. Strikingly, basal cell carcinogenesis only occurs when Atp1b1a function is compromised in both the overlying periderm (resulting in compromised epithelial polarity and adhesiveness) and in kidney and heart (resulting in hypotonic stress). Blockade of the ensuing PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NF\u03baB-MMP9 pathway activation in basal cells, as well as systemic isotonicity, prevents malignant transformation. Our results identify hypotonic stress as a (previously unrecognized) contributor to tumor development and establish a novel paradigm of tumor suppression."

Here, we identify cooperative non-cell-autonomous functions of a single gene that together provide a novel mechanism of tumor suppression in basal keratinocytes of zebrafish embryos. A loss-of-function mutation in <i>atp1b1a</i>, encoding the beta subunit of a Na,K-ATPase pump, causes edema and epidermal malignancy. Strikingly, basal cell carcinogenesis only occurs when Atp1b1a function is compromised in both the overlying periderm (resulting in compromised epithelial polarity and adhesiveness) and in kidney and heart (resulting in hypotonic stress). Blockade of the ensuing PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NF\u03baB-MMP9 pathway activation in basal cells, as well as systemic isotonicity, prevents malignant transformation. Our results identify hypotonic stress as a (previously unrecognized) contributor to tumor development and establish a novel paradigm of tumor suppression."

The kidney is involved in controlling the water and ion content of the body (known as osmoregulation), and the <i>atp1b1a</i> mutants have lower levels of ions and increased levels of water than normal zebrafish. Cancer formation could be completely blocked when the mutant embryos were kept in a solution that had the same salt and water content as the animals, instead of regular fresh water. This suggests that exposure of cells to body fluids with decreased ion and increased salt contents, a condition also called hypotonic stress, increases the risk of developing some tumors."

Most tumor suppressors affect one or more of these processes in a cell-autonomous manner, being produced by and acting within the tumor precursor cells themselves (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sherr, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sun and Yang, 2010</a>), whereas comparably few genes are known to block tumorigenesis in a non-cell-autonomous manner (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chua et al., 2014</a>). Tumor suppressors often act by inhibiting or antagonizing proto-oncogenic factors. The phosphatase PTEN for instance is the antagonist of phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinases (PI3Ks), critical coordinators of intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and cytokines. Hyperactivity of PI3K signaling cascades, including that involving AKT/PKB (protein kinase B), is one of the most common events in human cancers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altomare and Testa, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Thorpe et al., 2015</a>)."

Four \u03b1-subunit and three \u03b2-subunit genes have been described in mammals, of which \u03b11 and \u03b21 are the major isoforms in epithelial cells. These subunits transport Na and K ions across the cell membrane, and thereby play well-characterized roles in generating electrochemical gradients in multiple cell types, and in sodium and water balancing in renal tubules, thereby regulating body fluid composition and volume. However, additional pump-independent and evolutionary conserved functions for Na,K-ATPase proteins\u00a0have been described in the context of epithelial cell adhesiveness and polarity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vagin et al., 2012</a>). Here, the \u03b2-subunits play a prominent role. These are type II transmembrane proteins with glycosylated extracellular domains that can form \u03b21-\u03b21 trans-bonds between neighboring cells, thereby promoting both epithelial polarity and intercellular adhesiveness of cultured cells. \u03b2-subunit glycosylation has a positive impact on cell-cell adhesiveness, most likely by stabilizing E-cadherin cell adhesion proteins (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vagin et al., 2008</a>). Consistently, in transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial\u00a0cells (MDCK) cells, the expression of both E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase \u03b21-subunit is drastically reduced, and epithelial polarity and junctional complexes can only be re-established upon repletion of both molecules (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rajasekaran et al., 2001</a>). Na,K-ATPase \u03b2<sub>1</sub>-subunit levels are also reduced in cell lines derived from various carcinomas. This\u00a0evidence, together with functional studies with transformed MDCK cells, has led to the proposal that the Na,K-ATPase \u03b2<sub>1</sub> subunit has a potential tumor-suppressor function (<a href=\"#bib34\">Inge et al., 2008</a>),\u00a0but\u00a0direct genetic evidence for this notion had been missing to\u00a0date."

During the affected stages, the epidermis is normally bi-layered, consisting of a tight junction-bearing outer periderm and a basal layer of keratinocytes. The latter are transformed in <i>atp1b1a</i> mutants, leading to\u00a0their overgrowth and invasion of dermal compartments. Keratinocyte transformation is transduced via aberrant activation of a PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NF\u03baB-MMP9 (metalloprotease 9) pathway. Chemical inhibition of PI3K, mTORC1 and NF\u03baB rescues all aspects of malignancy, whereas knockdown of MMP9\u00a0alleviates only\u00a0epidermal invasiveness but not hyperplasia, pointing to a specific role of this matrix metalloprotease as one of the mediators of metastasis, and to the involvement of additional relevant NF\u03baB targets. Epidermal malignancy is also fully suppressed upon incubation of embryos in isotonic\u00a0(rather than the natural hypotonic) medium, and the remaining basal cell polarity and adhesiveness defects can be rescued by concomitant re-introduction of wild-type Atp1b1a in peridermal cells. Together with other presented data, these\u00a0findings\u00a0indicate that epidermal malignancy results from a combined loss of the \u03b2-subunit\u2019s trans-layer function in\u00a0promoting basal cell polarity via the periderm, and its osmoregulatory function in\u00a0suppressing hypotonic stress.

To study the subcellular localization of zebrafish Atp1b1a, we transiently expressed an <i>atp1b1a-gfp</i> fusion construct in peridermal cells, one of its endogenous expression sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3i</a>), under the control of the <i>krt4</i> promoter. As described for Na,K-ATPases in other epithelial cells, Atp1b1a-GFP was localized in the basolateral domain of peridermal cells, together with E-cadherin (Cdh1), while it was absent from the apical region marked by the tight junction protein Tjp1/ZO-1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kiener and Hunziker, 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Consistent basolateral defects were found in <i>psoriasis</i> mutants even when incubated in isotonic medium to exclude effects resulting\u00a0from tonicity-related stress. TEM and IF studies revealed unaltered morphologies of tight junctions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,e</a>) and an unaltered distribution of Tjp1 in the periderm of mutant embryos at 52 hpf (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement\u00a01</a>). By contrast, the lateral regions of peridermal cells were less organized (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,e</a>), and aberrant gaps were observed between peridermal cells and underlying basal keratinocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b\u2013f</a>), Furthermore, the membranous localization of Cdh1 and Lgl2 proteins was strongly diminished in\u00a0both the peridermal and basal cells of <i>psoriasis</i> mutants, independent of whether they had been incubated in hypotonic or isotonic medium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a\u2013h</a>). At later stages (84 hpf), basal keratinocytes of <i>psoriasis</i> mutants displayed a strong and tonicity-independent reduction in normally basally localized cytokeratins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7i\u2013l</a>), similar to that\u00a0previously reported for <i>lgl2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sonawane et al., 2005</a>).

This suggests that Atp1b1a might regulate epithelial polarity and epidermal integrity at least in part by cooperating with Lgl2 and by\u00a0ensuring its proper localization. To test whether, in line with this notion, <i>lgl2</i> and <i>atp1b1a</i> genetically interact, we performed synergistic enhancement studies. When either <i>lgl2</i> or <i>atp1b1a</i> MOs were\u00a0injected at a low, sub-phenotypic concentration, all embryos displayed wild-type morphology. By contrast, when the two MOs were co-injected at the same concentrations, 62% of the embryos (n\u00a0=\u00a074) developed pericardial edema, a loss of Na/K-ATPase \u03b1-subunits from the\u00a0basolateral domains of pronephric epithelial cells, epidermal aggregates, and\u00a0an upregulation of the malignancy markers pAKT and <i>mmp9</i> in basal keratinocytes, similar to the phenotype after full knockdown of <i>atp1b1a</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7m\u2013q</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement\u00a01</a>).

                                "text": "In contrast to <i>lgl2</i> expression\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib60\">Sonawane et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sonawane et al., 2009</a>), <i>atp1b1a</i> expression in the epidermis is restricted to the periderm, suggesting that the effect of this gene on basal keratinocytes must be indirect. To prove this more directly, and to rule out indirect effects caused by hypotonicity, we analyzed chimeric embryos under isotonic conditions. Wild-type basal cell precursors that\u00a0were\u00a0transplanted into <i>atp1b1a</i> morphant hosts later exhibited distorted keratin distribution similar to that of their morphant neighbors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). Vice versa, <i>atp1b1a</i> morphant basal cells transplanted into wild-type hosts were indistinguishable from their wild-type neighbors and displayed normal keratin distribution (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>). This indicates that keratin localization in basal keratinocytes\u00a0and the\u00a0epithelial polarity of these\u00a0cells are under the control of Atp1b1a function in a tissue other than the basal epidermal layer and the osmoregulatory organs. To show that this tissue is the periderm, we established a stable line of the aforementioned <i>krt4</i> transgene driving expression of <i>atp1b1a-gfp</i> exclusively in peridermal cells. In <i>psoriasis</i> mutants carrying this transgene that\u00a0were raised under isotonic conditions, keratin localization in basal keratinocytes was fully restored and indistinguishable from that in wild-type siblings (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c\u2013e</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a028/28; 3 independent experiments). We conclude that <i>atp1b1a</i> is required in the periderm to establish proper epithelial polarity and organization in the underlying basal keratinocytes. Furthermore, this function is independent of the osmoregulatory role of Atp1b1a, as the corresponding defects are present even\u00a0in mutants kept in isotonic medium, thus in the absence of hypotonic stress. When kept in hypotonic medium, <i>psoriasis</i> mutants carrying the <i>krt4:atp1b1a-gfp</i> transgene displayed a partial restoration of epidermal cell polarity both in the periderm and in the basal layer (cytokeratin and Lgl2 localization; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1e,I,m and f,j,n</a>) and a partial, but significant amelioration of basal cell malignancy (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a>), including reduction in the expression of the malignancy markers pAKT and <i>mmp9</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f\u2013h</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1g,k,o</a>). The failure of full restoration under hypotonic conditions suggests that hypotonic stress further challenges the epidermal polarity system, which becomes\u00a0more difficult to repair than is the case under isotonic conditions. In addition, the data reveal that upon hypotonic stress, the degrees of epidermal polarity defects and epidermal malignancy are proportionally linked."

Thus, even when the osmoregulatory role of Atp1b1a has become dispensable upon incubation in isotonic medium, peridermal cells of mutant embryos display reduced levels of E-cadherin and\u00a0of Lgl2, a pro-basal polarity regulator, as well as increased spacing between epidermal cells. Strikingly, basal keratinocytes themselves also display specific defects, such as reduced membraneous Lgl2 and E-cadherin levels, as well as a mislocalization of cytokeratins in basal domains. These defects could be rescued when transgene-encoded wild-type Atp1b1a was re-introduced into peridermal cells, indicating that Atp1b1a from the periderm regulates the epithelial organization and adhesiveness of basal keratinocytes in a tonicity-independent manner (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

Trans-bonds between ATPase \u03b2-subunits, previously reported to mediate cell-cell adhesiveness in other instances (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vagin et al., 2012</a>), could account for the adhesiveness among peridermal cells, but not for\u00a0that\u00a0between peridermal and basal cells, as the latter lack <i>atp1b1a</i> expression. The cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin might be the relevant mediator. In <i>psoriasis</i> mutants, E-cadherin membrane localization is severely diminished both in peridermal and in\u00a0basal cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The reduction of E-cadherin in peridermal cells could be a direct consequence of the loss of Atp1b1a, with which it is normally co-localized in basolateral regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This\u00a0is\u00a0consistent with the formerly reported physical interaction between ATPase \u03b1-subunits and E-cadherin via the anchoring protein ankyrin and the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vagin et al., 2012</a>).\u00a0In addition, Atp1b1a could promote E-cadherin localization via other epithelial polarity regulators, consistent with reports in MCDK cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Qin et al., 2005</a>). We propose that it is this loss of proper E-cadherin in peridermal cells that compromises not only\u00a0their adhesion to the underlying basal cells (due to the loss of trans-bonds between the basal side of peridermal and the apical side of basal cells; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) but also the adhesion among basal cells themselves, as well as their epithelial polarity. Consistent with the latter notion, loss of E-cadherin has been shown to affect apical-basal polarity in numerous systems (<a href=\"#bib13\">Desai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Stephenson et al., 2010</a>)."

Atp1b1a\u00a0is another cell adhesion molecule and epithelial polarity regulator to\u00a0add\u00a0to the list,, as\u00a0its loss causes crucial features of carcinogenesis (hyperplasia and infiltration of other tissues) in vivo. Strikingly, however, epidermal malignancy only occurs upon the combined loss of Atp1b1a\u2019s osmoregulatory and epithelial polarity-regulating functions. Thus, hypotonic stress per se does not lead to basal cell malignancy, as demonstrated in this work by the treatment of wild-type embryos with ouabain. Consistently, none of the described kidney mutants, although displaying massive edema formation as a result of internal hypotonicity, have\u00a0had reported skin defects (<a href=\"#bib15\">Drummond et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Drummond, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hentschel et al., 2005</a>).

Like <i>atp1b1a</i> mutants, <i>lgl2</i> mutants display aberrant apical-basal polarity of basal keratinocytes (mislocalized cytokeratin) and E-cadherin displacement, as well as epidermal hyperplasia and increased expression of <i>mmp9</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sonawane et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Reischauer et al., 2009</a>), which we now can interpret as a sign of invasiveness. Although not yet\u00a0addressed, carcinogenesis in <i>lgl2</i> mutants might also\u00a0involve hypotonic stress, and <i>lgl2</i>, like <i>atp1b1a</i>, might act both in the epidermis and in the kidney. Thus, we found that\u00a0<i>atp1b1a</i> and <i>lgl2</i> not only genetically\u00a0interact\u00a0during epidermal cell polarity and malignancy but also during edema formation and Na/K-ATPase \u03b1-subunit localization (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), in line with previous reports of pronephric defects and mild edema formation in <i>lgl2</i> morphants (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tay et al., 2013</a>). However, <i>atp1b1a</i> and <i>lgl2</i> mutants also display differences. Although\u00a0in conjunction with other mutations, loss of Lgl2 function leads to defects in earlier developmental stages (<a href=\"#bib72\">Westcot et al., 2015</a>; this work), epidermal hyperplasia in <i>lgl2</i> single mutants begins significantly later (4 days post fertilization; dpf) than that\u00a0in <i>atp1b1a</i> mutants\u00a0(2\u00a0dpf). An even more pronounced requirement in different time windows has been reported for Na,K-ATPase and Lgl during epithelial polarity regulation in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. Thus, defects in <i>lgl</i> mutants are manifested during gastrulation, when ATPase is dispensable, whereas corresponding defects in ATPase mutants are first detected during early organogenesis stages, when the\u00a0defects in <i>lgl</i> mutants begin to recover (<a href=\"#bib43\">Laprise et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Laprise and Tepass, 2011</a>). This suggests that as in flies, Atp1b1a and Lgl2 in\u00a0zebrafish\u00a0might act in different basolateral-promoting complexes,\u00a0which\u00a0have differential temporal but partially redundant functions. In addition, although eventually converging at similar or even identical (<i>mmp9</i>) effector genes, Atp1b1a and Lgl2 can fulfill their tumor-suppressing role by blocking different pathways. Lgl2 has\u00a0been reported to act by blocking ErbB and MAPK in later epidermal malignancies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Reischauer et al., 2009</a>), but\u00a0earlier it\u00a0cooperates with Atp1b1a to inhibit aberrant activation of a PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NF\u03baB pathway (this work)."

NF\u03baB can affect cancer cell survival, proliferation and invasiveness, and can act in cancer cells themselves or on the tumor microenvironment, for instance by regulating tissue inflammation, which in turn further stimulates tumor progression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hoesel and Schmid, 2013</a>). In <i>atp1b1a</i> mutants, however, inflammation seems to be of minor relevance:\u00a0epidermal aggregates only display moderately increased numbers of innate immune cells, and genetic ablation of the entire myeloid lineage does not alleviate epidermal malignancy (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). One prominent direct transcriptional target of NF\u03baB is <i>mmp9</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rhee et al., 2007</a>), a matrix-metalloprotease with collagenase activity that destabilizes basement membranes and connective tissue, thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kessenbrock and Werb, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dilly et al., 2013</a>). In addition, MMPs can promote tumor vascularization and inflammation as well as tumor cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kessenbrock and Werb, 2010</a>). In zebrafish <i>atp1b1a</i> mutants, however, the NF\u03baB-dependent increase in <i>mmp9</i> expression only contributes to epidermal invasiveness, while epidermal hyperplasia is mediated by NF\u03baB targets other than <i>mmp9</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10m</a>). Thus, in contrast to <i>mmp9</i> knockdown, treatment of mutant embryos with hydroxyurea rescues epidermal hyperproliferation in the persistent presence of high NF\u03baB activity. The nature of these proliferation-promoting NF\u03baB targets remains unknown. CyclinD1 (<i>ccnd1</i>), a described direct transcriptional NF\u03baB target in mammals(<a href=\"#bib30\">Hinz et al., 1999</a>), seems an\u00a0unlikely\u00a0target, as its expression levels are unaltered in <i>atp1b1a</i> mutants (JH and MH, unpublished data)."

EGFR would be a strong candidate. It acts as the upstream regulator of PI3K to mediate hypotonic stress in human keratinocytes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kippenberger et al., 2005</a>), and is activated by hypotonicity in several other, MAPK-mediated responses (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lezama et al., 2005</a>). Like Atp1b1a, EGFR is normally targeted to the basolateral side of epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">He et al., 2002</a>), and its signaling strength is under the control of the epithelial polarity system (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hobert et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Vermeer et al., 2003</a>). Nevertheless, treatment of <i>atp1b1a</i> mutant embryos with the chemical pan-ErbB inhibitor PD168393 failed to rescue epidermal malignancies (JH and MH, unpublished data).

For instance, untransformed human keratinocytes display strongly increased proliferation when cultured in hypotonic medium (<a href=\"#bib27\">G\u00f6nczi et al., 2007</a>). Systemic hypotonicity can also occur in humans in vivo. A major human condition that\u00a0leads to systemic hypotonicity in conjunction with reduced Na levels (hypotonic or hypoosmolar hyponatremia) is increased nephric water re-absorption caused by ADH (antidiuretic hormone) hyperactivity. In SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), this is usually linked to carcinogenesis and results\u00a0from ectopic ADH production by the tumors,\u00a0which in general are rather aggressive (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ellison and Berl, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Groh\u00e9 and Berardi, 2015</a>). In fact, hyponatremia is quite common in malignant solid tumors beyond SIADH (up to 25% of all patients). It is used as a prognostic and predictive value and is\u00a0associated with high morbidity rates; its early diagnosis and treatment significantly improves the patients\u2019 prognosis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schutz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Groh\u00e9 and Berardi, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balachandran et al., 2015</a>). This correlation suggests that systemic hypotonicity / hyponatremia increases carcinoma incidence and aggressiveness. In addition, the carcinogenesis risk seems\u00a0to\u00a0be increased by locally\u00a0restricted hypotonic stress.\u00a0Such stress might occur, for instance, during injuries of the lung or the esophagus (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ribeiro et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Islami et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Goldkorn and Filosto, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Maret-Ouda et al., 2016</a>), when epithelial cells become exposed to the airway surface fluid (<a href=\"#bib36\">Joris and Quinton, 1993</a>) or to\u00a0saliva (<a href=\"#bib17\">Edgar, 1992</a>), respectively, both of\u00a0which are hypotonic compared to the internal milieu. In this light, and in light of the data presented in this work, it makes sense to include treatments that\u00a0target osmotic conditions in therapies against certain carcinoma types (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balachandran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Groh\u00e9 and Berardi, 2015</a>). Furthermore, lavages with distilled water during cancer surgery (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iitaka et al., 2012</a>), or hypotonic approaches to improve the uptake of chemotherapeutics by tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stephen et al., 1990</a>), should be used with caution."

Pools of 2\u20134 libraries were sequenced on one lane using an Illumina TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 and an Illumina TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer with a paired-end (101x7x101 cycles) protocol. The alignment to the zebrafish reference version Zv9 was performed using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA). PCR duplicate marking was performed using Picard, both\u00a0realignment around indels and variant calling were performed using the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK). The annotation was performed using Annovar and the variations were filtered according to the predicted effect at the protein level and according\u00a0to their presence in a control set of 5 unrelated zebrafish Whole-Exome Sequencing datasets. For mapping, all variant loci with a coverage of at least 20 were selected from both the affected pool and the parental DNA, with the exclusion of loci in which both datasets were homozygous for the variant allele. At every locus, the percentage of reads showing the variation in the parental DNA was subtracted from the percentage of reads showing the variation in the affected pool. The absolute value of this difference was then plotted against the physical position of the locus and heatmaps were generated for the whole genome and for each chromosome. The chromosomes were then visually analyzed to identify the regions in which the majority of the loci show a difference of either 25% or 50%."

The authors propose that perturbed cell adhesion, cell polarity in the epidermis and osmotic stress caused due to impaired function of heart and larval kidney contribute towards the development of malignancy. They further show that the osmotic stress results in activation of PI3K-AKT-mTORC1- NF\u03baB-MMP9 pathway in the basal epidermis promoting cell proliferation as well as invasive behavior of the cells. These findings are conceptually interesting and bring into light the importance of osmotic stress in development of malignancy.

These perturbations in cell polarity and adhesion in conjunction with the osmotic stress results in malignant behavior of the basal epidermal cells. If correct, driving expression of <i>atp1b1a</i> in the periderm should rescue all the aspects of cell polarity phenotype in the periderm as well as in the basal epidermis and also rescue malignancy in the basal epidermis without affecting the edema phenotype (as the kidney and heart will remain nonfunctional) in hypotonic medium. Authors have just looked at the keratin localization upon driving the expression of <i>atp1b1a</i> in the periderm, that too in the isotonic condition, which is not enough. These rescue experiments are crucial for this paper and can be easily done using their transgenic line that drives expression of <i>atp1b1a-gfp</i> in periderm under keratin4 promoter."

This result indicates that Lgl2 localisation requires <i>atp1b1a</i> function in the periderm (possibly directly) as well as in the basal epidermis (indirectly?) whereas the interaction studies indicate that <i>atp1b1a</i> and <i>lgl2</i> have partial redundant functions. Previous studies (Reischauer et al., Westcot et al.) suggest that Lgl has a pro basal function in the basal cells of the developing fin epithelium and that it's loss is enough to cause hyperplasia and EMT. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the genetic interaction data that authors have. Is it possible that the decrease in Lgl levels contributes to the malignancy phenotype in psoriasis mutant? If yes, can authors rescue the aspects of malignancy by restoring the Lgl levels in psoriasis mutants? Is it that the reduction in Lgl and ATP1b1a levels in the periderm results in malignant phenotypes when morpholinos are coinjected at suboptimal concentrations? Or is it that the reduction in Lgl levels in the basal epidermis and reduction of Atp1b1a in the periderm results in the malignant phenotype when authors co-inject the morpholinos at sub optimal concentrations? What is the status of edema in the larvae injected with the suboptimal concentration of both the morpholinos? Is it the same PI3K-AKT-mTORC1- NF\u03baB-MMP9 pathway that gets activated in the co-injected embryos? In its current form the genetic interaction data does not contribute much towards our understanding of how these two components actually interact and function together in stratified epithelium. If authors wish to include these data in the manuscript a thorough analysis of this part (addressing questions raised above) is required."

If correct, driving expression of atp1b1a in the periderm should rescue all the aspects of cell polarity phenotype in the periderm as well as in the basal epidermis and also rescue malignancy in the basal epidermis without affecting the edema phenotype (as the kidney and heart will remain nonfunctional) in hypotonic medium. Authors have just looked at the keratin localization upon driving the expression of atp1b1a in the periderm, that too in the isotonic condition, which is not enough.

Of note, a similar partial restoration as for the malignancy markers was obtained for the cell polarity markers Lgl2 in the periderm (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E, I, M</a>) and cytokeratin in the basal layer (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B, C</a>). In conclusion, while further supporting the notion that Atp1b1a from the periderm promotes epithelial polarity and suppresses malignancy in basal keratinocytes, the data further indicate that the degrees of polarity defects and epidermal malignancy are proportionally linked. In addition, they suggest that hypotonic stress further challenges the epithelial cell polarity system, which therefore is more difficult to repair by transgene-encoded Atp1b1a from the periderm than under isotonic conditions. In the text of the manuscript, these new data are described and discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201c<i>atp1b1a</i> interacts with <i>lgl2</i> and is required in peridermal cells to establish proper epithelial organization of basal keratinocytes\u201d."

This result indicates that Lgl2 localisation requires atp1b1a function in the periderm (possibly directly) as well as in the basal epidermis (indirectly?) whereas the interaction studies indicate that atp1b1a and lgl2 have partial redundant functions. Previous studies (Reischauer et al., Westcot et al.) suggest that Lgl has a pro basal function in the basal cells of the developing fin epithelium and that it's loss is enough to cause hyperplasia and EMT. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the genetic interaction data that authors have. Is it possible that the decrease in Lgl levels contributes to the malignancy phenotype in psoriasis mutant? If yes, can authors rescue the aspects of malignancy by restoring the Lgl levels in psoriasis mutants? Is it that the reduction in Lgl and ATP1b1a levels in the periderm results in malignant phenotypes when morpholinos are coinjected at suboptimal concentrations? Or is it that the reduction in Lgl levels in the basal epidermis and reduction of Atp1b1a in the periderm results in the malignant phenotype when authors co-inject the morpholinos at sub optimal concentrations? What is the status of edema in the larvae injected with the suboptimal concentration of both the morpholinos? Is it the same PI3K-AKT-mTORC1- NF\u03baB-MMP9 pathway that gets activated in the co-injected embryos?

The main reason to show the genetic interaction between the two was the desire to provide a further line of evidence that ATP1b1a regulates epithelial cell polarity of epidermal cells. Therefore, we very much prefer to leave these interaction data in the manuscript, in particular, as we now have added at least some (in our opinion the most crucial) of the proposed new experiments. Thus, we now show that embryos co-injected with sub-phenotypic doses of <i>atp1b1a</i> and <i>lgl2</i> MOs also display edema formation and a down-regulation of Na/K-ATPase \u03b1-subunits in basolateral domains of pronephric epithelial cells, as well as an up-regulation of pAKT levels and <i>mmp9</i> expression in basal keratinocytes. Moreover, we show that the epidermal aggregates, but not the edema, are rescued upon treatment with the chemical PI3K, mTORC1 and NFkB inhibitors (new <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that ATP1b1a and Lgl2 most likely cooperate both in the epidermis (periderm) and in the pronephros to suppress epidermal malignancy.
