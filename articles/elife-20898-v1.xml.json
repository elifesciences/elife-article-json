We now demonstrate that hypomorphic <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mice have granule and Purkinje cell abnormalities causing subsequent disruptions in postnatal cerebellar foliation and lamination. Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobule echoing the posterior vermis DW \"tail sign\" observed in human imaging studies. Lineage tracing experiments in <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mouse cerebella indicate aberrant migration of granule cell progenitors destined to form the posterior-most lobule causes this unique phenotype. Analyses of rare human del chr 6p25 fetal cerebella demonstrate extensive phenotypic overlap with our <i>Foxc1 </i>mutant mouse models, validating our DWM models and demonstrating that many key mechanisms controlling cerebellar development are likely conserved between mouse and human."
