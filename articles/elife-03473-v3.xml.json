After import, it is unclear how these intrinsically unstable and aggregation-prone proteins are targeted to the ribosome assembly site in the nucleolus. Here, we report the discovery of a conserved nuclear carrier Tsr2 that coordinates transfer of the r-protein eS26 to the earliest assembling pre-ribosome, the 90S. In vitro studies revealed that Tsr2 efficiently dissociates importin:eS26 complexes via an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism that terminates the import process. Subsequently, Tsr2 binds the released eS26, shields it from proteolysis, and ensures its safe delivery to the 90S pre-ribosome. We anticipate similar carriers\u2014termed here escortins\u2014to securely connect the nuclear import machinery with pathways that deposit r-proteins onto developing pre-ribosomal particles."

After import, it is unclear how these intrinsically unstable and aggregation-prone proteins are targeted to the ribosome assembly site in the nucleolus. Here, we report the discovery of a conserved nuclear carrier Tsr2 that coordinates transfer of the r-protein eS26 to the earliest assembling pre-ribosome, the 90S. In vitro studies revealed that Tsr2 efficiently dissociates importin:eS26 complexes via an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism that terminates the import process. Subsequently, Tsr2 binds the released eS26, shields it from proteolysis, and ensures its safe delivery to the 90S pre-ribosome. We anticipate similar carriers\u2014termed here escortins\u2014to securely connect the nuclear import machinery with pathways that deposit r-proteins onto developing pre-ribosomal particles."

RNA polymerase I drives production of the 35S pre-rRNA transcript in the nucleolus, which initiates the assembly process. The emerging 35S pre-rRNA transcript undergoes co-transcriptional modification and processing (<a href=\"#bib66\">Osheim et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kos and Tollervey, 2010</a>), and associates primarily with 40S subunit r-proteins and \u223c50 assembly factors to form the earliest pre-ribosome, the 90S (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dragon et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Grandi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2003</a>). Cleavage of 35S pre-rRNA releases the pre-40S particle, permitting the remaining pre-rRNA to associate with r-proteins of the 60S subunit and \u223c200 additional assembly factors to undergo further maturation and pre-rRNA processing (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fatica et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Grandi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nissan et al., 2002</a>).

All mRNAs encoding r-proteins must be exported into the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. Nearly all newly synthesized r-proteins are then imported into the nucleus. In yeast, the importin Kap123 has been shown to be an important mediator of r-protein import, but the related importin Pse1 can functionally substitute Kap123 in vivo (<a href=\"#bib76\">Rout et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Schlenstedt et al., 1997</a>). Unlike other cargos, r-proteins contain large unstructured regions that form intricate interactions with rRNA within the mature ribosome and are prone to non-specific interactions with nucleic acids, aggregation and proteolytic degradation in their non-assembled state (<a href=\"#bib37\">J\u00e4kel and G\u00f6rlich, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">J\u00e4kel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Klinge et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rabl et al., 2011</a>). In contrast to typical protein transport events, nuclear import of r-proteins and subsequent transfer to the ribosome production site pose logistical challenges. In addition to their transport role, importins have been implicated to chaperone basic r-proteins during their transport to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib38\">J\u00e4kel et al., 2002</a>).

Tsr2 extracts eS26 from its importins to terminate its import process. Hereby, we reveal an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism to dissociate an importin:cargo complex. Tsr2 binds and protects the released eS26 from aggregation and proteolysis thereby ensuring its safe transfer to the 90S pre-ribosome. Our data raise the possibility of a yet unidentified fleet of carriers that securely link the nuclear import machinery with the ribosome assembly pathway."

One possibility is that formation of this particle is impaired in Tsr2-depleted cells, thereby indirectly interfering with 20S pre-rRNA processing. To test this, we performed polysome analyses. Cell extracts from WT and Tsr2-depleted cells prepared under polysome preserving conditions were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In agreement with a role in the 40S biogenesis pathway, the polysome profile of Tsr2-depleted cell extracts revealed strongly reduced levels of free 40S subunits and polysomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top panel). Northern analyses revealed that mature 25S rRNA and immature 20S pre-rRNA co-peak (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, bottom panel), indicating accumulation of 80S-like particles, similar to the one seen upon Fap7-depletion (<a href=\"#bib31\">Granneman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Strunk et al., 2012</a>).

SRM-MS is a reliable tool that overcomes stochastic under sampling of peptides, a critical deficit in shotgun mass spectrometry which complicates the reproducible detection and precise quantitation of proteins in a complex mixture (<a href=\"#bib71\">Picotti and Aebersold, 2012</a>). SRM relies on the development of specific mass spectrometric-based assays for every target protein and their subsequent application to the relative or absolute quantification within multiple biological samples. We developed a set of SRM assays that enabled us to simultaneously monitor the co-enrichment of eS26 and different r-proteins: uS7 (Rps5), eS28 (Rps28), eS1 (Rps1) and uS11 (Rps14) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) with multiple pre-ribosomal particles. Both Western and SRM analyses revealed that eS26 co-enriches efficiently with the earliest ribosomal precursor, the 90S, and different pre-ribosomes along the 40S maturation pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The Western signal for eS26 on the 90S pre-ribosome (Noc4-TAP) is specific since no association was detected with the earliest 60S pre-ribosome (Ssf1-TAP) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

The r-protein eS26 is assembled into the 90S pre-ribosome and is then rapidly transported to the cytoplasm as part of the 40S pre-ribosome. To investigate eS26 nuclear uptake in vivo we uncoupled its import from its export. Structural analyses of the 40S subunit showed that the N-terminus of eS26 is embedded within the rRNA framework (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rabl et al., 2011</a>). We fused GFP to the N-terminus of eS26 with the aim to impair its incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosome. Sucrose gradient analyses showed that GFP-eS26 co-sediments only in lighter fractions at the top of the gradient suggesting that it is not incorporated into pre-ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In vitro binding studies showed that like eS26, GFP-eS26 interacts with Kap123, Kap104 and Pse1 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Thus, the GFP-eS26 fusion protein is functional to recruit the import machinery, although it does not complement the eS26-depleted strain (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Further, GFP-eS26 directly binds Tsr2 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and importantly, like eS26, GFP-eS26 is degraded upon Tsr2-depletion (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). We exploited the GFP-eS26 fusion protein as a tool to monitor the nuclear uptake of eS26 in different importin mutants. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, nuclear uptake of GFP-eS26 was reduced in <i>kap123\u0394</i> and <i>kap104\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that eS26 import requires these importins. Nuclear localization of GFP-eS26 in the <i>pse1-1 ts</i> mutant at restrictive temperature remained unaffected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) indicating that impairment of this importin alone does not inhibit the nuclear import of eS26. The <i>pse1-1 kap123\u0394</i> mutant showed only a slight increase in cytoplasmic staining of GFP-eS26 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Nuclear import of GFP-eS26 was unaffected in the <i>kap114\u0394 sxm1\u0394</i> double mutant and <i>sxm1\u0394 kap120\u0394 nmd5\u0394</i> triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

For this, we monitored the localization of different truncated versions of eS26 fused to -GFP at the N-terminus. These cell-biological analyses revealed that the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain is required for efficient nuclear uptake of eS26 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). If eS26 were imported into the nucleus in complex with Tsr2, then we reasoned that depletion of eS26 would induce Tsr2 mislocalization to the cytoplasm. However, localization of Tsr2-3xGFP was not affected upon eS26-depletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These studies together with the observation that Tsr2:eS26 complex is unable to recruit importins argue against the idea that eS26 is transported to the nucleus in complex with Tsr2. We conclude that Kap123 and Kap104 target eS26 to the nucleus and that Tsr2 is not a component of this import complex."

Thus, Kap123 seems to be the major import receptor for Tsr2.

One possibility could be that import of Tsr2 by Kap123 is regulated by post-translational modification. Alternatively, Tsr2 might be transported into the nucleus via a \u2018piggy bag\u2019 mechanism bound to another yet unknown Kap123 cargo. We can exclude the possibility that eS26 serves as an adaptor to import Tsr2 since (1) Tsr2 does not mislocalize to the cytoplasm in a eS26-depleted strain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and (2) in vitro binding assays show that the Tsr2:eS26 complex does not interact with Kap123 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

To test whether the release of eS26 from the importins is RanGTP-dependent, we performed in vitro dissociation assays. A pre-formed importin:eS26 complex was incubated with 1.5 \u00b5M Gsp1Q71L-GTP (equivalent to the human RanQ69L mutant that cannot efficiently hydrolyze GTP, hereafter Gsp1Q71L-GTP is termed RanGTP; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bischoff et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Maurer et al., 2001</a>).

To test this, we isolated Enp1-TAP, which purifies both the 90S pre-ribosome and an early pre-40S subunit, from WT and Tsr2-depleted cells and assessed co-enrichment of eS26 by Western analyses. Consistent with a role for Tsr2 in supplying eS26 to the 90S pre-ribosome, we found that eS26 does not efficiently co-enrich with Enp1-TAP in Tsr2-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This was specific for eS26, since the recruitment of uS7 and uS3 to Enp1-TAP particles was not affected in these cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This lack of enrichment was due to decreased eS26 protein levels, since Western analyses of whole cell extracts derived from Tsr2-depleted cells revealed strongly reduced eS26 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These data led us to test whether eS26 becomes susceptible to proteolysis in Tsr2-depleted cells.

These analyses revealed that eS26 protein levels decreased over time upon Tsr2-depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

This process requires the import of \u223c14 million r-proteins into the nucleus through \u223c200 NPCs. Such a process entails rapid transport of importin:r-protein complexes into the nucleus, and necessitates an efficient mechanism to dissociate these complexes to terminate the import process. This permits rapid recycling of importins back to the cytoplasm for subsequent rounds of import. Although it is recognized that r-proteins employ multiple import pathways to reach the nuclear compartment, it remains unclear how these intrinsically unstable and aggregation-prone proteins are targeted to the assembling pre-ribosome. It is assumed that, like a typical import cargo, RanGTP releases the r-protein from the importin and the r-protein somehow finds its way to its cognate rRNA site. Here, we reveal that Tsr2 extracts eS26 from importins and ensures its safe transfer to the 90S pre-ribosome. These data implicate an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism that terminates the import process, and uncovers an unanticipated link between the nuclear import machinery and the ribosome assembly pathway."

Inside the nucleus, eS26 is removed from its importins in a RanGTP-independent mechanism mediated by Tsr2. The released eS26 forms a stable complex with Tsr2. After Tsr2:eS26 complex formation, Tsr2 guarantees a safe transfer of eS26 to the 90S pre-ribosome. Although RanGTP is able to inefficiently release eS26 from its importin, failure to immediately bind Tsr2 results in eS26 degradation. Therefore, in absence of Tsr2, only a smaller fraction of eS26 may reach the 90S pre-ribosome, providing a possible explanation as to why Tsr2-deficient cells are severely impaired in growth but are still viable, although the r-protein eS26 is essential. Notably, human Tsr2 can rescue the severe growth defect of the Tsr2-depleted strain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), strongly suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of Tsr2 in 40S assembly."

The eS26C77W mutant interacted poorly with its import receptors, suggesting that the inability to interact with importins may cause its degradation. Cysteine 77 is one of four conserved cysteines within eS26 that coordinates a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, right panel; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rabl et al., 2011</a>).

In addition to their transport role, importins may select correctly folded eS26. Notably, the eS26D33N mutant interacted with Kap123, Kap104, Pse1 and Tsr2 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>).

Tryptic cleavage was defined to occur after lysine and arginine, unless followed by a proline residue, and peptides were allowed to have up to one non-tryptic end and up to two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was added as static modification and methionine oxidation as variable modification. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 50 ppm.

Originally identified in a RNA processing screen as needed for 20S rRNA processing, the function of Tsr2 was poorly understood. Through a series of systematic analyses, the authors trace its role to pre-40S maturation and subsequently to ribosomal protein eS26 incorporation. Biochemical experiments illustrated a direct physical interaction between Tsr2 and eS26 that was mutually exclusive of the eS26-importin interaction. Further analysis showed that Tsr2, and not Ran-GTP, efficiently disassembles the eS26-importin complex in a substrate-specific reaction. These findings, together with the observation that eS26 is both aggregation prone and degradation prone in the absence of Tsr2, lead the authors to an interesting model whereby Tsr2 represents a new functional family of proteins that mediate the exchange of ribosomal proteins from importins to the preribosome."

The primary criticism centers around the issue of solidifying the central conclusion that Tsr2 is localized to and acting in the nucleus after eS26 import. Since earlier studies have suggested that eS26 is loaded onto the preribosome in the cytosol, it is worth more rigorously excluding this possibility. In this alternative interpretation of the authors' data, Tsr2 would bind to eS26 in the cytoplasm to prevent its interaction with karyopherins and to promote its late assembly, possibly in the cytoplasm. Addressing the following points would help discriminate these models."

The authors monitored the localization of Tsr2 coupled to 3 copies of GFP and expressed on top of WT protein. The higher expression level due to the extra copies from the CEN vector could lead to a mislocalization artifact. The authors should nail down the localization of functional/endogenous Tsr2 by either using an integrated GFP-tagged functional protein or indirect IF using anti-Tsr2. This would strengthen their model regarding its site of action."

Its accumulation in the nucleus suggests that it may not load efficiently into ribosomes. This is an important point because if the protein is not functional and not incorporated into ribosomes, its localization may be aberrant. The authors should clarify whether GFP-eS26 is functional and incorporated into ribosomes."

Presumably this is protein that is not bound by a Kap, hence its cytoplasmic localization, and not bound by Tsr2, which should be restricted to the nucleus. The apparent stability seems counter to the model. Again, the knowing the functionality of eGFP-eS26 would help with interpreting this result."

One strategy is to uncouple nuclear import of eS26 from its export. This would mean: to allow eS26 import, but selectively impair eS26 recruitment to the 90S pre-ribosome. We took advantage of the crystal structure of 40S subunit (<a href=\"#bib73\">Rabl et al., 2011</a>, doi: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1198308\">10.1126/science.1198308</a>).

We therefore fused GFP to the N-terminus of eS26, with the aim of constructing an eS26 that fails to be incorporated into the 90S pre-ribosome. Sucrose gradient analyses showed that GFP-eS26 co-sediments in lighter fractions at the top of the gradient suggesting that it is not incorporated into pre-ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>). Binding studies showed that like eS26, GFP-eS26 interacts with Kap123 and Kap104 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2C</a>). Thus, like eS26, GFP-eS26 is functional to recruit specific components of the import machinery. Consistent with these studies, GFP-eS26 is efficiently targeted to the nucleus in a Kap123 and Kap104 dependent manner. Therefore, we do not think the nuclear location of GFP-eS26 is aberrant."

Thus, Kap123 seems to be an import receptor for Tsr2.

One possibility could be that import of Tsr2 by Kap123 is regulated by posttranslational modification. Alternatively, Tsr2 may be transported into the nucleus <i>via</i> a \u201cpiggy bag\u201d mechanism bound to another yet unknown Kap123 cargo. We can exclude the possibility that eS26 serves as an adaptor to import Tsr2 since (1) Tsr2-3xGFP does not mislocalize to the cytoplasm in a eS26-depleted strain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and (2) <i>in vitro</i> binding assays show that the Tsr2:eS26 complex does not interact with Kap123 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).
