The hominoid-specific gene <i>TBC1D3</i> undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. Here, we found that expression of <i>TBC1D3</i> in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via <i>in utero</i> electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells (vRGs) and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia (oRG), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of <i>TBC1D3</i> in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either <i>in utero</i> electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3, was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding."

The hominoid-specific gene <i>TBC1D3</i> undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. Here, we found that expression of <i>TBC1D3</i> in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via <i>in utero</i> electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells (vRGs) and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia (oRG), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of <i>TBC1D3</i> in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either <i>in utero</i> electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3, was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding."

These cells give rise to new neurons, and are usually rare in mice but abundant in the brains of animals with a folded cortex. Additional experiments using samples of human brain tissue confirmed that <i>TBC1D3</i> is required for the outer radial glial cells to form. The samples were collected from miscarried fetuses with the informed consent of the patients and following approved protocols and ethical guidelines."

To fit into a limited cranium, expanded cortical surfaces are folded to form gyri and sulci. Recent cross-species studies have shown the emergence of an outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) in the primate cortex, consisting of a massive pool of proliferating basal progenitors (BPs) and post-mitotic neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Betizeau et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fietz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Reillo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Smart et al., 2002</a>). Unlike the neuroepithelia-derived ventricular radial glial cells, which undergo repeated and typically asymmetric cell division at the apical surface of the ventricular zone, the BPs, after delamination from the apical surface, translocate to the SVZ, where they exhibit symmetric or asymmetric divisions. In primates, the recently identified outer (basal) radial glia (referred to as oRG or bRG) and the intermediate progenitors (IPs) in the OSVZ, which can undergo multiple rounds of symmetric or asymmetric divisions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Betizeau et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>), are two major forms of BPs. By contrast, the IPs and minimal oRG cells in the mouse SVZ usually exhibit final division to generate a pair of post-mitotic neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shitamukai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). The radial and lateral expansion of BPs is thought to be a main cause of cortical folding of gyrencephalic species (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fietz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lewitus et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lui et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Reillo et al., 2011</a>). In support of this hypothesis, forced expansion of BPs by down-regulating the DNA-associated protein Trnp1 or overexpressing cell cycle regulatory proteins Cdk4/Cyclin D1 resulted in gyrification of the cerebral cortex in naturally lissencephalic mouse or gyrencephalic ferret (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stahl et al., 2013</a>)."

In particular, several recent studies have aimed to uncover the distinctive transcriptional signature of the expanded human OSVZ or BPs that reside there, leading to the identification of a group of genes highly expressed in the human OSVZ (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miller et al., 2014</a>), and human-specific orthologs preferentially expressed in human RGs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florio et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lui et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pollen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Thomsen et al., 2016</a>). For examples, platelet-derived growth factor D is expressed specifically and functionally important in human but not mouse RGs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lui et al., 2014</a>). A human lineage-specific Rho GTPase-activating protein could enhance the generation of IPs and cause neocortex expansion when expressed in the mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florio et al., 2015</a>).

At E15.5,\u00a0in situ\u00a0hybridization with an antisense <i>TBC1D3</i> probe showed that the transcript was expressed in TBC1D3-electroporated mice but not in control mice injected with the vehicle construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), consistent with the absence of TBC1D3 in the murine genome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hodzic et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, expression of TBC1D3 caused delamination of ventricular radial glia (vRG), and a decreased level of N-cadherin at adherens junctions (AJs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) at the ventricular surface. The reduction in N-cadherin was probably due to either the transcriptional inhibition or destabilization of transcripts, because in situ hybridization and real-time PCR showed marked reduction of <i>N-cadherin (Cdh2</i>) transcript in VZ cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and flow cytometry-sorted YFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing TBC1D3 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>), respectively.

                                "text": "Previous studies have shown that disruption of AJs due to the loss of RhoA in neural progenitors is accompanied by an elevated proliferation of neuroprogenitors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Katayama et al., 2011</a>). We thus examine the effect of TBC1D3 expression via <i>in utero</i> electroporation on neuroprogenitor proliferation by calculating the proportion of cells in S phase, as assayed by the incorporation of pyrimidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2 hr before sacrificing the electroporated mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). We found that TBC1D3 expression caused an increase in BrdU-positive (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) proliferating cells, as compared to that of control mice electroporated with vehicle construct (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). In an additional control experiment, we found that expressing a mutated form of TBC1D3, with the deletion of amino acids 286 to 353 (\u2206286\u2013353) essential for its cytoplasmic retention (<a href=\"#bib19\">He et al., 2014</a>), in neural progenitors had no effect on BrdU incorporation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). These results suggest that cytoplasmic presence of TBC1D3 promotes the proliferation of early neural precursors. Interestingly, the TBC1D3-induced population of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells scattered widely across the cortex, from VZ to CP, with the highest concentration in SVZ (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C,F</a>), indicating increased generation of BPs. The identity of these basal localized cells as BPs was further revealed by positive labeling by Ki67, a marker for cells in cell cycle, and negative labeling by NeuN, a marker for post-mitotic neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This effect of TBC1D3 expression was also confirmed by the increase in the proportion of cells stained with the mitotic marker phosphorylated Histone (PH3<sup>+</sup>) in basal regions and a decrease in cells attached to the ventricular surface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,G</a>). The seemingly non-cell autonomous effect of TBC1D3 expression on proliferation of BPs was most likely caused by different dosages of pE/nestin-TBC1D3 and pCAG-YFP (3:1) used in electroporation, because electroporation with pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP, a vector co-expressing both TBC1D3 and EGFP, caused increase in numbers of basal BrdU<sup>+</sup> or PH3<sup>+</sup> cells in EGFP<sup>+</sup> but not in EGFP<sup>-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The notable slight decrease of EGFP<sup>-</sup> apical neural progenitors might be due to the disruption of proliferation niche in VZ regions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B,D</a>, left)."

In primates, however, a recently identified subtype of BPs, namely outer radial glia (oRG) or basal radial glia (bRG), represents the predominant BPs in the expanded OSVZ (<a href=\"#bib52\">Smart et al., 2002</a>). These oRG cells express RG marker Pax6 and/or Sox2 and can divide multiple times to generate many daughter oRG or IPs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fietz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>). By contrast, the lissencephalic mouse embryonic cortex contains very few oRG cells, which divide only once to generate two neurons (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Highly proliferative oRG cells are thought to be critical for the expansion of primate brain cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sun and Hevner, 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "Remarkably, we found that TBC1D3 expression caused an increase in Pax6<sup>+</sup> cells in the mouse cortex, especially in the basal regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). The RG identity of these cells was further corroborated by the oRG-like morphology and the mode of division. In TBC1D3-expressing mouse cortical slices, we observed that many Sox2<sup>+</sup> or Pax6<sup>+</sup> BPs exhibited a single process pointing to the pial surface with intense signals of mitosis-specific phospho-Vimentin (p-Vim) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>), similar to unipolar oRGs identified in the human fetal brain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fietz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>). However, in control mice, the percentage of Sox2<sup>+</sup>/p-Vim<sup>+</sup> or Pax6<sup>+</sup>/p-Vim<sup>+</sup> cells with a basal process was much lower (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). This pial surface contact by oRG process was further examined by application of fluorescent membrane probe DiI to the isolated brain prior to sectioning. In TBC1D3-expressing cortices, we observed many oRG-like cells with a basal process attaching the pial surface and without the apical process attached to the VZ surface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). In the control cortices, however, most RGs had both apical and basal processes attaching the pial and VZ surfaces respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). Thus, TBC1D3 expression promoted production of oRG cells, which are normally rather rare in mice. In addition, we observed an increase in Tbr2<sup>+</sup> BPs at 96 hr after electroporation with TBC1D3 construct at E13.5 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>), in accordance with the linage relationship between oRG cells and IPs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>)."

We labeled individual progenitors with H2B-GFP to trace nuclear motion and tdTomato to reveal cell morphology without or with co-electroporation with TBC1D3 expression vector pCS2-Myc-TBC1D3, and brains were sliced 24 hr later for time-lapse imaging. In agreement with the above finding of increased oRG population, the number of cells with MST was markedly higher in TBC1D3-expressing slices, as compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). To visualize and identify the types of oRGs and their daughter cells generated by TBC1D3 expression, we electroporated E13.5 mice with pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP plasmids (or pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP as the control), followed with time-lapse imaging (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>) and immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013L</a>) of E14.5 brain slices. More than half (74/120) of proliferating cells labeled by pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP were typical oRG with a single basal process and an upward MST (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). In agreement with that observed in the primate OSVZ (<a href=\"#bib4\">Betizeau et al., 2013</a>), we also observed other types of oRGs, including bipolar cells with both apical and basal processes (42/120) and a few cells with a single apical process and a downward MST (4/120) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). Post-imaging immunostaining of cell markers showed that, in TBC1D3-electroporated samples, a large fraction of either apical or basal daughter cells derived from oRG cells exhibiting MST continued to express Sox2 but not Tbr2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J\u2013L</a>), consistent with oRG cells with the capacity for multiple rounds of cell division. In line with this notion, birth dating analysis using sequential labeling with BrdU and EdU showed that the fraction of BrdU<sup>+</sup>EdU<sup>+</sup> cells was higher in basal regions of TBC1D3-expressing cortices, as compared to that of controls (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, TBC1D3 expression in mice had endowed the primate-like proliferative potency of oRG cells. Taken together, these results show that the primary action of TBC1D3 expression is to promote the generation of oRG cells with high proliferative capacity, leading to expansion of BPs."

                                "text": "To further determine whether TBC1D3 is really essential for the generation of oRG cells in the developing human brain, we took advantage of small interference RNA (siRNA) and investigated the effect of TBC1D3 down-regulation on basal cortical neural progenitors of human brain slices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the constructs encoding TBC1D3 siRNAs (1033, 3B, or 440) down-regulated the expression of TBC1D3 in cultured Hela cells in various degrees with siTBC1D3-440 exhibiting most effective effect. Next, vRG cells in cultured fetal human brain slices were transfected with TBC1D3 or control siRNA using electroporation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). After culture for 72 hr, we found that electroporated cells in control samples exhibited normal delamination and a large fraction of them translocated to SVZ regions with typical morphology of oRG cells, whereas majority of siTBC1D3-electroporated cells remained in VZ regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). These results suggest that TBC1D3 is critical for the generation of oRG cells. In line with this notion, basal cells positive for Sox2, which largely represents oRG cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pollen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Thomsen et al., 2016</a>), were also markedly decreased in siTBC1D3-expressing samples (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). This effect was unlikely caused by off-target effect of siTBC1D3, because co-expression with TBC1D3 largely rescued the defect caused by TBC1D3 down-regulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). In agreement with the result that TBC1D3 destabilized <i>Cdh2</i> transcript, we found that transfection with TBC1D3 siRNA markedly increased stability of <i>Cdh2</i> mRNA in human neural progenitor ReNeuron cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Taken together, TBC1D3 plays a critical role in the generation of BPs during human brain development."

Three independent founder lines were generated with line 10 exhibiting highest copy number and expression level (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>), and thus line 10 was used for further breading and analyses. Immunostaining indicated that TBC1D3 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of Pax6<sup>+</sup> RG cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Notably, the expression level of TBC1D3 was progressively increased from early to later embryonic stages (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Beginning from E14.5, we observed apparent protrusion of layer 2/3 cells towards the pial surface in the cortex of all TG mice examined (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>; arrows), clear folding of cortical surface could be discerned on cortical surfaces or slices with Nissl staining in P3.5 and in adult mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>; asterisks and arrows). Immunostaining of Cux1 and Ctip2, markers for layer 2/3 and layer 5 cortical neurons, respectively, showed clear lamination in the cortex of both control and TG mice, but the TG cortex showed gyrus-like folding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,G</a>). Staining of pan-neuronal marker NeuN and astrocyte marker GFAP also showed folding of the cortical surface in adult TG mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). We did not observe apparent difference in vertical distribution of new born cortical neurons in TG mice (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that cortical folding was unlikely due to neuronal migration defects."

This localized effect may be attributed to temporal restriction of TBC1D3 expression in RG cells of TG mice and the rostral-to-caudal temporal progression of neurogenesis observed in several mammalian species (<a href=\"#bib56\">Caviness et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McSherry and Smart, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rakic, 1974</a>)."

At E12.5, the TG mice exhibited an increase in proliferating PH3<sup>+</sup> BPs, with a wide distribution across basal regions of the cortex, whereas only a single distinct layer contained PH3<sup>+</sup> cells in control mice (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). More strikingly, we observed a marked increase in the population of Sox2<sup>+</sup>Pax6<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>-</sup> cells in basal regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) and more than half of them exhibited typical morphology of oRG cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The presence of elevated oRG cells in the basal regions was also determined by DiI back-labeling on embryos of TG mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Similar to that observed in electroporation experiment (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), some of the basal Sox2<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>-</sup> cells exhibited clustered distribution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>). Notably, clustered columns of Sox2<sup>+</sup>Pax6<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>-</sup> cells were observed beneath regions of protrusion (as defined by DAPI staining of cells) at E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>), supporting the ontogeny unit hypothesis for cortex expansion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rakic, 1988</a>). Unlike basal Pax6<sup>+</sup> cells, relative density of total Pax6<sup>+</sup> only slightly increased (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). Sequential labeling with BrdU and EdU for mice at E13.5 and E16.5 also showed an increase in the number of EdU<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup> basal progenitors in TG mice (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results further support the conclusion based on <i>in utero</i> electroporation studies that TBC1D3 expression promotes the generation of highly proliferative BPs in mice. Besides morphological features and mode of division, several molecular markers have been identified for oRG cells, including HOPX (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pollen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Thomsen et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, many HOPX<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in basal extra-VZ regions of TG mice, whereas these cells were barely detectable in WT control mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I,J</a>). Thus, we conclude that TBC1D3 expression promotes generation of oRG cells in mice."

Interestingly, we found that TBC1D3 expression in neuroprogenitors by in utero electroporation at E13.5 caused a reduced expression of <i>Trnp1</i> in flow cytometry-sorted cells at E15.5, as compared to that found in control cells sorted from vehicle-electroporated mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), consistent with the finding that regional down-regulation of <i>Trnp1</i> expression causes cortical folding in mice (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stahl et al., 2013</a>). Unlike the role in destabilizing <i>Cdh2</i> transcript, TBC1D3 expression had no effect on the stability of <i>Trnp1</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). This result indicates a linkage between TBC1D3 and known factors that modulate fate transition from RGs to BPs. In addition to <i>Trnp1</i>, Notch signaling has been proposed to play a role in maintaining the progenitor status of human oRG cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>). However, we found that TBC1D3 expression had no effect on the transcriptional level of <i>Hes1</i> and <i>Hes5</i>, effecters of Notch signaling, as well as <i>Numb</i>, which encodes an endocytic adaptor protein that acts as a Notch pathway inhibitor localized to the apical membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>). The Ras-Raf-ERK signaling cascade mediates the mitotic role of EGF/EGFR signaling pathway in promoting cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Citri and Yarden, 2006</a>). We found that the signals for activated phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) were elevated in TBC1D3 TG mice, mostly in VZ/SVZ regions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>), in line with the previous observation that TBC1D3 enhanced the ERK signaling (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wainszelbaum et al., 2008</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib60\">2012</a>). Notably, almost all (99.1%) of Pax6<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>-</sup> oRG cells in developing human cortex were positively stained by pERK1/2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H,I</a>), further supporting the role of ERK signaling in oRG proliferation.

However, loss of adherens junction proteins or breaking their linkage to the cytoskeletal belts by down-regulating the small GTPase RhoA (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cappello et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lien et al., 2006</a>) had little effect on oRG generation or cortical folding, although apically anchored progenitor cells became delaminated. Thus, delamination of VZ progenitors is not sufficient for generating highly proliferative BPs, and changes in cell cycle regulatory factors are also be required. In the present study, we showed that expression of TBC1D3 led to not only down-regulation of N-cadherin, leading to VZ progenitor delamination, but also reduced Trnp1 expression and enhanced ERK signaling that could be involved in elevated proliferation of delaminated cells. Furthermore, other functions of TBC1D3 may also contribute to the cortical folding phenotype we observed. For examples, cell culture studies of TBC1D3 have suggested its potential role in membrane endocytosis, as well as Ras activation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wainszelbaum et al., 2008</a>), processes that may be involved in various aspects of neural development leading to cortical folding and gyrification. Indeed, we found that Ras activity was involved in TBC1D3-induced proliferation of BPs. Recent single-cell transcriptome analyses of human oRG cells have identified multiple preferentially expressed genes related to extracellular matrix formation, cell migration, and stemness, including the most specific oRG marker HOPX (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pollen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Thomsen et al., 2016</a>). Strikingly, many HOPX positive cells were observed in TBC1D3 TG mice. The relationship between TBC1D3 expression and these oRG markers remains to be clarified. Simple ectopic localization of RG cells outside of the ventricular zone may not be sufficient to cause cortical expansion or folding as shown in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yoon et al., 2014</a>). Appearance of oRG-like features, including the contact with pia surface by the basal process, multiple rounds of cell division, expression of specific markers, as well as clustered regional distribution of BPs observed in this study, may play prominent roles in cortical folding."

The pregnant female mouse was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 50 mg/kg BrdU (Sigma) at E14.5 and 100 \u03bcg EdU (Life Technologies) at E15.5. After 2 hr, fetal mice brains were dissected and fixed immediately in cold 4% PFA in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by dehydration in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C. For transgenic mice, BrdU and EdU were sequentially injected at E13.5 and E16.5, respectively. Frozen sections (50 \u03bcm) were collected in PBS as described above. BrdU staining was performed using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Abcam). In brief, brain sections were successively treated with 1 M HCl for 10 min on ice, 2 M HCl for 10 min at RT and another 20 min at 37\u00b0C to denature the DNA. Immediately after the acid incubations, sections were transferred into 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 9.0, for 10 min of neutralization at RT. After washes with PBS, brain sections were treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min followed by incubation in 10% donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr at RT, followed by incubation with primary antibodies (mouse anti-BrdU, Life Technologies B35128, 1:200; chicken anti-GFP, Aves Lab #GFP-1020, 1:500) at 4\u00b0C overnight, washes and incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1\u20132 hr at RT. EdU staining was performed using a Click-iT Plus EdU Imaging Kit (Life Technologies C10640) immediately after the incubation of secondary antibodies."

The key conclusion the authors made is that TBC1D3 is required for oRG generation in regulating cortical expansion and folding. However, the conclusion on oRG is mainly made with morphological features (basal localization, lack of attachment to the ventricular surface), not by definitive molecular signatures/markers. It is still possible that TBC1D3 simply regulates attachment to ventricular surface, lack of which leads to aberrant proliferation in basal location. This does not necessarily mean conversion of ventricular progenitors to oRG cells. Recently, there are multiple markers identified for oRG cells. While these markers may not work for mouse, they should be tested in their human fetal tissue studies."

This type of motor learning involving balance on the rotator is generally thought to require changes in cerebellar circuits, which was not explore here. Behavioral tests usually more dependent on hippocampal and cortical circuits include novel object recognition or some sensory discrimination/associative learning tests. The authors should either perform a broader range of behavioral tests in order to determine if there is a general improvement in 'cognitive' or 'motor' performance in these transgenic mouse line(s) and more carefully interpret the results in the context of the motor learning field."

The authors suggested a transcriptional suppression of N-cadherin and Trnp1 by TBC1D3, but the altered expressions on those genes may be just indirect effects of cytosolic role of TBC1D3. Overexpressed TBC1D3 in human carcinoma cell lines is exclusively cytosol, via direct protein-protein interaction with microtubule (He et al. PLoS One 2014). Do the authors think that TBC1D3 directly regulates gene transcription? What exactly is ectopic TBC1D3 doing in vRG and oRG. How might the cytoplasmic retention influence its function? How may the phenotype that the authors observed in the mouse cortex be related to the known functions of TBC1D3, e.g. activating RAS and enhancing EGF and Insulin signaling?</i> "

First, we performed additional experiments to determine how does TBC1D3 regulate N-cadherin and Trnp1 transcripts and found that expression of TBC1D3 indeed caused destabilization of N-cadherin transcript (see revised <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). The decrease in the level of Trnp1 might also be indirect. We propose that the expression of TBC1D3 in the VZ leads to detachment of vRGs via downregulation of N-cadherin and/or Trnp1, and promotes proliferation of oRG-like cells through Ras-ERK signaling. Several newly added lines of evidence support this model:"

It's not clear why increasing the number of neurons in superficial layers of the cortex would be responsible for the rotarod phenotype shown in Figure 8. Why did authors use average foot position from the top instead of latency to fall, which is widely used and more distinct? This type of motor learning involving balance on the rotator is generally thought to require changes in cerebellar circuits, which was not explore here. Behavioral tests usually more dependent on hippocampal and cortical circuits include novel object recognition or some sensory discrimination/associative learning tests. The authors should either perform a broader range of behavioral tests in order to determine if there is a general improvement in 'cognitive' or 'motor' performance in these transgenic mouse line(s) and more carefully interpret the results in the context of the motor learning field.</i> "
