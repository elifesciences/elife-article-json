The fact that this enzyme and three other proteins required for origin licensing \u2013 the origin recognition complex, CDC6 and CDT1 \u2013 are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution confirms the central importance of origin licensing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Makarova and Koonin, 2013</a>)."

First, by binding to DNA and histone proteins, it selects the sites where origin licensing takes place. Second, in conjunction with CDC6, it recruits the MCM2-7 helicase (which\u00a0is\u00a0bound to\u00a0a CDT1\u00a0protein) to each origin of replication. Structural studies indicate that CDC6 binds to the origin recognition complex to form a six-subunit protein ring (made up of CDC6 and ORC1-ORC5) around the DNA at the origin of replication (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bleichert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). This ring then binds to the MCM2-7 helicase such that the latter encircles the DNA adjacent to the origin of replication (<a href=\"#bib7\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). Subsequent events activate MCM2-7, allowing it to separate the DNA strands so that they can be copied (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bell and Labib, 2016</a>)."

Mapping the origins of replication showed that the mutant cells had approximately half as many of these sites as normal cells.

One possibility is that the mutant alleles do not completely eliminate the subunit targeted by the mutation. Although no residual ORC1 or ORC2 proteins were detected, Shibata et al. estimate that up to 1% of the proteins could still have been present in the cells. If residual ORC1 or ORC2 explains the viability of the mutant cells, each remaining origin recognition complex would have to load more than 35 helicases over 3.5 million DNA base pairs. Furthermore, although a lower abundance is consistent with the reduced number of origins of replication observed in the mutant cells, it does not explain why 60% of these sites are at new locations."

The loss of either of these subunits would leave a complex containing just four subunits but, crucially, each of these partial complexes would retain the ability to bind to CDC6. Therefore, it is possible that an origin recognition complex that lacks ORC1 or ORC2 could still form a ring (from four ORC subunits and CDC6) that retains the ability to bind strongly to DNA, CDC6 and MCM2-7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Mutations that reduced the production of ORC5 or CDC6 decreased DNA synthesis in ORC1 or ORC2 mutants, which indicates that both ORC5 and CDC6 are still involved in DNA replication in the absence of ORC1 or ORC2. In contrast to ORC1 and ORC2, Shibata et al. were unable to obtain viable mutations that prevented the production of the ORC4 or ORC5 proteins. These mutations would break the ring into multiple segments and the inability to obtain these mutants suggests that smaller ORC sub-complexes are non-functional. Finally, a partial origin recognition complex would be expected to have similar but not identical DNA binding properties to the full complex, and so is consistent with the partial overlap in the locations of the origins of replication seen between mutant and non-mutant cells."

For example, one or more CDC6 proteins could directly or indirectly bind to DNA to recruit MCM2-7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Although there is no evidence that CDC6 intrinsically binds to DNA, there is evidence that tethering CDC6 to DNA is sufficient to cause the adjacent DNA to be replicated (<a href=\"#bib8\">Takeda et al., 2005</a>), raising the possibility that other proteins could recruit CDC6. In addition, mutant cells that lacked ORC1 adapted to grow more rapidly over time, possibly reflecting the emergence of mutations that promote an alternative mechanism of origin licensing."

For example, it will be important to determine if it is possible to simultaneously mutate ORC1 and ORC2 in viable cells. If so, this finding\u00a0would support an ORC-independent model for CDC6 recruitment and origin licensing as the remaining ORC subunits would lack CDC6 binding sites. If not, then a model in which a partial origin recognition complex can perform origin licensing would be more likely. Regardless of the eventual mechanism, these studies reveal a resilience of the human DNA replication machinery to mutation that could facilitate growth as cells mutate during cancerous transformation."
