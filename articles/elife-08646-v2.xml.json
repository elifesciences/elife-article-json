SSB binds ssDNA with a variable footprint of \u223c30\u201370 nucleotides, reflecting partial or full wrapping of ssDNA around a tetramer of SSB. We directly imaged single molecules of SSB-coated ssDNA using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and observed intramolecular condensation of nucleoprotein complexes exceeding expectations based on simple wrapping transitions. We further examined this unexpected property by single-molecule force spectroscopy using magnetic tweezers. In conditions favoring complete wrapping, SSB engages in long-range reversible intramolecular interactions resulting in condensation of the SSB-ssDNA complex. RecO and RecOR, which interact with SSB, further condensed the complex. Our data support the idea that RecOR--and possibly other SSB-interacting proteins\u2014function(s) in part to alter long-range, macroscopic interactions between or throughout nucleoprotein complexes by microscopically altering wrapping and bridging distant sites."

SSB binds ssDNA with a variable footprint of \u223c30\u201370 nucleotides, reflecting partial or full wrapping of ssDNA around a tetramer of SSB. We directly imaged single molecules of SSB-coated ssDNA using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and observed intramolecular condensation of nucleoprotein complexes exceeding expectations based on simple wrapping transitions. We further examined this unexpected property by single-molecule force spectroscopy using magnetic tweezers. In conditions favoring complete wrapping, SSB engages in long-range reversible intramolecular interactions resulting in condensation of the SSB-ssDNA complex. RecO and RecOR, which interact with SSB, further condensed the complex. Our data support the idea that RecOR--and possibly other SSB-interacting proteins\u2014function(s) in part to alter long-range, macroscopic interactions between or throughout nucleoprotein complexes by microscopically altering wrapping and bridging distant sites."

In doing so, SSB protects ssDNA from chemical damage and exonucleolytic degradation, removes secondary structure, and enhances the enzymatic activity of many proteins involved in DNA metabolism (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shereda et al., 2008</a>). The extent to which ssDNA is wrapped around a tetramer of SSB is often referred to as a binding mode, defined by the apparent site size or footprint (i.e. nucleotides bound per tetramer). These binding modes are sensitive to salt, temperature, pH, and binding density (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lohman and Ferrari, 1994</a>). The cooperativity, i.e. nearest neighbor interactions, of SSB is also altered when SSB binds ssDNA in different binding modes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lohman et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bujalowski and Lohman, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ferrari et al., 1994</a>). At low salt concentrations, where ssDNA is partially wrapped around SSB, cooperativity is very high or \u2018unlimited\u2019. As such, proteins crowd very close to each other along the ssDNA. At higher more physiological salt concentrations, SSB binds in the fully wrapped binding mode and exhibits \u2018limited\u2019 cooperativity, where SSB forms dimers of tetramers (i.e. octamers) along the ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bujalowski and Lohman, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lohman and Ferrari, 1994</a>)."

These structures are observed at a low binding density of SSB; however, at higher binding densities, the structures form smooth, contoured nucleoprotein complexes that are condensed relative to the contour length of the corresponding dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Griffith et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hamon et al., 2007</a>). High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of spread SSB-coated ssDNA formed in low and high salt, measured approximately a twofold difference between the contour lengths of the nucleoprotein complexes. This difference in contour length was proposed to reflect the partially wrapped SSB<sub>35</sub> and fully wrapped SSB<sub>65</sub> binding modes, corresponding to a site size of 35 and 65 nucleotides, respectively (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamon et al., 2007</a>). It is worth noting that an additional, intermediate binding mode, SSB<sub>55</sub>, was also observed in direct binding experiments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lohman and Overman, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bujalowski and Lohman, 1986</a>)."

These ssDNA regions can range from a few hundred to tens of thousands of nucleotides in length. More than a dozen proteins interact directly with SSB via its short, unstructured C-terminal tail (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shereda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wessel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</a>). In the absence of interaction partners or ssDNA, this unstructured peptide tail interacts with the subunits within the SSB tetramer (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kozlov et al., 2010a</a>). This inter-subunit allostery contributes to the complex, cooperative nature of SSB binding to ssDNA. It has been proposed that the binding modes of SSB might be modulated in vivo for differential roles during ssDNA processing. Direct evidence for such modulation remained elusive for many years (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shereda et al., 2008</a>); however, recent work has shown that PriC remodels the SSB-ssDNA complex to create a DNA structure competent for DnaB loading during replication restart (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wessel et al., 2013</a>) and that PriA modulates the SSB-ssDNA complex to expose a potential replication initiation site (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</a>)."

This annealing activity is essential for RecA-independent, homology-directed DNA repair that proceeds through the single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kantake et al., 2002</a>). RecO also stimulates RecA-dependent homologous recombination by acting with RecR and RecF to promote RecA filament assembly (<a href=\"#bib61\">Umezu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Handa et al., 2009</a>). RecR, which does not bind to ssDNA, dsDNA, or SSB, binds to RecO and enhances the affinity of RecO for ssDNA-bound SSB (<a href=\"#bib61\">Umezu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Umezu and Kolodner, 1994</a>); however, neither RecO nor RecOR are capable of physically displacing SSB from ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib62\">Umezu and Kolodner, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ryzhikov et al., 2011</a>). When RecR is bound to RecO, it partially inhibits the annealing activity of RecO but stimulates both the rate of RecA nucleation and filament growth on SSB-coated ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kantake et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Morimatsu et al., 2012</a>). As RecA does not interact with SSB, RecO, or RecR (<a href=\"#bib61\">Umezu et al., 1993</a>), this activity must proceed through a RecOR-induced conformational change in the SSB-ssDNA complex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ryzhikov et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>)."

We also observe RecO-induced condensation of the SSB-ssDNA complex, as well as long-range intramolecular bridging in the presence of both RecO and RecR. We propose that the nature of this condensation is due to the ability of SSB to interact with distant sites along the ssDNA\u2014either through dimerization of SSB tetramers or through the partial wrapping of distant ssDNA sites on a single SSB protomer\u2014and that one role of RecOR is to enhance these distant interactions, which in turn would facilitate annealing of complementary strands. Our observations raise the possibility that the microscopic changes in ssDNA-binding modes observed for SSB cause macroscopic condensation (or de-condensation) of the nucleoprotein fiber that, in turn, might regulate access to ssDNA."

This protein maintains a high, albeit attenuated, affinity for ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 2012</a>). SSB<sup>AF488</sup>-ssDNA nucleoprotein complexes were formed by first denaturing bacteriophage \u03bb genomic dsDNA that had been biotinylated at the 3\u2032-terminated ends using DNA polymerase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The denatured DNA was mixed with buffer containing SSB<sup>AF488</sup>, attached to a glass surface functionalized with streptavidin, extended using flow within a microfluidic chamber, and visualized using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). When the concentration of sodium acetate (NaOAc) was increased during buffer exchange at a constant flow rate and a constant concentration of fluorescent SSB, the length of single molecules of SSB<sup>AF488</sup>-coated ssDNA shortened (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>); however, the fluorescent intensity of individual molecules remained constant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the protein had not dissociated, but rather redistributed, along the ssDNA molecule.

However, we were perplexed by the observation that the amount of protein\u2014indicated by the total fluorescent intensity\u2014along the ssDNA remained essentially unchanged during each salt-jump transition, despite the fact that the length had changed substantially."

                                "text": "Stopped-flow kinetic studies have previously demonstrated that SSB tetramers can transfer between ssDNA molecules without proceeding through a free protein intermediate (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kozlov and Lohman, 2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">b</a>) and single-molecule experiments have directly demonstrated that SSB tetramers diffuse rapidly on ssDNA and can \u2018hop or jump\u2019 across long distances of ssDNA via intersegmental transfer (<a href=\"#bib51\">Roy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). To distinguish between the intramolecular redistribution of SSB along the ssDNA in cis vs dissociation balanced with rebinding during the transition, we asked whether the salt-induced condensation of single molecules might be reversible in the absence of free protein. To address this possibility, SSB-coated ssDNA was tethered in a flow cell and extensively washed with buffer to remove free protein (\u223c100\u2013200 volumes of the flow chamber). An injection loop was then used to transiently pulse the tethered molecules with buffer containing either 100 or 400 mM NaOAc, followed by a sufficient volume of buffer to remove the injected salt. When the salt concentration was raised to 100 mM NaOAc, the flow-extended molecules compacted to \u223c60% of the length in the absence of salt (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), and then returned to the previously extended length when the salt was removed from the flow chamber. Similarly, this condensation was also observed when 400 mM NaOAc was used (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>); however, the extent of the condensation was greater, wherein the molecules shortened to \u223c12% of the flow-extended length in the absence of salt. In both experiments, the molecules were dimmer at the end of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), where approximately 20% of the SSB dissociated in the 0\u2192100 transition, and \u223c60% dissociated in the 0\u2192400 transition."

                                "text": "SSB<sup>AF488</sup> is particularly suitable for single molecule measurements due to its relative photostability, whereas an alternative biosensor derived from fluorescein-5-maleimide, SSB<sup>f</sup>, is particularly suitable as an ensemble ssDNA-biosensor due to the large, linear increase in fluorescence upon ssDNA binding (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dillingham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell, 2011</a>). To determine whether the measured lengths of individual SSB<sup>f</sup>-coated ssDNA complexes were correlated with the DNA-binding modes of SSB, we measured the stoichiometry of SSB<sup>f</sup> binding to poly(dT) using ensemble fluorescence measurements. Poly(dT) was titrated into a fixed concentration of SSB<sup>f</sup> at various concentrations of NaOAc, and the data were fit to a two-segment line to determine the apparent site size, which reflects the extant binding mode at each salt concentration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The observed site size increased from \u223c43 to \u223c70 nucleotides per SSB tetramer over the range of salt concentrations tested as expected; however, we noted that the amplitude of the fluorescence enhancement increased dramatically with salt concentration, indicating the molecular environment of the fluorophore was altered (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In addition to the stoichiometric titrations performed by adding ssDNA to a fixed concentration of SSB<sup>f</sup>, we performed so-called \u2018salt back-titrations\u2019 to determine the concentration at which SSB<sup>f</sup> dissociates from ssDNA. When pre-formed complexes of SSB<sup>f</sup>-poly(dT) were titrated with an increasing concentration of salt (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we observed an initial sharp increase in the fluorescence corresponding to the amplitudes from our direct titrations shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. The fluorescence peaked between 200 and 400 mM NaOAc, and was followed by a shallow, linear decrease until the concentration reaches approximately 2M NaOAc, where the fluorescence intensity exhibited a sharp decrease due to dissociation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The midpoint of this sharp transition corresponds to the so-called, \u2018salt-titration midpoint\u2019, where \u223c50% of the complex is dissociated (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kowalczykowski et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Newport et al., 1981</a>). The salt-titration midpoint for this experiment shows that \u223c2 M NaOAc in the presence of 5 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> is required to dissociate half of the protein from the DNA."

Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> induces a large condensation of nucleoprotein fibers that plateaus between 1 and 2 mM, and results in complexes that are as short as those produced with the much higher monovalent salt concentrations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). <i>Escherichia coli</i> maintains its intracellular osmolality by adjusting the intracellular concentration of glutamate, which ranges from \u223c30 to 260 mM when cells are grown in media containing from \u223c100 to 1100 mM solute (<a href=\"#bib49\">Richey et al., 1987</a>).

In particular, we reasoned that force spectroscopy would enable us to distinguish between intramolecular collapse owing to secondary structure formation and exclusion of SSB versus intrinsic, protein-mediated folding of the SSB-ssDNA molecule. We further reasoned that because SSB<sup>f</sup> is a modified variant of SSB (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dillingham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell, 2011</a>), we could not exclude the possibility that a component of the intramolecular condensation might be due to the fluorescent adduct. This concern prompted us to assess the condensation state of single molecules of ssDNA coated with wild-type, unmodified SSB. Briefly, a \u223c13.5-kbp DNA substrate with unique flanking restriction sites was PCR amplified from bacteriophage \u03bb DNA. Molecular \u2018handles\u2019 were made by PCR amplification of two fragments (\u223c2 kbp each) using pUC19 as a substrate in the presence of modified nucleotides. One fragment was amplified in the presence of DIG-dUTP, while the other was amplified in the presence of biotin-dGTP. These PCR fragments were ligated to the ends of the 13.5 kbp substrate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, leftmost cartoon). The DNA substrate was alkali denatured and then neutralized with buffer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, center cartoon). This resulted in ssDNA with one end that could be attached to the glass surface of a microfluidic cell that had been functionalized with anti-DIG antibodies, and the other end could be attached to a streptavidin-coated paramagnetic bead (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, rightmost cartoon). Paramagnetic beads and ssDNA that were not attached to the surface were flushed from the flow cell. Force-extension measurements of individual molecules were performed first in the absence of SSB at increasing salt concentrations. The salt was flushed from the flow cell, and measurements were then repeated in the presence of SSB, again at increasing concentrations of salt."

When SSB was bound to the ssDNA, both increasing and decreasing the force kinetically perturbed the length of the SSB-ssDNA complex with apparent exponential kinetics (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, inset). Care was taken to insure that the length measurements were made only after the ssDNA or SSB-ssDNA complex was in equilibrium at each force (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Force-extension curves of individual molecules of ssDNA were obtained by first decreasing force (dashed lines) and then increasing force (solid lines) at increasing concentrations of NaOAc in the absence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and presence of SSB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The force-extension curves of ssDNA alone show that the force required to stretch ssDNA also increases with respect to increasing concentrations of NaOAc (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The force-extension curves for ssDNA alone at salt concentrations greater than 25 mM NaOAc demonstrate hysteresis (i.e. the force-extension curves obtained by increasing and decreasing force do not overlap) due to the formation of secondary structure in the ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bosco et al., 2014</a>) <i>see also</i>, (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Saleh et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, this hysteresis was absent in the force-extension curves measured in the presence of SSB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), except at 750 mM NaOAc, the highest salt concentration that we used in our magnetic tweezer experiments. This modest hysteresis at the highest concentration of NaOAc is consistent with our interpretation that the decrease in the amplitude of the fluorescence enhancement measured during equilibrium titrations with SSB<sup>f</sup> is due to partial dissociation of SSB at concentrations of NaOAc greater than 750 mM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). More importantly, the absence of hysteresis in the presence of SSB is strong evidence that the structures are always at equilibrium, and that there are no kinetically trapped intermediates, neither short range nor the more likely long range random interactions (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schaper et al., 1991</a>), that would contribute to non-equilibrium behavior. We therefore infer that the intramolecular condensation that we observe is intrinsic to a reversible equilibrium folding of the SSB-ssDNA complex."

This relative condensation was calculated by dividing the length, L, by L<sub>0</sub> (i.e. L/L<sub>0</sub>), where L<sub>0</sub> is the length of the SSB-coated ssDNA in the absence of salt (0 mM NaOAc) for each applied force. The relative condensation was then re-plotted as a function of increasing NaOAc concentration for each force measurement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). As the concentration of NaOAc increases, the length of the SSB-coated ssDNA monotonically decreases, or condenses, (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>); however, the extent of the condensation is dependent on the force applied. We also compared the salt-dependent length changes measured using magnetic tweezers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>) to the salt-dependent length changes observed in the direct visualization experiments using TIRF microscopy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a>) by calculating the relative condensation, L/L<sub>0</sub>, to permit a normalized comparison of the different lengths of ssDNA used in each experiment. Since the salt-induced condensation of the molecules measured in the TIRF experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, black squares) is most similar to the relative condensation observed in the magnetic tweezer experiments that were performed at forces between 0.1 and 0.5 pN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, orange and gray circles), we estimate that this is approximately the shear force applied by flow during TIRF microscopy within our microfluidic cells. Importantly, because the salt-induced condensation of the SSB<sup>f</sup>-ssDNA complex is in qualitative agreement with the data obtained with wild-type SSB, we conclude that the salt-induced condensation observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a> is dominated by intramolecular bridging in cis, mediated by oligomers of SSB, rather than any property of the modified SSB<sup>f</sup> (<i>see Discussion</i>)."

The integrated area under a force-extension curve is the work performed on\u2013\u2013or absorbed by\u2013\u2013the polymer that is being stretched (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We therefore integrated the area under the force-extension curves, relative to the area for ssDNA alone in the absence of salt, to measure the change in energy of the interrogated molecule due to the presence of salt (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and/or SSB (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The measured change in energy (\u0394E), in units of pN\u2022nm, was then converted to units of k<sub>B</sub>T (i.e. the Boltzmann constant multiplied by the absolute temperature) using the relationship k<sub>B</sub>T \u223c 4.1 pN\u2022nm at 25\u00b0C, which corresponds to the energy contribution from thermal fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nelson, 2004</a>). The energy of salt-induced stabilization of ssDNA secondary structure is apparent in the deviation between the results obtained for pulling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, increasing force, black filled circles) and relaxing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, decreasing force, open circles) ssDNA in the absence of SSB. In the presence of SSB, the change in energy with respect to salt concentration approximately paralleled the behavior of ssDNA being relaxed from high force to low (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, compare red circles, red line with open black circles, dashed line), where long range ssDNA secondary structure does not contribute energetically. Because there was no hysteresis for SSB-ssDNA complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), the parallel energetic behavior of SSB-ssDNA and relaxing ssDNA suggests that SSB eliminates the hysteresis seen in ssDNA alone that is introduced by secondary structure formation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>) and SSB allows the ssDNA within the complex to behave as though long range secondary structure were absent. The addition of SSB resulted in an additional 3100 (\u00b1550) k<sub>B</sub>T (represented as \u0394\u0394E) at salt concentrations from 25 to 250 mM NaOAc relative to relaxing ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, open red circles, dashed line). Only at the highest salt concentration that we measured, 750 mM NaOAc, did we measure a substantial reduction in the \u0394\u0394E, consistent with our interpretation that SSB dissociates at these high salt concentrations, but not measurably below 250 mM NaOAc. While the total energy contribution of SSB binding is nearly constant (i.e. isoenergetic) within error, with respect to increasing salt concentrations (up to \u223c250 mM NaOAc), the contribution of each individual SSB tetramer should (and does) vary due to the transition in the site size across the range of salt conditions. This is\u2013\u2013in part\u2013\u2013reflected in the complex relationship that increasing salt has on the intrinsic flexibility of the ssDNA (reflected in the \u2018relaxing\u2019 curve, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, open black circles) vs the folding contributions of secondary structure (reflected in the \u2018pulling\u2019 curve, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, closed black circles). Because SSB eliminates hysteresis, and we interpret this as complete removal of hysteretic secondary structure, we reason that the relevant comparison (i.e. \u0394\u0394E calculation) is between the +SSB curve (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, red symbols) and \u2018relaxing\u2019 ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, open black symbols) (<i>see Discussion</i>). Accounting for the change in site size as the concentration of salt increases, the energy of SSB binding to ssDNA in our measurement corresponds to \u223c11 (\u00b12) k<sub>B</sub>T per SSB tetramer (assuming \u223c200\u2013320 SSB tetramers per ssDNA molecule), which is in reasonable agreement with the binding energy previously reported (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Suksombat et al., 2015</a>). These calculations are limited owing to our inability to actually count the number of SSB tetramers bound to each ssDNA molecule in the magnetic tweezer experiment."

Therefore, single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments were also performed in the presence of RecO, with and without RecR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). For naked ssDNA, in the absence of NaOAc and Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, the force-extension curves overlap when the applied force is either increased or decreased (i.e. there is no hysteresis) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, black curves); however, when 100 mM NaOAc and 1 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> were added to mimic physiological conditions, significant hysteresis was observed (red curve, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) due to the salt-induced stabilization of DNA secondary structure (<a href=\"#bib58\">Smith et al., 1996</a>). As documented above, this hysteresis in the presence of 100 mM NaOAc and 1 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> was also completely eliminated upon the addition of SSB (blue curve, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). When RecO was added in a stoichiometric ratio to SSB, the nucleoprotein fiber shortened \u223c10% relative to SSB-alone across the entire force spectrum, and hysteresis was not evident (purple lines, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The absence of hysteresis in the presence of RecO is interesting because RecO is known to facilitate annealing of complementary ssDNA in the presence of SSB (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kantake et al., 2002</a>), suggesting that RecO functions primarily in trans to promote annealing of complimentary strands, but not in cis to permit formation of non-specific secondary structures."

As expected from our previous experiments, the addition of salt induced hysteresis in the force-extension curve, wherein formation of intramolecular secondary structure accounted for approximately 1400 k<sub>B</sub>T. The addition of SSB was sufficient to eliminate this hysteresis in the presence or absence of RecO. The energy contribution of RecO to the SSB-ssDNA energy was modest, accounting for \u223c250 k<sub>B</sub>T (or \u223c1.2 k<sub>B</sub>T per SSB tetramer). The addition of RecR\u2013\u2013so that SSB, RecO, and RecR were all present\u2013\u2013again, contributed a modest amount of energy when the complex was relaxing (an additional \u223c220 k<sub>B</sub>T or \u223c1 k<sub>B</sub>T per SSB tetramer); however, when RecOR was bound to the SSB-coated ssDNA, hysteresis returned to the system, which we interpret as a result of long-range, protein\u2013protein interactions bridged by RecOR bound to SSB-ssDNA. The energy contribution from RecOR-mediated bridging was \u223c2000 k<sub>B</sub>T (or \u223c10 k<sub>B</sub>T per SSB tetramer). Interestingly, this energy contribution is essentially the same as the energetic contribution from SSB binding to ssDNA alone (\u223c9\u201313 k<sub>B</sub>T per tetramer, see previous section), indicating that RecOR bridges distant SSB tetramers and those tetramers must be disrupted as the molecule is stretched by increasing force. We conclude that when incubated together, RecOR forms a complex that binds to SSB-bound to ssDNA, and in doing so, both modulates the wrapped-state, or binding-mode, of SSB in order to induce macroscopic changes and serves as a scaffold to bridge distant sites along the SSB-ssDNA nucleoprotein fiber."

These results provide an extensive physical description of the polymer dynamics of SSB-coated ssDNA and reveal a previously unrealized property of SSB-ssDNA complexes to interact with distant intramolecular sites, which is manifest as condensation of single nucleoprotein fibers. This macroscopic condensation could occur either through the association of stable octamers or through ssDNA by the direct binding of distant sites to a single tetramer. The extent of condensation, however, is greatest under conditions where ssDNA is fully wrapped around the protein in the SSB<sub>65</sub> binding mode, making the former possibility more likely. In our force-spectroscopy experiments, the addition of SSB (or SSB and RecO) eliminated the salt-induced hysteresis caused by formation of DNA secondary structure through intramolecular annealing in cis. When we compare the energetic contribution of SSB binding to ssDNA, relative to the salt-induced effects on the ssDNA polymer energetics (excluding the contributions from long range secondary structure by comparing the \u2018relaxing\u2019 ssDNA force-extension curves), the change in energy due to SSB binding (when summed over a single molecule of ssDNA) is nearly isoenergetic across a large salt concentration range (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, compare the slope for SSB, red-filled circles, to relaxing ssDNA alone, open black circles, and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is both interesting and unexpected as it implies a homeostasis with regard to the energetics of SSB, relative to ssDNA, at physiological salt concentrations, making the absolute intracellular salt concentration nearly unimportant relative to other cellular processes working on or with the SSB-ssDNA complex. We propose that this relatively constant energy contribution across the ssDNA is made possible by a net change in the microscopic binding modes of SSB in such a way that all (or most) ssDNA is effectively coated by SSB, albeit with each SSB tetramer engaged in a different number of nucleotides and a different number of SSB tetramers engaged at each salt concentration. In this way, the sum of the energy changes (<i>see</i> <a href=\"#bib59\">Suksombat et al., 2015</a>) for each tetramer is balanced across a wide range of physiological conditions."

From the perspective of displacing SSB from ssDNA by another protein, this is the biologically relevant comparison because the absence of hysteresis in the SSB-ssDNA curves shows that there is no long range secondary structure in the SSB-ssDNA complexes. When we calculate the \u0394\u0394E relative to the \u2018pulling\u2019 condition with ssDNA alone where the contributions of secondary structure are clearly evident (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, solid black circles and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, solid red circles, solid red line), the \u0394\u0394E decreases until it becomes negative (and therefore unfavorable) at approximately 400 mM NaOAc, corresponding to a concentration of salt where secondary structure may become more stable than the SSB\u2013ssDNA interaction (consistent with our observations in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, this net energetic accounting reflects what would be apparent in a traditional ensemble measurement, where SSB-binding and DNA secondary structure formation are in competitive equilibrium, and reconciles our observations with previous work that has interrogated the salt-dependence of SSB-ssDNA interactions where the standard state for free energy calculations is the free ssDNA that will form secondary structure."

Since denatured \u03bb-phage DNA is 6.6-fold longer than M13mp7 ssDNA, we expected our SSB-ssDNA would be approximately 6.1 \u03bcm long in low salt and compacted by 1.6-fold to approximately 3.7 \u03bcm long in high salt (up to \u223c300 mM Na<sup>+</sup>); however, we observed an approximately fourfold compaction over this range. A substantially greater degree of compaction of the complexes was measured upon further increase in salt concentration \u2013 from 6.5 \u03bcm in the absence of salt to 0.5 \u03bcm at 750 mM NaOAc \u2013 which is a 13-fold compaction. If the site size was the dominant factor determining the condensation state of SSB-coated ssDNA, then the maximum change in length should be approximately twofold, yet we measure a \u223c13-fold decrease in length. We propose that an explanation derives from the fact that SSB does not simply bind to ssDNA as an array of globular units, but instead exhibits limited cooperativity between tetramers, at higher salt concentrations, where it also forms octamers (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lohman and Bujalowski, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bujalowski and Lohman, 1989a</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">b</a>) which might serve as an intramolecular bridges between distant sites along the ssDNA resulting in the condensation that we observe (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chrysogelos and Griffith, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Griffith et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hamon et al., 2007</a>). Although the molecular nature of the condensing species is unknown, we also note that the population of the various SSB-binding modes depends not only on intracellular solution conditions, but also on the SSB concentration itself due to the established effects of \u2018competition\u2019 between DNA-binding modes with different site sizes, affinities, and cooperativities (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schwarz and Stankowski, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bujalowski et al., 1988</a>); therefore, with SSB in excess over ssDNA \u2013 which is the cellular situation \u2013 multiple modes coexist and may serve to keep the amounts of bound SSB nearly constant. Finally, although the high degree of salt-induced compaction of SSB-ssDNA that we observed was surprising based on previous AFM and EM studies, our results are in good qualitative agreement with early, largely unexplained, ultracentrifugation experiments performed with SSB-saturated M13-phage ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schaper et al., 1991</a>): our changes in length with salt concentration map exactly on the reported changes in sedimentation coefficients for the SSB-M13 ssDNA complexes."

The absence of hysteresis in our force-extension curves in the presence of SSB is strong evidence that the intramolecular condensation that we observe is not due to the formation of distant ssDNA\u2013ssDNA contacts, but rather is driven by the microscopic reorganization of SSB along the ssDNA, which in turn contributes to a macroscopic folding of the molecule. Several structural polymer models might explain the condensed molecules that we observe, including the formation of solenoid or fractal structures; however, several interesting properties of SSB support the idea that intramolecular folding or condensation is protein-mediated. First, dimerization of SSB tetramers (i.e. octamer formation) is a well-established phenomenon at increasing but still physiologically relevant intracellular salt concentrations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chrysogelos and Griffith, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bujalowski and Lohman, 1987</a>), which can linearly vary from 0.23 to 0.93 molal K<sup>+</sup> ion and from 0.03 to 0.26 molal glutamate ion in response to changes in the osmolality of the growth medium (<a href=\"#bib49\">Richey et al., 1987</a>) <i>see also</i>, (<a href=\"#bib16\">Epstein and Schultz, 1965</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Epstein and Schultz, 1966</a>). Second, SSB exhibits long-range, intersegmental transfer (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2014</a>), the latter of which likely proceeds through direct, tetramer transfer within a ternary intermediate comprising SSB and two ssDNA molecules without proceeding through a free-protein intermediate (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kozlov and Lohman, 2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">b</a>). This property of SSB is possible owing to multiple, high affinity binding sites distributed around the tetramer, or as the case may be in the high-salt mode, octamers. This phenomenon has primarily been described as a transient intermediate during rapid, stopped flow kinetics; however, we believe that the intramolecular condensation that we observe here provides evidence that the sum of these transient interactions across the SSB-ssDNA fiber might explain how many SSB tetramers can simultaneously engage in distant ssDNA sites to contribute to an intramolecular, folded polymer that is highly dynamic and \u2018fluid\u2019, undergoing constant, steady\u2013steady state protein turnover and diffusion at equilibrium. This is corroborated by the rapid exchange of SSB protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and the absence of net protein loss under steady-state conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but the rapid dissociation in the absence of free protein during salt-jump experiments (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), as well as the ability of SSB labeled with different fluorophores to exchange and form mixed complexes (JCB, unpublished observations), a phenomenon also demonstrated for eukaryotic RPA (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gibb et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Similar to nucleosomes, SSB binds and wraps a DNA polymer around itself (albeit ssDNA instead of dsDNA), interacts with dozens of proteins via a short acidic peptide tail, and exhibits complex cooperative and anti-cooperative behavior that is modulated by salt concentration. Our observation that SSB-ssDNA is macroscopically organized and regulated through microscopic interactions is surprisingly similar to the most basic organization of eukaryotic chromatin and highlights the important role of SSB, not simply as a kinetic trap for ssDNA, but as an organizational and regulatory scaffold during DNA metabolism (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shereda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sun et al., 2015</a>). This organizational and regulatory role is likely controlled by the acidic, intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of SSB, which is required for cooperative binding of SSB to ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kozlov et al., 2015</a>). In the absence of interaction partners or ssDNA, this unstructured peptide tail interacts with the subunits within the SSB tetramer (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kozlov et al., 2010a</a>). Recent studies have identified a cadre of proteins, including the \u03c7 subunit of DNA polymerase III, PriA, PriB, RecG, RNaseHI, Exonuclease I, and RecO, that bind to the C-terminal tail of SSB and either remodel the SSB-ssDNA complex or regulate enzymatic ssDNA metabolism (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cadman and McGlynn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shereda et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lu and Keck, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kozlov et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2010b</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wessel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Petzold et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sun et al., 2015</a>). Extrapolating from our observations in this work, these many proteins may regulate access to ssDNA by binding to SSB and altering either compaction/de-compaction most likely by perturbing the microscopic binding state of SSB."

                        "text": "Indeed, we demonstrate that this condensation occurs not only with increasing osmolality, but also by the addition of RecO, which binds directly to SSB, in the absence and presence of RecR (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ryzhikov et al., 2011</a>). As the C-terminal tail of SSB interacts with more than a dozen proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shereda et al., 2008</a>), our observation supports and expands upon the idea that these proteins might modulate the macroscopic condensation state of the SSB-ssDNA fiber by microscopically altering the binding mode, and therefore either grant or restrict access to the ssDNA. In the case of RecO and RecOR, altering this macromolecular state by bridging distant sites could reduce the three-dimensional space required to facilitate homology-dependent annealing of ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berg et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Forget and Kowalczykowski, 2012</a>), which occurs by a second order kinetic process (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berg et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kantake et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, RecO has been shown to slow the rate of one-dimensional diffusion, or sliding, of SSB on ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>), which is consistent with the small energy contribution of RecO and RecOR binding we observe here, where RecO contributes an additional \u223c1\u20132 k<sub>B</sub>T per SSB tetramer. By slowing the rate of diffusion of SSB on ssDNA, RecO might facilitate both annealing and RecA nucleation by increasing the lifetime of transiently exposed ssDNA. The long range interactions induced by RecR could also be due to phasing of SSB via its interaction with RecO, creating microscopic gaps on the ssDNA that allow distant sites with micro-homology to anneal, forming intramolecular secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In its biological context, these microscopic gaps could also facilitate the nucleation of RecA filaments during homologous recombination by exposing short segments of ssDNA between SSB tetramers, either by inducing a conformational change that physically disrupts the SSB-ssDNA complex to create gaps or by increasing the lifetime of transiently exposed ssDNA created during SSB sliding along the ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 2012</a>)."

The flow cell was mounted onto a PicoTwist microscope (PicoTwist, Paris, France) so that the Mylar is under tension. The position of the magnets was carefully adjusted so that the distance between the magnets and the flow cell surface was accurate and calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications. The DNA substrate was incubated in 0.5 M NaOH to denature the dsDNA to ssDNA, which was then attached to magnetic beads (1 \u03bcm MyOne C1 Dynal) by mixing biotinylated ssDNA and the beads in \u223c5:1 molar ratio in SMB and incubating on a slow rotator for 15 min at room temperature. The ssDNA-bead mixture was added to the flow cell. After 10-min incubation at 25\u00b0C, untethered beads were eliminated by extensive washing with SMB. Changing the position of the magnets controlled the force. Flow was driven by gravity.

Bell et al. examine the properties of single molecules of SSB-coated ssDNA using TIRF microscopy and force spectroscopy (magnetic tweezers). The first set of experiments use tethered single-stranded Lambda DNA coated with fluorescently labeled SSB in a flow cell to image the condensation/length of the molecules in response to salt titrations. The degree of condensation is greater than what was expected based on simple binding mode transitions, and it is suggested that this is due to long-range intramolecular interactions. The second set of experiments use force spectroscopy to generate force-extension curves of Lambda ssDNA coated with unmodified SSB in the absence and presence of RecO/RecOR. The results from this indicate that addition of RecO alone further shortened the nucleoprotein fiber and the addition of RecOR induced significant hysteresis suggesting RecR is bridging distant contacts within the nucleoprotein fiber. The authors conclude that RecOR binding to SSB-ssDNA modulates the binding mode of SSB and serves as a scaffold to condense distant sites on the nucleoprotein fiber."

In particular the major problems raised by all three reviewers concerns perhaps the validity of predicting expected compaction of ss lambda DNA by SSB should be based on site sizes measured with polydT (for example see point 4 and 7 below)."

In experiments with poly(dT), binding modes with occluded site sizes of \u223c35, 40, 55 and 65 nucleotides per tetramer have been identified. The relative stability of these modes can be modulated in vitro by changing the salt concentration. As the salt concentration is increased, the mode of binding shifts from the 35 mode to the higher site size modes, resulting in progressive compaction of the ssDNA. These different binding modes also display very different cooperative behavior. The binding mode transitions have also been demonstrated by sedimentation, EM and AFM measurements. The previously reported occluded site size measurements as a function of salt type and concentration have generally been performed using poly(dT) in order to eliminate complications due to secondary structure (hairpins, etc.) that will form in natural ssDNA, such as M13 or lambda DNA that is used in the current study. In the original report of salt-induced SSB binding mode transitons (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lohman &amp; Overman (1985)</a>) the apparent site sizes measured using poly(dT) were compared with measurements using ss M13 phage DNA. These showed that the apparent site size is severely overestimated when M13 ssDNA is used and that the discrepancy increases as the salt concentration increases (e.g., 65 nt for pol(dT) vs. 77 nt for M13 DNA at 0.3 M NaCl). This difference will be greater at higher salt concentrations. This difference is due to the fact that SSB, especially at high salt concentrations is unable to remove all of the secondary structure from natural ssDNA. This is partly because SSB does not bind with high cooperativity in the 55 or 65 modes. Therefore, the uncertainty in predicting what the expected compaction of ss lambda DNA based on site sizes measured on polydT makes the main conclusion difficult to assess. The authors need to address this before the manuscript can be published."

When the calculation is done using 4.5 nm, the predicted length lower limit is lowered by 25%, which encompasses all of the data points except for the two at the highest salt concentrations.

The figure panel was meant to illustrate the surprising result that SSB-ssDNA compacted more than we initially anticipated based on the published results in Hamon et al., where they observed a contour length of 920 nm at low salt concentration, where SSB is typically in the \u201cSSB<sub>35</sub>-mode\u201d, and 560 nm in a higher salt concentration, where it is in the \u201cSSB<sub>65</sub>-mode\u201d. This change in length (920 nm vs. 560 nm) represents a 1.6-fold increase upon going from high to low salt, or a decrease of 60% upon going from low to high salt. Since lambda DNA is 6.6-fold longer than ssM13, we anticipated our SSB-ssDNA molecules should be \u223c6.1 um in the low salt, SSB<sub>35</sub>-mode and decrease by 60% to \u223c3.7 um in the high salt SSB<sub>65</sub>-mode. Both of these DNA molecules are natural, mixed sequences, and we expect their propensity to form secondary structure should be similar and comparable. Though we still refer to these lengths and the typical SSB-binding modes in the text, because we now focus our comparisons to observed native DNA lengths, we have removed the figure plotting our measured site size vs. length, have clarified the different ssDNA molecules used in the individual panels in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, and have removed the panel (E) showing length predictions."

This assay is extremely sensitive, and allowed us to measure the condensation of the SSB-ssDNA fiber (on a long, natural ssDNA substrate) as a function of both force and salt perturbation. When we compared force-extension curves for either ssDNA or SSB-coated ssDNA, we noted that a dramatic difference is apparent in the hysteresis of the curves. We interpret the absence of hysteresis in the presence of SSB as strong evidence that long-range DNA secondary structure is not capable of excluding SSB and contributing to condensation until the concentration of NaOAc was increased to 750 mM. This is readily apparent when we calculate the \u0394\u0394E (energy) by subtracting the ssDNA-alone relaxation curves (which do not include the energetics of long-range secondary structures; see subsections \u201cForce spectroscopy of single molecules of ssDNA and SSB-coated ssDNA reveals a nearly complete relief of hysteresis in SSB-ssDNA unfolding transitions\u201d and \u201cThe SSB-ssDNA complex is a nearly isoenergetic landscape, relative to unstructured ssDNA, at physiological salt concentrations\u201d for discussions and references) from the SSB-coated ssDNA curves at each salt concentration, where we see a nearly uniform binding energy, with the sole exception of the 750 mM NaOAc condition (new <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, at least in our magnetic tweezers experiment where some force is always being exerted on the molecule owing to the bead tethering (in contrast to the ensemble equilibrium binding described in the paragraph above), no measureable long-range secondary structure forms in the presence of SSB."

The model that we propose, where SSB-mediates this condensation via SSB-SSB interactions or by engaging in multiple SSB-ssDNA interactions within single tetramers, rather than ssDNA hybridization, is largely warranted based on the complex properties of SSB, but it is a model nonetheless.

Interestingly, they do show images of SSB-ssDNA complexes formed in 12 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in their <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, and these complexes form \u201chighly condensed complexes that do not spread well<i>\u201d</i>, consistent with our observations of strong, Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>-dependent compaction, but as a consequence of this highly condensed structure, they do not report measurements of these complexes. We also note that such condensed complexes can be easily dismissed by critics of AFM as being structures that aggregated on the ionic mica surface and perhaps \u201cartifacts\u201d. We did attempt to use AFM to image condensed complexes; however, we ran into two technical problems. We verified that conditions permitting condensation similarly resulted in poorly spread complexes that could not be used to measure contour lengths and resulted in poor imaging conditions owing to salt and aggregates on the mica. Removal of the salt requires rinsing the samples, which obviously perturbs the intramolecular condensation of the molecules, and we know from our TIRF experiments that condensation, decondensation and remodeling are rapid. Given these technical problems \u2013 as well as the complication of requiring spermidine for surface adsorption \u2013 we reasoned that the force spectroscopy experiments would be the most accurate method for measuring contour lengths at increasing salt concentrations using wild-type unlabeled SSB."

Alternatively, long-range interactions could be explained by re-annealing of the ssDNA as secondary structure forms.

                    "text": "<i>4) It is well established that</i> E. coli <i>SSB can bind single stranded DNA in multiple binding modes that differ in the extent of wrapping of the ssDNA around the tetramer. In experiments with poly(dT), binding modes with occluded site sizes of \u223c35, 40, 55 and 65 nucleotides per tetramer have been identified. The relative stability of these modes can be modulated in vitro by changing the salt concentration. As the salt concentration is increased, the mode of binding shifts from the 35 mode to the higher site size modes, resulting in progressive compaction of the ssDNA. These different binding modes also display very different cooperative behavior. The binding mode transitions have also been demonstrated by sedimentation, EM and AFM measurements. The previously reported occluded site size measurements as a function of salt type and concentration have generally been performed using poly(dT) in order to eliminate complications due to secondary structure (hairpins, etc.) that will form in natural ssDNA, such as M13 or lambda DNA that is used in the current study. In the original report of salt-induced SSB binding mode transitons (</i><a href=\"#bib38\"><i>Lohman &amp; Overman (1985)</i></a><i>) the apparent site sizes measured using poly(dT) were compared with measurements using ss M13 phage DNA. These showed that the apparent site size is severely overestimated when M13 ssDNA is used and that the discrepancy increases as the salt concentration increases (e.g., 65 nt for pol(dT) vs. 77 nt for M13 DNA at 0.3 M NaCl). This difference will be greater at higher salt concentrations. This difference is due to the fact that SSB, especially at high salt concentrations is unable to remove all of the secondary structure from natural ssDNA. This is partly because SSB does not bind with high cooperativity in the 55 or 65 modes. Therefore, the uncertainty in predicting what the expected compaction of ss lambda DNA based on site sizes measured on polydT makes the main conclusion difficult to assess. The authors need to address this before the manuscript can be published</i>."

Therefore, AF488-labeled SSB is most well suited for single-molecule measurements, and fluorescein-labeled SSB is more suitable for traditional, ensemble measurements. In the absence of salt, we have observed a 2.6-fold increase in fluorescence upon polydT binding to SSB-AF488, but only a 2.2-fold fluorescence enhancement in the presence of salt (200 mM NaOAc and 5 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>).
