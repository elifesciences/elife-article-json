In this study, we report that these kinases attenuate \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in white adipose tissue. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of these kinases restored \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and lipolysis attenuated by TNF\u03b1 and Poly (I:C). Conversely, overexpression of the kinases reduced induction of <i>Ucp1</i>, lipolysis, cAMP levels, and phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase in response to isoproterenol or forskolin. Noncanonical IKKs reduce catecholamine sensitivity by phosphorylating and activating the major adipocyte phosphodiesterase PDE3B. <i>In vivo</i> inhibition of these kinases by treatment of obese mice with the drug amlexanox reversed obesity-induced catecholamine resistance, and restored PKA signaling in response to injection of a \u03b2-3 adrenergic agonist. These studies suggest that by reducing production of cAMP in adipocytes, IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 may contribute to the repression of energy expenditure during obesity."

In this study, we report that these kinases attenuate \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in white adipose tissue. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of these kinases restored \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and lipolysis attenuated by TNF\u03b1 and Poly (I:C). Conversely, overexpression of the kinases reduced induction of <i>Ucp1</i>, lipolysis, cAMP levels, and phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase in response to isoproterenol or forskolin. Noncanonical IKKs reduce catecholamine sensitivity by phosphorylating and activating the major adipocyte phosphodiesterase PDE3B. <i>In vivo</i> inhibition of these kinases by treatment of obese mice with the drug amlexanox reversed obesity-induced catecholamine resistance, and restored PKA signaling in response to injection of a \u03b2-3 adrenergic agonist. These studies suggest that by reducing production of cAMP in adipocytes, IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 may contribute to the repression of energy expenditure during obesity."

Obesity also increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and certain cancers. There is considerable evidence to suggest that adipose tissue becomes less sensitive to catecholamines such as adrenaline in states of obesity, and that this reduced sensitivity in turn reduces energy expenditure.

High levels of the two enzymes also resulted in lower levels of a second messenger molecule called cAMP, which increases energy expenditure by elevating fat burning. However, treating the fat cells with drugs that interfere with the two enzymes restored sensitivity to catecholamine, allowing the fat cells to burn energy."

Both of these kinases are increased as a consequence of the inflammatory program in obesity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reilly et al., 2013</a>), and contain NF\u03baB regulatory sites in their promoter regions, allowing them to be induced upon NF\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kravchenko et al., 2003</a>). Deletion of the IKK\u03b5 gene rendered mice partially resistant to some of the deleterious effects of high fat feeding, including weight gain, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and systemic inflammation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2009</a>). We report, in this study, that IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 can desensitize lipolytic signaling in white adipose tissue in response to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists by phosphorylating and increasing the activity of PDE3B, in the process decreasing cAMP levels. Thus, induction of these noncanonical I\u03baB kinases might contribute to catecholamine resistance during obesity, and blocking their activity has the potential to increase energy expenditure as an anti-obesity and anti-diabetes therapy."

Activation of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling by either \u03b2-adrenergic agonists or cold exposure in white and brown adipose tissue initiates a cascade of events through cyclic AMP (cAMP), culminating in the transcriptional upregulation of Ucp1, which results in increased proton leak and energy expenditure (<a href=\"#bib24\">Himms-Hagen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yehuda-Shnaidman et al., 2010</a>). Our previous studies revealed that compared to wild-type (WT) controls, IKK\u03b5-deficient mice exhibited increased energy expenditure while on a high fat diet (HFD), accompanied by increased expression of Ucp1 in white adipose depots (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, increased energy expenditure in IKK\u03b5-deficient mice was only seen in HFD-fed mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that upon induction of IKK\u03b5 during obesity, the kinase might repress an increased adaptive thermogenic response to overnutrition. To explore this possibility, we overexpressed IKK\u03b5 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and examined <i>Ucp1</i> gene expression after treatment with the non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), or the \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic agonist, CL-316,243. Fold difference in <i>Ucp1</i> gene expression was calculated by normalization of relative <i>Ucp1</i> mRNA levels in treated relative to control samples. Treatment of empty vector-expressing cells with ISO or CL-316,243 resulted in a 1.6-fold or twofold increase in <i>Ucp1</i> mRNA levels, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The induction of <i>Ucp1</i> gene expression in response to ISO or CL-316,243 was blunted when WT IKK\u03b5 was overexpressed in these cells. However, expression of the kinase-inactive mutant of IKK\u03b5 K38A (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</a>) was less effective, but still modestly repressed <i>Ucp1</i> expression."

We thus modeled the obesity-dependent increase in the noncanonical IKKs by overexpressing IKK\u03b5 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, followed by assay of glycerol release in response to ISO or CL-316,243. Although both isoproterenol and CL-316,243 increased lipolysis in empty vector-expressing cells, overexpression of WT IKK\u03b5 reduced the lipolytic effects of isoproterenol and CL-316,243 by greater than 40%, and also reduced basal glycerol release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The reduction in lipolysis by IKK\u03b5 overexpression was accompanied by dramatically reduced phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin in response to ISO or CL-316,243 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Expression of the catalytically inactive kinase was less effective in blocking lipolytic signaling, although the levels of protein achieved by overexpression were lower compared to the WT kinase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Overexpression of TBK1 reduced phosphorylation of HSL in response to isoproterenol or the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Identical results were obtained when IKK\u03b5 was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated with forskolin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), as detected by western blotting with an anti-phospho-PKA substrate motif antibody. Overexpression of IKK\u03b5 also repressed the phosphorylation of p38 (p-p38) in response to forskolin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) or isoproterenol (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas overexpression of IKK\u03b5 K38A was without effect (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). While glycerol release is likely the result of changes in HSL and perilipin phosphorylation, it is important to note that we have not directly assayed whether re-esterification of glycerol intermediates are also affected. Taken together, these data suggest that similar to what is observed in obesity, overexpression of IKK\u03b5 or TBK1 can repress lipolytic signaling. The partial effectiveness of the kinase-inactive mutants is puzzling, but may reflect their activation of endogenous IKK\u03b5 or TBK1 kinases due to dimerization (<a href=\"#bib35\">Larabi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tu et al., 2013</a>)."

IKK\u03b5 overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced by greater than 80% the increase in cAMP levels produced by both isoproterenol and forskolin, whereas overexpression of IKK\u03b5 K38A did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Previous studies have shown that decreased sensitivity to adrenergic stimuli in adipose tissue can result from reduced \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Reynisdottir et al., 1994</a>) or increased expression of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stich et al., 2002</a>). These studies represent the first demonstration that defects distal to the adrenergic receptor may also contribute to catecholamine resistance, and suggest that IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 can attenuate the \u03b2-adrenergic/cAMP pathway in response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimuli in adipocytes in a cell-autonomous manner, and further that induction of these kinases during obesity may account for decreased energy expenditure by reducing sensitivity of adipocytes to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation."

We thus used TNF\u03b1 to model the inflammatory milieu of obese adipose tissue in cell culture to determine whether the cytokine might also regulate \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in this context. While short-term treatment with TNF\u03b1 augmented the increase in cAMP produced by forskolin treatment, this effect declined after 12 hr. After 24 hr of exposure, TNF\u03b1 inhibited the production of the second messenger produced by forskolin (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with amlexanox also blocked the inhibitory effect of TNF\u03b1 on isoproterenol-stimulated \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, as determined by western blotting with an anti-phospho-PKA substrate motif antibody, anti-phospho-HSL, and anti-phospho-perilipin antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, phosphorylation of p38 in response to isoproterenol was also dramatically augmented by amlexanox in a dose-dependent manner. Previous studies showed that the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, Poly (I:C), results in the direct activation of IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hemmi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clark et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2011</a>).

Phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) is the major PDE isoform expressed in adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zmuda-Trzebiatowska et al., 2006</a>). Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of PDE3B in cells and <i>in vivo</i> revealed an important role for the enzyme in lipid and glucose metabolism (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Degerman et al., 2011</a>).

This residue resides in a consensus phosphorylation sequence for both Akt and PKA, and also serves as a consensus 14-3-3 binding motif once phosphorylated (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lindh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Palmer et al., 2007</a>). We thus created a Ser318Ala (S318A) mutant of PDE3B, and examined its interaction with a GST-14-3-3\u03b2 fusion protein or by GST-14-3-3 overlay assay. Interestingly, despite incubation with TBK1, the phospho-defective, S318A mutant of PDE3B, did not specifically interact with GST-14-3-3\u03b2, whereas the wild-type protein did (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). In a GST pull-down assay, the molecular shift of PDE3B S318A was still detected by western blot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that phosphorylation of PDE3B by TBK1 on other sites still occurred, but were not crucial for 14-3-3\u03b2 binding."

Overexpression of WT PDE3B in cells reduced the attenuation of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production and phosphorylation of HSL produced by TNF\u03b1, whereas PDE3B S318A was ineffective (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). These data suggest that although IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 can phosphorylate PDE3B on several sites, serine 318 may be particularly important in the regulation of phosphodiesterase function by promoting the interaction between PDE3B and 14-3-3\u03b2.

Indeed, while numerous studies have demonstrated catecholamine resistance in obese adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jensen et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Reynisdottir et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bougneres et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jocken and Blaak, 2008</a>), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To test the functional importance of the noncanonical IKKs in maintaining energy balance <i>in vivo</i>, we investigated whether the administration of a selective inhibitor of IKK\u03b5 and TBK1, amlexanox, can reverse diet-induced catecholamine resistance in rodents. We fed mice a high fat or normal diet, treated them with amlexanox by oral gavage for 4 days (prior to the point when weight loss is seen), and then gave a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of the \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic agonist CL-316,243. Injection of CL-316,243 stimulated a threefold increase in serum FFA and glycerol levels in both vehicle and amlexanox-treated mice on normal diet (ND). The effect of CL-316,243 to increase serum FFAs was significantly attenuated in HFD-fed, vehicle-treated mice. However, HFD-fed mice treated with amlexanox responded like normal diet mice, despite the fact that they were weight matched with control HFD-fed mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The fold increase in serum glycerol levels was also significantly higher in amlexanox-treated HFD mice, as compared to vehicle-treated HFD-fed mice. In addition, <i>ex vivo </i>pretreatment of white adipose tissues from mice on a HFD with amlexanox enhanced glycerol release (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This effect was more pronounced in the inguinal fat depot, where amlexanox pretreatment increased phosphorylation of HSL, perilipin, and other proteins recognized by the PKA substrate motif antibody in response to CL-316,243 treatment compared to vehicle-pretreated tissues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Amlexanox also concurrently increased the phosphorylation of TBK1 at Ser172 due to the relief of feedback inhibition, as previously reported with other inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clark et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Reilly et al., 2013</a>)."

Obesity generates a state of low-grade inflammation in both humans and rodents, which involves activation of the NF\u03baB pathway (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wellen and Hotamisligil, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hotamisligil, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shoelson et al., 2007</a>). Upon its prolonged activation, NF\u03baB induces the expression of the noncanonical I\u03baB kinases IKK\u03b5 and TBK1. The induction of these kinases was blocked by administration of anti-inflammatory agents to mice without producing weight loss, suggesting that they are expressed in response to inflammation rather than obesity <i>per se</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reilly et al., 2013</a>). Deletion of the IKK\u03b5 gene rendered mice partially resistant to weight gain, insulin resistance, steatosis and the long-term inflammation produced by high fat diet (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2009</a>), and administration of the dual specificity IKK\u03b5/TBK1 inhibitor amlexanox to diet-induced obese or ob/ob mice produced even more profound effects (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reilly et al., 2013</a>). The blockade of these kinases in obese rodents with amlexanox results in increased phosphorylation of PKA substrates in adipose tissue, along with increased expression of Ucp1, and improved rates of lipolysis and fat oxidation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reilly et al., 2013</a>). Amlexanox was shown to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity of rat peritoneal mast cells via an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib41\">Makino et al., 1987</a>). Together these data indicate that IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 might exert their physiological effects in part by reducing the sensitivity of adipocytes to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation via changes in cAMP."

Although there are differences in expression of these kinases in other tissues (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shimada et al., 1999</a>), and perhaps differences in the upstream signals that lead to their regulation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wunderlich et al., 2008</a>), their relative roles in controlling this pathway remain uncertain. Additionally, the mechanism by which PDE3B is regulated remains uncertain. While phosphorylation correlates well with decreased levels of cAMP in cells, we have been unable to demonstrate increased catalytic activity of the enzyme due to phosphorylation by IKK\u03b5, TBK1 or the other kinases (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kitamura et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Palmer et al., 2007</a>) thought to regulate the phosphodiesterase.

Our data confirm previous findings that TNF\u03b1 and perhaps other inflammatory cytokines can promote lipolytic processes in cells after short-term treatment, but that after longer exposure elicit an inhibitory response that appears to be the result of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 induction. Thus, these kinases may be part of a \u2018counter-inflammatory\u2019 program that attenuates the extent to which inflammatory signals are effective, and also serves to conserve energy by repressing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation through activation of PDE3B. Interestingly, PDE3B is also a target of insulin action in adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Degerman et al., 2011</a>). Thus, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 appear to co-opt insulin targets to conserve energy during obesity. These insights further suggest that the noncanonical IKKs might be interesting new therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes."

Proteins were identified by searching data against human protein database (Uniprot, rel. 2010-9) using X!Tandem/TPP software suite. Oxidation of Met, carbamidomethylation of Cys and phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr were considered as potential modifications (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maine et al., 2010</a>)."

When comparing two groups, we performed Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test to determine statistical significance. When more than two groups and two factors were investigated, we first performed a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to establish that not all groups were equal. After a statistically significant ANOVA result, we performed between-group comparisons using the Tukey <i>post hoc</i> analysis for comparisons of all means and Sidak for comparisons of within factor main effect means. ANOVA and Tukey/Sidak tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6."

These studies build on their prior work demonstrating that obesity-induced inflammation enhances the expression of non-canonical IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 in adipocytes. Here, they present evidence that these kinases phosphorylate PDE3B, which subsequently leads to reduced cellular cAMP concentrations and a reduction of cAMP dependent pathways including lipolysis. The authors conclude that reduced energy expenditure in obesity may result from reduced sensitivity to sympathetic activation due to inflammation-generated signals in adipose tissue."

Although ?-adrenergic signaling and lipolysis are enhanced in white adipose tissue from IKK? knockout mice fed a high-fat diet, the body weights of IKK? knockout mice are reduced compared to WT mice. We realized that conclusions derived from these data are thus confusing and somewhat problematic. Because weight loss alone has the potential to improve catecholamine sensitivity in obese mice, it is impossible to determine from these data whether the differences were due to weight or direct IKK? effects. Furthermore, we now know that in addition to IKK\u03b5 TBK1 also plays an important role in the regulation of the lipolytic pathway."

Even when HSL is phosphorylated in vitro with recombinant PKA, the change in catalytic activity is relatively modest (up to about 50% increase in most studies (Krintel et al., <i>FEBS J</i>, 2009) and many others). The reason for this discrepancy is that in addition to its modest effect on catalytic activity, HSL (and perilipin) phosphorylation induces a translocation of the enzyme to the lipid droplet, where it can gain access to its substrate. This translocation effect relies on phosphorylation, and is probably the more important event in controlling activity in cells (Clifford et al., <i>JBC</i>, 2000, and many other papers). Because of this, HSL activity per se is rarely measured in vitro after cell lysis."

Firstly, the levels of protein achieved by overexpression of IKK? K38A are consistently less than those seen with the WT protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and 1C</a>), probably because the kinase inactive mutant is somewhat toxic to cells. In this regard, using more IKK\u03b5 K38A DNA in an attempt to reach similar levels of WT protein expression during electroporation was not successful, as the fat cells would not tolerate the transfection. We also tried to generate stable 3T3-L1 adipocytes by lentiviral transduction to resolve this problem, but achieved only 10% infection efficiency in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, again reflecting the toxicity produced by the dead kinase. Even though we were not able to achieve equal expression, we repeated our experiments to examine <i>Ucp1</i> gene expression in response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimuli in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing empty vector or IKK\u03b5, or IKK\u03b5 K38A by electroporation. Interestingly, as shown before in numerous experiments, overexpression of IKK\u03b5 K38A still produced a small reduction in the sensitivity of cells to \u03b2-adrenergic stimuli regarding <i>Ucp1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), glycerol release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) or cAMP signaling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) compared to when empty vector was overexpressed, despite the fact that levels of expression were lower than those seen with the WT kinase. We are not able to provide a conclusive explanation for this, but can point to one possibility. TBK1 decreases sensitivity to \u03b2-adrenergic stimuli, similar to the effect of IKK\u03b5 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>), and both endogenous TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 are present in IKK\u03b5 K38A expressing cells. Recent studies on crystal structure of TBK1 suggest that homo- and hetero-dimerization of both IKK? and TBK1 (Larabi et al., <i>Cell rep.</i>, 2013 and Tu et al., <i>Cell rep.</i>, 2013) could result in activation of the complex. Thus, dimerization of IKK\u03b5 K38A with an endogenous active kinase may produce increased activity of the complex. We have discussed this possibility in the revised paper."
