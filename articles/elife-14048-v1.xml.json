Here we identify the Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK, Wnd in <i>Drosophila</i>) as a critical target and effector of cAMP in injured axons. DLK/Wnd is thought to function as an injury \u2018sensor\u2019, as it becomes activated after axonal damage. Our findings in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian neurons indicate that the cAMP effector kinase PKA is a conserved and direct upstream activator of Wnd/DLK. PKA is required for the induction of Wnd signaling in injured axons, and DLK is essential for the regenerative effects of cAMP in mammalian DRG neurons. These findings link two important mediators of responses to axonal injury, DLK/Wnd and cAMP/PKA, into a unified and evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway for stimulating the regenerative potential of injured axons."

Here we identify the Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK, Wnd in <i>Drosophila</i>) as a critical target and effector of cAMP in injured axons. DLK/Wnd is thought to function as an injury \u2018sensor\u2019, as it becomes activated after axonal damage. Our findings in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian neurons indicate that the cAMP effector kinase PKA is a conserved and direct upstream activator of Wnd/DLK. PKA is required for the induction of Wnd signaling in injured axons, and DLK is essential for the regenerative effects of cAMP in mammalian DRG neurons. These findings link two important mediators of responses to axonal injury, DLK/Wnd and cAMP/PKA, into a unified and evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway for stimulating the regenerative potential of injured axons."

These findings reveal a unified pathway that is the key to unlocking the regenerative potential of injured nerve fibers, which has been conserved for hundreds of millions of years of evolution.

This failure is not only a reflection of the growth inhibitory nature of CNS tissue (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fawcett et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Filbin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Silver et al., 2015</a>), but also due to the lack of intrinsic capacity for neurons in the adult CNS to grow axons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sun and He, 2010</a>). However, landmark studies by Richardson and Issa have suggested that neurons indeed possess an innate ability to regenerate their axons in the adult mammalian CNS, and that this ability can be unlocked by a \u2018conditioning lesion\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Richardson and Issa, 1984</a>). In adult DRG neurons, an injury to peripherally projecting axons, i.e. a compression injury to the sciatic nerve, unleashes growth programs within the DRG and allows for regeneration of its centrally projecting axons in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib37\">Neumann and Woolf, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Richardson and Issa, 1984</a>). This growth can be induced by a lesion in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) even after the CNS lesion has occurred (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ylera et al., 2009</a>), hence it is of great interest from a therapeutic perspective to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow for the unlocking of such regenerative potential."

Since this second messenger is commonly modulated by growth signals and neuronal activity, cAMP modulation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic inroad to stimulate the regenerative potential of neurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xiao et al., 2015</a>). However, the downstream pathways that are engaged by this broadly utilized second messenger to actually promote axonal regeneration are not known. Much attention has focused upon the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), since constitutive activation of CREB is sufficient to stimulate axonal regeneration in the presence of CNS myelin <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gao et al., 2004</a>). However, more recent studies indicate that endogenous CREB is not required for cAMP elicited axonal regeneration <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ma et al., 2014</a>).

This conserved axonal mitogen activated kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) is thought to function as a sensor of axonal damage, and therefore should become activated upon conditioning injury. In support of this, Wnd/DLK is transported in axons (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>) and is required acutely in injured axons for the generation of signals that are retrogradely transported to the cell body (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shin et al., 2012</a>).

In addition, our functional studies in both <i>Drosophila</i> motoneurons and adult mammalian DRG neurons indicate that the ability of cAMP and PKA to promote axonal regeneration depends entirely upon the ability of PKA to activate the DLK/Wnd kinase. These findings present a unified and evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway, from cAMP to PKA to DLK, which plays a central role in stimulating the ability of injured axons to regenerate."

To study this axon regeneration pathway in <i>Drosophila</i>, we used previously developed axon injury assay in third instar larvae (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>), and found that knockdown of phosphodiesterase <i>dunce (dnc</i>) or activation of PKA by overexpression of the catalytic subunit (PKA<sup>CA</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 1995</a>) led to an enhanced growth response of <i>Drosophila</i> motoneuron axons after nerve crush injury (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The new axonal growth from the injured proximal stump generally assumes a highly branched shape, characterized by a network of small branches and a general thickening of the axon diameter. To assess the injury response, we quantified the total membrane volume within 100 \u00b5m of the axonal tip (indicated by the dash line in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In control animals, this total volume increases 3 fold, from 68.5 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> to 200 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> 15\u2009hr after injury. PKA activation led to a 1.5 fold increase in this volume compared to control (WT) axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The enhanced sprouting response stimulated by PKA was lost when DLK/Wnd function was inhibited by co-expression of RNAi targeting Wnd (but not a control RNAi) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). These observations are consistent with the previous finding in <i>C.elegans</i> that DLK is required for the regeneration that is induced by cAMP signaling (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010</a>). In addition, PKA alone is required for <i>Drosophila</i> motoneurons to initiate regenerative sprouting, as RNAi-mediated knockdown of the PKA catalytic subunit inhibited the sprouting response by 50% compared to control axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). cAMP and PKA therefore play an influential role in the regenerative capacity of <i>Drosophila</i> motoneuron axons."

To probe the relationship between PKA and Wnd, we first utilized previously established tools in <i>Drosophila</i> for monitoring the activation of Wnd and downstream nuclear signaling. Wnd signaling induces expression of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) phosphatase puckered (<i>puc</i>), which can be measured as lacZ expression using fly lines that contain the <i>puc</i>-lacZ enhancer trap reporter (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>). <i>Puc-</i>lacZ is expressed at low levels in uninjured motoneurons, however it is induced by axonal injury in a manner that requires both Wnd and JNK kinase function (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>).

JNK activation stimulates phosphorylation of DLK at sites outside of its activation loop (T43 and S533) and changes DLK\u2019s sensitivity to degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</a>). This increase in protein stability leads to an increase in total levels of DLK. Since PKA stimulates an increase in ectopically expressed DLK, it most likely increases protein stability. We therefore tested whether this increased stability involves the previously described JNK-dependent feedback mechanism. If this is the case, the effects of PKA and forskolin should depend on the function of JNK. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>, treatment with JNK inhibitor VIII led to a 30% decrease in total DLK level, as expected for JNK\u2019s previously demonstrated role in promoting DLK stability. However, even in the presence of JNK inhibitor, treatment with forskolin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or transfection with PKA<sup>CA</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) increases DLK level by 50%. Moreover, treatment with JNK inhibitor had very little effect upon the fraction of total DLK that is phosphorylated at S302 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>).

Depending upon the context, its activation can lead to either axonal regeneration or cell death and degeneration (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</a>). The factors that determine beneficial versus detrimental outcomes, along with the general cellular mechanisms that lead to the activation of DLK, are poorly understood. In this study, we found that an immediate upstream activator of DLK is the cAMP regulated kinase PKA. Elevation of cAMP signaling, which is activated by pro-regenerative manipulations such as a conditioning lesion, is the most widely known pathway for promoting axonal regeneration (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hannila and Filbin, 2008</a>). We found that an essential component of this regenerative pathway is the activation of Wnd/DLK by PKA. These findings delineate an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the activation of the Wnd/DLK kinase. Taken together with previous findings that Wnd/DLK is an essential regulator of responses induced by a conditioning injury (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shin et al, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Xiong and Collins 2012</a>), the activation of Wnd/DLK by PKA in injured axons presents a unified molecular pathway for activating a regenerative response to axonal damage."

A recent study has noted that in certain sensory neuron types in <i>C. elegans</i>, PKA <i>gain-of-function</i> mutations can induce axonal outgrowth even in <i>dlk</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2016</a>). Hence, multiple pathways for axonal regeneration may be inducible by PKA. However DLK is strongly required for cAMP stimulated regeneration in other neuron types in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010</a>), and, importantly, in axonal regeneration induced by a conditioning lesion in the mammalian PNS (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). Our findings now indicate that DLK is an important molecular target and effector of cAMP-induced regeneration in mammalian neurons."

The existence of a direct upstream activator of the kinase was not previously implied, and has thus far been unknown.

This mechanism may involve additional phosphorylation sites on DLK, and indeed, multiple PKA consensus sequences are observed in Wnd/DLK\u2019s sequence (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, it is also possible that PKA regulates DLK\u2019s stability via other mechanisms, such as previously described ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nakata et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2006</a>), palmitoylation modification (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holland et al., 2016</a>), changes in DLK\u2019s interacting proteins or subcellular localization. Such aspects of regulation could involve additional molecular targets of PKA, which would provide some potential for context specificity in DLK\u2019s regulation. While PKA has many cellular targets, its specificity can be highly regulated at a subcellular level by interactions with AKAP scaffolding proteins and local changes in cAMP (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tasken and Aandahl, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wong and Scott, 2004</a>).

Does PKA act locally in axons to stimulate DLK? Other studies have suggested that Wnd/DLK can regulate retrograde signaling pathways that originate in axons (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ghosh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Watkins et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Holland et al., 2016</a>).

Hiw/Rpm-1/Phr1 is previously known for its role in regulating synaptic arborization and growth via its regulation of Wnd/DLK (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nakata et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shin and DiAntonio, 2011</a>). The addition of cAMP and PKA into this regulatory pathway suggests a mechanism that may be broadly utilized to orchestrate structural changes within presynaptic terminals. We propose that the regulation of DLK by PKA may be generally important for neuronal plasticity as well as responses to axonal damage."

WT and DLK KO mice were age-sex matched. Neurons were prepared as previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frey et al., 2015</a>). Briefly, DRG were digested for 15 min at 37\u00b0C with 0.35 mg/mL liberase Blendzyme (Roche), 10\u00a0mg/mL bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 0.6 mg/mL DNase (Sigma) followed by another 15 min digest at 37\u00b0C with 0.05% trypsin. DRG were tritterated in culture media (DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 \u00b5g/mL penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin) to dissociated cells. Cells were plated on PDL (10 mg/mL) and laminin (10 mg/mL) coated plates. On day <i>in vitro</i> (DIV)1, half of the media was removed and fresh media containing AraC (Sigma, 10 nM final) was added. Drug treatment and replating were performed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frey et al., 2015</a>). On DIV4, DMSO or forskolin (30 \u00b5M) were added to cells. 24\u2009hr after drug application, drugs were washed out with DMEM. Neurons were lightly trypsinized with 0.025% trypsin for 5 min in the incubator (37\u00b0C, 5%CO<sub>2</sub>). Trypsin was removed and fresh culture media was added to the cells which were then gently pipetted and transferred to culture slides. 18\u2009hr after replating, neurons were fixed (4% PFA) and stained for \u03b2III-tubulin (Covance, mouse anti-Tuj1, 1:500). At least 100 neurons were imaged per group using either Leica DFC310 FX or DFC7000T color fluorescence cameras and longest neurite was traced using NeuronJ plugin for ImageJ. For replating experiments with PKA inhibitor (H-89, 5 \u00b5M), vehicle or inhibitor were added at the same time as DMSO and forskolin."

DLK (known as Wnd in <i>Drosophila</i>) has previously been implicated in invertebrate and mammalian systems to be essential for neuronal axon regeneration. DLK is enriched in axons after axonal injury, and DLK is required for injury-induced axonal regeneration in neurons of mammals, flies and worms. However, the specific mechanism by which DLK is activated is currently unknown, but multiple signaling pathways are likely to activate axonal regeneration. The authors focus on the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which stimulates axonal elaboration in multiple models systems of axon growth/regeneration. Based on an evolutionarily conserved PKA phosphorylation site residing in the kinase domain of DLK, the authors hypothesized that DLK phosphorylation lies downstream of the cAMP-PKA pathway to modulate DLK-dependent axonal regeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, the authors demonstrate that DLK is subject to direct PKA phosphorylation at the proposed PKA phosphorylation site (S302). Additionally, the authors demonstrate in HEK293 mammalian cultured cells that DLK phosphorylation is enhanced (phospho-specific DLK antibody) when the PKA signaling pathway is activated either pharmacologically or by expression of constitutively activated PKA. The authors correlate DLK phosphorylation with enhanced DLK abundance in HEK293 cells and implicate a previously described JNK feedback pathway that affects DLK ubiquitination and degradation. These observations are consistent with their well-executed in vivo experiments demonstrating #1) a genetic interaction in <i>Drosophila</i> between PKA and Wnd in mediating axonal regeneration after injury, #2) enhanced levels of Wnd protein and activity after axonal injury or genetically activating the PKA pathway, and #3) failure to rescue axonal regeneration by expressing the phosphorylation incapable Wnd S302A in the <i>wnd</i> mutant compared to WT controls."

The authors nicely correlate DLK 302 phosphorylation with DLK abundance in transfected HEK293 cells. Huntwork-Rodriguez, in a prior study, reported that S302 of DLK is required for DLK protein stability (Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013). That is, DLK downstream activation of the JNK pathway was proposed to result in a feedback loop in which JNK\u2192DLK phosphorylation results in increased DLK abundance by reducing DLK degradation. There, the DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutant exhibited decreased overall DLK abundance by enhancing DLK degradation.
