It has been proposed that proteins utilize disordered regions in the adaptive recognition of their various binding partners. However apart from a few exceptions, defining the importance of disorder in promiscuous binding interactions has proven to be difficult. In this paper, we have utilized a genetic selection that links protein stability to antibiotic resistance to isolate variants of the newly discovered chaperone Spy that show an up to 7 fold improved chaperone activity against a variety of substrates. These \u201cSuper Spy\u201d variants show tighter binding to client proteins and are generally more unstable than is wild type Spy and show increases in apparent flexibility. We establish a good relationship between the degree of their instability and the improvement they show in their chaperone activity. Our results provide evidence for the importance of disorder and flexibility in chaperone function."

It has been proposed that proteins utilize disordered regions in the adaptive recognition of their various binding partners. However apart from a few exceptions, defining the importance of disorder in promiscuous binding interactions has proven to be difficult. In this paper, we have utilized a genetic selection that links protein stability to antibiotic resistance to isolate variants of the newly discovered chaperone Spy that show an up to 7 fold improved chaperone activity against a variety of substrates. These \u201cSuper Spy\u201d variants show tighter binding to client proteins and are generally more unstable than is wild type Spy and show increases in apparent flexibility. We establish a good relationship between the degree of their instability and the improvement they show in their chaperone activity. Our results provide evidence for the importance of disorder and flexibility in chaperone function."

Additional proteins called chaperones often help with this folding process, and it has been proposed that chaperones must be particularly flexible in order to cope with the changes in the shape of the different proteins being folded. However, studying this hypothesis directly has proven to be difficult."

This assay identified several variants of Spy that could stabilise an unstable test protein even more effectively than the wild-type Spy can.

We reasoned that we might gain insight into this long-standing problem by isolating and characterizing chaperone variants that exhibit improved chaperone activity. A genetic selection that we had developed previously gave us a unique opportunity to pursue these aims. This selection uses a folding biosensor to directly link protein stability to antibiotic resistance. The biosensor consists of an unstable protein inserted into \u03b2-lactamase, a selectable marker that encodes penicillin resistance (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foit et al., 2009</a>). Stabilization of the unstable protein results in higher levels of antibiotic resistance. We showed that the stabilization could be due to mutations within the unstable protein itself (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foit et al., 2009</a>), addition of chemical chaperones to the growth media (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hailu et al., 2013</a>), or host variants that stabilize the unstable protein (<a href=\"#bib35\">Quan et al., 2011</a>)."

We found that this stabilization occurs through the induction of a previously uncharacterized chaperone called Spy (<a href=\"#bib35\">Quan et al., 2011</a>). We obtained evidence that Spy acts in an ATP-independent manner to help protect bacterial cells from a number of conditions that lead to widespread protein denaturation and aggregation, such as treatment with tannin, ethanol, or butanol (<a href=\"#bib35\">Quan et al., 2011</a>). The crystal structure of Spy shows that it forms an unusual cradle shaped dimer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Quan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kwon et al., 2010</a>). When we attached environmentally sensitive probes to various sites in Spy, including the concave and convex surfaces, nearly all showed substantial changes in fluorescence upon interaction with the client protein casein. These results suggest that client binding may occur over large regions of Spy, that Spy might undergo significant conformational changes upon client binding, or a combination of both (<a href=\"#bib35\">Quan et al., 2011</a>)."

We have now isolated Spy variants with improved ability to stabilize a poorly folded client protein (Im7 L53A I54A) in vivo. These variants also showed improved ability to prevent the aggregation of client proteins in vitro. Many of these Spy variants contain residue substitutions that act to expand a hydrophobic region present on the protein\u2019s concave surface.

Analysis of the reasons behind the improved chaperone ability of activity enhancing mutants of Spy should inform us about Spy\u2019s catalytic mechanism and perhaps also tell us what makes for a good chaperone. We reasoned that activity-enhancing mutations would be more informative in general than those that decreased function, in part because there are a wider variety of uninteresting reasons that mutations can disrupt function such as those causing chain termination. If we succeeded at all in getting activity enhancing mutations we anticipated obtaining two types of mutations. We might obtain those that acted in a substrate specific manner that improved the action of Spy only against the substrate for which they were selected on, and variants that generally improved the activity of Spy against multiple substrates. If we succeeded in obtaining this latter type of mutations, they should be particularly informative as to what makes a protein an effective chaperone. To obtain activity-enhanced Spy variants, we used an error-prone PCR-based approach (<a href=\"#bib29\">McCullum et al., 2010</a>) that targeted the mature protein encoding region of the <i>spy</i> gene on pCDFTrc-Spy to create a plasmid library of \u223c10<sup>6</sup> members that contained an average of 1.2 nucleotide mutations per <i>spy</i> gene. This variant library was transformed into SQ2041, a <i>spy</i> null strain of <i>E. coli</i> that contains the stability biosensor (see strain list in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We plated the mutant library onto LB plates that contained 0.1 mM IPTG (to induce Spy) and 4 mg/ml penicillin, the concentration at which a strain co-expressing wild-type Spy and the biosensor (strain SQ2068) fails to grow. Using this selection approach, we isolated 65 Spy variants that, when co-expressed with the biosensor, showed improved antibiotic resistance compared to cells that co-express wild-type Spy."

                                "text": "To test whether the Spy variants\u2019 increased chaperone activity was general or client specific, we purified the variant proteins and tested their chaperone activity in vitro using two standard chaperone clients: reduced denatured \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-LA) and chemically denatured aldolase. In genetic selections one usually gets what you select for, thus we had anticipated that the variants we obtained would show an improved ability to refold Im7. These mutations, would at a minimum, likely to be informative about the factors involved in Spy-Im7 interactions. We however considered it unlikely that they would show generally improved chaperone activity for at least two reasons. First, in a wide variety of laboratory evolution experiments where variant enzymes are selected that show improved activity against one substrate, often though not always show decreased activity against other unrelated substrates (<a href=\"#bib16\">Goldsmith et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). More specifically, other efforts at improving chaperone activity, though showing some success in generating mutants that were better with the substrates they were selected on, in general showed decreased chaperone activity against other substrates (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aponte et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schweizer et al., 2011</a>). For instance Wang et al, through the use of a multistep screening process, succeeded in isolating GroEL variants that enhanced the expression of GFP and circularly permuted versions of GFP 3-8-fold, presumably by enhancing folding of GFP in vivo. However these variants were defective in all other measures of GroEL function tested including ability to support bacterial growth at high temperature, in vivo folding of the GroEL substrate HrcA, and phage lambda and Mu growth (whose growth dependency on GroEL and GroES historically led to the naming of the GroE genes [<a href=\"#bib15\">Georgopoulos et al., 1972</a>]). These GroEL variants in vitro were also no better than wild type GroEL in enhancing the yield of active GFP. The authors concluded that increased GFP folding of these variants \u2018comes at the expense of the ability of GroEL/S to fold its natural substrates\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2002</a>). The majority of the DnaK variants Aponte et al isolated based on an improved ability to fold an unstable variant of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in vivo turned out to be inferior to wild type DnaK in refolding luciferase in vitro, though it needs to be mentioned that they did succeed in isolating four variants that showed a slightly improved in vitro refolding yield for luciferase ranging from 1.2 to 1.9-fold (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aponte et al., 2010</a>). Given the apparent difficulty in isolating chaperone or enzyme variants that show generally enhanced activity against a variety of substrates, we were surprised that all 7 Spy variants that we had isolated based on their ability to fold Im7 in vivo were significantly more active in preventing aggregation of both chemically denatured \u03b1-lactalbumin and aldolase in in vitro assays. In the aldolase aggregation assay, they were 1.3\u20136.9-fold more active than wild type, and in the \u03b1-lactalbumin aggregation assay, they were 1.6\u20132.4-fold more active (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We also tested for the activity of these chaperone variants in their ability to facilitate aldolase refolding. Six of the seven of the variants were found to be more active than is wild type Spy in the range of 1.9\u20134.9-fold. The one exception, Q25R, was measured to marginally increase refolding yield (1.4-fold) (See <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Because our Spy variants showed improved chaperone activity towards at least three client proteins (Im7, aldolase and \u03b1-lactalbumin), we called them \u2018super-Spy\u2019 variants."

The most commonly observed substitutions (Q100L, which occurred in 74% of the variants, and H96L and the Q49L, which occurred in \u223c5% and \u223c3% of the variants, respectively) change polar or charged residues (glutamine and histidine) into the hydrophobic amino acid leucine, thereby increasing the area of the hydrophobic region."

Simple expansion of peptide-binding hydrophobic regions on our Spy variants could thus be one straightforward way to explain their improved chaperone activity. There are some expectations of this simple model:(1) chaperone variants with a larger or stronger hydrophobic patch will have enhanced affinity for client proteins, and (2) client proteins are likely to interact with regions on the 3D structure of the chaperone that are adjacent to the sites mutated in our selected Spy variants. Alternatively, the Spy mutations could increase chaperone efficacy in other less direct ways. For example, they could map to sites distant from the active site of the chaperone and exert their beneficial action through allosteric effects. To help distinguish between these possible models and to better understand how Spy interacts with its clients, we decided to map the site(s) with which Spy binds the client protein Im7. To achieve this, we:(1) examined the effects of Im7 binding on hydrogen-deuterium exchange in Spy, (2) investigated the proteolytic sensitivity of the chaperone in the presence and absence of Im7, and (3) crosslinked Spy to its client."

To ascertain the effects of client protein binding on deuterium exchange, we compared the level of hydrogen-deuterium exchange of free Spy with that of a Spy-Im7 complex using a mass spectrometry approach. We incubated Spy with a 40-amino acid peptide derived from Im7 L53A I54A (residues 7\u201345), which binds Spy with a 2.6 \u00b5M KD (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details of peptide generation and selection). Using 10s exchange times, we obtained evidence that \u223c10 Spy amides become more protected upon Spy-Im7 complex formation compared to free Spy (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Substantial changes in protection were mapped to the residues located in N- and C-terminal regions of Spy (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We were able to localize the improved Spy protection in the presence of client to several specific residues: T5, H16, A37, Q114, F115, F119, and E125. The protection includes not only the flexible N and C termini (residues 1\u201328 and 125\u2013138), which are not present in the crystal structure, but extends into the \u03b11 and \u03b14 helices as well (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Increased protection from hydrogen-deuterium exchange in these regions could possibly indicate involvement of these Spy residues in the interaction with Im7 or could imply the folding of these flexible regions upon client binding, or a combination of both."

Protein samples were incubated with trypsin at a constant 100:1 mass ratio (protein: protease). At various times, aliquots were withdrawn, quenched, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The residue numbers of trypsin-cleavable sites are shown along with their location in Spy's secondary structure (indicated by the cartoon). The bars indicate the time at which cleavage at that residue took place. A missing bar indicates that cleavage was not seen within the 8-min time frame. The unstructured termini are more accessible to trypsin in general, and many sites show apparent increased digestion in the presence of client compared to Spy alone. The interpretation of increased cleavage of these sites is not straightforward. The increased digestion might reflect some real structural rearrangement in Spy upon client binding so that these residues are more exposed to trypsin. Alternatively, they may not be involved in substrate binding and their increased digestion might be an artifact due to a higher total mass of trypsin, which was used to accommodate the addition of client. We were not able to distinguish these two possibilities. On the other hand, the sites showed decreased cleavage despite an increased amount of trypsin are more easily interpreted. Decreased cleavage suggests that they are protected, either by the substrate protein, or by other regions in Spy, which further implies a conformational change upon substrate binding. Cleavage at residues 61, 84, 102, 113, and 122 (circled) is significantly delayed when the client Im7 L53A I54A is present. We conclude that R61, K84, K102, K113, and R122 are sites but not necessarily the only sites affected by the binding events."

Proteolytic sites in Spy that show altered trypsin susceptibility may either be directly involved in Im7 binding or be near the Im7 binding site. Note that it is also possible that Im7 binding induces a significant conformational change or change in flexibility in Spy that alters the trypsin susceptibility of certain residues. In the absence of Im7, the flexible N terminus and to a lesser extent the flexible C terminus of Spy are more accessible to trypsin than the structured regions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the presence of Im7, a number of sites including R61, K84, K102, K113, and R122 show significant protection compared to free Spy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Notably, changes in trypsin susceptibility occur on both the inside and outside of the cradle due to the thinness of the Spy molecule. These susceptibility changes suggest that either client binding occurs over large portions of Spy or that client binding involves major conformational changes or changes in flexibility, or a combination of these factors. Combining these observations with the deuterium exchange results suggests that Im7 peptide binding affects a relative large area on the Spy surface, especially the rim regions (\u03b14 helix and the N-terminus of the \u03b12\u2019 helix) and the tips (N-terminus of the \u03b11 helix, C-terminus of the \u03b13 helix, and the N-terminus of the \u03b14 helix) of the Spy cradle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Using these zero-length reagents, we were able to confidently detect and identify additional short distance Spy-Im7 crosslinks between Y104 of Spy and Y10 of Im7, and between K39 of Spy and E12 of Im7 (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Notably, nearly all crosslinks identified in all four crosslinking reactions occurred on the concave side of Spy, with a few occurring on the rim of the cradle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Essentially no crosslinks were obtained on the convex side of Spy despite the abundance of lysines on the convex side (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), providing evidence that peptide binding occurs on the interior concave surface of the Spy homodimer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

Note that the distance constraints we obtained from the crosslinking study were NOT applied during the docking and refinement process. However, of the top 10 models with the lowest energy scores, six fit the zero length crosslinker data (i.e., the critical constraints for the two pairs of residues that crosslinked with the zero length crosslinkers: Spy Y104 and Im7 Y10, Spy K39 and Im7 E12), with atomic contact distances ranging between 2.5 and 6.5 \u00c5. These models are very similar with average pair-wise RMSDs of about 2 \u00c5. Thus, the docking analysis provides evidence that the crosslinking experiments were sampling an energetically plausible complex. For further analysis, we selected the model with the smallest atomic contact distance for these two pairs of residues found to interact by zero-length crosslinkers."

Given that this model is strongly constrained by only two pairs of residues that were found to interact using the zero-length crosslinkers, it is best regarded as a very tentative and theoretical model. Never-the-less it is consistent with our experimental data and helps in our interpretation of it. The contacts predicted between Im7 and Spy in this tentative model are moderately extensive, burying a surface of \u223c1502 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, which is consistent with medium binding affinity (KD = 2.6 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>).

The distance between Im7 Y10 and Spy Y104 is 4.5 \u00c5 in this model, consistent with the close distance constraint that was defined by the zero-length crosslinking via PICUP. Similarly, Im7 Glu12 and Spy Lys39 form a direct salt bridge, consistent with their interaction via the zero-length crosslinker EDC. This model also helps explain the effects of at least some of our beneficial Spy mutations. Polar-to-apolar Spy mutations (Q49L, H96L, Q100L) may enhance the hydrophobic interaction that Spy has with Im7 through the interaction with Y10, F15, and I44 of Im7 by expanding and partially fusing the hydrophobic patches P1 and P2 on Spy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 4</a>)."

Biotinylated Im7 L53A I54A was immobilized on the streptavidin coated sensor tip. Binding of Spy to Im7 alters the thickness of the molecular layer on the tip surface, which triggers a change in the spectrum signal (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdiche et al., 2008</a>). Thus, we can monitor the binding in real time to measure the association and dissociation rates of the two proteins. In order to get accurate k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> rates we found it is vital to use a substrate that is soluble and not bound to the tip as an aggregate. Unfortunately, most chaperone substrates such as aldolase rapidly aggregate when placed under conditions where they are chaperone substrates (i.e., at least partially unfolded) making it very difficult to accurately determine k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> rates. Im7 L53A I54A has the very fortunate properties of being not only a clear in vivo substrate of Spy (indeed Spy was discovered by the ability it has to enhance the yield of folded Im7 L53A I54A) but also soluble in solution. This nicely behaved, soluble chaperone substrate bound to the tips in a reproducible manner and allowed us to determine the k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> rates for the chaperone. All of the Spy variants we tested showed smaller values for both k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> compared to wild-type Spy (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), suggesting that they both bind and release clients more slowly. Overall, the decreases in the k<sub>off</sub> rates are more dramatic than the decreases in the k<sub>on</sub> rates (for instance, Q100L shows a \u223cthree-fold decrease in k<sub>on</sub> and a \u223c16-fold decrease in k<sub>off</sub>). As a result, all selected Spy variants except F115I show a significantly increased apparent affinity for Im7 L53A I54A, up to 5.8 -fold. Note that Q100L, the mutation present in 74% of the variants that answered our selection, has the largest effect on both k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> of any of the variants tested. It is thus a good possibility that the increase in the ability of at least some of our Spy variants to stabilize Im7 in vivo is at least in part due to their increased affinity for Im7."

This unusually thin nature of Spy is presumably under genetic selection and of functional significance. It also may allow for conformational changes during Spy\u2019s chaperone cycle. Consistent with this hypothesis, major changes in the fluorescence of environmentally sensitive probes attached to various locations in Spy were observed to occur upon client protein binding (<a href=\"#bib35\">Quan et al., 2011</a>). One possibility is that our mutations act to alter the flexibility and stability of Spy and, in so doing, alter its chaperone activity."

Our super-Spy variants demonstrate tighter client binding, and we observe a correlation between the in vitro dissociation constants of these variants to the client protein Im7 L53A I54A and their ability to stabilize Im7 L53A I54A in vivo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This implies that Spy\u2019s binding affinity for Im7 L53A I54A is important in determining its chaperone activity. Tighter binding could act to decrease the steady state concentration of presumably aggregation-prone or protease sensitive Im7 folding intermediates, thus increasing the Im7 level in the cell. Variants of Spy that increased the affinity of clients beyond a certain point may not be obtained by our in vivo selection because they would be expected to fail to release their clients in a timely fashion. Further increases in affinity are expected to be counterproductive. For aldolase aggregation inhibition Q25R, for instance, is the most effective, but it is only very marginally better than wild type Spy in refolding aldolase, perhaps partly because it fails to release aldolase at an optimal rate. Client and variant specific changes in affinity may explain why there appears to be no good relationship between the activity that one specific variant shows with the various specific client proteins tested."

A previous attempt to evolve the chaperone GroEL for instance, succeeded in generating highly client specific variants that were defective in the folding of other clients (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2002</a>).

In addition to increasing binding site hydrophobicity, most of our super-Spy variants decrease Spy\u2019s thermodynamic stability and increase the level of disorder that Spy shows in the absence of client proteins. Two of the Spy variants, L32P and F115L, show no protected amide protons whatsoever in the absence of the client, implying extreme levels of flexibility prior to client binding. These data suggest that Spy flexibility is important for chaperone function, presumably by facilitating client binding. The six long coiled-coil tentacles in the jellyfish-like chaperone prefoldin, for instance, are flexible, enabling it to adjust its central cavity and capture various client proteins (<a href=\"#bib40\">Siegert et al., 2000</a>). Many other chaperones including GroEL, DnaK, and the small HSPs contain regions of disorder, which have been proposed to aid in client recognition and chaperone function, although the exact roles of these disordered regions are unclear (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib5\">Bardwell and Jakob (2012)</a>). There are a number of chaperones that are conditionally disordered and that are active as a chaperone in the disordered state. These include HdeA, a chaperone that is activated on the protein level by acidic pH, and Hsp33, a chaperone that is activated by oxidation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bardwell and Jakob, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Foit et al., 2013</a>). Disorder is also an emerging theme, not only among chaperones but among many hub proteins, which are capable of binding to multiple unrelated targets (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bardwell and Jakob, 2012</a>). It has been proposed that proteins utilize these disordered regions in the adaptive recognition of their various binding partners (<a href=\"#bib30\">Oldfield et al., 2008</a>); yet, apart from a few exceptions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brzovic et al., 2011</a>), defining the precise roles that disorder plays in these promiscuous binding proteins has proved to be difficult."

If the only requirement is to increase the hydrophobicity of the P1 and P2 region, one might also expect a larger variety of mutants to have answered the genetic selection. The very narrow range of substitutions that answers our selection with 74% of our variants containing the Q100L substitution strongly suggests that these variants may be having more specific effects beyond their effects on surface hydrophobicity and flexibility. Several of the substitutions do not appear to result in a substantial gain in surface hydrophobicity. One alteration, F115L/or I, replaces one hydrophobic residue with another, and two of the substitutions, Q25R and L32P, apparently result in a decrease in hydrophobicity, though not specifically for the patches P1 and P2. Despite these exceptions, it is striking that the majority of the variants isolated do exhibit changes in flexibility and surface hydrophobicity, which goes at least part way toward explaining their \u2018super-Spy\u2019 activity."

Inspection of an alignment of Spy homologues (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) shows that although evolution has, for some of the residues commonly made the exact same substitutions as have emerged from our selection, and in other cases it has found very similar answers. The F115L substitution is very commonly found in Spy homologue, as is Q49L. The precise substitution that we found, H96L has not been observed in the sequences we compared, but remarkably, the chemically very similar residue M is actually the most common residue found at position 96. Evolution generally acts to optimize rather than maximize protein activity. One can imagine that some organisms require more or less Spy activity. The optimal level of Spy activity selected for in <i>E. coli</i> is apparently less than seems to be required in other organisms. That other organisms have independently obtained the same \u2018Super Spy\u2019 substitutions that we found is testimony of the power of our selection for in vivo stability."

Each reaction contains 50 \u00b5M of \u03b1-lactalbumin, 0-100 \u00b5M of Spy, and 20 mM DTT in a buffer composed of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.0. 100 \u00b5l of each reaction solution was incubated in an acrylic UV transparent flat-bottom 96-microwell plate (Corning, Corning, NY) sealed with a transparent film (Denville Scientific, Inc. South Plainfield, NJ). The light scattering light due to the aggregation of reduced \u03b1-lactalbumin was monitored at 360 nm using a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT) with readings taken every 15 min for 10 hr at 25\u00b0C following an initial period of medium speed shaking for 30 s before each reading. Spy variants were added to the aggregation reaction at three concentrations: 5, 7.5, and 10 \u00b5M to make the final Spy: \u03b1-lactalbumin ratios equal to 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2, respectively. Light scattering data at four endpoints (300, 400, 500, and 600 S) were used to calculate the relative activities of different Spy variants based on standard curves generated with 22 different Spy: \u03b1-lactalbumin ratios. The average of the 12 relative activity values (three concentrations each calculated according to four standard curves) of each mutant was then calculated and standard errors (from the calculation for average) are given. Typical aggregation curves and standard curves can be found in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. Quantification was carried out as follows: to measure the relative activity of Spy variants on \u03b1\u2013LA, each Spy variants were used at three ratios in duplicate (Spy: \u03b1\u2013LA ratios = 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) in the aggregation assay. The standard curve was smooth and could have been usable over a broad range. These specific ratios were chosen because they A) fell in a steep portion of the standard curve so that the light scattering signal is the most sensitive to the amount of Spy added and because B) the Spy concentrations at these ratios were high enough to enable pipetting high enough volumes to minimize pipetting errors. The portion of the standard curve we used is indicated by the red box in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. Light scattering endpoints at 300, 400, 500, and 600 S were taking from each aggregation curve and then back-calculated according to the standard curve at the respective time point to get the effective ratio of Spy: \u03b1\u2013LA (or, ratio equivalent to Spy WT: \u03b1\u2013LA). The activity of Spy variants relative to wild type is then calculated from dividing these effective ratios by the adding ratios. For example, Q100L added at a Spy: \u03b1\u2013LA ratio of 0.2 had a light scattering reading of 0.009 arbitrary units (a.u.) after 400 S of the reaction. According to the standard curve at 400 S, this is equivalent to wild type Spy added at a Spy:\u03b1\u2013LA ratio of 0.383. Therefore, Q100L has the activity 1.82-fold of wild type based on the calculation from the 400 S standard curve. This calculation is then repeated using the other three standard curves and other light scattering endpoint values taken from the aggregation curves of the same variant added at different Spy:\u03b1\u2013LA ratios. This strategy allowed us to generate 12 relative activity values (in duplicate) of the same variant, which are then averaged to give the final value. The standard errors we reported reflect the average of these 24 activity measurements. To validate our calculations, we performed the aggregation assay with wild type Spy in exactly the same way as we used for the Spy variants. This gave us a value of 1.06 \u00b1 0.09 fold activity relative to wild type Spy, suggesting that our approach to compare the activities of the Spy variants to wild type is precise and reproducible."

We found that pipetting the aldolase into the cuvette at the same position relative to the stirring bar made for a very reproducible assay. Thus, long gel loading tips (83 mm, MultiFlex Pipet Tips from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were used to pipette denatured aldolase into the cuvette through the small sample injection hole on the top of the lid of the PTI photomultiplier Spectrofluorimeter, so that for each injection the end of the tip lay just above the stirring bar. We used different ratios of wild Spy: aldolase to establish a standard curve. For most of the Spy variants we used a ratio of Spy: aldolase of 0.3 because this lies in the middle of the standard curve. Our most active variant Q25R, completely suppressed aldolase aggregation at this ratio so it was in addition further diluted and measured at a Spy: aldolase ratio of 0.1. The aggregation rates were measured by calculating the slopes of the aggregation curves (fitting the data points between 50 s and 600 s of the aggregation reaction).

To measure the specific in vivo activity of these Spy variants, we then normalized the maximal MIC values of each strain to the levels of Spy expressed in these variants to compensate for possible differences in Spy expression. The maximal MIC values were achieved at 0.5 mM IPTG induction for all the variants except for Q49L and WT which reached a maximal MIC starting at 0.2 mM. The steady-state protein levels of each Spy variant expressed at various IPTG concentrations were measured using quantitative western blots as described above. The in vivo specific activity was obtained by calculating the ratio between the maximal MICs obtained for the variant divided by the MIC obtained for wild-type Spy when it was expressed to the same level as the variant. These values are reported as normalized MIC values (MIC<sub>norm</sub>) and are a measure of the in vivo specific activity of the Spy variants."

                                "text": "Hydrogen-deuterium exchange of Spy and Spy-Im7 complex was performed using top-down ECD-FTICR-MS, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pan et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Serpa et al., 2013</a>). This approach relies on the rapid scrambling-free fragmentation of the intact protein by electron capture dissociation (ECD). The deuteration level of each amino acid residue then can be deduced from the c- and z-ion series produced. Briefly, Spy and Im7 protein stock solutions (250-1000 \u00b5M) in 40 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 were diluted with 10 mM ammonium acetate to 25 \u00b5M final Spy (dimer) and 100 \u00b5M Im7. Spy-Im7 complex was preformed in a 1:4 molar ratio of Spy dimer to Im7. Spy or Spy-Im7 samples were continuously mixed from separate syringes with D<sub>2</sub>O in a 1:4 ratio (80% D<sub>2</sub>O final) via a three-way tee, which was connected to a 100 \u00b5m \u00d7 21 cm capillary, providing a labeling time of 10 s. The outflow from this capillary was mixed with a quenching solution containing 0.4% formic acid in 80% D<sub>2</sub>O from a third syringe via a second three-way tee, and injected into a Bruker 12 T Apex-Qe hybrid Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA), equipped with an Apollo II electrospray source. In this analytical format, lower deuteration levels would reflect more protection of the amide protons and formation of hydrogen bonding due to residues involvement in secondary structure elements, interaction, or shielding from the solvent. In-cell ECD fragmentation experiments were performed with an m/z 900-1200 precursor selection range using a cathode filament current of 1.2 A and a grid potential of 12 V as previously described (<a href=\"#bib39\">Serpa et al., 2013</a>). Approximately 1200 scans were accumulated over the m/z range 250\u20132600, corresponding to an acquisition time of approximately 30 min for each ECD spectrum. Deuteration levels of the amino acid residues\u2019 amide groups were determined from centroid masses of the c- and z-ion series. The analysis of the deuteration status of c- and z-ion fragment series thus allowed us to localize the residues that exhibited major differences in the protection between free Spy and Spy that is occupied by its client protein Im7."

The crosslinked proteins were digested with trypsin and proteinase K and crosslinked peptides were affinity purified with immobilized avidin, then identified by LC-MALDI MS and MS/MS. Zero-length crosslinking brings additional challenges to the mass spectrometric analysis of the crosslinks as the crosslinked peptides formed do not acquire a specific isotopic signature. To facilitate detection and identification of the Spy-Im7 zero-length crosslinks, we applied a variation of the method using <sup>15</sup>N metabolically-labeled oligomeric proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Taverner et al., 2002</a>). We used an equimolar mixture of non-labeled and <sup>15</sup>N metabolically-labeled Im7 for crosslinking the Spy-Im7 complex. Following digestion of the crosslinked complex, every Im7 peptide and, most notably, inter-protein Spy-Im7 crosslinks were represented by a pair of light and heavy isotopic forms, derived from non-labeled and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Im7 peptides, respectively. Mass difference between such pairs is then determined by the number of the nitrogen atoms in the Im7 peptides. We have implemented this principle, as an additional selection criterion, into the algorithm for the automatic detection and identification of the inter-protein crosslinks in heteromeric protein complexes.

After quenching the digestion reaction, the peptide mixture was mixed with the N-terminal strep-tagged Spy and applied to a strep-tactin sepharose column (IBA, Germany). The complex was eluted by 2.5 mM desthiobiotin, separated by a reverse phase C18 column (Zorbax 300SB-C18, 1 \u00d7 50 mm, 3.5 \u00b5) at room temperature, and then applied to a Q-TOF dual ESI LC/MS (Agilent) for identification. We obtained fragments 5\u201343, 5\u201370, 5\u201373 and 5\u201376 from Im7 L53A I54A. The shortest fragment (5\u201343) constitutes most of the \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices in Im7. We then screened a few constructs containing extension or deletion at the N or C termini with amino acid sequences derived from the Im7 protein to identify the most stably expressed fragment in vivo. We purified three peptides with the highest expression levels (3\u201345, 7\u201345, and 12\u201345) and characterized their interactions with Spy by isothermal titration calorimetry. Based on their affinities to Spy (K<sub>d</sub> = 2.5, 2.3, 2.6, and 8 \u00b5M for the full length Im7 L53A I54A, 3\u201345, 7\u201345, and 12\u201345 peptide, respectively) and their expression levels, we chose the 7\u201345 fragment as the minimal length peptide that represents the interaction between Spy and Im7 L53A I54A."

Spy variants were diluted to 6.5 \u03bcM in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (degassed), pH7.5 and were denatured at a heating rate of 2\u00b0C/min from 10\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C in a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette. The circular dichroism signal was monitored by a JASCO J-810 CD spectrometer (JASCO inc., Easton, MD) equipped with a Peltier thermoelectric controller. Samples were quickly cooled down to 10\u00b0C at the end of the denaturation reaction and each spectrum after renaturation was compared with the original spectrum at 10\u00b0C to check the reversibility of the denaturation reactions. All the Spy variants after renaturation gained at least 95% of the initial CD signal, indicating that the denaturation process is reversible for all the variants under the conditions we have used. Data analysis was performed in Sigmaplot according to equation II as described in the supplemental materials in (<a href=\"#bib18\">Greenfield, 2006</a>) to obtain the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) and the enthalpy change (\u0394H<sub>m</sub>) of each denaturation reaction at pH7.5. Each thermal denaturation measurement was performed three times to get the average values of \u0394H<sub>m</sub> and T<sub>m</sub> and the standard errors (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). To find the heat capacity change (\u0394Cp) when the protein unfolds we obtained Tm and \u0394H<sub>m</sub> as a function of pH by measuring the denaturation curves at a wide range of pH from 2.0 to 10.0 in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer. We then plotted the \u0394H<sub>m</sub> against Tm to yield \u0394Cp (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), which is the slope. Finally, the unfolding free energy change \u0394G<sub>NU</sub> at 25\u00b0C is calculated using the modified Gibbs-Helmholtz equation according to <a href=\"#bib19\">Grimsley et al., (2013)</a>:"

Intriguingly, this seems not the case for Spy. Here, the authors even show that increasing affinity is even linearly associated with further increase client affinity. Would one not expect a bell-shaped curve here? I.e., for mutants with the highest affinity, client off rates should be so low that, whilst aggregation prevention may still be high, client release would be so low that efficient client folding would no longer occur. In fact, it would be highly informative to also add data on protein refolding activity of these mutants. It would be appreciated if the authors could elaborate on this to some extent in their Discussion."

For example, it's confusing that much is made of the hydrophobic patches on Spy (P1 and P2 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Three of the variants increase and connect the patches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), creating, presumably, a more favorable binding surface for unfolded or partially unfolded proteins. This is quite convincing. Then the probability calculations in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> are at odds with this by predicting that the highest probability sites for the interface are not in the hydrophobic binding patches. A program called ProMate was used. No details were provided, including the reference, so it's difficult to evaluate the method and reliability of the predictions but they are logically at odds with the other rationalizations for activity and their other figures, as mentioned. Along similar lines <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, panel A is confusing with respect to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and the \u2018story\u2019 presented in the manuscript. There are two hydrophobic patches on Spy, which turn into one large hydrophobic surface upon mutation, yet panel A shows essentially that entire surface to be positively charged. I don't see how both can be true. You mention using a plugin in Pymol (no reference, no details). My guess is that the electrostatic potential wasn't calculated correctly or without knowledge of thresholds and solvent screening methods. Nonetheless the logical inconsistencies between different figures and the text make for a confusing read. In general the various computational tools seem to have been naively applied to the problem. These things need to be addressed, and if there are real conflicts then they need to be discussed but they aren't addressed here, or maybe the inconsistencies weren't noticed, or perhaps the figure legends are inaccurate."

One is that the main claim is that Spy becomes more active when it is more flexible/unfolded yet the modeling is done with static WT Spy crystal structures. The second is related, the experiments that are equated with flexibility measurements (hydrogen exchange and protease susceptibility) were performed on only WT Spy according to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. I don't see results for 'flexibility' experiments for the variants, particularly Q100L, H96L and Q49L. Given the authors' argument that flexibility is linked to activity (and increased activity is demonstrated) I think some results relating to the increased flexibility of the variants (limited possibly just to the main 3 mutants) should be explicitly provided. Then there is another issue that raises questions, it isn't clear that the protease experiments are reliable or even support the binding and 'flexibility' arguments. For example, in looking at <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a> the most striking thing is that most of the faster cleavage times are for the Spy Im7 complex (tall magenta bars). This is very confusing and at odds with the proposed binding models. The authors do point out the inconsistency but then essentially ask us to ignore it and focus on only the cases where the magenta bars are low (i.e., higher incubation times or &gt; 8 min). I assume that if there were a structural explanation from the models that it would have been presented."

For example, increased hydrogen exchange is taken as proof of flexibility, but the method does not measure flexibility per se. For example, you can have a rigid, stiff extended chain that exchanges 100% and to say the chain is flexible would be wrong. What makes me mention this is that most of the results are presented in a very direct way with respect to the wording by providing inference as fact or by using the word indicate or determine instead of using the word suggest. While this may seem like a fine point, much of the manuscript reads as something of a house of cards that is strongly presented as fact. It is recommended that the manuscript is edited to tone some of this down."

Rather than individually mutating residues and testing for loss of function, one can simply exploit what evolution has done to a protein to gain a good idea of which residues are important for the function by simply looking at residue-by-residue conservation. We have clarified our rational for looking at activity enhancing mutations by adding these sentences to the results section: \u201cOur ability to link protein folding to antibiotic resistance gives us a unique opportunity to select for activity enhancing mutations in a chaperone. Analysis of the reasons behind the improved chaperone ability of activity enhancing mutants of Spy should inform us about Spy\u2019s catalytic mechanism and perhaps also tell us what makes for a good chaperone. We reasoned that activity-enhancing mutations would be more informative in general than those that decreased function, in part because there are a wider variety of uninteresting reasons that mutations can disrupt function such as those causing chain termination.\u201d"
