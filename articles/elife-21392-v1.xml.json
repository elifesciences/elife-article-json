                    "text": "A high density of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes of Ranvier is necessary for rapid and efficient action potential propagation in myelinated axons. Na+ channel clustering is thought to depend on two axonal cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the axon and myelinating glia at the nodal gap (i.e., NF186) and the paranodal junction (i.e., Caspr). Here we show that while Na<sup>+</sup> channels cluster at nodes in the absence of NF186, they fail to do so in double conditional knockout mice lacking both NF186 and the paranodal cell adhesion molecule Caspr, demonstrating that a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes. Furthermore, we show that paranode-dependent clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels requires axonal \u03b2II spectrin which is concentrated at paranodes. Our results reveal that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup>channel clustering is mediated by the spectrin-based paranodal axonal cytoskeleton."

Na+ channel clustering is thought to depend on two axonal cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the axon and myelinating glia at the nodal gap (i.e., NF186) and the paranodal junction (i.e., Caspr). Here we show that while Na<sup>+</sup> channels cluster at nodes in the absence of NF186, they fail to do so in double conditional knockout mice lacking both NF186 and the paranodal cell adhesion molecule Caspr, demonstrating that a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes. Furthermore, we show that paranode-dependent clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels requires axonal \u03b2II spectrin which is concentrated at paranodes. Our results reveal that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup>channel clustering is mediated by the spectrin-based paranodal axonal cytoskeleton."

Node assembly depends on the interactions between axons and myelinating glia that are mediated by distinct cell adhesion complexes present at both the nodal gap and the paranodal junction flanking each node of Ranvier. A key mediator of these interactions is the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin (Nfasc). The <i>Nfasc</i> gene is alternatively spliced to generate a neuronal 186 kDa variant (NF186) found at nodes of Ranvier (<a href=\"#bib10\">Davis et al., 1996</a>), and a glial 155 kDa variant (NF155) that is a core component of the paranodal junctions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tait et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pillai et al., 2009</a>). <i>Nfasc</i> is essential for node of Ranvier assembly as genetic deletion of both NF155 and NF186 in mice results in the absence of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sherman et al., 2005</a>)."

                        "text": "At peripheral (PNS) and central (CNS) nodes, NF186 is clustered and stabilized at the axolemma by glial adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix (ECM) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eshed et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Susuki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Colombelli et al., 2015</a>). Clustered NF186 functions as an attachment site for the nodal scaffolding proteins ankyrinG (AnkG) and \u03b2IV spectrin, which in turn recruit Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davis and Bennett, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sherman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gasser et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ho et al., 2014</a>). After node assembly, NF186 helps to stabilize and maintain the nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel protein complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amor et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Desmazieres et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with these observations, transgenic expression of neuronal NF186 on an <i>Nfasc</i>-null background is sufficient to rescue nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zonta et al., 2008</a>). In addition, the glial NF155-dependent paranodal axoglial junctions have also been proposed to function as a parallel mechanism to cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels by acting as lateral diffusion barriers to restrict the location of nodal proteins in the axolemma (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rasband et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pedraza et al., 2001</a>). In support of this idea, transgenic expression of NF155 in myelinating oligodendrocytes on a <i>Nfasc</i>-null background is sufficient to induce Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zonta et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, in vitro myelination of <i>Nfasc</i>-null axons by wild-type Schwann cells (which results in the formation of a normal paranodal junction) induces the clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, mice lacking both paranodal junctions and NF186-binding CNS nodal ECM proteins have a profound reduction in the clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib38\">Susuki et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, disruption of paranodal junctions alone causes only mild perturbations to Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dupree et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bhat et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boyle et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pillai et al., 2009</a>). Together, these observations support a model where two glia-dependent mechanisms direct Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier: (1) clustering of axonal NF186 by glia-derived proteins and (2) restriction of nodal protein complexes within the nodal gap by the paranodal junctions."

Furthermore, if paranodal junctions can act as diffusion barriers to cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels, what molecular mechanisms are involved?"

We confirmed the role of the paranodal junction as a second, glia-dependent mechanism for Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering by generating double-conditional knockout mice lacking both axonal Caspr and NF186. Finally, using double-conditional knockout mice deficient in both axonal NF186 and \u03b2II spectrin, we extend our understanding of node formation by showing that the axonal \u03b2II spectrin-based paranodal cytoskeleton underlies the paranodal mechanism of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering."

We found clusters of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at all nodes of Ranvier at both P9 and P12 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b\u2013d</a>). We also examined the clustering of other nodal proteins including AnkG, \u03b2IV spectrin, and gliomedin (Gldn; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Whereas Na<sup>+</sup> channels, AnkG, and \u03b2IV spectrin were unaffected by the loss of NF186, Gldn was no longer restricted to nodes of Ranvier, consistent with gliomedin's function as a ligand for NF186 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eshed et al., 2005</a>). Similar to <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice, analysis of peripheral nerves from <i>Thy1-Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice revealed clustered Na<sup>+</sup> channels, AnkG, and \u03b2IV spectrin, but loss of the nodal NF186 ligands NrCAM and Gldn (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b and d</a>)."

                                "text": "A major function of NF186 during early development is to interact with gliomedin to form heminodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters which are precursors to mature nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>). Heminodes are most easily seen in dorsal root ganglion/Schwann cell mixed cultures that have been induced to myelinate. Whereas 84% (n\u00a0=\u00a0128 heminodes) of heminodes from wild-type (WT) cultures had heminodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>), only 6% (n\u00a0=\u00a0113 heminodes) of heminodes from <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice had heminodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters. Instead, <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice had Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the forming nodal gap between adjacent Schwann cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). The distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the latter supports a role for paranodal junctions in restricting nodal proteins between two forming myelin sheaths (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>). Intriguingly, close examination of <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> dorsal roots and <i>Thy1-Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> peripheral nerves showed that the intensity of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel staining was reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). Quantification of the nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel fluorescence intensity in <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice at P9 and P12 showed a significant reduction compared to control <i>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). Consistent with this reduced nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel density, compound action potential recordings from P10 dorsal roots (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1f</a>) revealed a reduction in conduction velocity in <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g</a>). The loss of Na<sup>+</sup> channels from nodes may account for the juvenile lethality observed in <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (i.e., at 7\u201310 days these mice began to develop a progressive tremor that worsened until most mice died at around 3 weeks of age). Hence, while these observations confirm that paranodal junctions are sufficient for the initial Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at PNS nodes, they also support previous observations that NF186 plays important roles in maintaining the nodal protein complex which is necessary for proper action potential conduction (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amor et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Desmazieres et al., 2014</a>)."

Immunostaining of <i>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mouse optic nerves with a chicken panNF antibody that recognizes both NF186 and NF155 splice variants showed staining at both nodes and paranodes (note the yellow color at nodes due to overlap with Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the <i>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> control optic nerves, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). However, we found that some oligodendrocytes in the <i>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mouse also recombine, resulting in a mosaic nerve with some regions lacking both NF155 and NF186 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013b</a>, outlined region). Like <i>Pgk-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice, regions lacking both NF155 and NF186 had dramatically reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering; when Na<sup>+</sup> channels were clustered in regions lacking paranodal NF155, they always colocalized with NF186 in axons corresponding to retinal ganglion cells that presumably did not undergo recombination (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Therefore, we restricted our analysis to regions of the <i>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mouse optic nerve where oligodendrocytes still expressed NF155. Immunostaining showed a pronounced gap in Nfasc immunoreactivity at nodes; occasionally we found some nodes that still had nodal NF186, likely due to a lack of recombination in those neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a and b</a>, arrows). Consistent with our observations in the PNS, we found robust Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering in the gap between all panNF-labeled paranodal junctions at P17 and P30 in the <i>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mouse optic nerve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b,d</a>). Intriguingly, at P60 some nodes had intact panNF-labeled paranodal junctions but without any associated Na<sup>+</sup> channel immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, arrowhead and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). However, in contrast to the PNS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>), we did not observe a general reduction in Na<sup>+</sup> channel fluorescence intensities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). As expected, nodes lacking NF186 in the <i>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice had AnkG and \u03b2IV spectrin (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Furthermore, we did not observe any invasion of Kv1.2-subunit containing K<sup>+</sup> channels into paranodal regions, indicating that the paranodal axoglial junctions remain intact in the <i>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mouse optic nerve (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Similarly, analysis of nodes of Ranvier in the spinal cords of <i>Thy1-Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> showed that despite the loss of NF186, there was robust clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels, AnkG, and \u03b2IV spectrin (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2c and d</a>). However, the chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan brevican (Bcan), a core nodal ECM protein that binds to NF186 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Susuki et al., 2013</a>), could not be detected (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2c</a>)."

The reduced conduction velocity does not reflect impaired myelination (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1f\u00a0and\u00a01g</a>), but instead likely reflects the combined effects of decreased nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel density, loss of nodal extracellular matrix molecules (<a href=\"#bib42\">Weber et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bekku et al., 2010</a>), and loss of some paranodal junctions due to NF155-deficient oligodendrocytes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Together, these observations reinforce the concept that paranodal junctions in CNS myelinated axons are sufficient to induce Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering in the absence of NF186. Furthermore, they extend our understanding of CNS nodes by showing that assembly of the CNS nodal ECM depends on NF186, and that as in the PNS, NF186 may contribute to the maintenance of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel densities required for proper action potential propagation."

                                "text": "How do paranodal junctions act as a barrier to restrict nodal proteins to the gaps in the myelin sheath? We previously showed that the enrichment of AnkG in the axon initial segment (AIS) depends on an \u03b1II/\u03b2II spectrin-dependent submembranous cytoskeleton that functions as an intra-axonal boundary (<a href=\"#bib18\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>). Paranodes also have a specialized \u03b1II/\u03b2II spectrin-based axonal cytoskeleton whose assembly requires the NF155-dependent paranodal junction (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ogawa et al., 2006</a>). Thus, the paranodal cytoskeleton may function as repeating intra-axonal boundaries that restrict AnkG and Na<sup>+</sup> channels to nodes. To test this hypothesis, we generated <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice that lack both NF186 and \u03b2II spectrin in PNS sensory neurons. Importantly, 94.1% and 94.6% of nodes in control and <i>Avil-Cre; Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice, respectively, had clustered Na<sup>+</sup> channels (p=0.28 by Student\u2019s t-test; n\u00a0=\u00a03 independent animals for each genotype and a total of 796 and 464 nodes were examined in control and cKO mice, respectively). Furthermore, at individual nodes in the <i>Avil-Cre;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice we found Na<sup>+</sup> channel fluorescence intensities of 1.035 and 0.935 (arbitrary units) in control and <i>Avil-Cre;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice, respectively (p=0.44 by Student\u2019s t-test; n\u00a0=\u00a04 mice of each genotype with a total of 100 and 92 nodes measured in control and cKO mice, respectively). Thus, <i>Avil-Cre;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice have normal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering and densities of Na<sup>+</sup> channels, indicating that NF186 is sufficient to cluster nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Compared to single knockouts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>) and <i>Nfasc<sup>fl/f</sup>;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice), animals lacking both NF186 and \u03b2II spectrin in their sensory axons had an extreme deficit in proprioception (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Electron microscopy showed paranodes, but thinner myelin in <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013d</a>), whereas mice lacking \u03b2II spectrin had normal myelination (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). To confirm that paranodal junctions are intact we immunostained paranodes in dorsal roots using antibodies to Caspr. Both <i>Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> and <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice had normal paranodal Caspr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), indicating intact paranodal junctions. Nevertheless, immunostaining of roots lacking NF186 and \u03b2II spectrin revealed a profound loss of Na<sup>+</sup> channel, AnkG, and \u03b2IV spectrin clustering (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013I</a>) at P10 and P15 despite intact NF155-dependent paranodal junctions. These results extend the model for how Na<sup>+</sup> channels are clustered at nodes by demonstrating that the paranodal junction barrier mechanism is mediated by the \u03b2II spectrin-based paranodal cytoskeleton."

Our results confirm and extend the model that two glia-dependent mechanisms direct Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Susuki et al., 2013</a>). These mechanisms consist of: (1) glia-derived adhesion/ECM proteins working through NF186, and (2) the assembly of a paranodal junction dependent cytoskeletal barrier containing \u03b2II spectrin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These two mechanisms converge on the clustering of the axonal cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins AnkG and \u03b2IV spectrin at the nodes of Ranvier (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ho et al., 2014</a>). Accordingly, the loss of NF186 can be partially compensated for by the paranodal junction-based cytoskeletal barrier since Na<sup>+</sup> channels may still be clustered, but they cannot be maintained in the absence of NF186 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). With the same rationale, Na<sup>+</sup> channels still cluster at nodes in the absence of the paranodal junction barrier (by genetically deleting cell adhesion molecules that mediate axoglial contact at this site (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhat et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boyle et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pillai et al., 2009</a>), or \u03b2II spectrin [<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>]) due to the function of NF186 at the forming nodes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). When both NF186 and the paranodal junction based spectrin cytoskeleton are lost, Na<sup>+</sup> channels cannot be clustered at nodes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Glial NF155 binds to a heterodimeric cell adhesion molecule complex consisting of axonal Caspr and contactin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charles et al., 2002</a>). In myelinating glia, NF155 also interacts with ankyrinB (AnkB) and AnkG to facilitate the assembly of the paranodal junction, which in turn controls the rapid development of Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering in the CNS (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2014</a>). Axonal Caspr has a cytoplasmic protein 4.1 binding domain, and protein 4.1B is enriched at paranodes and juxtaparanodes. Protein 4.1B binds to \u03b1II/\u03b2II spectrin and mice deficient in either 4.1B or \u03b2II spectrin have impaired axonal membrane domain organization with mislocalization of juxtaparanodal Kv1 K<sup>+</sup> channels due to loss of the paranodal boundary (<a href=\"#bib23\">Horresh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Einheber et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Together, these observations suggest that in myelinated axons, glial NF155 directs the assembly of the \u03b1II/\u03b2II spectrin-based paranodal cytoskeleton through Caspr and protein 4.1B. One prediction from this model is that mice lacking both NF186 and protein 4.1B should phenocopy the <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sptbn1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice we analyzed."

We speculate that similar to the AIS and distal axon (<a href=\"#bib18\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>), different spectrin and ankyrin cytoskeletons occupy mutually exclusive domains due to steric effects. Thus, domains containing \u03b2IV spectrin are mutually exclusive to those containing \u03b2II spectrin. Recent experiments using super-resolution microscopy reveal that the \u03b2II spectrin-based cytoskeleton in unmyelinated axons is organized into repeating rings of spectrin tetramers and actin (<a href=\"#bib43\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). However, the high density of \u03b1II/\u03b2II spectrin found at paranodes may not be organized in the same way, and this high density may function to restrict ankG/\u03b2IV spectrin-containing cytoskeletons to the forming nodes as the myelin sheath elongates. While the conclusion that the paranodal junction contributes to the clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels is consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rasband et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zonta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>), it is different from the one reached by Thaxton et al. (<a href=\"#bib40\">Thaxton et al., 2011</a>). To specifically target NF186 these authors used a Cre-recombinase under control of the Neurofilament light chain (<i>Nefl-Cre</i>). Unfortunately, this Cre-driver line has poor penetrance and poor temporal precision (<a href=\"#bib40\">Thaxton et al., 2011</a>). Since we also observed reduced densities of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering (in the PNS) and even complete loss of channels in some NF186-deficient axons (both PNS and CNS) with increasing age, we speculate the results of <a href=\"#bib40\">Thaxton et al. (2011)</a> reflect the role of NF186 for maintenance of Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters rather than their initial assembly. This conclusion is consistent with their observation that in P11 sciatic nerves, 30% of nodes lacking NF186 still had Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering. It was with these concerns in mind that we used two different <i>Nfasc</i> alleles and three different highly penetrant and temporally precise Cre-driver lines. Why are Na<sup>+</sup> channel intensities at PNS nodes reduced but normal at CNS nodes in NF186-deficient axons? We speculate that differences in primary and secondary clustering mechanisms can account for the reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel density in the PNS. For example, we previously proposed the main clustering mechanism in the PNS is through ECM/NF186 rather than the paranode (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, since Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering in the CNS is temporally correlated with assembly of the paranodal junction (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rasband et al., 1999</a>), but not the assembly of the CNS nodal ECM (<a href=\"#bib38\">Susuki et al., 2013</a>), our results are consistent with the idea that the main driver of CNS nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering is the paranodal cytoskeleton-based mechanism. Since the main paranode-based mechanism is intact in <i>Six3-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice, their Na<sup>+</sup> channels may be more stable."

Spectrins are potent substrates for calpain-mediated proteolysis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Siman et al., 1984</a>). Thus, injury or disease could affect the integrity of this clustering mechanism. This could be particularly detrimental for peripheral and central autoimmune diseases that have as their molecular targets nodal antigens including NF186 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mathey et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Uncini et al., 2013</a>) resulting in a 'double-hit': disruption of nodal neurofascin and paranodal junction cytoskeletons.

For better contrast resolution, tissues were impregnated with uranyl-acetate (2% in H2O for 1 hr) before being washed twice in H2O. After a series of dehydrating steps in rising EtOH-concentrations (50%, 70%, 96% each twice for 5 min, 100% three times 10 min), tissues were embedded in propylene oxide (3 \u00d7 10 min) and incubated overnight in 30% Epon \u2018Hard\u2019 (EMS) diluted in propylene oxide. Next, Epon was introduced gradually into the samples (50% and 70% 24 hr each, 100% 48 hr). Sciatic and optic nerves were then transferred into backing-molds with 100% Epon and left to harden for three days in an oven at 65\u00b0C. Sections were subsequently sectioned and examined using a Philips CM-12 transmission electron microscope."

Homogenates were incubated on ice for 40 min (vortexed every 5 min), centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and supernatant was collected and kept at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE in Tris-Acetate 7% gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (110V, 1 hr). Membranes were then incubated with blocking solution (5% BSA in TBS-T (5 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCl and 0.05% tween in H2O pH\u00a0=\u00a07.5)) for 60 min and reacted with the appropriate antibodies for 12 hr at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were then washed in TBS-T (3 \u00d7 5 min) and incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 45 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed again and reacted with ECL (Pierce). Membranes were visualized using the Chemidoc MP Digital chemiluminescent gel documentation system (Bio-Rad)."

Using in vivo genetic manipulations to selectively delete NF186 from different populations of PNS and CNS neurons, the authors find NaV channel clusters remain at nodes in the absence of NF186. This finding is, on the surface, different from that reported by Thaxton et al. in 2011, in which loss of NF186 was reported to result in a loss of NaCh clusters. The authors suggest that this discrepancy is due to the poor efficiency of the Cre line used in the 2011 report, and further, that NF186 plays an important role in maintaining NaCh clusters rather than in initially forming clusters. Consistent with this interpretation, the 2011 report observed some NaCh clusters in P11 sciatic nerves, and both groups find a decrease in NaCh clusters with age."

These data are included here for the reviewers <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>. We speculate that this discrepancy between the CNS and PNS reflects differences in primary and secondary clustering mechanisms in the PNS vs. the CNS. Specifically, in the PNS the primary mechanism of NaCh clustering is through Gldn/NF186 with the paranodal junctions being the secondary mechanism. In the CNS, the primary mechanism is the paranodal junction, while the ECM/NF186 interaction is the secondary mechanism (Susuki et al., Neuron 2013). (These conclusions are also consistent with the observation that in mice lacking paranodal junctions the nodal clusters in the CNS become proportionally much, much longer than those in the PNS (Rios et al., J Neurosci 2003)). We chose not to include these data since they do not change the conclusions and would require a complicated discussion of the differences in the hierarchy of clustering mechanisms between the PNS and CNS that may detract from the main message. Should the reviewers feel these data are critical to the overall message of the paper we will be happy to include them as they provide strong support for the sufficiency of the paranodal mechanism \u2013 especially in the CNS.

Is the suggestion that Na<sup>+</sup> channels may be clustered in the absence of \u03b2IV spectrin or AnkG? We previously showed that the ankG-binding motif of Na<sup>+</sup> channels is both necessary and sufficient for the proper clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Gasser et al., J Neurosci 2012) and we showed that Na<sup>+</sup> channels are <span class=\"underline\">never</span> clustered without a nodal ankyrin (Ho et al., Nat Neurosci 2014). Based on these prior observations we did not quantify \u03b2IV spectrin or ankG staining in the mice we analyzed \u2013 instead our focus was on Na<sup>+</sup> channels since clustering of Na<sup>+</sup> channels requires intact ankyrin and \u03b2 spectrin clustering. Nevertheless, our qualitative analysis indicated that the staining for ankG and \u03b2IV spectrin in <i>Avil-Cre;Nfasc<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Spnb2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice is similar to that for Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Since the animals analyzed in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> (<i>Thy-1Cre;Nfasc(4)<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice) have intact \u03b2II spectrin gene expression and intact paranodal junctions (as indicated by Caspr staining) we did not analyze \u03b2II spectrin staining in these mice. There is no reason to expect that \u03b2II spectrin staining should be altered."

However, we chose not to discuss the hypomyelination because the focus of the paper is on Na<sup>+</sup> channel clustering at nodes and the function of the paranodal cytoskeleton in that process. Although interesting, we believe it is tangential to the main message of the paper and we have no data to support any particular mechanism. If the editor would like us to discuss the issue we are happy to do it, but it will be speculation. The more important question is about the EM and the lack of transverse bands. We agree that transverse bands are not visible in the example of the paranode shown. Unfortunately, because of the recombination that occasionally occurs in oligodendrocytes (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we cannot be certain that a given paranode has NF155. Although most investigators believe the molecular basis of the transverse band is the Caspr/contactin/NF155 protein complex, this has never been proven by immunoelectron microscopy. Nevertheless, since there are no known examples where transverse bands are present but Caspr and NF155 are not also clustered, we used Caspr and paranodal NF immunostaining to indicate intact paranodal junctions in the nodes we analyzed. Thus, although we are limited in our analysis of paranodes by EM, the immunostaining strongly supports the conclusion that junctions are intact."

Instead the delay in the first peak and increase in the second peak corresponds to slowing of axons due to reduced Na<sup>+</sup> channel densities. Respectfully, we do not believe reporting a conduction velocity for all peaks is particularly informative since the entire trace shown represents the summation of action potentials from many hundreds if not thousands of axons in the sensory roots. The velocity for the second peak is easy to provide, it is just that we do not think it will provide any additional information beyond what is already given in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F and G</a>.
