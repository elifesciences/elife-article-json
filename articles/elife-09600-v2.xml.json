We show that in areas V1-V3 this overlap is due to two co-located but non-interacting populations of neurons, each with a receptive field serving only one hemifield. Importantly, the two populations share the same local vascular control, resulting in a unique organization useful for quantifying the relationship between neural and fMRI BOLD responses without direct measurement of neural activity. Specifically, we can non-invasively double local neural responses by stimulating both neuronal populations with identical stimuli presented symmetrically across the vertical meridian to both visual hemifields, versus one population by stimulating in one hemifield. Measurements from a series of such doubling experiments show that the amplitude of BOLD response is proportional to approximately 0.5 power of the underlying neural response. Reanalyzing published data shows that this inferred relationship is general."

We show that in areas V1-V3 this overlap is due to two co-located but non-interacting populations of neurons, each with a receptive field serving only one hemifield. Importantly, the two populations share the same local vascular control, resulting in a unique organization useful for quantifying the relationship between neural and fMRI BOLD responses without direct measurement of neural activity. Specifically, we can non-invasively double local neural responses by stimulating both neuronal populations with identical stimuli presented symmetrically across the vertical meridian to both visual hemifields, versus one population by stimulating in one hemifield. Measurements from a series of such doubling experiments show that the amplitude of BOLD response is proportional to approximately 0.5 power of the underlying neural response. Reanalyzing published data shows that this inferred relationship is general."

The two eyes\u2019 optic nerves are bridged together with a structure called the optic chiasm, which ensures that each side of the brain gets input from both eyes for one side of the visual field. However, in rare cases, a person may lack an optic chiasm, and instead each side of the brain processes information about both sides of the visual field seen by one eye. This condition is known as achiasma."

This revealed that each half of the visual field stimulates different neurons in the same brain hemisphere of an achiasmic visual cortex. The two sets of neurons do not interact with each other, but they do share the same local blood supply. Moreover, these sets of neurons are organized in such a way as to preserve normal vision, and can be controlled independently using visual stimulation."

This also causes an increased BOLD signal as more blood flows to that region of the brain. Bao et al. were therefore able to infer a mathematical relationship between neural activity and the BOLD signal. This revealed that the magnitude of the BOLD signal is proportional to the square root of the underlying neural activity. Reanalyzing previously published BOLD data from other fMRI studies of healthy humans and monkeys supports this conclusion."

The neural response that is associated with information processing is itself multi-faceted. It comprises several interacting components, including subthreshold and suprathreshold electrical activities, the transport, release and reuptake of neurotransmitters, and various maintenance activities. Each of these components has its own metabolic and hemodynamic consequences. The common extracellular measurements of neural response include single- and multi-unit spiking activities and local field potential (LFP). While seminal studies have demonstrated a close relationship between the BOLD signal and these extracellular measurements of neural response (<a href=\"#bib44\">Logothetis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mukamel et al., 2005</a>), the quantitative nature of this relationship has not been sufficiently characterized. More importantly, since the relationship between these extracellular measurements and the intracellular components of neural activity is complex, the measured relationship between the BOLD signal to any specific extracellular components (e.g., power in the gamma band of LFP) may not reflect the relationship between the BOLD signal and the totality of neural response."

The general approach is to assume the BOLD responses evoked at different times and in different stimulus conditions sum linearly. Boynton and colleagues\u00a0(1996) studied how the BOLD signal varied with the contrast and duration of stimulus presentation in the\u00a0striate cortex and found that the system is approximately linear, in the sense that the BOLD response evoked by a 12\u2009s stimulus was well approximated by summing the responses from two consecutive 6-s stimulations, even though predictions based on stimulations of much shorter durations (e.g., 3\u2009s) failed to accurately predict the long-duration stimulus response. While this and similar studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dale and Buckner, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heckman et al., 2007</a>) have clearly noted the lack of linearity, their general message of an approximately linear system has nevertheless been used to justify the broad application of the general linear model (GLM) in fMRI data analyses. While the neural response is not explicitly involved in this type of analysis, it is always in the background \u2014 any nonlinearity observed in the BOLD response, e.g., in surround suppression or adaptation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kourtzi and Huberle, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Larsson and Smith, 2012</a>) is often attributed to the underlying nonlinear neural response. The implicit assumption in common practice is that the relationship between the BOLD response and the neural response is essentially linear, a view that is widespread (<a href=\"#bib45\">Logothetis and Wandell, 2004</a>) but under-examined."

A condition known as achiasma or non-decussating retinal-fugal fibre syndrome may provide an excellent model system for this purpose. This congenital condition prevents the normal crossing of optic nerve fibers from the nasal hemi-retina to the brain hemisphere contralateral to the eye (<a href=\"#bib2\">Apkarian et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">1995</a>).

In other words, there are two pRFs for every point on this person\u2019s low-level visual cortex. The two pRFs are symmetrically located across the vertical meridian.

The result is an in-vivo system with two independent populations of spatially intermingled neurons that share the same local control of blood vasculature. Because their population receptive fields (pRFs) do not overlap, an experimenter can independently stimulate each population by presenting a stimulus to its respective receptive field. Such a system is ideal for characterizing the relationship between neural and BOLD responses. Even though we may not know the constituents of the neural response, it will be reasonable to assume that the local neural response evoked by presenting identical stimuli to both pRFs, thereby activating both neuronal populations equally, is twice the neural response evoked by presenting the stimulus to just one of the pRFs. Measuring BOLD responses under these conditions allows us to not only directly test for linearity between the BOLD signal and neural response but also quantify the relationship between them, up to an arbitrary scaling factor.

The target letter was randomly drawn from the set of 10 letters (C, D, H, K, N, O, R, V, S and Z). The stimuli appeared for 150 ms at a given location on the CRT monitor. There were three conditions: (1) the flankers and target on the same side, (2) the flankers and target on symmetrically opposite sides across the vertical meridian, and (3) target only. When the flankers and the target were on the same side (Condition 1), letter identification performance was severely impaired by the flankers -- the well-known crowding effect. When the flankers and target were on the opposite sides (Condition 2), even though the cortical representations of the flankers and target were equally close as in Condition 1, no crowding effect was found, and performance was identical to the target-only condition. These behavioral experiments show that even though the cortical representations of left and right visual fields overlap in V1-V3 in achiasma, the neuronal populations that represent these visual fields do not\u00a0interact functionally."

We then measured the effect of adaptation when S was monocularly performing a highly demanding fixation task. The adapting and testing patterns were four counter-flickering Gabors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Relative to the adaptors, the test patterns could be either at the same spatial locations or at the mirrored locations across the vertical meridian. The orientation of the test stimulus could be either the same as or orthogonal to the adaptors. As expected, when the adaptors and test patterns were at the same spatial locations, we observed strong BOLD adaptation when they were of matching orientation and a large release from adaptation when they were of orthogonal orientations. The critical conditions are when the adapting and testing patterns were at different spatial locations but projected to the same points on the cortex of S. In these conditions, regardless of orientation, we found a large release from adaptation equal or greater in amplitude than in the same-location cross-orientation condition. We take this result to mean that the co-localized neural populations that underlie the two pRFs on either side of the vertical meridian do not interact physiologically with each other."

In separate experiments, a stimulus was presented for either 1\u2009s or 6\u2009s, followed by a 16\u2009s blank. We measured the full peristimulus time course of the evoked BOLD response and its amplitude. In V1-V3 and across the contrast levels, the BOLD response to the combined stimulus A+B was significantly higher than what could be produced by doubling the contrast of stimulus A or B [paired t-test; V1: t(19) = -4.48, p=2.57x10<sup>-4</sup>; V2: t(19) = -2.96, p=0.008; V3: t(19) = -4.30, p=3.85x10<sup>-4</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) but significantly lower than the sum of the BOLD responses to stimuli A and B [paired t-test; V1: t(24) = 2.53, p=0.018; V2: t(24) = 6.20, p=2.11x10<sup>-6</sup>; V3: t(24) = 6.07, p=2.87x10<sup>-6</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This finding shows that BOLD summation, in the absence of nonlinearity associated with neuronal summation (assuming that the A+B stimulus simultaneously excited two independent populations of neurons), is itself nonlinear, with a compressive nonlinearity. The compressive nonlinearity was not due to response saturation since the 1-s stimulation duration yielded essentially the same nonlinearity as the 6-s simulation. This result implies a nonlinear relationship between neural and BOLD responses, and challenges the prevailing linearity assumption."

We sought to express BOLD amplitude (<i>B</i>) as a function of neural response (<i>Z</i>), where <i>Z</i> refers to the local aggregate of neural response with unspecified constituents. At each cortical region of interest, the BOLD summation experiment provided five levels of <i>Z</i>, corresponding to the five levels of luminance contrast for the single-sided stimuli (A, B). (The single-sided stimuli A and B resulted in nearly identical time courses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> on robustness), indicating that the inputs from the left and right visual fields were balanced. We therefore use their averages in the analysis.) For each level of <i>Z</i> evoked by a single-sided stimulus, the level of neural response evoked by the corresponding double-sided stimulus (A+B) is doubled under the assumptions of co-localization and independence, which we have empirically validated.

The fits were good, with R<sup>2</sup> ranging from 0.73 to 0.99. The distribution of the best-fitting exponents (<i>\u03b3</i>) is shown in (<b>C</b>). The median of the distribution (0.48) is close to the exponent (0.5, red dashed vertical line) of the BvZ function inferred from the achiasmic subject. Asterisk (*) marks studies in which subjects attended to the stimuli used to obtain the contrast response functions. Underline (_) marks studies that measured and analytically discounted any task-related baseline response from the contrast response functions.

We arrived at this conclusion by considering 21 datasets from 12 published studies (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) on the contrast response function measured with fMRI BOLD in human V1. We assume the BvZ function to follow a power-law relationship, as we have found with the achiasmic subject, but allowed the exponent (<i>\u03b3</i>) to be a free parameter. <i>\u03b3</i> = 1 represents a linear relationship between BOLD response and spike rate. We used two single-unit contrast response functions (spike rate vs. contrast) for this meta-analysis. One of the functions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) was from <a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht (1995)</a>, which was an average of 19 monkey V1 neurons, each tested with their respective optimal stimuli. The other (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) was from <a href=\"#bib27\">Heeger et al. (2000)</a>, which was averages of the predicted response (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geisler and Albrecht, 1997</a>) of over 300 neurons to the specific stimulus used in <a href=\"#bib8\">Boynton et al. (1999)</a> (Geisler, personal communication). For each BOLD data set, we estimated the value of <i>\u03b3</i> such that the resulting BvZ function, when applied to a single-unit contrast response function, resulted in a predicted BOLD response that best matched the BOLD data set in terms of an error-weighted least-squares fit. With respect to the two neuronal contrast response functions, the bulk of the distribution of <i>\u03b3</i> lies mid-range between 0 and 1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013E</a>). The overall picture given by this set of nearly two dozens experiments is that BOLD response is nonlinearly related to spike rate. The interquartile range of both distributions includes <i>\u03b3</i> ~ 0.5, the exponent of the BvZ function independently estimated from our pure BOLD summation experiments with subject S. In fact, <i>\u03b3</i> ~ 0.5 is near the median of one distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and the mode of the other distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

We reached this conclusion by measuring, in the visual cortex of an achiasmic subject, fMRI BOLD amplitudes at five levels of neural activity <i>and</i> also at twice those levels. Our ability to double the local neural response relies on the presence of two co-localized but independent populations of neurons in the visual cortex of the achiasmic subject. The two neuronal populations are equally excitable, and each population has a distinct and non-overlapping population receptive field. We used fMRI retinotopy and localized stimulation to demonstrate co-localization and equal excitability. We used a sensitive contrast detection task and a long-duration fMRI adaptation task to demonstrate independence. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the achiasmic human visual cortex provides a versatile in vivo model for investigating the relationship between evoked neural response and the associated fMRI BOLD signal."

None of these studies attempted to use achiasma as a model system to study the relationship between neural response and the BOLD signal, nor had they thoroughly assessed the neural underpinning of the overlapped visual-field representations in achiasma. Nevertheless, the fMRI visual field mapping results from these prior studies are very similar to our results, suggesting that our subject is a \u2018typical\u2019 achiasmic individual.

Our method bypasses any nonlinearity between the stimulus and neural response. It also sidesteps the need to define the constituents of neural response (e.g., spiking activity, different frequency bands of LFP). These unique abilities stem from the configuration of the visual cortex in human achiasma: that there are two identical but independent populations of neurons that are co-localized on the cortex, sharing the same local control of blood supply. Each of these neuronal populations is associated with a distinct population receptive field. If stimulating one population results in some level of neural response, then for most reasonable definitions of 'neural response', stimulating both populations by placing identical stimuli in each of the two population receptive fields will double the local neural response (because two populations of neurons, instead of just one population, are responding). This notion of 'neural response' does not differentiate the specific components of neural response, such as spikes or LFP, which are themselves related in a complex manner. Rather, it is a holistic quantity (Z) that describe the totality of neural response, a notion that is perhaps more useful for most cognitive neuroscience investigations using fMRI. The fact that we succeeded in using the inferred BvZ functions to predict BOLD contrast-response functions from single-unit contrast-dependent spiking activity demonstrates the validity of our approach. While these results may suggest that Z is more related to spikes than to other neural response components nonlinearly related to spikes, more studies will be needed to quantify the link between the totality of neural response of a neural population and its individual components. The balance of the components that make up Z (e.g., spikes, LFP's) may depend on the stimulus, brain area, and task."

The empirical evidence we reported here suggests that there are two independent neuronal populations co-localized in each voxel of V1-V3 that subserve these two population receptive fields. <a href=\"#bib73\">Williams et al. (1994)</a> found that in achiasmic Belgian sheepdogs, retinal axons originating from the nasal hemi-retina, which would normally cross the midline, instead innervated ipsilateral LGN and occupied those layers that would otherwise receive inputs from the contralateral eye. Alternating layers of the LGN in achiasma thus form mirror-image maps of the visual field. If axon guidance between LGN and V1 during development is typical in achiasma, then what would develop into the ocular dominance columns of V1 in a normal visual system will instead become visual-field dominance columns in achiasma, as suggested by <a href=\"#bib71\">Victor et al. (2000)</a>. Preliminary measurements with 7T fMRI showed results consistent with the presence of visual-field dominance columns in V1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Olman et al., 2014</a>)."

Downstream from Layer 4, we expect this columnar organization to dissolve into finely intermingled but non-interacting unilateral (and monocular) neurons, for the following reason. In a normally developed visual system, binocular neurons receive inputs from monocular neurons in the neighboring ocular dominance columns. However, in achiasma, such 'binocular' neurons would stay monocular and unilateral. This is because the inputs from neighboring visual-field dominance columns would not correlate, as they represent unrelated locations in the left and right visual fields. Neurons that received inputs from neighboring columns would likely suppress or eliminate the inputs from one of the visual fields, chosen at random and without preference, since the inputs from the two visual fields are of equal strength (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The intermixing of the unilateral neurons would become finer downstream from V1 Layer 4, starting with neurons in the superficial and deep layers of V1. This may explain why the \u03b3 value of the BvZ function observed in V1 was higher than those found in V2 and V3 \u2013 the coarsely segregated neuronal populations in V1 Layer 4, which would not fully share the local vascular system, lead to a more linear summation (higher value of \u03b3). In V1, Layer 4 tends to have a larger contribution to the measured BOLD signal because of its dense vasculature but contributions from superficial and deep layers are also significant (<a href=\"#bib61\">Polimeni et al., 2010</a>). We postulate that neurons representing the two hemifields would be more intermingled in the superficial and deep layers than those in Layer 4. These neurons would likely be more complex and less linear in their response properties to visual stimulation than neurons in Layer 4 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Movshon et al., 1978a</a>,<a href=\"#bib52\">b</a>). Their contribution to the\u00a0BOLD signal relative to those in Layer 4 may be significantly reduced with long-duration simulation because of adaptation. The summation function thus appeared more linear in the 6-s condition than in the 1-s condition. It is important to point out that the summation function cannot be used to infer the BvZ function if the conditions of co-localization and non-interaction are not met. The condition of co-localization was not met in V1, and we could not use the summation function of V1 to infer its BvZ function. We do not think that the relationship between neural and BOLD responses depends significantly on stimulus duration. The fact that the BvZ functions inferred from V2 and V3, where the co-localization condition was met, provides an excellent fit to the V1 single-unit data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) further suggests that the inferred BvZ function is applicable in at least V1-V3."

The presence of two independent neuronal populations with non-overlapping receptive fields at the same cortical location allows for the independent control of two separate sources of the local neural activity via stimulus presentation. By measuring the fMRI BOLD responses associated with a doubling of the local neural response, we found that the amplitude of the evoked BOLD response is proportional to the sum-total of the evoked neural response raised to a power around 0.5."

In separate blocks of trials, the target was presented in the upper-left or lower-right quadrant against a uniform gray field with a luminance of 30.4\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>. A high contrast (Weber contrast = 1.0) task-irrelevant flickering checkerboard was displayed at a mirror-symmetric location from the target, either about the vertical meridian, such that the target and the flickering checkerboard would activate the same set of cortical regions, or about the horizontal meridian, such that the target and checkerboard would activate two different sets of cortical regions. The target was a 45<b>\u00b0</b> oriented Gabor with a center spatial frequency of 1 cycle/degree and a space constant (<math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></math>) of 1.4\u00b0.

A two-interval-alternative-forced-choice paradigm (judging which interval contained the target), controlled with the adaptive procedure QUEST (<a href=\"#bib72\">Watson and Pelli, 1983</a>), was used to measure the contrast threshold for a 75% correct detection rate. Each trial consisted of two temporal intervals (target-present and target-absent in random order) separated by a 500 ms blank. In each interval, the flickering checkerboard appeared for its entire duration of 600 ms. The Gabor target appeared for the last 150 ms of the target-present interval. During both intervals, a beep was presented 450 ms after the interval onset to reduce temporal uncertainty about target. The subject identified the target-present interval with a button press. A new trial began 500 ms after the subject had responded. Feedback was given after each response. For each target location, the subject completed 4 blocks of 50 trials."

Stimulus types A and B each consisted of 4 circular patches of black-and-white checkerboard arranged in either a backward-slash (A) or a forward-slash (B) configuration. For stimulus type A+B, the stimuli of type A and B were presented simultaneously, resulting in 8 checkerboard patches on the display. All patches in a stimulus were of the same contrast. We tested five Weber contrast levels from 0.05 to 1.0 in equal logarithmic steps against a uniform gray field of 156\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The outer patches were centered at an eccentricity of 7\u00b0 and had radius 2\u00b0. The inner patches were centered at an eccentricity of 3.5\u00b0 and had radius 1\u00b0. Each scan tested a specific contrast level. Within a scan, 19 stimulus blocks of 6\u2009s each (or 1\u2009s in a separate experiment) were interleaved with 19 16-s blank blocks. For each stimulus block, a stimulus of given type (A, B, or A+B) was presented, counter-flickering at 2\u2009Hz. For each scan, the stimulus blocks were arranged in an otherwise random sequence with the constraint that each of the three stimulus types was preceded by every stimulus type equally often. To encourage and maintain fixation throughout a scan, the central fixation mark changed from \u2018+\u2019 to \u2018\u00d7\u2019 for about 400ms and back at random intervals, uniformly distributed between 3\u2009s and 7\u2009s. When the fixation was changed to \u2018\u00d7\u2019 from \u2018+\u2019, it was further tilted by \u00b1 5\u00b0. The subject was to attend the fixation mark and report the direction of tilt as soon as the \u2018 \u00d7\u2019 appeared by pressing one of two response keys."

To improve SNR, we used a GLM-based denoising method described in <a href=\"#bib37\">Kay et al. (2013)</a>. The method assumes that physiological noise across measured voxels in the brain is correlated in the sense that it resides in a low-dimensional space. The method estimates this space in terms of its principle components from the voxels that are not driven by the stimulus. These components are then entered into the GLM design matrix for a given experiment as regressors of no interest in order to estimate and reduce the influence of noise from each voxel. To ensure that this method does not introduce confounds, we further tested this method using data from the 6-s experiment, which are of high SNR, and found that results were essentially the same as the ones obtained with the generic deconvolution method (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The multiplier 2 represents our assumption that the double-sided condition generated twice the neural response of the corresponding single-sided condition. In our case, the candidate monotonic and smooth function turned out to be a general cubic function restricted to be monotonically ascending. This is based on the following consideration. To be model-neutral, we first considered the entire family of cubic spline functions with <i>k</i> control points (<i>k</i>\u22652) that are constrained to be monotonic. A cubic spline function with <i>k</i> control points has 2<i>k</i> degrees of freedom. We iteratively estimated the <i>n</i>-1 values of <math id=\"inf12\"><mrow><msub><mi>Z</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math>\u00a0and the 2<i>k</i> parameters of the cubic spline function by minimizing the normalized chi-square, which is the sum of squared errors between the 2<i>n</i> points and the cubic spline function, divided by the degrees of freedom of the residual. The degrees of freedom of the residual are <math id=\"inf13\"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2212</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>k</mi></mrow></math>, and <i>k</i> has to be at least 2. In our case, <i>n</i>=5, meaning that the residual would have no degrees of freedom for <i>k</i>&gt;2. As a result, we considered only the family of cubic spline functions with two control points, situated at <math id=\"inf14\"><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf15\"><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mi>Z</mi><mn>5</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo></mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, respectively."

In achiasma, mirror-symmetric locations of the left and right visual fields are mapped to the same cortical location in visual areas. However, as careful psychophysics and fMRI adaptation experiments here show, stimulation at one site has negligible behavioral or neural effects on processing at the mirror-symmetric site. As such, achiasma provides a unique natural case study to investigate BOLD summation between effectively independent neural populations. The paper shows that doubling the stimulation sites in an achiasmic individual does not double the BOLD response; rather the BOLD response is approximately proportional to the square root of the neural response. These results are of general interest in neuroimaging considering the common use of BOLD fMRI to infer neural function."

Specifically, for V2 and V3, the confidence limits for the power law exponent include 0.5, and are similar for 6-sec and 1-sec presentations. But for V1, the 6-sec presentation yields a power law of about 0.75, with confidence limits that don't overlap with those for V2 and V3. The 1-sec V1 measurement is like V2 and V3, with confidence limits centered on 0.5. The authors interpret the finding that the 6-sec V1 measurement is closer to 1 as a result of less-complete overlap of the vasculature between the columns. While this may be true, it is unclear why the 1-sec measurement doesn't also show the same effect. So if the non-overlap issue is to be suggested as a plausible explanation for the V1 vs. V2/V3 discrepancy, something needs to be said about why only the 6-sec measurement shows its effect. Whatever the authors do on this point, I think that it is important to add that the explanation is at least somewhat conjectural, and one does need to also maintain the possibility that V1 is somehow different in terms of Z-to-B coupling. The paper's core contribution remains valid and important \u2013 the Z-to-B coupling is clear sublinear, in contrast to previous claims."

If one assumes a power law b=z^g, then the ratio of a pair of B measurements directly gives the scaling exponent g: b(2z_i)/b(z_i)=2^g. So one can plot these ratios, b(2z_i)/b(z_i), as a function of the index i, and see if these ratios are independent of i \u2013 or alternatively, if a trend emerges. If there's no trend, then the power law approximation is valid, the inferred value of the exponent g is the average of these ratios (optionally weighted by their reliabilities). If a trend emerges (which I doubt, given the good fits in the paper), then a power-law relationship cannot hold\u201d."

In a pairwise comparison with alpha=0.05, the requirement is for the CI of one estimated value not to include the estimated mean of the other value, and vice versa. It does not require the two CIs be non-overlapping.) We added a dashed line at gamma = 0.5 to make clear these conditions for a significant difference were met."

A likely cause of this is that the hemifield dominance columns in V1 are concentrated in Layer 4, because the thalamic inputs from the hemifields are segregated (Williams et al., 1994). The hemifield representations in the superficial and deep layers are likely intermingled for the same reason they intermingled in V2 and V3. Moreover, the effect of adaptation is probably less in Layer 4 than in the superficial and deep layers. This means that the observed BOLD signal in the 6-s condition (stronger adaptation) was probably dominated by signal from Layer 4, thus showing greater linearity than the 1-s condition. We have added text in the Discussion to describe this hypothesis (paragraph three, subsection \u201cOrigins of co-locating but non-interacting neuronal populations\u201d)."

One can argue that bypassing the contrast response function is an advantage (because of simplicity and reduced assumptions) or a disadvantage (since it misses an opportunity for contact with known physiology). So these approaches are complementary, and optimally, I think that the authors should retain their original analysis but also add the proposed analysis, as follows: The suggestion for the simpler analysis is as follows. The starting point is the set of values (z_i, 2z_i) at which they have measured the BOLD responses b_i,1=b(z_i) and b_i,2=b(2z_i). If one assumes a power law b=z^g, then the ratio of a pair of B measurements directly gives the scaling exponent g: b(2z_i)/b(z_i)=2^g. So one can plot these ratios, b(2z_i)/b(z_i), as a function of the index i, and see if these ratios are independent of i \u2013 or alternatively, if a trend emerges. If there's no trend, then the power law approximation is valid, the inferred value of the exponent g is the average of these ratios (optionally weighted by their reliabilities). If a trend emerges (which I doubt, given the good fits in the paper), then a power-law relationship cannot hold\u201d.</i>"
