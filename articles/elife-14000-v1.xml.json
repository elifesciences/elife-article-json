In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans,</i> pairing odor with food deprivation results in aversive olfactory learning, and pairing odor with food results in appetitive learning. Aversive learning requires nuclear translocation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 in AWC olfactory neurons and an insulin signal from AIA interneurons. Here we show that the activity of neurons including AIA is acutely required during aversive, but not appetitive, learning. The AIA circuit and AGE-1, an insulin-regulated PI3 kinase, signal to AWC to drive nuclear enrichment of EGL-4 during conditioning. Odor exposure shifts the AWC dynamic range to higher odor concentrations regardless of food pairing or the AIA circuit, whereas AWC coupling to motor circuits is oppositely regulated by aversive and appetitive learning. These results suggest that non-associative sensory adaptation in AWC encodes odor history, while associative behavioral preference is encoded by altered AWC synaptic activity."

Repeated exposure to an odor reduces a neuron\u2019s sensitivity to that odor, and Cho et al. show that this occurs irrespective of whether the odor is paired with reward or with punishment. This indicates that the neuron stores information about the odor as a non-associative memory. By contrast, pairing an odor with reward has differing effects on associative learning to pairing that same odor with punishment. Pairing an odor with a reward increases a sensory neuron\u2019s ability to communicate with target neurons \u2013 ultimately, those that control movement \u2013 whereas odor-punishment pairing reduces this ability. Further experiments showed that an insulin peptide supports learning about odors and punishments, but not about odors and rewards."

Primary sensory neurons adjust their sensitivity and dynamic range to capture ongoing sensory information without saturating, a phenomenon illustrated by the adaptation of the retina to ambient light levels over a 10<sup>10</sup>-fold range (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arshavsky and Burns, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fain et al., 2001</a>). In addition, animals learn to increase, decrease, or switch their preference for sensory cues experienced in attractive or aversive contexts. Sensory adaptation and context-dependent learning affect overlapping circuits, which must preserve robust function in the face of continuously changing neuronal properties. Here, we show how an olfactory circuit implements these two processes by encoding sensory adaptation and aversive learning at distinct sites."

Olfaction may be its most complex sense. <i>C. elegans</i> detects hundreds of volatile odors using dedicated sensory neurons, each of which expresses multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Troemel et al., 1995</a>). For example, an olfactory neuron called AWC<sup>ON</sup> (one of two AWC neurons) detects benzaldehyde, butanone, and isoamyl alcohol, and expresses at least five chemosensory GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bargmann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lesch and Bargmann, 2010</a>). Calcium imaging and genetic studies indicate that AWC signal transduction resembles mammalian phototransduction: odors are inferred to decrease the level of cGMP, close a cGMP-dependent transduction channel, and hyperpolarize AWC (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bargmann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>)."

This process has been called adaptation, but will here be called aversive olfactory learning to reflect its long duration and the required pairing with food deprivation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nuttley et al., 2002</a>), and to distinguish it from short-term sensory adaptation. Aversive learning is selective for the experienced odor, even when two odors are sensed by partly overlapping olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colbert and Bargmann, 1995</a>). The genetic requirements for aversive learning vary depending on the odor and the duration of odor exposure, and include G protein signaling pathways, ion channels, and transcriptional regulators (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ardiel and Rankin, 2010</a>)."

Here, we use circuit manipulations, molecular markers, and in vivo\u00a0calcium imaging to map the effects of odor history and food context on the olfactory circuit. We show that during aversive learning, the food-deprivation context engages feedback from AIA and other neurons, as well as insulin signaling. This feedback regulates EGL-4 localization and the behavioral output of AWC. In parallel, non-associative sensory adaptation shifts the dynamic range of AWC during both appetitive and aversive learning. Thus olfactory learning induces both associative and non-associative plasticity in a single sensory neuron."

Attractive odors reduce AWC<sup>ON</sup> calcium, and subsequent odor removal results in a calcium increase that can overshoot before returning to baseline (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). Previous studies have demonstrated a near-complete loss of AWC odor sensitivity after an hour of conditioning with isoamyl alcohol (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chalasani et al., 2010</a>). Using genetically-encoded calcium indicators to monitor butanone responses after aversive learning, we found that AWC<sup>ON</sup> calcium responses at 1 \u00b5M butanone were greatly diminished after butanone conditioning (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, the AWC<sup>ON</sup> responses were restored after ten minutes of recovery in buffer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This short-term suppression of butanone responses appears insufficient to explain aversive learning behavior, which persists through an hour-long chemotaxis assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

We suggest that this results from alterations in synaptic vesicle release by AWC<sup>ON</sup>, which contains both glutamatergic and peptidergic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chalasani et al., 2010</a>). Candidate mechanisms for plasticity are changes in the composition or level of the neuropeptides produced by AWC, changes in the relative rates of release of the two vesicle classes, or changes in resting potential that affect basal neurotransmitter release. Gene expression changes induced by nuclear EGL-4 or other transcriptional regulators may contribute to these functional effects (<a href=\"#bib19\">Juang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Neal et al., 2015</a>)."

C. elegans</i> migrates to salt concentrations that have been paired with food (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kunitomo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luo et al., 2014</a>), and learns the association over about 90 min, a time\u00a0frame similar to that of olfactory learning. Salt preference changes are accompanied by synaptic changes in the ASER gustatory neuron that are induced by INS-1, AGE-1, and an axonal isoform of the DAF-2 insulin receptor (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kunitomo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Oda et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ohno et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tomioka et al., 2006</a>).

                                "text": "Unlike olfactory learning, however, salt preference learning is accompanied by bidirectional shifts in the salt concentration that activates ASER in calcium imaging experiments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kunitomo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luo et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, <i>C. elegans</i> temperature preference learning results in precise bidirectional shifts in the temperature sensitivity of the AFD thermosensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kimura et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Clark et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ramot et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2014</a>). A key difference between olfactory learning and these other forms of plasticity is the nature of sensory preference. In thermotaxis and gustatory plasticity, animals seek out a preferred concentration at the 'setpoint', the temperature or salt condition associated with chronic cultivation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kunitomo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luo et al., 2014</a>). Returning to the setpoint is the apparent homeostatic goal of the directed behavior. Olfactory plasticity, by contrast, is relatively insensitive to setpoint. It is linked to the identity of the odor, not the quantity, and the readouts of aversive and appetitive learning are observed across 100-fold concentration changes in the odor source (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colbert and Bargmann, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Torayama et al., 2007</a>). Although odor history does change sensory representations in AWC<sup>ON</sup>, this is not central to the behavioral preference; it is the context-dependent synaptic changes that appear to be instructive. Individual neurons may tune history-dependent changes in sensory detection and associative changes at sensory synapses in a variety of ways, generating different forms of sensory plasticity to solve different behavioral problems."

Animals were observed under a 60X objective of a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and neurons expressing the fluorescent marker were identified based on known landmarks and morphological characteristics. Animals carrying the <i>gcy-28d::HisCl1</i> transgene showed expression in AIA (100%), AVF (~90%), ASI (~65%, weak), and IL2, I1, or M3 pharyngeal neurons (~70% each). Animals carrying the <i>gcy-28d::unc-103(gf)</i> transgene showed expression in AIA (~95%), AVF (&lt;5%), ASI (&lt;5%), and IL2, I1, or M3 neurons (~5% each). The <i>gcy-28d::unc-103</i> expression pattern suggests that silencing AIA alone can disrupt aversive learning, but this appears inconsistent with the complete set of <i>HisCl1</i> data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, because aversive learning was normal with two <i>HisCl1</i> transgenes that are expressed in AIA (<i>ins-1(s), ttx-3(intron7</i>)). Two potential explanations for this apparent discrepancy are (1) chronic AIA silencing with <i>unc-103(gf)</i> disrupts aversive learning, but transient AIA silencing during conditioning with HisCl1 does not unless additional neurons are silenced (2) in addition to AIA, a low level of <i>unc-103(gf)</i> in another neuron, below the detection limit of the mCherry reporter, silences that neuron in the <i>gcy-28d::unc-103(gf)</i> strain."

In the cited work, Lee et al. 2010 report that constitutive nuclear localization of EGL-4 \"renders the animals unresponsive to AWC-sensed odors.\" The concern is that constitutive expression may have larger and/or additional/different effects than acute translocation to the nucleus during an actual adaptation experiment. With respect to the model, it is also recommended that the authors provide one or more plausible scenarios (ideally with precedents in the literature) for how nuclear EGL-4 might reduce the effectiveness of AWC activation."

It also seems reasonable that associations formed between butanone and a rich source of food should be referred to as \"appetitive conditioning.\" The suggested change in terminology would also make the paper easier to understand, by avoiding the many different meanings of \"adaptation.\"</i>"

In the cited work, Lee et al. 2010 report that constitutive nuclear localization of EGL-4 \"renders the animals unresponsive to AWC-sensed odors.\" The concern is that constitutive expression may have larger and/or additional/different effects than acute translocation to the nucleus during an actual adaptation experiment. With respect to the model, it is also recommended that the authors provide one or more plausible scenarios (ideally with precedents in the literature) for how nuclear EGL-4 might reduce the effectiveness of AWC activation.</i>"
