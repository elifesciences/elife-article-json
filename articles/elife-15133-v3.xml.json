At several sensory synapses, rapid vesicle supply is achieved via highly mobile vesicles and specialized ribbon structures, but how this is achieved at central synapses without ribbons is unclear. Here we examine vesicle mobility at excitatory cerebellar mossy fibre synapses which sustain transmission over a broad frequency bandwidth. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching in slices from VGLUT1<sup>Venus</sup> knock-in mice reveal 75% of VGLUT1-containing vesicles have a high mobility, comparable to that at ribbon synapses. Experimentally constrained models establish hydrodynamic interactions and vesicle collisions are major determinants of vesicle mobility in crowded presynaptic terminals. Moreover, models incorporating 3D reconstructions of vesicle clouds near active zones (AZs) predict the measured releasable pool size and replenishment rate from the reserve pool. They also show that while vesicle reloading at AZs is not diffusion-limited at the onset of release, diffusion limits vesicle reloading during sustained high-frequency signalling."

At several sensory synapses, rapid vesicle supply is achieved via highly mobile vesicles and specialized ribbon structures, but how this is achieved at central synapses without ribbons is unclear. Here we examine vesicle mobility at excitatory cerebellar mossy fibre synapses which sustain transmission over a broad frequency bandwidth. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching in slices from VGLUT1<sup>Venus</sup> knock-in mice reveal 75% of VGLUT1-containing vesicles have a high mobility, comparable to that at ribbon synapses. Experimentally constrained models establish hydrodynamic interactions and vesicle collisions are major determinants of vesicle mobility in crowded presynaptic terminals. Moreover, models incorporating 3D reconstructions of vesicle clouds near active zones (AZs) predict the measured releasable pool size and replenishment rate from the reserve pool. They also show that while vesicle reloading at AZs is not diffusion-limited at the onset of release, diffusion limits vesicle reloading during sustained high-frequency signalling."

At these synapses, vesicular release is sustained by a large number of highly mobile vesicles (<a href=\"#bib34\">Holt et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rea et al., 2004</a>) and a ribbon-like scaffold that is thought to rapidly capture and deliver vesicles to the release sites (<a href=\"#bib26\">Griesinger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Khimich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">LoGiudice et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Graydon et al., 2014</a>). Downstream of ribbon synapses, sensory information is transmitted by conventional synapses formed by afferent and sensory nuclei neurons that sustain rate-coded signalling over a broad frequency bandwidth (<a href=\"#bib76\">Taschenberger and von Gersdorff, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Saviane and Silver, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bagnall et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hallermann et al., 2010</a>). Some of these conventional synapses, such as those formed by cerebellar mossy fibre terminals (MFTs) or vestibular nerve fibres, have a readily releasable pool (RRP) of only 1\u20132 vesicles per AZ, which are docked and primed and ready for release. A much larger releasable pool (RP) containing 200\u2013300 vesicles resides nearby and these vesicles can be supplied to the AZ, docked and primed at a combined rate of 40\u201380 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (with all three steps referred together as reloading) to refill the RRP (<a href=\"#bib68\">Saviane and Silver, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hallermann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">McElvain et al., 2015</a>). Even when the large RP is depleted by sustained high-frequency stimulation, release rates of 7\u20138 s<sup>\u22121</sup> can be sustained by replenishment from a large vesicle reserve pool (R) at these synapses (<a href=\"#bib68\">Saviane and Silver, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">McElvain et al., 2015</a>). Because these conventional synapses lack ribbons, and central synapses are thought to contain mostly immobile vesicles (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jordan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lemke and Klingauf, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Shtrahman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2012</a>), it is unclear how vesicles are supplied to AZs during sustained high-frequency signalling."

Presynaptic terminals are packed with macromolecules and cytoskeletal elements, as well as vesicles and mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harris and Weinberg, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wilhelm et al., 2014</a>). The rate of vesicle diffusion will therefore be determined not only by the cytoplasmic viscosity, but by the cytoskeletal matrix (<a href=\"#bib48\">Luby-Phelps et al., 1987</a>) and organelles including vesicles (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gaffield et al., 2006</a>), as well as binding to these elements (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shtrahman et al., 2005</a>) via fine protein connectors (<a href=\"#bib73\">Siksou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Busnadiego et al., 2013</a>). These factors, together with the tortuous paths required to diffuse around large organelles, are thought to explain why vesicle mobility in crowded presynaptic terminals is substantially lower than that of vesicle-sized beads in cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib48\">Luby-Phelps et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gaffield et al., 2006</a>). Hydrodynamic interactions between vesicles are another potentially important determinant of their mobility. Hydrodynamic forces arise from the displacement of fluid as nanoscale objects move through solution. Studies of protein diffusion in red blood cells and bacteria (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doster and Longeville, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ando and Skolnick, 2010</a>) show hydrodynamic interactions reduce the mobility of macromolecules. Moreover, studies of colloidal suspensions of vesicle-sized beads demonstrate hydrodynamic interactions are particularly strong in crowded environments, when the volume fraction of the diffusing objects is high (<a href=\"#bib80\">van Blaaderen et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Tokuyama and Oppenheim, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Segr\u00e8 et al., 1995</a>). However, nothing is known about how hydrodynamic interactions affect vesicle mobility within axon terminals. Quantifying the physical determinants of vesicle mobility within crowded presynaptic terminals could therefore provide new insights into vesicle supply at central synapses."

Our results establish that most vesicles within MFTs are highly mobile and hydrodynamic interactions and vesicle collisions are major determinants of their mobility. Moreover, simulations of vesicle diffusion at 14 reconstructed AZs indicate that, while vesicle diffusion does not limit vesicle reloading at the onset of sustained high-frequency signalling, it does limit vesicle reloading at late times due to significant vesicle depletion near the AZ. The simulations also predict both the size of the functional RP and the vesicle replenishment rate from the reserve pool."

To assay vesicle mobility, we positioned a diffraction-limited laser focal spot within a MFT and recorded fluorescence using the confocal spot detection method. The intensity of a brief bleaching pulse was set to produce a modest reduction in fluorescence (~35%) to ensure the bleached volume did not extend significantly beyond the core of the illumination point-spread function of our microscope (iPSF; FWHM <i>xy</i> = 0.30 \u00b5m, <i>z</i> = 1.32 \u00b5m; e<sup>\u22122</sup> volume = 0.31 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>). Fluorescence was monitored before and after the bleaching pulse using brief low-intensity probe pulses that produced little cumulative bleaching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, red circles). Since the iPSF was considerably smaller than the MFTs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, blue spot), which are typically 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u00b5m, we made multiple FRAP recordings from several locations within the same MFT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). While the individual FRAP measurements were variable, fluorescence almost always exhibited a strong recovery within 10 s (grey lines) indicating unbleached and bleached vesicles were free to move in and out of the confocal volume. The mean fluorescence recovery was determined for each MFT by averaging the individual FRAP measurements (black circles). To determine whether fluorescence recovery varied between MFTs, we calculated the fluorescence at two times, 1 s (<i>f</i><sub>1s</sub>) and 5 s (<i>f</i><sub>5s</sub>), during the recovery.

However, there was a small but consistent increase in fluorescence after 2 s due to slow tissue drift (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). A simple linear correction for the drift allowed a more accurate estimate of the control FRAP curve (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Together, these results confirm our FRAP measurements reflect the diffusion of vesicles within MFTs, suggest vesicle mobility is reduced by the presence of a network of actin filaments in the cytoplasm, and indicate synapsin has little impact on vesicle mobility within the interior of MFTs."

We quantified D<sub>long</sub> of vesicles in MFTs by fitting our average control FRAP curve to an analytical solution of the diffusion equation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axelrod et al., 1976</a>). This gave D<sub>long</sub> = 0.018 \u00b1 0.005 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s for the raw control FRAP curve and 0.025 \u00b1 0.003 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s after correcting for tissue drift (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, red line; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In contrast to the diffusion model, which matched our data closely, the fit of a model of directed flow (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axelrod et al., 1976</a>) was poor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, yellow line). Moreover, the fit of the weighted sum of the diffusion and flow models converged on diffusion (98%), suggesting diffusion underlies vesicle mobility in MFTs. Because some of the assumptions underlying the analytical diffusion model only approximated our experimental conditions, we also used 3D finite-difference reaction-diffusion simulations that explicitly modelled these conditions (Materials and methods). The FRAP simulation that best matched the drift-corrected data had a D<sub>long</sub> similar to that obtained with the analytical solution (p=0.84, F-test; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, blue line). A\u00a0comparison of our best estimate for D<sub>long</sub> in MFTs (0.025 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s) with that estimated at other synapses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) indicates vesicle mobility is higher in MFTs than at other conventional central synapses and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), but comparable to that measured at ribbon synapses."

To quantify vesicle and mitochondrial densities within the central region of MFTs, where our FRAP measurements were predominantly made, we performed serial-section EM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Quantitative analysis of 3D volumes (0.2\u20130.4 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>, <i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a03) revealed a vesicle density of 3930 \u00b1 262 per \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> (or 118 \u00b1 8 per \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> in 2D) in regions not occupied by mitochondria, consistent with previous measurements from MFTs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</a>). To convert this density into a volume fraction, we estimated the mean volume occupied by a vesicle by performing high-resolution 3D electron tomography on MFTs. Vesicle diameters exhibited an approximately normal distribution with a mean of 41.1 \u00b1 0.2 nm (256 vesicles around 3 AZs; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), again consistent with previous measurements (<a href=\"#bib63\">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</a>). Taking into account vesicle membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib75\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>), and the cubic relationship between vesicle radius and volume, indicates the mean volume occupied by a vesicle is equivalent to a sphere with 44 nm diameter. Using this diameter, we computed a vesicle volume fraction of 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 of the non-mitochondrial volume (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The average volume fraction occupied by mitochondria was 0.28 \u00b1 0.04. Hence, this analysis shows the central region of the MFT is a highly crowded environment with 40% of the volume occupied by vesicles and mitochondria."

Since simulations mimicked conditions of live tissue, we corrected our measured vesicle diameter for the 11% tissue shrinkage in fixed tissue (<a href=\"#bib41\">Korogod et al., 2015</a>) giving an equivalent diameter of 49 nm. The spatial extent of the bleaching reaction was set by the iPSF, and the average fluorescence during the probe pulses was computed by spatially weighting the fluorescence according to the measured confocal PSF (cPSF) of our microscope (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, right; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Approximately 300 vesicles were located within the cPSF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, left). When the timing and intensity of the bleaching reaction were set to match the bleaching and probe pulses used in our FRAP experiments, FRAP curves from the Monte Carlo simulations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) exhibited remarkably similar behaviour to our experimental FRAP curves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

The log of the <math id=\"inf2\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msup><mi>\u03c7</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mstyle></math> calculated from the simulated and experimental FRAP curves had a minimum at D<sub>short</sub> = 0.060 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s and a 25% immobile fraction (68.3% confidence intervals 0.055\u20130.070 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s and 24\u201325%, respectively). To better understand how vesicle collisions reduce vesicle mobility, we examined how vesicle diffusion, computed from the mean square displacement (MSD) of the mobile vesicles, changed as a function of time (D(<i>t</i>) = MSD/6<i>t</i>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). At short times, before any vesicle collisions, D(<i>t</i>) \u2248 D<sub>short</sub> (0.060 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s). At longer times, however, as vesicles collided with themselves and mitochondria, D(<i>t</i>) fell to a steady-state value of 0.025 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s. Hence, over the 10 s period of our FRAP experiment, D(<i>t</i>) reached a similar D<sub>long</sub> estimated from our analytical and finite-difference approaches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Indeed, comparison of the FRAP curve computed from our best-match Monte Carlo simulation with that computed from our best-match finite-difference simulation\u00a0showed a close match (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These results indicate steric interactions introduce a pronounced time dependence to vesicle diffusion and over long timescales vesicle collisions reduce vesicle mobility by a factor of 2.4 (i.e. D<sub>long</sub>/D<sub>short</sub> = 0.42)."

Adding immobile vesicles further reduced the diffusion coefficient of the mobile vesicles (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gaffield et al., 2006</a>) and as the fraction of immobile vesicles increased, this effect became increasingly nonlinear. Finally, adding mitochondria reduced vesicle mobility to a similar extent across all vesicle densities (blue open circles). For conditions within MFTs, the reduction in vesicle mobility due to collisions between mobile vesicles was 30%, while that due to collisions with immobile vesicles and mitochondria was 13% and 32%, respectively.

Unlike steric interactions, hydrodynamic interactions occur on a very fast timescale, so their effect on vesicle diffusion can essentially be considered instantaneous. To estimate the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on vesicle diffusion in MFTs, we used an analytical approach that is accurate across a wide range of volume fractions (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tokuyama and Oppenheim, 1994</a>). We quantified the effect of hydrodynamic interactions by calculating the ratio of D<sub>short</sub> to the \u2018free\u2019 unhindered diffusion coefficient of a single vesicle in cytoplasm (D<sub>cyto</sub>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, D<sub>short</sub>/D<sub>cyto</sub> shows an approximately linear relationship with vesicle volume fraction (red line). However, introduction of randomly dispersed immobile vesicles at 25% produced a nonlinear dependence between D<sub>short</sub>/D<sub>cyto</sub> and the total vesicle volume fraction (blue line; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Muthukumar, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Michailidou et al., 2009</a>).

                                "text": "As hydrodynamic interactions act on a microsecond timescale, the vesicle diffusion coefficient D(<i>t</i>) is expected to decrease from D<sub>cyto</sub> to D<sub>short</sub> almost instantaneously (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). On the other hand, vesicle collisions take longer to occur, so their effect on D(<i>t</i>) is expected to occur on a millisecond to second timescale. At these longer timescales, both hydrodynamic and steric interactions are therefore present. The different timescales of hydrodynamic and steric interactions suggest they can be treated as independent processes, allowing their combined effect to be calculated via a simple multiplication: D<sub>long</sub>/D<sub>cyto</sub> = D<sub>short</sub>/D<sub>cyto</sub>\u00a0\u00d7 D<sub>long</sub>/D<sub>short</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; red circles and black line; <a href=\"#bib54\">Medina-Noyola, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">van Blaaderen et al., 1992</a>). For the conditions at the centre of MFTs, the combined effect of hydrodynamic interactions and vesicle collisions resulted in an 80% reduction in vesicle mobility (D<sub>long</sub>/D<sub>cyto</sub> = 0.19; dashed blue line). This suggests the diffusion coefficient of dilute vesicles in cytoplasm, in the absence of crowding effects, is 0.127 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s, which is only a factor of 3.5 lower than that of dilute 50 nm beads in the cytoplasm of 3T3 cells at 37\u00b0C (0.45 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s; <a href=\"#bib48\">Luby-Phelps et al., 1987</a>). A likely explanation of the lower value of D<sub>cyto</sub> for vesicles than beads is that vesicle protein interactions with the cytomatrix slow vesicle mobility."

We refer to the region of diffusible space extending from each AZ face as the vesicle \u2018cloud\u2019. Vesicle density within the vesicle cloud was calculated either by counting the number of vesicle centre points falling within its boundaries, or by computing the volume fraction occupied by the vesicles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, bottom; red circles and blue line respectively). The vesicle density reached 5652 \u00b1 377 per \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> at 30 nm from the AZ. This corresponds to a volume fraction of 0.25, assuming a vesicle diameter of 44 nm in fixed tissue, which is 50% higher than the volume fraction at the center of MFTs (0.17). Vesicle density declined with distance from the AZ, converging to the density estimated at the centre of the MFT for distances &gt;100 nm. These results suggest an accumulation of vesicles extends ~2 vesicle diameters from the AZ. The total number of vesicles increased monotonically with distance from the AZ, from 2 \u00b1 1 within 22 nm, to 48 \u00b1 6 within 100 nm and 252 \u00b1 34 within 300 nm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top).

To examine this, we quantified the spatial dependence of the vesicle density assuming all of the space surrounding the AZ is diffusible (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, bottom; black circles). This approach gave a similar estimate of the vesicle density close to the AZ, but beyond 150 nm from the AZ the density rapidly declined, reaching 15% of the peak value by 400 nm from the AZ. This suggests that, beyond 150 nm, intracellular organelles, cytoskeletal barriers and/or curvature of the plasma membrane create a significant amount of non-diffusible space (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Indeed, quantification of the mean distance from the AZ to the nearest mitochondrial membrane revealed mitochondria are located within 270 \u00b1 20 nm (n\u00a0=\u00a029) of the AZ. These results suggest that the diffusible space available to vesicles is restricted near the AZ of MFTs and that vesicle density only increases above that found in the MFT interior within 100 nm of the AZ release face."

We assumed D<sub>cyto</sub> was identical to that measured in the centre of the MFT and regions outside the vesicle cloud consisted of non-diffusible space since these regions contained no vesicles in the EM reconstructions. The most distal regions of the vesicle cloud were coupled to a large reserve of vesicles to mimic replenishment from the centre of the MFT. Hydrodynamic interactions were simulated using analytical expressions that accounted for local variations in vesicle density and the effect of the plasma membrane, which reduced vesicle mobility as vesicles approached the AZ (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In our initial simulations, vesicles that collided with the AZ were instantaneously \u2018released\u2019 without any delay.

To investigate this, we focussed on later times (50\u2013100 s) when the cumulative number of vesicles supplied to the AZ increased linearly with time, indicating the supply rate was constant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>, blue line). The slope of the linear portion of the cumulative supply functions gave a mean vesicle supply rate of 7 \u00b1 1 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>) which is remarkably similar to the vesicle release rates per release site measured at MFTs (8 s<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Saviane and Silver, 2006</a>) and vestibular nerve synapses (7 s<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#bib53\">McElvain et al., 2015</a>) during long trains of stimuli.

The close agreement between our experimentally constrained models of vesicle diffusion at AZs and experimental measurements suggests vesicular release is diffusion-limited during sustained high-frequency signalling once the RRP and RP are depleted. Examination of vesicle density close to the AZ during sustained release revealed that it falls dramatically, reaching a steady state after ~20 s (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, control conditions). However, vesicle mobility increased substantially during vesicle depletion due to reduced hydrodynamic and steric interactions, resulting in a shallow concentration gradient and a constant vesicle supply rate at late times."

Interestingly, removing steric interactions (by shrinking vesicles to points) had little additional effect to removing hydrodynamic interactions at early and intermediate times (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). However, at late times, removing vesicle collisions increased vesicle supply to the AZ by a factor of 2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,G,H</a>) consistent with their effect on vesicle mobility over long time scales (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

For open geometries, the average vesicle supply rate at early times was the same as that for the control geometries (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

To examine the limiting case, we assumed the total time for docking and priming (\u03c4<sub>d+p</sub>) was equal to the measured RP\u2192RRP vesicle reloading time at these AZs (16.7 ms; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, the initial release rate was lower than that for conditions of instantaneous release and, after the RRP was released, the vesicle release rate became limited by \u03c4<sub>d+p</sub> and the release probability (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). However, at later times during the train (&gt;1 s), the release rate converged with that for instantaneous release, indicating that it had become limited by the diffusion-mediated vesicle supply (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Back extrapolation analysis of cumulative release at late times during the 100 Hz train gave estimates for the limiting vesicle release rate and RP size that were similar to that obtained with instantaneous release, irrespective of whether 1 or 2 release sites were present (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,F,G</a>). These more realistic simulations of release during 100 Hz trains therefore support our finding that vesicle release becomes diffusion-limited during sustained high-frequency signalling. Furthermore, back extrapolation analysis of the open-geometry condition revealed that the release rate rapidly becomes limited to ~30 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, resulting in a RP pool of only 2 \u00b1 1 vesicles (i.e. close to the RRP; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013G</a>). While the exact values of the functional pool estimated from back extrapolation of the open-geometry condition may be prone to some error, because of its small size and the fact that the replenishment rate is higher than the release rate (<a href=\"#bib59\">Neher 2015</a>), the more than 100-fold reduction in the RP estimate compared to that for measured vesicle clouds shows that the diffusible space around the AZ is a major determinant of the RP pool size."

Our results show 75% of vesicles within cerebellar MFTs are highly mobile, and hydrodynamic interactions and vesicle collisions arising from organelle crowding are major determinants of vesicle mobility. 3D reconstructions of 14 AZs from high-resolution serial-section EM revealed \u2018clouds\u2019 of vesicles near the AZ exhibiting variable shapes and sizes. Simulations of vesicle diffusion at these reconstructed AZs suggest that, at early times during high-frequency presynaptic activity, diffusion-mediated vesicle supply is substantially faster than the experimentally measured vesicle reloading rates. However, at later times, during prolonged presynaptic activity, when the RP becomes depleted, the rate of vesicular release becomes limited by diffusion-mediated supply to the AZ. These AZ simulations predict the size of the experimentally measured RP and the vesicle replenishment rate from the reserve pool. Hence, our results identify the major physical determinants of vesicle diffusion within the crowded environment of presynaptic terminals, show vesicle mobility at an excitatory central synapse is comparable to that at ribbon synapses and suggest passive diffusion limits vesicle supply to AZs during sustained high-frequency release. Moreover, our results provide a structural basis for the functionally defined ~300 vesicle RP at MFT AZs."

Fast hydrodynamic interactions arising from fluid displacement influence vesicle mobility on both short (microsecond) and long (millisecond to second) timescales. In contrast, effects of vesicle collisions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gaffield et al., 2006</a>) are only felt on long time scales. The combined effects of these interactions result in a vesicle diffusion coefficient that evolves with a characteristic time course that depends on the\u00a0vesicle density (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Given the strength of hydrodynamic interactions in crowded environments, it is surprising their effects have only recently been investigated in biological systems in the context of protein diffusion (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doster and Longeville, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ando and Skolnick, 2010</a>). Our results extend these studies by showing hydrodynamic interactions are likely to be a major determinant of vesicle diffusion in synaptic terminals. Indeed, taking account of hydrodynamic and steric interactions arising from vesicle crowding explains much of the discrepancy between D<sub>long</sub> of vesicles and 50 nm beads in cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib48\">Luby-Phelps et al., 1987</a>). Hence, our results identify the main physical determinants of vesicle mobility in a central axon terminal and highlight the need to consider hydrodynamic interactions within crowded intracellular environments."

                                "text": "By quantifying how hydrodynamic and steric interactions vary with vesicle volume fraction and the fraction of immobile vesicles, it is possible to predict the vesicle mobility near the AZ and across different types of synapses (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). At MFTs our quantitative model of vesicle mobility predicts that vesicle diffusion slows down from 0.025 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s within the MFT interior to 0.012 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s in the vicinity of the AZ. Thus, physical interactions slow vesicle mobility even in the absence of binding to tethers and connectors (which could slow diffusion further to 0.002 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s). For ribbon-type bipolar cells, which have a vesicle density comparable to MFTs, our model of vesicle mobility predicts D<sub>long</sub> = 0.014 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s, which matches well to the value measured in goldfish (0.015 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s; <a href=\"#bib34\">Holt et al., 2004</a>), but cannot account for the exceptionally high mobility found in lizard (<a href=\"#bib64\">Rea et al., 2004</a>). Nevertheless, our framework does predict the low vesicle mobility at the NMJ (predicted 0.006 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s vs. measured 0.005 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gaffield and Betz, 2007</a>), where vesicle density is more than double that within the MFT (0.33 vs. 0.17 volume fraction). Measurements of vesicle mobility in small central synapses are more numerous but highly variable. Our modelling predicts that D<sub>long</sub> is low within the middle of the vesicle cluster in small boutons (0.002 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s). This is similar to some FRAP-based estimates (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shtrahman et al., 2005</a>) and recent single-vesicle tracking measurements (0.003 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al. 2012</a>). Moreover, our predicted D<sub>long</sub> falls within the wide range of estimates of vesicle mobility using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, pink symbols; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yeung et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jordan et al., 2005</a>), but these estimates depend on the diffusion/binding model applied (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jordan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Shtrahman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yeung et al., 2007</a>). Synapsin-based immobilization of vesicles appears prevalent in small boutons (<a href=\"#bib62\">Orenbuch et al., 2012</a>), consistent with reports that most vesicles are immobile (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shtrahman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, there is a\u00a0rapid vesicle exchange with the axon (<a href=\"#bib74\">Staras et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Herzog et al., 2011</a>) where mobility is high (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Our simulations suggest that the low mobility of vesicles in small central synapses is largely due to strong steric and hydrodynamic interactions arising from the high vesicle density. Moreover, although the presence of tethers/connectors will restrict vesicle mobility further, their effects will only be strong if they have long lifetimes (i.e. slow unbinding). While the properties of vesicle mobility within small synapses is still uncertain, our results show that to understand the variations in vesicle mobility across synapses, it is necessary to account for the physical interactions arising from organelle crowding."

Our analysis shows\u00a0that on average\u00a0there\u00a0are only 2 vesicles at the AZ face, suggesting few vesicles are docked and release ready at each AZ. This potentially explains why multi-vesicular release (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2001</a>) is not a dominant form of release at MFTs (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sargent et al., 2005</a>). Away from the AZ face, the vesicle density falls to a level comparable to the density measured at the centre of the MFT. The accumulation of vesicles at the AZ face has a similar spatial extent as the AZ cytomatix protein Bassoon (~100 nm), which speeds vesicle reloading at MFTs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hallermann et al., 2010</a>) possibly via vesicle clustering (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mukherjee et al., 2010</a>). Our experimentally constrained simulations suggest diffusion can supply vesicles to the AZ at the onset of high-frequency signalling (&lt;100 ms) faster than the measured vesicle reloading rates of 40\u201380 s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), even in the presence of protein filament connectors and tethers (<a href=\"#bib73\">Siksou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Busnadiego et al., 2013</a>). This suggests factors other than diffusion, such as docking and priming, limit vesicle reloading at the onset of sustained release. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms that speed docking and priming (<a href=\"#bib58\">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</a>) would therefore be most effective at accelerating vesicle reloading at the early stages of high-frequency signalling, but increasing vesicle mobility or reducing the immobile fraction would be effective later, once vesicle depletion occurs."

Remarkably, 3D AZ reconstructions predict the size of the RRP and our simulations predict the RP from the spatial positions of the vesicles, the diffusible space surrounding the AZ and our model of vesicle mobility. Furthermore, once the RP is depleted, our simulations predict a vesicle supply rate of 7 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, which matches the release rates of 7\u20138 s<sup>\u22121</sup> recorded at these synapses (<a href=\"#bib68\">Saviane and Silver, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">McElvain et al., 2015</a>). Because glutamate refilling is 100-fold slower than these rates (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hori and Takahashi, 2012</a>), rapid local endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib83\">Watanabe et al., 2013</a>) is unlikely to be responsible for these limiting rates. Our results therefore suggest that, during sustained high-frequency release, vesicle supply from the reserve pool to the AZ is limited by vesicle diffusion from the interior of the MFT. Thus, diffusion rather than docking and priming potentially limits the rate at which continuous sensory variables, such as head velocity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arenz et al., 2008</a>) and joint angle (<a href=\"#bib81\">van Kan et al., 1993</a>), are transmitted. Moreover, the fact that increasing diffusional access to the AZ effectively eliminates the functionally defined RP indicates the shape and extent of the vesicle cloud associated with an AZ is a major determinant of the RP, because it sets the rate of supply from the reserve pool. This structural property could therefore contribute to the heterogeneous functional properties of MFTs (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sargent et al., 2005</a>) originating from different precerebellar nuclei (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chabrol et al., 2015</a>). Thus, our results provide the structural basis for a functionally defined vesicle pool and show diffusion ultimately limits vesicle supply during sustained high-frequency signalling at a central synapse."

To do this, the distance from a vesicle\u2019s centre to the nearest point of the AZ face was measured for each vesicle and a histogram of the distances constructed using 22 nm bins. In order to compute the vesicle density as a function of distance to the AZ, we limited the diffusible space to the outermost extremity of the vesicle \u2018cloud\u2019. To do this, we divided the space surrounding the AZ into 44 nm voxels and defined voxels as diffusible only if they contained any part of a vesicle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The vesicle density was computed within the cloud as a function of distance from the AZ by sorting the diffusible voxels as a function of their distance to the AZ and counting the number of vesicle centre points that fell within each bin and dividing by the sum of the voxel volumes. The vesicle density was also calculated by subdividing the 44 nm voxels into 4.4 nm voxels and computing the volume of voxels that fell within the vesicles and dividing by the total volume of the diffusible voxels. To calculate the vesicle density when assuming all space surrounding the AZ is diffusible, we divided the vesicle count as a function of distance from the AZ (22 nm bins, as described above) by the space surrounding the AZ in 22 nm thick bands."

While assumptions (1), (2) and (3) are reasonable for our experimental paradigm, assumptions (4\u20137) may not be strictly correct. To test assumptions (4) and (5), we used a 3D finite-difference reaction-diffusion simulation approach (see below) that explicitly modelled the bleaching and probe pulses and the spatial properties of the iPSF and cPSF of our microscope (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Comparison of the fit to our drift-corrected control data (where D<sub>long</sub> = 0.025 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s) to a finite-difference simulation with D<sub>long</sub> = 0.025 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s showed a close agreement, with only a slightly slower rate of recovery for the finite-difference simulation (not shown; t<sub>1/2</sub> = 0.58 vs. 0.66 s). Only a small increase in D<sub>long</sub> to 0.028 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s of the finite-difference simulation was necessary to produce matching FRAP curves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Similarly, to test assumptions (4\u20137), we used a 3D Monte Carlo simulation approach (see below) that included long cylindrical mitochondria, which form non-diffusible regions and are therefore likely to introduce anisotropic diffusion. Nevertheless, we found a close agreement to the finite-difference simulation that simulates a homogeneous concentration with isotropic diffusion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Using a combination of 3D ultrastructural analysis, measurements of vesicle diffusion and simulations, the authors convincingly conclude that vesicle diffusion is the main rate limiting factor in vesicle supply, which is surprising as this would limit the impact of vesicle tethering and priming processes at least on a long time scale, previously considered to be the critical rate limiting step in preparing vesicle for fusion."

However, exactly this fact might account for the differences in measured SV mobilities compared to hippocampal boutons: the confocal volume for FRAP or FCS measurements in the latter case almost inevitably contains the volume close to the active zone (in axial direction the volume extends far beyond the small bouton boundaries). This is less likely the case in FRAP experiments in the MFTs which measured 7 to 10 \u00b5m according to the authors: thus, rather volumes in the middle of the MFT at some distance to the AZs where the SV density is lowest (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) are probed. Although multiple or at least three measurements were made per terminal at different locations the large axial extent of the bleaching volume implies that mostly volumes away from the small AZs are covered. Given this and that the '3D reconstructions revealed the AZs of MFTs are small and surrounded by a cloud of vesicles that is highly variable in shape and extent', could the measured fast rates of fluorescence recovery predominantly reflect fast SV movements at the fringes of these SV clouds and even in-between clusters from different AZs? Here, overall SV densities are small and thus the dynamics might be much higher than within the densely packed areas close to the AZ, where SVs in EM tomograms even appear interconnected by short filaments, which might highly reduce their mobility."

This error is larger for higher replenishment rates, which could explain the low RRP for the open geometry. Since in the simulations all vesicles are tractable, accurate estimates of the replenishment rates over time should be calculated and used for more accurate RRP estimates in the default- and open geometry."

Primed vesicles in the RRP are most likely docked at/tethered to the membrane via (partial?) assembly of SNARE-complexes and are therefore not free to diffuse (?). One would expect that this stabilizes an RRP of a certain size, independent of the geometry of the diffusible space but dependent on the number of available docking sites. This is supported by the fact that deletion of priming molecules like Munc13 and Munc18 produce a complete loss of RRP without affecting the geometry of the terminal. The impact of molecular priming on the RRP in the diffusion model should be discussed in the context of this evidence."

However, exactly this fact might account for the differences in measured SV mobilities compared to hippocampal boutons: the confocal volume for FRAP or FCS measurements in the latter case almost inevitably contains the volume close to the active zone (in axial direction the volume extends far beyond the small bouton boundaries). This is less likely the case in FRAP experiments in the MFTs which measured 7 to 10 \u00b5m according to the authors: thus, rather volumes in the middle of the MFT at some distance to the AZs where the SV density is lowest (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) are probed. Although multiple or at least three measurements were made per terminal at different locations the large axial extent of the bleaching volume implies that mostly volumes away from the small AZs are covered. Given this and that the '3D reconstructions revealed the AZs of MFTs are small and surrounded by a cloud of vesicles that is highly variable in shape and extent', could the measured fast rates of fluorescence recovery predominantly reflect fast SV movements at the fringes of these SV clouds and even in-between clusters from different AZs? Here, overall SV densities are small and thus the dynamics might be much higher than within the densely packed areas close to the AZ, where SVs in EM tomograms even appear interconnected by short filaments, which might highly reduce their mobility.</i>"

Under these conditions diffusion-based vesicle supply becomes rate limiting for release and the presence of connectors has little effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>).

In the revised manuscript we now define 3 pools in the Introduction (first paragraph). Vesicles belonging to the readily releasable pool (RRP) are those that are docked and primed at the face of the AZ. Our EM data suggests there are ~2 vesicles docked at each small AZ (145 nm diameter). In contrast, vesicles in the releasable pool (RP) correspond to the ~300 non-docked vesicles per AZ, but they must be supplied to the AZ, then docked and primed (with all three steps referred to as reloading) before they transition to the RRP. Finally, vesicles in the reserve pool (R) correspond to a still larger pool that are supplied more slowly and are presumably further away from the AZ. We now illustrate these pools and their experimentally measured transition rates in a cartoon (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Moreover, the cumulative vesicle release plots of our Monte Carlo simulations did not reach steady state for control conditions until after 20 seconds. For this reason we did not attempt to estimate the RRP with the back extrapolation method. Instead, we estimated the RP (plus RRP) which is large (~300 vesicles per AZ), and since the R-&gt;RP replenishment rate is slow, the error due to back extrapolation should be relatively small. We now discuss the back extrapolation method and the pitfalls highlighted in Neher (2015) in the context of our analysis (first paragraph of Discussion)."

                    "text": "For the open-geometry simulations there is a much higher diffusion-mediated supply rate (~55 Hz) than for the control AZ simulations. Since little vesicle depletion occurs during prolonged release under open-geometry conditions, equalization of release and replenishment rates occurred rapidly, resulting in a small number of vesicles being released before the release rate becomes constant. To examine this in more detail, we carried out more realistic simulations of release during a 100 Hz train, which included the measured RP-&gt;RRP reloading rate and a release probability (new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). While this did not alter the RP size estimated from the reconstructed AZ simulations with back extrapolation under control conditions (237 for instantaneous release vs. 217 for 100 Hz train), the RP estimated for open-geometry conditions was substantially reduced compared to instantaneous release (16 for instantaneous release vs. 2 for 100 Hz train) as predicted by Neher (2015). While it is clear that starting with a full RRP and having fast replenishment is likely to add some error in these latter estimates, the fact that the RP for the open geometry is 100-fold lower than the RP for the measured control cloud geometry, and is close to the size of the tiny RRP, confirms that the cloud geometry is a major determinant of the functional RP. Indeed, these simulations indicate that, when the diffusional barriers that define the extent of the vesicle cloud are removed, the RP no longer exists as an entity, with only the RRP and an effectively infinite reserve pool remaining. We now link these results to vesicle depletion and mobility during sustained release for the different simulation conditions (see new <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, since the physical extent of the pool identified with back extrapolation is unclear, we now describe it as the size of the pool of vesicles that can be depleted before release and supply rates equalize (excluding those replenished during that time; Results section, subsection \u201cModels of diffusion-limited vesicle supply to the Az during sustained release\u201d). This allows a more intuitive explanation of these effects since it is easy to understand why the geometry of the diffusible space around the AZ sets the R-&gt;RP supply rate."

Primed vesicles in the RRP are most likely docked at/tethered to the membrane via (partial?) assembly of SNARE-complexes and are therefore not free to diffuse (?). One would expect that this stabilizes an RRP of a certain size, independent of the geometry of the diffusible space but dependent on the number of available docking sites. This is supported by the fact that deletion of priming molecules like Munc13 and Munc18 produce a complete loss of RRP without affecting the geometry of the terminal.

Indeed, we have carried out an extensive set of simulations that include both tethers (filaments attaching vesicles to the AZ face) to multiple docking sites and connectors (filaments between vesicles), systematically varying the binding kinetics and number. While inclusion of these flexible 10 nm filaments within 150 nm of the release face can sustain the higher concentration of vesicles within 100 nm of the AZ release face, they still allow vesicle-AZ collisions to occur at well above the measured reloading rate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>).

A recent paper (Schotten et al. <i>eLife</i>, 2015) argues that their effects are predominantly to lower the activation energy for fusion rather than the AZ hit rate. This conclusion is based on measurements of hypertonic-solution evoked release and modelling of the activation energy for vesicle fusion and on the observation that hypotonic solutions specifically release primed vesicles (Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996), which are bound to the plasma membrane with the fusion machinery preassembled, and are not therefore affected by diffusion-limited vesicle supply. Indeed it is difficult to predict how rapid cell shrinking would affect diffusion-based supply, since it is unclear whether the increase in the concentrations of vesicles or slowing of diffusion by steric and hydrodynamic interactions and viscosity will increase or decrease the AZ hit rate. Since our study is focused on supply from the RP and reserve pools, we feel that discussing how sucrose affects the RRP is beyond the scope of this study."
