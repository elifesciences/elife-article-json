Inspired by a series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures, we designed synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown. The new ternatin variants are cytotoxic toward cancer cells, with up to 500-fold greater potency than ternatin itself. Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe, we identify the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A\u00b7GTP\u00b7aminoacyl-tRNA) as a specific target and demonstrate competitive binding by the unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. We conclude that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products."

Inspired by a series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures, we designed synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown. The new ternatin variants are cytotoxic toward cancer cells, with up to 500-fold greater potency than ternatin itself. Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe, we identify the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A\u00b7GTP\u00b7aminoacyl-tRNA) as a specific target and demonstrate competitive binding by the unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. We conclude that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products."

Cyclic peptide natural products, especially those containing one or more <i>N</i>-methyl (or <i>N</i>-alkyl) amino acids, comprise a privileged class of macrocycles due to their modular structure, relative ease of synthesis, intrinsic cell permeability, and constrained three-dimensional architectures (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bockus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Giordanetto and Kihlberg, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hewitt et al., 2015</a>). Examples of cyclic peptides with well characterized cellular targets include cyclosporin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Liu et al., 1991</a>), trapoxin and romidepsin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Taunton et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nakajima et al., 1998</a>), and cotransin/CAM741 and decatransin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Besemer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Garrison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Junne et al., 2015</a>). These macrocyclic compounds target conserved eukaryotic proteins that play essential roles in calcium-mediated signaling (cyclophilin/calcineurin), epigenetic regulation (histone deacetylases), and secretory protein biogenesis (Sec61 translocon), respectively. In addition to serving as drugs and potential leads for cancer and immune diseases, these cyclic peptides have proven to be useful as chemical probes, revealing new cellular roles for their target proteins, as well as mechanistic insights into the biochemical processes they orchestrate."

Motivating the current study, ternatin's molecular target and mechanism of action were completely unknown. While searching for cyclic peptides that, like ternatin, incorporate a \u03b2-hydroxy leucine, we found a patent application that describes partially elucidated structures of five related cyclic heptapeptides isolated from an <i>Aspergillus</i> fungus in Malaysia (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blunt et al., 2010</a>).

Using the ternary complex assembled from eEF1A, GTP, and Phe-tRNA, we found that didemnin and ansatrienin could compete with photo-ternatin <b>5</b> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). Similarly, didemnin and ansatrienin abolished photo-labeling of the 50-kDa band in cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), further supporting the assignment of this band as eEF1A.

We tested these cell lines for cross-resistance to our most potent ternatin variant <b>4</b>.

The strengths of the manuscript include (1) Synthesis and discovery of a new derivative, ternatinA4, with significantly improved cellular activity over ternatin itself. (2) Demonstration, once again, of the use of photo-leucine, as a useful tool to help detect binding proteins of cyclic peptides. (3) Elucidation of the mode of action of the ternatin family of natural products and identification of the eEF1A-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA complex as the target. Though ternatin and its analog ternatinA4 are not the first translation inhibitors targeting eEF1A, their structural simplicity and ease of synthesis renders them more ideal leads for future drug development. (4) The data are of high quality and convincing."

The authors use similarities between ternatin and other reported cytotoxic natural products to design hybrid compounds (3 and 4), and these molecules are more potent as cell death inducing agents. After showing these compounds inhibit protein synthesis, the authors use a series of labeling studies (utilizing derivative 5) to infer that eEF1A is the biological target. Interestingly, the authors never apparently confirm this target with mass spec (as is standard nowadays) but instead use resistant cell lines that have mutations in this target, and some in vitro experiments, to connect the compound to the target. Overall this type of target ID work is messy and difficult and the authors are commended for doing a very nice job with this study."

The authors began with an astute detective work to identify the relationship between ternatin and some of highly potent antiproliferative cyclic peptides disclosed in the patent literature. They then synthesized a few analogs and identified one (ternatin analog #4 or ternatinA4) with 20- to 50-fold higher potency than the ternatin itself in a large number of cancer cell lines. Based on limited structure-activity relationship, an active photo-affinity label with a clickable handle was made and used to detect a 50-kD protein from cell extract. Guided by the effect of ternatin and analogs on translation elongation, the authors guessed that the 50-kD protein is eEF1A, a GTPase that is involved in the loading of charged tRNA during the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Subsequently, the authors found that ternatinA4 indeed bound to eEF1A in a GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA dependent manner, suggesting that ternatin bound to the ternary complex of eEF1A, GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA. To confirm that eEF1A is the bona fide target for ternatinA4, the authors took advantage of a known Ala399 mutant of eEF1A that was recently reported to confer resistance to another elongation inhibitor nannocystin A. Indeed, the same A399V mutant was found to confer resistance to ternatinA4 to cells and lost binding to ternatinA4. Moreover, the authors also demonstrated that the known eEF1A inhibitors didemnin B and ansatrienin B could both compete against the ternatin photo-affinity label for binding to eEF1A, suggesting that they share the same target."

(2) Demonstration, once again, of the use of photo-leucine, as a useful tool to help detect binding proteins of cyclic peptides. (3) Elucidation of the mode of action of the ternatin family of natural products and identification of the eEF1A-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA complex as the target. Though ternatin and its analog ternatinA4 are not the first translation inhibitors targeting eEF1A, their structural simplicity and ease of synthesis renders them more ideal leads for future drug development.
