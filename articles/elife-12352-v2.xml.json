The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood. To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions, we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict. We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times. These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), followed by medial frontal cortex (mFC) and then by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics, and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex."

The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood. To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions, we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict. We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times. These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), followed by medial frontal cortex (mFC) and then by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics, and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex."

These responses corresponded with the subject\u2019s reaction time, changed depending on the exact nature of the task, and even reflected the subjects\u2019 errors.

An important case of cognitive control arises when input stimuli elicit conflicting responses and subjects must select the task-relevant response despite competition from an often stronger but task-irrelevant response (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miller, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Miller and Cohen, 2001</a>). A canonical example of this type of conflict is the Stroop task: subjects are asked to name the font color of a word where the semantic meaning conflicts with the color signal (e.g. the word 'red' shown in green versus red). Such incongruent inputs lead to longer reaction times, attributed to weaker signals (color processing) that must be emphasized over the automatic processing of word information (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stroop, 1935</a>). The Stroop task is frequently used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology and forms the foundation for theories of cognitive control."

Lesion studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen and Servan-Schreiber, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Perrett, 1974</a>), human neuroimaging measurements (<a href=\"#bib21\">Egner and Hirsch, 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">MacDonald, 2000</a>), and macaque single unit recordings (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnston et al., 2007</a>) implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in providing top-down signals to bias processing in favor of the task-relevant stimuli (<a href=\"#bib5\">Botvinick et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Miller and Cohen, 2001</a>). The medial frontal cortex (mFC) also participates in cognitive control, possibly in a conflict monitoring capacity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Botvinick et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rushworth et al., 2004</a>). Recordings and lesions studies in the macaque anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ito et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nakamura et al., 2005</a>) suggest that ACC neurons are principally involved in monitoring for errors and making between-trial adjustments (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Braver, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ito et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Johnston et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Roth\u00e9 et al., 2011</a>)\u2014an idea that has received support by a recent study in the human ACC (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sheth et al., 2012</a>). Recent work has also demonstrated that the supplementary motor area and the medial frontal cortex play an important role in monitoring for errors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonini et al., 2014</a>). An alternative and influential theoretical framework posits that the ACC monitors for potential conflicts and subsequently directs the dlPFC to engage control processes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Botvinick et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shenhav et al., 2013</a>). Several human neuroimaging studies are consistent with this notion (<a href=\"#bib4\">Botvinick et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kerns, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kerns et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">MacDonald, 2000</a>) but the relative contributions of dlPFC, mFC, and ACC to cognitive control remain a matter of debate (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aarts et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cole et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fellows and Farah, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mansouri et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Milham and Banich, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Milham et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rushworth et al., 2004</a>)."

The challenge in dissociating the relative roles of these regions during Stroop-like tasks is that increased task difficulty recruits a host of executive functions (attention, decision-making, uncertainty, cognitive control). These functions are associated with neural activity spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds and the underlying dynamics are difficult to untangle with the low temporal resolution of existing neuroimaging techniques (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shenhav et al., 2013</a>). Human single neuron studies provide millisecond resolution but have focused on individual regions (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sheth et al., 2012</a>). We took advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in human epilepsy patients and the ability to record simultaneously from multiple regions to directly investigate the dynamics of conflict responses during cognitive control. We hypothesized that subregions of frontal cortex could be differentiated based on the temporal profile of their conflict responses. We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1397 electrodes in 15 subjects while they performed the Stroop task or a variation in which they were asked to read the word instead of focusing on its color."

Several analyses link these signals to cognitive control. Neural responses increased for incongruent compared to congruent trials, and these signals correlated with behavioral reaction time, depended on the task, and exhibited adaptation over trials. We compared pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes to disassociate these different regions based on the timing of these conflict responses rather than their presence or absence. Conflict responses emerged first in the ACC and subsequently emerged in dlPFC and mFC and finally in OFC. These observations propose a plausible flow of signals underlying cognitive control."

For the Stroop task, subjects made more errors during incongruent trials (average error rate: 5 \u00b1 3%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 paired t-test), as demonstrated in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bugg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Egner and Hirsch, 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kerns et al., 2004</a>). There was no difference in the number of error trials during the Reading task (<i>P =</i> 0.76, paired t-test). Subsequent analyses focused on correct trials only unless otherwise stated. Subjects\u2019 reaction times also had a significant interaction between stimulus type and task (F = 65.2, <i>P</i> &lt; 10<sup>\u20135</sup>, ANOVA). Consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stroop, 1935</a>), subjects\u2019 response times during the Stroop task were delayed for incongruent trials compared to congruent trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, average delay: 215 \u00b1 93 ms, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, paired t-test, see also <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> for individual subject data).

The Gratton effect was present in all four frontal regions and there were no statistically significant differences in the strength of the effect across regions (F = 0.25, <i>P\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.86, ANOVA). To control for reaction time effects on these comparisons, we ran an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for a main effect of trial history on the gamma power with the behavioral reaction time as a covariate (Materials and methods). The neural Gratton effect during the Stroop task persisted under these controlled conditions (<i>P</i> = 0.0002, multilevel model). We also explicitly ruled out reaction time differences by subsampling to match the reaction time distribution between conditions, with similar results (<i>P</i> = 0.01, multilevel model). Together, these results suggest that the neural signals described here code for an internally perceived level of conflict that exhibits conflict adaptation and correlates with the across-trial variability in reaction times."

We also examined the responses elicited in the broadband signals (1 to 100\u2009Hz) as well as in the theta, (4 to 8\u2009Hz), beta, (9 to 30\u2009Hz), and low gamma (30\u201370\u2009Hz) bands. No conflict selective responses were observed in the broadband signals or low gamma band. We found conflict-selective responses both in the theta and beta bands (see example in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013f</a>). Across theta and beta frequency bands, we also observed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task (theta: <i>P</i> &lt; 10<sup>\u20135</sup>, beta: <i>P</i> &lt; 10<sup>\u20134</sup>, multilevel model). Consistent with the results reported in the gamma frequency band, conflict responses in the theta and beta bands were more prominent during the Stroop task compared to the Reading task (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast to the results in the gamma band, power in the theta and beta bands <i>decreased</i> during incongruent trials. Furthermore, power in the theta and beta frequency bands was not correlated with reaction times (theta: <i>P</i> = 0.43, beta: <i>P</i> = 0.09, sign-rank test)."

In particular, several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of the gamma band is coupled to the phase of slower oscillations in the theta band (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canolty et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oehrn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tort et al., 2008</a>). We therefore examined the degree of cross-frequency coupling between the signals in the gamma and theta bands (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with previous studies, we found that 50% of the electrodes demonstrated significant theta-gamma coupling. However, the strength of this coupling was not different between congruent and incongruent trials across the population of conflict-selective electrodes (<i>P</i> = 0.52, sign-rank test)."

Yet, error monitoring has also been ascribed to frontal cortical circuits (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shenhav et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yeung et al., 2004</a>). To investigate whether the same electrodes responding to conflict are also involved in successful error monitoring, we analyzed the neural signals during self-corrected trials. In these trials, subjects initially made an erroneous response and rapidly corrected themselves with the right answer. Given the high performance level of all subjects, the number of such trials is low. However, these trials are particularly interesting because we can be certain that there was successful error detection (as opposed to error trials without any self-correction). An example self-corrected trial from the ACC electrode shown previously is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>. The subject initially made an incorrect response (green), which was rapidly followed with the correct response (red). Increased gamma power was observed after onset of the erroneous response. In contrast, the following corrected behavioral response exhibited no such post-response signal. Additionally, these error-monitoring signals were not observed in correct incongruent trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), and were consistent across the n =\u00a011 self-corrected trials for this subject (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <i>P</i> = 0.001, signed rank test). Another example electrode is shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>. There were only two subjects contributing n = 7 conflict-signaling electrodes that had a sufficient number of self-correction trials (greater than five trials) for this analysis. For each electrode, we compared the difference in neural signals during the one-second post-response window between the initial error and the following self-correction. Of those n = 7 electrodes, n = 5 electrodes showed evidence of error monitoring (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, sign-rank test). Although the number of electrodes and trials in this analysis is small, these results provide a direct correlate of error monitoring signals. Furthermore, these results highlight that the same electrodes that respond to conflict leading up to the behavioral response can also show post-response error monitoring."

To examine the dynamics of cognitive control orchestrating the transformation of conflicting visual signals to motor outputs, we compared, across those four regional groups, the latencies relative to behavioral response onset at which the congruent and incongruent trials could be discriminated. Comparing latencies across regions is difficult, especially across subjects with varying reaction times. For a controlled and direct comparison, we restricted the analysis to compute the latency differences between pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes. This within-subject pairwise analysis had increased power to examine the relative dynamics between frontal lobe areas (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The relative latencies were significantly different across the regions (<i>P</i> = 0.01, permutation test, post-hoc testing was controlled for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure, Materials and methods). Conflict responses in the ACC preceded those in all the other frontal lobe regions, followed 207 \u00b1 40 ms later by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 388 \u00b1 83 ms later by medial frontal cortex. Signals in orbitofrontal cortex emerged 319 \u00b1 78 ms after dlPFC. This entire processing cascade took approximately 500 ms. For comparison, subjects\u2019 behavioral reaction times to incongruent trials were 1105 \u00b1 49 ms. The latency difference between ACC and dlPFC is based on 6 electrode pairs: one ACC electrode and six simultaneously recorded dlPFC electrodes. There was only one pair of simultaneous recordings between ACC and OFC and we do not report this value in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. The other region comparisons have contributions from multiple electrodes in multiple subjects (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>).

Conflict responses throughout the other frontal cortex regions also demonstrated the neural Gratton effect, suggesting a more distributed network involved in across-trial adaptation than previously hypothesized. The physiological responses in these areas were stronger in cI trials (incongruent trials that were preceded by congruent trials) than iI trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). While the increased activity in cI trials compared to iI trials is consistent with neuroimaging studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Botvinick et al., 1999</a>), single neuron recordings in a different Stroop-like task report the opposite relationship (iI &gt; cI) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sheth et al., 2012</a>).

Single unit recording in macaque ACC typically find error monitoring signals but not conflict-selective responses (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cole et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Emeric et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ito et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Taylor et al., 2006</a>), see however (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ebitz and Platt, 2015</a>), whereas human neuroimaging studies report both types of signals in ACC. There has been significant debate concerning whether action monitoring and conflict detection represent distinct processes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carter et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carter et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Swick and Turken, 2002</a>). Because both processes may co-occur on the same trials, high temporal resolution is required to disassociate the two computations. A recent human intracranial study has found error signals in supplementary motor area and medial frontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonini et al., 2014</a>), and a human single unit study reported conflict signals in ACC (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sheth et al., 2012</a>). The current work demonstrates the coexistence of both error signals and conflict signals. The analysis of the few self-correction trials in our data suggests that the same areas responsible for pre-behavioral conflict signals can also produce post-behavioral response error-monitoring signals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In addition, the relative timing of the conflict and error signals surrounding the neural responses confirms computational predictions based on a connectionist architecture to explain the mechanisms of conflict (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yeung et al., 2004</a>) and scalp EEG studies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hughes and Yeung, 2011</a>).

Previous work has suggested differential roles for distinct oscillatory components of the local field potential (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kahana et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Ullsperger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">von Stein and Sarnthein, 2000</a>). There were clear differences in the type of information conveyed by distinct frequencies components. Lack of significant correlations with reaction time in the theta and beta bands suggests that the gamma band better captures the behavior. Additionally, conflict responses were characterized by increased power in the gamma band, but decreased power in the theta and beta bands (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Previous scalp EEG recordings (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Ullsperger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">van Driel et al., 2015</a>) have demonstrated that conflict and/or error trials elicit increased theta power, suggesting potentially interesting differences in how theta is captured across spatial scales. We also observed a decrease in beta power, which is consistent with previous studies that correlate frontal cortex activation with desynchronization in the beta band and increased synchronization in the gamma bands (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crone et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Crone et al., 1998b</a>). Differences across tasks, recording methods, and targeted regions should be interpreted with caution. The roles of different oscillatory components in neocortex are not clearly understood. One possibility is that lower frequency bands reflect the summed dendritic input of the nearby neural population (<a href=\"#bib35\">Logothetis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mitzdorf, 1987</a>) and can act as channels for communication (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</a>), whereas higher frequency bands represent the population spiking rate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buzsaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</a>). Along these lines, we speculate that the theta desynchronization we observe could reflect a reduction of inputs, leading to inhibition of the prepotent but erroneous response."

By comparing pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes, we found that conflict responses in the ACC lead the dlPFC by ~200 ms. Medial frontal cortex is anatomically close and extensively connected to the ACC, and the two regions are often grouped together (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cavanagh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004</a>). Yet, conflict responses in the mFC trail the ACC by hundreds of milliseconds, suggesting an important distinction between the two regions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rushworth et al., 2004</a>). The relative latency measurements place the OFC at the bottom of this cascade. The hierarchical cascade of processes described here is consistent with predictions from mechanistic models of cognitive control (e.g. see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in <a href=\"#bib54\">Shenhav et al, Neuron 2013</a>). In particular, stimulus related signals are evident along the ventral visual stream early on and feed onto frontal cortex, where we find that ACC activity precedes activity in other frontal regions, followed by dlPFC, and finally mFC, and OFC."

The relatively long delays between regions are also particularly intriguing. There are monosynaptic connections that link these four regions within frontal cortex and yet, it takes 100\u2013200 ms to detect the relative activation between these areas (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Given that (1) reaction times are different for the cI versus iI trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and (2) gamma power is significantly correlated with reaction time in incongruent trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we would expect differences in gamma power in cI versus iI trials. To control for this potential confounding effect in our measurements of trial history dependence, we applied two methods. First, for each electrode, we performed an ANCOVA on the gamma power with trial history (cI or iI, for example) as the group and reaction time as a covariate. We computed the regression line, extracted the RT-adjusted gamma power from the y-intercept and used this value in the group analysis. Second, we performed a matched reaction time analysis, where the distribution of reaction times was equalized by subsampling the trials in a histogram-matching procedure with 200\u00a0ms bins. This resulted in using only ~50% of the trials. The same analysis was then applied to this reaction time matched dataset."

Instantaneous phase and amplitude was extracted with the Hilbert Transform. For the Stroop and Reading Task separately, the MI was computed as the Kullback-Leiber distance between the phase-amplitude histogram and a uniform distribution. For comparison between tasks, the number of trials was equalized. This MI was compared against a surrogate distribution generated by randomly lagging the time series across 1000 repetitions. Similar results were obtained with the measure defined in Canolty et al. (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canolty et al., 2006</a>). Results were also similar when a surrogate distribution was created by randomly pairing low-frequency phase with high-frequency power from different trials."

This finding is consistent with a recent crop of theoretical perspectives on frontal lobe function, which have generally placed cingulate in the role of recruiting dorsolateral PFC when there is a demand for cognitive control."

The neurons they examined all showed response-selective activity, and the 'conflict' activity seen at the population level turned out to reflect non-linear modulation of response-related activity when responses competed. This always struck me as a very serious problem for the 'conflict monitoring' theory. The question is how the present authors can rule out this kind of explanation for their own results. The second paragraph of the subsection \u201cConflict responses in frontal cortex\u201d reports that \u03b3-band power was invariant to the particular word-color combination presented, which makes it sound like the neural responses being recorded were not response specific. If this were indeed the case, then it would clearly rule out a Nakamura-Olson scenario. And this conclusion would be possible if the data being reported involved single-neuron recordings. However, it is not clear that the reported findings, in an ECoG setting where you're seeing population-level effects, can rule out this alternative interpretation."

We first determined whether the neural responses were modulated by conflict and obtained n=51 electrodes across our electrode population (paragraph four, subsection \u201cConflict responses in frontal cortex\u201d). From this subset of electrodes, we considered all possible pairs of <i>simultaneously recorded electrodes</i> across regions (i.e. within the same subject, subheading \u201cRegional differences in conflict response latencies\u201d). This requirement significantly lowers the number of possible pairs: electrode locations are purely dictated by clinical reasons and we did not always have simultaneous pairs for all possible combinations of regions. It is difficult to derive the number of electrode pairs in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> (e.g. 36 in the question above) from the number of electrodes in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> (e.g. 24 in the question above).

Thus, if there were few electrode pairs for a given comparison, the same few pairs would also be driving the latency differences in the null distribution.

The neurons they examined all showed response-selective activity, and the 'conflict' activity seen at the population level turned out to reflect non-linear modulation of response-related activity when responses competed. This always struck me as a very serious problem for the 'conflict monitoring' theory. The question is how the present authors can rule out this kind of explanation for their own results. The second paragraph of the subsection \u201cConflict responses in frontal cortex\u201d reports that \u03b3-band power was invariant to the particular word-color combination presented, which makes it sound like the neural responses being recorded were not response specific. If this were indeed the case, then it would clearly rule out a Nakamura-Olson scenario. And this conclusion would be possible if the data being reported involved single-neuron recordings. However, it is not clear that the reported findings, in an ECoG setting where you're seeing population-level effects, can rule out this alternative interpretation.</i> "

                    "text": "We thank the reviewers for raising this important question. It is indeed the case that the neural responses where we observe conflict-selective signals were not response-selective. We do observe sensory responses selective to color or word along the ventral visual stream as well as motor selective responses in motor cortex (now mentioned briefly in paragraph three, Results). However, out of the n=51 conflict- selective electrodes in frontal cortex, we observe response-specific signals in only 1 electrode. Thus, <i>at the level of EcoG field potentials</i>, the modulation by conflict cannot be simply explained on the basis of selectivity to specific color/word combinations."

Although some investigators have claimed that \u03b3 power in field potential signals reflects population-firing rates from the underlying neuronal populations (Manning et al., 2009; Ray and Maunsell, 2011), the relationship between spikes and field potentials is more complex (Buzsaki et al., 2012). We cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons in these areas show stronger selectivity to specific color/word combinations and that this is averaged out in our signals. We now discuss this point in paragraph five, Discussion."
