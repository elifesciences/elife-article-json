We now report that complete genetic deficiency for the COPII component SEC24A is compatible with normal survival and development in the mouse, despite the fundamental role of SEC24 in COPII vesicle formation and cargo recruitment. However, these animals exhibit markedly reduced plasma cholesterol, with mutations in <i>Apoe</i> and <i>Ldlr</i> epistatic to <i>Sec24a</i>, suggesting a receptor-mediated lipoprotein clearance mechanism. Consistent with these data, hepatic LDLR levels are up-regulated in SEC24A-deficient cells as a consequence of specific dependence of PCSK9, a negative regulator of LDLR, on SEC24A for efficient exit from the ER. Our findings also identify partial overlap in cargo selectivity between SEC24A and SEC24B, suggesting a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the recruitment of secretory proteins to the COPII vesicles that extends to soluble as well as trans-membrane cargoes."

We now report that complete genetic deficiency for the COPII component SEC24A is compatible with normal survival and development in the mouse, despite the fundamental role of SEC24 in COPII vesicle formation and cargo recruitment. However, these animals exhibit markedly reduced plasma cholesterol, with mutations in <i>Apoe</i> and <i>Ldlr</i> epistatic to <i>Sec24a</i>, suggesting a receptor-mediated lipoprotein clearance mechanism. Consistent with these data, hepatic LDLR levels are up-regulated in SEC24A-deficient cells as a consequence of specific dependence of PCSK9, a negative regulator of LDLR, on SEC24A for efficient exit from the ER. Our findings also identify partial overlap in cargo selectivity between SEC24A and SEC24B, suggesting a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the recruitment of secretory proteins to the COPII vesicles that extends to soluble as well as trans-membrane cargoes."

Proteins synthesized by the ribosomes attached to the rough ER are generally transferred to another structure within the cell, the Golgi apparatus, where they undergo further processing and packaging before being secreted or transported to another location within the cell."

Both copies of <i>SEC23</i> are derived from the same ancestral gene, and all four copies of <i>SEC24</i> are derived from a different ancestral gene, and the availability of these copies potentially expands the range of properties that the vesicles can have. Insight into the roles of each SEC protein has come from work with <i>SEC</i> mutants. For example, a mutation in <i>SEC23A</i> was found to cause skeletal abnormalities in humans."

Following synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-membrane and soluble proteins co-translationally inserted into the ER are packaged into transport vesicles coated with COPII (coat protein complex II) for export from the ER and delivery to the Golgi for further processing (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2004</a>). The assembly of the COPII coat is initiated at ER exit sites upon activation of the GTPase SAR1, which recruits the inner-coat heterodimer SEC23/SEC24, followed by the assembly of the outer-coat heterotetramer SEC13/SEC31 to generate carrier vesicles destined for the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gurkan et al., 2006</a>)."

The SEC31/SEC13 outer-coat regulates the size and rigidity of COPII coats to package specialized cargos (<a href=\"#bib16\">Copic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jin et al., 2012</a>). Mammals express multiple paralogous forms of COPII, including two SAR1 GTPases (SAR1A/B), two SEC23s (SEC23A/B), four SEC24s (SEC24A-D), as well as two SEC31s (SEC31A/B), thus expanding the repertoire of potential COPII coat structures (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wendeler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zanetti et al., 2011</a>). Biochemical and structural studies of the COPII complex have identified multiple cargo recognition sites on SEC24 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Miller et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bickford et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gurkan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mancias and Goldberg, 2008</a>). The four mammalian SEC24 paralogs can be divided into two subfamilies, SEC24A/B and SEC24C/D, sharing \u223c60% sequence identity within but only \u223c25% identity across subfamilies (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mancias and Goldberg, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zanetti et al., 2011</a>).

Mutations in human <i>SAR1B</i> result in chylomicron retention disease (Anderson Disease), a distinct defect in fat absorption due to reduced chylomicron assembly and secretion by intestinal enterocytes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jones et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Annesi et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, missense mutations in human <i>SEC23A</i> result in a characteristic syndrome of malformations restricted to the craniofacial skeleton (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boyadjiev et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2010</a>), with similar skeletal abnormalities observed in SEC23A-deficient zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lang et al., 2006</a>). Mutations in human <i>SEC23B</i> result in the autosomal recessive disorder congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II, with abnormalities restricted to the hematopoietic erythroid compartment (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bianchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schwarz et al., 2009</a>). Surprisingly, although red blood cells appear grossly normal in SEC23B-deficient mice, these animals die at birth due to dramatic destruction of the pancreas (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tao et al., 2012</a>)."

In contrast, murine SEC24D deficiency results in very early embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baines et al., In press</a>). Here, we report that complete deficiency of SEC24A is compatible with normal development and survival in mice. However, these animals exhibit markedly reduced plasma cholesterol due to selective blockade in the secretion of PCSK9, a circulating factor that negatively regulates cell surface LDL receptor expression."

Removal of the FRT-flanked gene trap and selection cassette by <i>Flpe</i> recombinase generated the <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>fl</i></sup> allele, which can be converted to the null <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>-</i></sup> allele by <i>Cre</i> recombinase. <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>+/cgt</i></sup> or <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>+/gt2</i></sup> intercrosses both produced offspring with all three genotypes at the expected Mendelian ratios (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Thus, specific dependence of SREBP/SCAP on SEC24A for ER-Golgi transport could potentially account for the aberrant cholesterol metabolism in SEC24A-deficient mice. To test this hypothesis, we performed mRNA-Seq (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mortazavi et al., 2008</a>) to examine the hepatic transcriptome in <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

To distinguish these two mechanisms, we crossed <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup> mice with <i>Apoe</i> null mice, in which receptor-mediated clearance of cholesterol-rich lipoprotein remnant particles from the plasma is inhibited due to loss of the critical lipoprotein particle component APOE. Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib48\">Piedrahita et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhang et al., 1992</a>), <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed markedly elevated cholesterol levels (272 \u00b1 13 mg/dl, n = 8). However, in contrast to the \u223c45% reduction in plasma cholesterol observed in mice singly deficient for <i>Sec24a</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), the plasma cholesterol levels in <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup> mice (277 \u00b1 14 mg/dl, n = 7) were indistinguishable (p&gt;0.8) from singly <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> littermates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Thus, <i>Apoe</i> is epistatic to <i>Sec24a</i>, suggesting that SEC24A may regulate cholesterol metabolism via the receptor-mediated clearance pathway. To further test this hypothesis, we also crossed <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup> mice into the <i>Ldlr</i> null background. Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ishibashi et al., 1993</a>), <i>Ldlr</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited markedly elevated plasma cholesterol levels (211 \u00b1 9 mg/dl, n = 14). Doubly deficient <i>Ldlr</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup> mice also displayed similarly elevated plasma cholesterol levels (197 \u00b1 12 mg/dl, n = 11), indistinguishable (p&gt;0.35) from their <i>Ldlr</i><sup>-/-</sup> littermates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that reduction in plasma cholesterol in SEC24A-deficient mice could result from increased clearance of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins by the LDLR. Consistent with this hypothesis, immunoblotting demonstrated elevated LDLR levels in liver protein extracts or in proteins bound to a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) matrix from <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup> mice compared to littermate controls, whereas other proteins including APOE, APOB48/100, or APO-A1 showed little alteration in the liver (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Since hepatic <i>Ldlr</i> transcripts remained unaltered in <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup> by both mRNA-Seq and qPCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), these data indicate that the reduction in LDLR protein levels in SEC24A-deficient mice was mediated via a translational or post-translational mechanism."

Belfeldin A (BFA) disrupts the Golgi apparatus and consequently the delivery of ER-derived COPII vesicles along the secretory pathway. When BFA was applied to a 293T cell line stably expressing PCSK9 fused with a C-terminal FLAG tag (PCSK9-FLAG), PCSK9 secretion into the medium was abolished and the protein accumulated intracellularly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). To directly test whether the COPII machinery plays a role in ER exiting of PCSK9, we employed permeabilized 293T cells stably expressing PCSK9-FLAG in an in vitro COPII vesicle budding assay. In the presence of rat liver cytosol supplying COPII components, along with ATP and GTP, PCSK9 was packaged into COPII vesicles that sedimented in a high-speed pellet fraction, together with the classic COPII cargo SEC22B, but not the ER resident protein roboporin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). ER budding of PCSK9 and SEC22B-containing vesicles were inhibited by GTPyS as well as constitutively active SAR1 (SAR1A H79G), both of which prevent GTP hydrolysis and subsequently COPII vesicle budding from the ER membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Inhibition of COPII vesicle formation in cells by SAR1B H79G also prevented secretion of PCSK9 into the medium, with corresponding intracellular accumulation of the protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

However, examination of these animals uncovered an unexpected reduction in plasma cholesterol due to a specific block in the secretion of PCSK9, a circulating regulator of cell surface LDL receptor (<a href=\"#bib17\">Costet et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Horton et al., 2009</a>). Genetic crosses demonstrate that both <i>Apoe</i> and <i>Ldlr</i> are epistatic to <i>Sec24a</i>, suggesting that SEC24A primarily affects receptor-mediated cholesterol clearance of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Consistent with these genetic data, hepatic LDLR levels are up-regulated in SEC24A deficient mice as a consequence of a specific dependence of PCSK9 on SEC24A for efficient exit from the ER. Our findings also identify a partial overlap in cargo selectivity between SEC24A and B, and suggest a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the recruitment of secretory proteins to the COPII vesicles that extends to soluble as well as trans-membrane cargos."

This notion is supported by the diverse phenotypes observed in vertebrates with selective deficiency of a single SEC24 paralog. The mammalian subfamily of SEC24A/B exhibits greater sequence identity than SEC24C/D to the essential yeast gene product SEC24p, with SEC24C/D closer to the non essential yeast gene products LST1p and ISS1p (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peng et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mancias and Goldberg, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zanetti et al., 2011</a>). However, SEC24A-deficient mice are remarkably normal, aside from reduced plasma cholesterol. Even the more severe neural tube closure defect in SEC24B-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib39\">Merte et al., 2010</a>) stands in stark contrast to the very early embryonic lethality in SEC24D-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baines et al., In press</a>)."

Our data, together with those of Merte et al. (<a href=\"#bib39\">Merte et al., 2010</a>), suggest that intrinsic cargo selectivity among SEC24 paralogs is a key determinant of SEC24 function. The latter authors demonstrated specific dependence of VANGL2, a key component of the planar cell polarity signaling pathway, on the SEC24B paralog for ER exiting (<a href=\"#bib39\">Merte et al., 2010</a>). Our findings identify PCSK9 as a specific SEC24A-dependent COPII cargo. Although all four SEC24 paralogs are expressed in the liver, loss of SEC24A disrupts PCSK9 secretion without affecting other COPII-dependent processes such as SREBP activation. SEC24B exhibits limited compensation for SEC24A, with combined genetic deficiencies providing no evidence for functional overlap with SEC24D. These data suggest overlapping cargo specificities between the members of the SEC24A/B subfamily, yet distinct from SEC24C/D. Furthermore, steady state levels of SEC24B, but not SEC24C/D, are increased in the absence of SEC24A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), although SEC24B mRNA levels remain constant. These data imply that SEC24A/B are balanced in a cytoplasmic pool distinct from SEC24C/D. Taken together, our data raise the possibility of extensive heterogeneity among COPII vesicles and their function in cargo selection and export, determined at least in part by SEC24 paralog composition."

Structural studies have revealed distinct cargo binding sites among SEC24 paralogs that recognize different sorting signals in specific trans-membrane cargos (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mancias and Goldberg, 2008</a>). Nevertheless, whether and how soluble cargos are selectively transported via COPII vesicles remain to be fully defined (<a href=\"#bib62\">Warren and Mellman, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jensen and Schekman, 2011</a>)."

The selective dependence of PCSK9 on SEC24A (and to a lesser extent on SEC24B), is inconsistent with this model. Indeed, PCSK9 represents the first example of a soluble vertebrate cargo that is differentially regulated by specific interaction with selective components of the COPII machinery. This specificity might be conferred by a cargo receptor that recruits PCSK9 into COPII vesicles for efficient secretion, in contrast to the bulk flow of more abundant soluble secretory proteins (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Warren and Mellman, 1999</a>)."

Additionally, TANGO1 localized to ER exit sites facilitates loading of bulky cargos such as collagen VII (<a href=\"#bib51\">Saito et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2011</a>). The existence of a PCSK9 ER cargo receptor has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nassoury et al., 2007</a>), but its identity has been unclear. Alternatively, COPII vesicles coated by SEC24C/D might exclude selected soluble cargos such as PCSK9. Additional cytosolic factor may also contribute to the selectivity among SEC24 paralogs as observed in the case of VANGL2 sorting (<a href=\"#bib39\">Merte et al., 2010</a>). Taken together with the broad range of specific phenotypes observed for human and murine mutations in the genes for individual COPII components, our findings suggest the potential for considerable heterogeneity in the COPII machinery, enabling the accommodation of diverse cargos."

Although genome-wide association studies for plasma lipid phenotypes have not identified a significant contribution from common genetic variants in the <i>SEC24A</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib60\">Teslovich et al., 2010</a>), a role for rare alleles at this locus cannot be excluded. Complete deficiency of SEC24A, even in the presence of haplo-insufficiency of SEC24B, is compatible with survival and normal development in the mouse, suggesting that pharmacologic inhibition of hepatic SEC24A expression/function to achieve reduction in plasma cholesterol may be well tolerated as a potential approach to inhibit PCSK9 scretion."

Using ERANGE software (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mortazavi et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"http://woldlab.caltech.edu/gitweb\">http://woldlab.caltech.edu/gitweb</a>), the unique reads falling on the gene models and splice reads derived from splice junctions of genes were recorded. Following the author's recommendation, the unique reads were also re-evaluated by assessing a first-pass reads per KB per millions reads (RPKM), and the unique reads were subsequently re-calculated with weights computed during the first pass. All candidate regions that were within a 20 kb radius of a gene, a default parameter recommend by the script author, were reported. Final exonic read density (final RPKM) was determined according to the expanded exonic read density. Differential expression analysis was performed to compare wild type vs <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>gt/gt</i></sup>. To obtain robust variance estimates, we empirically estimated the gene variance levels as a function of the average normalized read count per gene. Specifically, the gene-wise variance levels were estimated by calculating the differences in expression between samples for each gene, using local regression to predict the absolute value of the log-difference based on log<sub>2</sub>-read counts, and then estimating the variance using the standard sample variance formula and Fisher's Z distribution as in the methods of the eBayes function in the limma R package and in the IBMT method (<a href=\"#bib56\">Smyth, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sartor et al., 2006</a>). This results in a moderated variance test that accounts for the dependence of variance on gene length and expression level. The variance estimates are expected to be slightly conservative, due to the assumption that relatively few genes are truly differentially expressed. Given the variance estimates, z-scores and p-values were calculated for each gene. Fold changes on the read counts (normalized per million bp) were calculated, and the p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benjamini et al., 2001</a>). FDR &lt; 0.05 and a fold change &gt; 2 cut-off were used to select final up- and down-regulated gene lists. In addition to the gene level analysis, read counts and fold changes were also calculated using ERANGE for individual exons. Based on the counts of reads of individual exons and samples for each gene, Fisher's exact tests were performed to identify significant changes in expression ratios across exons, indicating differential splicing between the samples. Fisher's exact p-values were also adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR approach. Reverse transcription was performed with the Superscript II cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). The iQ SYBR Green Supermix (ABI) was used for quantitative RT-PCR as previously described (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2008</a>). PCR primers are listed under \u2018Primer sequences.'"

The authors provide evidence that this surprising result is caused by a reduction in secretion of PCSK9, a protein that binds the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor and promotes receptor degradation. The authors demonstrate convincingly that the knockout mice have reduced levels of circulating PCSK9 coupled with increased levels of both the ER-form of PCSK9 and of the LDLR in the liver. This is all consistent with the hypocholesterolemia in the <i>Sec24a</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice being due to a deficiency in PCSK9 secretion, as hypothesized by the authors."

These studies, combined with studies of other SEC24 isoform knockout mice, demonstrate differential requirements for COPII subunits in cargo selection at the ER. The relative selectivity of SEC24A for protein secretion is remarkable and of general interest. Since PCSK9 is a soluble cargo molecule, these data suggest that a PCSK9 cargo receptor may exist."

The deficient cytosols exhibited decreased activity in the generation of PCSK9-containing COPII vesicles, most marked in the SEC24A/B double knockdown experiments. These data have now been added as Figure 8d\u2013f in the revised manuscript. A similar reduction in the efficiency of packaging of SEC22B (a SNARE protein) was observed (Figure 8e), however, LMAN1 packaging was not affected. PCSK9 and SEC22B may share a requirement for SEC24A/B whereas LMAN1 was shown as a non-selective COPII cargo. The LMAN1 result also demonstrates that the other COPII proteins were not depleted from the SEC24A/ B knockdown cytosol."

Unfortunately, both mouse liver cytosols failed to exhibit any activity in the COPII vesicle budding assay, even for the classic COPII cargos LMAN1 and SEC22. A similar lack-of-activity was observed using cytosols prepared from mouse brain. We hypothesize that these results reflect the loss of one or more key components during cytosol preparation from mouse tissues, or the presence in these preparations of an inhibitor to the budding reaction. Our anti-SEC24A antibody also failed to exhibit blocking activity in the budding assay. These data are included below:"
