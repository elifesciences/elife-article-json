The stoichiometry between \u03b1 and \u03b2-subunits has been controversial with studies reporting either a strict 2 KCNE1:4 KCNQ1 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. We used <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one (EQ), two (EQQ) or four (EQQQQ) KCNQ1 subunits, to reproduce compulsory 4:4, 2:4 or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed EQQ and EQQQQ to have increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ - all abolished by the addition of KCNE1. As well, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, we found EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates to be progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, which demonstrates that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four \u03b2-subunits within the <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> complex."

The stoichiometry between \u03b1 and \u03b2-subunits has been controversial with studies reporting either a strict 2 KCNE1:4 KCNQ1 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. We used <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one (EQ), two (EQQ) or four (EQQQQ) KCNQ1 subunits, to reproduce compulsory 4:4, 2:4 or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed EQQ and EQQQQ to have increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ - all abolished by the addition of KCNE1. As well, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, we found EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates to be progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, which demonstrates that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four \u03b2-subunits within the <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> complex."

When paired with the accessory \u03b2-subunit, KCNE1, it has unique properties in several tissues, particularly the myocardium and inner ear. In the heart, KCNQ1 and KCNE1 together conduct the slow delayed rectifier current (<i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i>). This current is primarily responsible for stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration at high heart rates (<a href=\"#bib25\">Marx et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ackerman, 1998</a>). Several inherited mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE1 result in the life-threating arrhythmogenic syndromes long QT (LQT) types 1 and 5, short QT type 2 or familial atrial fibrillation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Splawski et al., 2000</a>;<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellocq et al., 2004;</a> <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2003</a>).

However, other experiments have suggested a more flexible stoichiometry with anywhere from one to four \u03b2-subunits associating per KCNQ1 tetramer depending on their concentration (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cui et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Morokuma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zheng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>).\u00a0Most notably, two recent reports both utilizing total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to count \u03b2-subunits by single molecule photo-bleaching reached opposing conclusions. Working in oocytes, Nakajo and colleagues characterized a flexible stoichiometry up to 4:4 that was dependent on the relative density of KCNE1 in the membrane (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>). Using a similar approach in mammalian cells, <a href=\"#bib37\">Plant et al. (2014)</a> reported that KCNQ1 tetramers were only present on the cell surface in a 2:4 or 0:4 stoichiometry with KCNE1. They also found that the 2:4 ratio was not exceeded even in the presence of increasing KCNE1 concentrations. Their observation of a maximum of 2 KCNE1 subunits per tetramer suggests an intrinsic cooperative mechanism preventing the association of a third or fourth \u03b2-subunit during channel assembly."

The channel complexes were evaluated in mammalian cells on their own or in combination with additional independent KCNE1 subunits using whole cell patch clamp, single-channel recordings and UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid approaches. In each instance, we were able to demonstrate that all four of KCNQ1\u2019s exterior clefts are accessible to KCNE1, confirming the variable stoichiometry model for channel complex assembly. In addition, the single channel analysis suggests that a 4:4 stoichiometry of KCNQ1 to KCNE1 maximizes channel conductance."

An additional one or three KCNQ1 subunits were linked to the construct to make EQQ and EQQQQ, respectively (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>).

KCNQ1, EQQQQ, EQQ and EQ were expressed independently in mammalian tsA201 cells and the resulting currents were characterized by whole cell patch clamp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A 4\u2009s isochronal activation protocol ranging from -80 to +100 mV was used to determine the V<sub>1/2</sub> of activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). As is known, KCNQ1 expressed alone had a V<sub>1/2</sub> of -15.5 mV, while the presence of additional tethered \u03b2-subunits resulted in a progressive depolarization of the V<sub>1/2</sub> of activation to a maximum of ~+30 mV, (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and H</a>).

In the presence of excess additional \u03b2-subunits, all the \u03b1-subunit complex configurations had V<sub>1/2</sub>\u2019s equivalent to that of EQ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and H</a>). This convergence of the V<sub>1/2</sub>\u2019s of activation to ~+30 mV, particularly the depolarizing shift of EQQQQ and EQQ, suggests that the independent GFP-tagged \u03b2-subunits can participate in channel gating."

The EQ 4:4 complexes open after a variable delay period and show fairly consistent bursts of opening that are close to 0.5 pA in amplitude. Similar single channel behavior is seen with KCNQ1+KCNE1, (<a href=\"#bib58\">Werry et al., 2013</a>) as also shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. In comparison, it can be seen that EQQ and EQQQQ channels open to lower levels than the EQ channels. In fact, EQQ channels show extremely long residence times in lower sublevels and rarely, or in the case of EQQQQ never, reach the fully open amplitudes seen in the EQ tracings. These observations are confirmed in the all-events amplitude histograms for the constructs, and the current-voltage relationships (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). While for EQ it can be seen that the peak of the events amplitude histogram is at ~0.45 pA, it is only 0.18 pA for EQQ, and barely separable from the closed events distribution in the case of EQQQQ, despite very large numbers of events. The dotted line in the plotted current-voltage relationships (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) refers to a slope conductance of 3.2 pS observed by <a href=\"#bib58\">Werry et al. (2013)</a> from separately co-expressed KCNQ1 and KCNE1. Clearly, the data from the EQ construct overlay the prior published data, and the fit line gives a mean slope conductance of 3.0 pS. However, for EQQ, the mean conductance data gives a value of only 1.3 pS, well below that observed for KCNE1 and KCNQ1 co-expressed separately (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) or as EQ together (p&lt;0.01). Due to the small amplitudes and brevity of EQQQQ openings it was not possible to derive a conductance value."

Here we have analyzed single channel data from EQ and EQQ to compare their striking subconductance occupancy behavior (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The all-points and idealized histograms are shown overlaying each other in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, and the tabulated data below. In EQ we observed the same five sublevels described before for E1 and Q1 expressed separately, plus an additional sixth smaller opening level at 0.08 pA that we did not see as clearly before. Visualizing this level was only possible due to improved signal to noise ratio in the present experiments. Again, EQ had its longest open residency in the second highest sublevel at 0.44 pA (36% of the time spent open), and split its remaining open time fairly evenly across the other sublevels. EQQ visited the same subconductance levels, but spent most of its time at the lower levels, only reaching the 0.44 pA level for 0.6% of the time it spent open. The most commonly occupied subconductance state for EQQ was the 0.29 pA sublevel, which it occupied 34% of the total open time. The data suggest that the open pore architecture of the <i>I<sub>Ks</sub>,</i> channel complex is not altered by the presence of only two E1 subunits in EQQ, just that the stability of higher subconductance levels is reduced to such an extent that their occupancy becomes probabilistically unlikely. This is the explanation for the lower observed single channel conductance of EQQ (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and likely EQQQQ as well."

The UV light excites the side chain\u2019s central ketone, generating a triplet oxygen radical. This short-lived radical can abstract a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom within a 3.1-angstrom radius. The resulting alkyl radical then rapidly reacts with the remaining ketyl radical in Bpa to form a covalent bond (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dorman and Prestwich, 1994</a>). Bpa was incorporated into the KCNE1 sequence using the amber stop codon (TAG) suppression system (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ye et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Xie and Schultz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Young and Schultz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chin and Schultz, 2002</a>). F57 was selected for mutation as it is located within the KCNE1 transmembrane domain and has been previously suggested to interact with KCNQ1 in the channel\u2019s closed state although no physical association has been established (<a href=\"#bib26\">Melman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Goldstein, 2007</a>). Methionine 62 was also mutated to a\u00a0tryptophan as a precaution against an inappropriate start site downstream of the TAG site. The M62W KCNE1 mutation has been previously shown not to impact channel gating, (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Goldstein, 2007</a>) and the same lack of effect was observed here (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Using these approaches we were able to determine that up to four KCNE1\u2019s can interact per KCNQ1 tetramer. Whole cell patch clamp studies indicated that EQQQQ and EQQ have a hyperpolarized voltage dependence of activation compared to EQ or wild type <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i>, which could be normalized by co-expression of additional KCNE1. We also observed the same phenomenon in single channels, where EQQQQ and EQQ had a shorter first latency to open and reduced conductance that equaled EQ and wild type <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> channels when KCNE1 was co-transfected. Finally, our key experiment using a photo-crosslinking unnatural amino acid, unequivocally demonstrated that KCNE1 can incorporate into the EQQQQ and EQQ channel complexes. Taken together, our findings verify that up to four KCNE1 subunits can regulate KCNQ1."

However, this debate has recently coalesced around an opposing idea that <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> has a strict 2:4 ratio of KCNE1\u2019s:KCNQ1\u2019s (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Morin and Kobertz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Plant et al., 2014</a>). This interaction has been investigated using a variety of approaches, including macroscopic currents, pharmacology and most recently by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The report by <a href=\"#bib37\">Plant et al. (2014)</a> utilizing single molecule photo-bleaching counted a maximum ratio of 2 \u03b2-subunits per KCNQ1 tetramer in opposition to a previous study using a similar approach (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>). They suggest a possible explanation for the different conclusions was their use of mammalian cells, representing a better model system than <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes for <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> assembly. Our findings using three different techniques in mammalian cells do not support this difference. We clearly show that an independently expressed KCNE1 can associate with EQQ, so that a stoichiometry greater than 2:4 is possible, and indeed that there is no intrinsic mechanism limiting the association of KCNE1 with the channel complex."

It is notable that the use of these proteins has not always yielded the same result. For example, in the first report of <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> fusion channels, no significant difference between EQQ and EQ channels was found, although a slowing of activation kinetics was observed when EQ and KCNE1 were co-expressed (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 1998</a>). A similar result was also found using EQ and EQQ variants that had 30 mV hyperpolarizing shifts in their V<sub>1/2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2003</a>).\u00a0More recently, two other studies have reported differences in the current-voltage relationship between EQ and EQQ that are consistent with our findings (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>). <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakajo et al. (2010)</a> also reported a small depolarizing shift in the V<sub>1/2</sub> when EQQ was co-expressed with KCNE1 in oocytes. One possible explanation for the differences in behavior could be the composition of the KCNE1-KCNQ1 linker in the fusion proteins. The earlier reports appear to use constructs where the C- and N-termini of KCNE1 and KCNQ1 are directly fused while later studies have inserted flexible linkers. Here, we constructed channels containing 52 and 31 amino acid linkers both of which exhibited a difference in V<sub>1/2</sub> between EQQ and EQ, and when EQQ was co-expressed with KCNE1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is consistent with the other longer E1-Q1 linker studies and suggests that restricting the C- (KCNE1) or N-termini (KCNQ1) may have subtle effects on channel gating that were not observed in basic macroscopic characterizations."

F57 has been identified as part of the \u2018activation triplet\u2019 consisting of F57, T58 and L59, which has been found to interact with the pore region of the channel (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tapper and George, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Melman et al., 2004</a>).\u00a0A crosslinking event between KCNE1 and the pore region could restrict its movement and prevent channel opening. There are several theories for how KCNE1 delays channel opening, including that KCNE1 inhibits the movement of the S4 domain in the voltage sensor, (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nakajo and Kubo, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ruscic et al., 2013</a>) or that it slows the opening of the pore domain (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rocheleau and Kobertz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>). Our findings suggesting that KCNE1 potentially impacts both are supported by a recent paper by <a href=\"#bib64\">Zaydman et al. (2014)</a>. They propose that KCNE1 does not directly affect VSD activation or pore opening, and instead suggest that KCNE1 alters the state-dependent interactions linking the VSD and pore in KCNQ1 channels. If KCNE1 affects the interactions between the two domains, it is plausible that KCNE1 not only independently modulates the voltage dependence of its own \u03b1-subunit, but also participates in interactions that, when covalently crosslinked, can prevent channel opening. Clearly additional studies are required to better understand the detailed nature of these interactions."

Since the nature of the channel complex has been in doubt, it has been difficult to consider the effects of a partially chaperoned channel. By confirming that <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> has a variable stoichiometry up to 4:4, our analysis of EQQ provides some insights into the channel\u2019s regulation. In addition to a hyperpolarizing shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), our single channel analysis indicated that EQQ and EQQQQ channels had a reduced first latency to open at +60 mV compared with wild type (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Also, unsaturated channels rarely reach a fully conducting state, and instead they primarily reside in subconducting conformations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The modulation of both these parameters is consistent with the kind of regulatory model proposed by <a href=\"#bib64\">Zaydman et al. (2014)</a>, in which KCNQ1 has intermediate and activated voltage sensor states, both of which lead to channel opening, but where KCNE1 suppresses opening in the intermediate state. In this scenario, EQQ and EQQQQ would represent hybrid channels; QQ subunits lacking E1 could open from an earlier gating state while those associated with E1 open from a more fully activated state. This would change the interacting forces on the subunits, move channel opening to an earlier conformation in the activation pathway, and likely left-shift the V<sub>1/2</sub> of activation and reduce the first latency for opening as we observed."

We have previously observed that wild type channels show a mean conductance of 3.2 pS and also exhibit several sub-conducting levels (<a href=\"#bib58\">Werry et al., 2013</a>). On its own, KCNQ1 is thought to have a reduced channel conductance, although this has not been confirmed by single channel analysis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yang and Sigworth, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pusch, 1998</a>). Our findings indicate that in the presence of only two KCNE1 subunits, the pore is still capable of achieving a wild type conducting state, but much less frequently such that a mean conductance of ~1.3 pS was observed. In the presence of only one E1 subunit (EQQQQ) the effect was even greater and points to a destabilized open pore configuration in the absence of KCNE1. Others have reported that KCNE1 can interact and modulate the characteristics of the pore domain but this is the first direct demonstration that sub-saturating levels of KCNE1 lowers mean single channel conductance, and it indicates that 4 KCNE1\u2019s preferentially stabilize the ion throughput rate of the open pore (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tapper and George, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Melman et al., 2004</a>).

A fully saturated channel has a depolarizing shift in the current-voltage relationship, extremely slowed activation and increased conductance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). However, during a normal cardiac action potential this would result in limited activation. If the stoichiometry can be regulated based on availability, (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>) then altering the expression could change the distribution of channel composition, shifting the overall activation kinetics of the current. Additionally, there is evidence for the association of other \u03b2-subunits. All five of the KCNE genes (KCNE1-5) can be expressed in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lundquist et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bendahhou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Radicke et al., 2006</a>).

There is also potential for different KCNE\u2019s associating with the same channel to modulate its function (<a href=\"#bib24\">Manderfield and George, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>). Flexibility in KCNQ1\u2019s \u03b2-subunits association, both in number and in type, allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression."

Ahern). Cells were washed and lifted in a low potassium hyperpolarizing solution (-90 mV; as determined by the Nernst equation) (mM): 4 KCl, 140 NMDG, 10 HEPES, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> pH 7.4. Cells were exposed to UV irradiation using a 500 W arc lamp with a Mercury-Xenon bulb (Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) for 0, 2 or 5\u2009min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at -80\u00b0C until used. Cell pellets were lysed as described above. 500 \u03bcg of each supernatant was diluted to 0.5% (w/v) DDM and 2 \u03bcg of T7-tag monoclonal (69522; Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada) was added. Samples were rotated for 1\u2009hr at room temp. 25 \u03bcl of washed, packed protein G-agarose beads (Roche) were added to each sample and rotated for 1\u2009hr at room temp. Beads were washed with PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) DDM and 600 mM NaCl. Protein complexes were eluted with PBS containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 50 mM DTT and separated on a 7% tris-acetate gel. Western blots were performed as described above using the anti-GFP monoclonal or T7-tag monoclonal (69522; Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada) antibodies."

It is known that in exogenous cells different KCNE1:KCNQ1 expression ratio result in currents with various activation properties. If these various properties also exist in heart cells they will affect heart rhythm. Therefore, this phenomenon is potentially of physiological importance. The question is whether this phenomenon is due to a different KCNE1:KCNQ1 stoichiometry in the <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> channel complex? There have been two camps with different views on this issue. One view is that the KCNQ1:KCNE1 stoichiometry varies from 4:1 to 4:4 in the <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> channel complex, and the other view is that the <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> channel has a fixed 4:2 KCNQ1:KCNE1 stoichiometry. Both camps have provided compelling evidence using various methods to support their view. This manuscript by Murray et al. uses two novel methods, namely single recordings and unnatural amino acid crosslinking, to argue that the <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> channel can have different KCNQ1:KCNE1 stoichiometry and the number of KCNE1 in the channel can be up to 4. At the core of this work are two neatly characterised and well-behaving tandem constructs, that behave more or less exactly the way that we would hope. Given the various troubles and pitfalls of tandems (which seem to work better in K-channels than most), these data are encouraging, and provide a lot of weight for the concepts which the authors wish to advance. The single channel recordings are nice and support the functional distinctions between the different conditions."

The 2 vs. 4 KCNE discussion rests on the idea that 2 or 4 are incorporated if supplied by tandems. A tandem tetramer with a single KCNE subunit could also be made presumably (EQQQQ). If EQQQQ was distinct from EQQ and Q alone (or QQQQ or QQ), that would provide very strong evidence for the idea that channels containing 2 and 4 KCNE-subunits have been analysed here."

While this is likely, is it possible that EQ has only two E1s associated with the channel and EQQ only has one, while other E1's from the constructs are not associated with the channel? For single channel studies, a channel with 1 or 3 KCNE1 should be included in addition to the presented data. To be really picky, there's nothing here that says that 4 KCNE subunits are ever incorporated. If a very strong mechanism limits the incorporation to 2 E subunits, all the results here are also possible with 2:4 and 1:4 stoichiometries, for example; the lower could be obtained in EQQ due to a dose effect. The 2 vs. 4 KCNE discussion rests on the idea that 2 or 4 are incorporated if supplied by tandems. A tandem tetramer with a single KCNE subunit could also be made presumably (EQQQQ). If EQQQQ was distinct from EQQ and Q alone (or QQQQ or QQ), that would provide very strong evidence for the idea that channels containing 2 and 4 KCNE-subunits have been analysed here.</i>"

In performing these experiments we were very pleased to observe that EQQQQ had a further hyperpolarized V0.5, shorter first latency, and reduced peak conductance compared to EQQ, all of which were reversed with co-expression of KCNE1. EQQQQ also had intermediate rate of crosslinking compared to Q1 and EQQ, consistent with the association of three KCNE1 subunits in the three available clefts. Incorporation of the new data required considerable changes to several figures and expansion of the manuscript."
