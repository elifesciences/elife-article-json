                    "text": "The cohesin ring holds newly replicated sister chromatids together until their separation at anaphase. Initiation of sister chromatid cohesion depends on a separate complex, Scc2<sup>NIPBL</sup>/Scc4<sup>Mau2</sup> (Scc2/4), which loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and partial defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, leading to severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. We present here a crystal structure showing the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4. Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. Using budding yeast, we demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion. These findings reveal the role of Scc4 in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establish a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres."

Initiation of sister chromatid cohesion depends on a separate complex, Scc2<sup>NIPBL</sup>/Scc4<sup>Mau2</sup> (Scc2/4), which loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and partial defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, leading to severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. We present here a crystal structure showing the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4. Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. Using budding yeast, we demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion. These findings reveal the role of Scc4 in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establish a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres."

A ring-like protein complex, cohesin, holds together each pair of newly-replicated chromosomes, known as \u2018sister chromatids\u2019. When the cell divides, cohesin is cleaved; this allows sister chromatids to separate, so that each daughter cell receives one member of each sister chromatid pair and thereby inherits a full complement of genes. Defects in this process result in severe developmental abnormalities. Moreover, the genes that underlie this process are among the most frequently mutated in cancer."

Cohesin, a ring-shaped protein complex that wraps around sister chromatids (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gruber et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Haering et al., 2008</a>) is the molecular agent of sister chromatid cohesion, which persists from the time of DNA replication until anaphase. A distinct protein complex containing Scc2<sup>NIPBL</sup> and Scc4<sup>Mau2</sup> (Scc2/4) initiates linkage of cohesin with DNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ciosk et al., 2000</a>), and an in vitro reconstitution of cohesin loading by Scc2/4 suggests that the product of this reaction is a topological protein\u2013DNA linkage (<a href=\"#bib23\">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013</a>). In metazoans, cohesin deposition by Scc2/4 is required for normal development (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dorsett et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kawauchi et al., 2009</a>), and mutations in NIPBL, the human homolog of Scc2, are dominant and causally linked to a severe developmental disorder, Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CDLS) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Krantz et al., 2004</a>)."

Cohesin enrichment at mitotic centromeres and pericentromeres results in tension across sister chromatids when paired kinetochores attach to opposite spindle microtubules (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tanaka, 2000</a>). Mitotic spindle checkpoint signaling senses the tension between sister centromeres to ensure correct kinetochore\u2013microtubule attachments (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stern and Murray, 2001</a>).

Thus, Scc2 activity in vivo must depend on Scc4 in ways not recapitulated by the in vitro loading reaction. We report here the structure of yeast Scc4 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of Scc2 and demonstrate that Scc4 determines cohesin localization through a conserved patch on its surface. These findings show that Scc4 targets cohesin loading to a specific genomic locus and that this function is separable from its essential role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome."

Scc2 is a 1493 amino acid residue protein predicted to have an unstructured N-terminal segment and a C-terminal HEAT (Huntington, EF3, PP2A, TOR1)/ARM (Armadillo) repeat domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Scc4, also conserved among nearly all eukaryotes, is predicted to have an extensive TPR (TetratricoPeptide Repeat) architecture. Negative stain electron microscopy of the full-length complex showed two large globular structures, variably positioned relative to each other, which we interpret as corresponding to the Scc2 HEAT repeat module and Scc2<sup>N</sup>-Scc4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We used limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry to identify an Scc4-containing subcomplex (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). An N-terminal fragment of Scc2 (residues 1\u2013181 or 1\u2013205) is sufficient for stable association with full-length Scc4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

The Scc2\u2013Scc4 interaction has two unusual features. First, the concave surface of Scc4 is entirely enclosed, and Scc2 dissociation would therefore require either unfolding or proteolysis of Scc2 or Scc4.

We compiled sequence alignments for the N-terminus of Scc2 from divergent eukaryotes, including yeasts and humans, and mapped amino acid conservation onto its structure (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure Supplement 2A,B</a>). Despite their low level of overall sequence conservation, Scc2/NIPBL proteins have conserved amino acid residues at buried positions that contact Scc4. Several Scc2\u2013Scc4 contacts on the external face of Scc4 are also conserved, including Scc2<sup>F86</sup>, which stacks onto Scc4<sup>Y40-Y41</sup>, and Scc2<sup>112\u2013120</sup>, which forms a helix that fits over a hydrophobic surface on Scc4 TPR<sup>N</sup>. We found that Scc2 variants mutated at conserved residues contacting either the concave or the external surface of Scc4 were less effective than wild-type Scc2 in restoring viability to an Scc2-degron (<i>SCC2-AID</i>) strain under depletion conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

We found that supplementing the chromosomal copy of <i>SCC2</i> with a plasmid coding for Scc2 or Scc2<sup>\u03941\u2013138</sup> complemented transcriptional repression of <i>SCC4</i> (<i>pGAL1-SCC4</i>). That is, increasing the <i>SCC2</i> gene copy number bypassed the effect on viability of transcriptional repression of <i>SCC4</i>, and the bypass did not require the Scc4-binding region of Scc2 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Because this region of Scc2 is probably unstructured when not bound by Scc4, it is a plausible cause of instability or aggregation when expressed unprotected. One reason why Scc4 is essential may therefore be that Scc2 is unstable in its absence."

To determine whether the Scc4-conserved patch functions in the same pathway as Chl4, we introduced the <i>scc4</i><sup><i>m3</i></sup> mutation into a <i>chl4\u0394</i> strain and tested for its effect on plasmid segregation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Inclusion of <i>scc4</i><sup><i>m3</i></sup> does not augment the severe plasmid loss phenotype caused by <i>CHL4</i> deletion. This relationship also holds true for <i>scc4</i><sup><i>m7</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

We found that an <i>scc4</i><sup><i>m3</i></sup>-bearing strain exhibited increased inter-spindle pole distances and that the <i>scc4</i><sup><i>m3</i></sup> mutation did not exacerbate the spindle extension phenotype of a <i>chl4\u0394</i> strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

Scc1 depletion extended roughly 10 kilobases to either side of the core centromere but not to chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Moreover, centromeric Scc2-GFP signal, normally visible in wild-type cells and eliminated by <i>CHL4</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fernius et al., 2013</a>), was lost upon mutation of the Scc4-conserved patch (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>).

DNA sequences per se do not drive cohesin loading (<a href=\"#bib28\">Onn and Koshland, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013</a>). Instead, targeting likely depends on interactions between the loading complex and chromatin-associated factors. We have determined the structure of Scc4 bound to a minimal fragment of Scc2, and we have used this structure to derive separation of function alleles that uncouple cohesin loading from cohesin targeting to centromeres. These experiments demonstrate that cohesin targeting in yeast depends on Scc4. This finding is consistent with unpublished genetic evidence for an Scc4-dependent cohesin localization pathway (Nasmyth, personal communication). Because the pathway that targets cohesin to centromeres requires Scc4 residues that are, in some cases, invariant across diverse eukaryotes, we suggest that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting we describe is a general feature of the control of cohesin loading."

These results probably reflect two modes for cohesin loading: one that depends on a conserved patch of Scc4 and happens at centromeres, and a second opportunistic mode that happens everywhere on the chromosome and is sufficient to support viability in the absence of the first mode. If so, Scc4-conserved patch mutations would not eliminate cohesin loading but would redistribute loading events, resulting in similar cohesin levels at centromeres and on chromosome arms. This prediction is borne out both by strains bearing Scc4-conserved patch mutations and by strains lacking <i>CHL4</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fernius and Marston, 2009</a>)."

In addition to findings from studies conducted in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dowen et al., 2014</a>), one of these reports (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mizuguchi et al., 2014</a>) suggests that cohesin complexes residing at specified sites in the genome function in gene looping and in defining chromosome territories. Because our ChIP-seq experiments show that Scc4 directs cohesin localization to broad centromeric domains but does not affect the local distribution of cohesin peaks, we suggest that the Scc4-dependent localization pathway we discuss here is overlaid upon local determinants of cohesin positioning on chromosomes. These local determinants would be a second level of cohesin regulation, operating at roughly the resolution of the transcriptional units in yeast. Integration of these spatial cues with temporal cues, including the kinase activity of DDK, could then generate the final cohesin distribution observed in metaphase cells. The Scc4-conserved patch presents a possible explanation for how broad cohesin-dense domains may be specified by the cohesion-loading complex, and it provides a molecular foundation for the study of chromatin-associated factors, both known and unknown, that localize cohesin loading."

To locate selenium atoms, we used SHELXD as implemented by HKL2MAP (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pape and Schneider, 2004</a>). A search for 20 heavy atom sites with a resolution cutoff of 4 \u00c5 yielded a solution with 28 heavy atom positions. A truncated list of coordinates for 18 heavy atoms was used to generate an initial map at 3 \u00c5 resolution using Phenix Autosol (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). After density modification using Resolve (as implemented by Phenix), the map displayed extensive density corresponding to alpha helices. Placement of ideal helices and refinement using Phenix Refine yielded a partial structure, which was then used as a search model for phase determination by molecular replacement using a high-resolution native data set and Phaser-MR. During later stages of refinement, riding hydrogens were included, and TLS groups were invoked for Scc4 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Painter and Merritt, 2006</a>). Crystallography statistics are shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, and the coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, accession number 4XDN."

It has also been implicated in regulating chromosome structure and in controlling gene expression. Haplo-insufficiency of its Scc2 subunit (Nipbl) causes Cornelia de Lange syndrome in humans, an effect thought but not yet proven to be due to subtle defects in cohesin's genomic distribution. It has been proposed but not yet proven that cohesin loading corresponds to entrapment of DNAs by cohesin rings. If so, the function of Scc2/4 must be to facilitate DNA entry, presumably by opening transiently one of the interfaces connecting its Smc1, Smc3, and kleisin subunits. It has been reported that Scc2's ortholog in <i>S.pombe</i>, Mis4, can promote the stable association of cohesin with DNA in vitro in the absence of Scc4 but whether this association is truly topological is not known. How then does Scc2/4 facilitate cohesin loading and what is the function of Scc4 if it is not directly involved in the loading reaction? These are questions of central importance for the cohesin field and, because cohesin is just one of several related Smc/kleisin complexes, a topic of broad general interest for the field of chromosome biology."

As might be expected, mutation of conserved residues within Scc2's NTD making contact with Scc4 compromise viability, as does deletion of the entire NTD. This is not unexpected as Scc4 itself is an essential gene. Mapping sequence variation onto the Scc4 structure revealed a cluster of highly conserved surface residues, mainly basic and hydrophobic. One might think therefore that this would prove to be a key surface through which Scc4 facilitates cohesin loading. Strangely, mutation of five residues within this conserved patch was not lethal (though the documentation here was inadequate). It did however appear to compromise recruitment of Scc2 to centromeres and to reduce the loading of cohesin onto peri-centric DNAs but not onto chromosome arms. Curiously, the anomaly of the most conserved part of Scc4 not being essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes is not discussed in the manuscript, which is odd. The paper concludes that Scc4's conserved patch is required for peri-centric cohesin loading but not for a second \u201copportunistic\u201d mode that occurs elsewhere on the chromosome (note that it is this second so called opportunistic mode that seems essential!). The paper also concludes that one of the functions of Scc4 is to mediate Scc2 stabilization, a statement for which there was no adequate justification. Though the structure appears to imply that this would be the case, this should be supported by some biochemical data (see below)."

Bold claims require exceptional documentation and sadly this is lacking here. From the structural figure supplied and the accompanying sequence variation, it would appear that L256, Y298, K299, Y313, F324, K327, and possibly K331 are the key surface conserved residues. And yet, for some reason the mutant Scc4 with the most extensive alterations in its conserved patch was <i>scc4</i><sup><i>m35</i></sup>, which contained F324A, K324A (presumably this should be K327A -typo?), K331A, K541A, and K542A. In other words, several of the key residues within the patch were left unmutated while residues that appear less conserved (K541 and K542, only conserved in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> like yeasts according to the figure) were mutated. If one wished to establish whether or not the conserved patch really is non-essential and has a specialized role in recruiting cohesin to centromeres, then one really needs to obliterate the nature of this surface and see whether the same results are obtained. What if mutating L256, Y298, K299, Y313, F324, K327, and K331 simultaneously were lethal? Would this not greatly alter the thrust of the paper and the interpretation of the results? Would it not imply that in fact, <i>scc4</i><sup><i>m35</i></sup> is a hypomorph (with regard to the function of the conserved patch) and that the selective reduction in cohesin loading at centromeres arises because efficient loading at this location is more sensitive to a partial loss of function than loading along chromosome arms? This is a serious issue but not one that would require an inordinate amount of work to address. Making such mutants, characterizing their (non-?) effect on Scc2/4 complex formation in vivo, and a far more careful analysis of their phenotypes rigorously at the genomic level and by live imaging should be a high priority."

This experiment cannot exclude the possibility that there is minor expression of SCC4 from the GAL promoter and that this contributes to the suppression of lethality.

For example, it would be surprising if scc2-4 would not also have very similar phenotypes on centromeric cohesion. If so, would you conclude that this mutation affected in a specific manner the formation of centromeric cohesion? These results per se do not \u201cstrongly suggest that the Scc4 conserved patch targets Scc2/4 specifically to centromeres\u201d. A close look at the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> suggests a slightly longer inter-SBP distance with the double mutant compared to single mutants. But there is nothing to compare a synthetic effect with, such as another mutant that would provide a longer inter-SPB distance when coupled with a <i>chl4</i> deletion.

First, there are major problems with analysing the distribution of Scc2 using ChIP. This problem afflicts data from a variety of organisms, not just yeast. The problem is that Scc2 is not stably associated with chromatin like cohesin. The only reliable method of documenting Scc2's localization at centromeres is to use live imaging, which avoids the countless pitfalls associated with ChIP. Fortunately, this can be readily done with <i>S. cerevisiae</i> where Scc2-GFP co-localizes with centromeres for much of the cell cycle and the centromeres are conveniently all clustered. The analysis performed here is of very poor quality. The images are not believable. It should be possible, especially if one uses diploids, to observe clear images in all cells post S phase and pre-anaphase. To distinguish mutant and wild type strains, these need to be differentially marked so that they can be placed on the same slide and imaged together and thereby compared rigorously. Moreover, the centromeres need to be marked separately in an unambiguous manner. The second problem concerns the use of QPCR ChIP to analyse cohesin's genomic distribution. In this day and age, it is not sufficient to draw major conclusions about the genomic distribution of proteins without analysing this using ChIP-seq. This would be easy to do."
