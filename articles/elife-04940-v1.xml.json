Wildtype <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae feed on bacteria, but for decades laboratory work has relied on axenic mutants that can also grow on liquid media. We used forward genetics to identify the causative gene underlying this phenotype. This gene encodes the RasGAP Neurofibromin (NF1). Loss of NF1 enables axenic growth by increasing fluid uptake. Mutants form outsized macropinosomes which are promoted by greater Ras and PI3K activity at sites of endocytosis. Relatedly, NF1 mutants can ingest larger-than-normal particles using phagocytosis. An NF1 reporter is recruited to nascent macropinosomes, suggesting that NF1 limits their size by locally inhibiting Ras signalling. Our results link NF1 with macropinocytosis and phagocytosis for the first time, and we propose that NF1 evolved in early phagotrophs to spatially modulate Ras activity, thereby constraining and shaping their feeding structures."

Wildtype <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae feed on bacteria, but for decades laboratory work has relied on axenic mutants that can also grow on liquid media. We used forward genetics to identify the causative gene underlying this phenotype. This gene encodes the RasGAP Neurofibromin (NF1). Loss of NF1 enables axenic growth by increasing fluid uptake. Mutants form outsized macropinosomes which are promoted by greater Ras and PI3K activity at sites of endocytosis. Relatedly, NF1 mutants can ingest larger-than-normal particles using phagocytosis. An NF1 reporter is recruited to nascent macropinosomes, suggesting that NF1 limits their size by locally inhibiting Ras signalling. Our results link NF1 with macropinocytosis and phagocytosis for the first time, and we propose that NF1 evolved in early phagotrophs to spatially modulate Ras activity, thereby constraining and shaping their feeding structures."

Animal cells and amoebae ingest solid material using F-actin driven projections of their plasma membrane, forming pseudopodia and ultimately cup- or crown-shaped ruffles that enclose adhered particles. These cells can also internalise bulk fluid without the guidance of a particle using a closely related process, macropinocytosis (<a href=\"#bib72\">Swanson, 2008</a>)."

Oncogenes such as Src and phosphatidylinositide 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K) have also been linked with regulation of these processes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Araki et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Veithen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buczynski et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amyere et al., 2000</a>). In amoebae, growth and endocytosis have obvious connections since phagocytosed material supplies essentially all their nutrients; in contrast vertebrates are specialised to digest food extracellularly in the gut, and so links are less apparent. However, large-scale endocytosis is extremely important in immune cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Metchnikoff, 1892</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Norbury et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sallusto et al., 1995</a>), while tumour cells, released from the normal constraints on growth and proliferation, can display pronounced macropinocytotic or phagocytotic uptake (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lewis, 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Montcourrier et al., 1994</a>), and can feed by ingesting extracellular protein (<a href=\"#bib21\">Commisso et al., 2013</a>).

This can be overcome if cells can be cultured axenically (\u2018a-xenic\u2019 indicating the absence of organisms of another species): in some cases, such as the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i>, which feeds primarily on bacteria in the wild (<a href=\"#bib78\">Vuillemin, 1903</a>), strains were gradually adapted to growth in complex liquid broth, and ultimately in chemically defined media (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sussman and Sussman, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Watts and Ashworth, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Franke and Kessin, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Watts, 1977</a>).

Two important mutations, <i>axeA</i> and <i>axeB,</i> were identified by linkage analysis as being necessary for robust axenic growth (<a href=\"#bib83\">Williams et al., 1974a</a>, <a href=\"#bib84\">1974b</a>), but only the latter is strictly required (<a href=\"#bib17a\">Clarke and Kayman, 1987</a>). Although these axenic mutant strains have been very widely used for over 40 years, the genetic basis of their growth has remained mysterious, since the mutations could not be precisely mapped. We used a forward genetic approach to identify mutations that promote axenic growth in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> using whole genome sequencing. We found that the <i>Dictyostelium</i> orthologue of the Ras GTPase activating protein (RasGAP) Neurofibromin (NF1), a tumour suppressor that is mutated in the genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis type 1 (<a href=\"#bib85\">Xu et al., 1990</a>), is a key regulator of both macropinocytosis and phagocytosis."

In order to minimize the number of irrelevant background mutations we avoided mutagenesis and found that spontaneous mutants that are able to grow and proliferate arise frequently among these growth-arrested populations. We selected several independent mutants and sequenced the genomes of three after clonal isolation, along with that of the parental DdB strain, which was chosen because it was also parent to the established axenic laboratory strains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bloomfield et al., 2008</a>)."

Further analysis demonstrated that AX4 has lost almost nine kilobases of this region on chromosome 3, resulting in the deletion of most of the coding sequence of a large gene encoding a homologue of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) Neurofibromin (NF1), as well as part of the upstream gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), with a short segment of extraneous sequence inserted.

AX4 derives from another axenic mutant, AX3 (or A3), which was isolated from wildtype cells independently from Ax2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Loomis, 1971</a>). Extant AX3 and AX4 strains share a large inverted duplication on chromosome 2 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Eichinger et al., 2005</a>) that is not present in Ax2. However, the mutation in <i>axeB</i> in Ax2 and AX4 is identical, suggesting that the extant lines of these strains, along with AX3, had a common ancestor that was axenic. It might not be possible to determine the reason for this discrepancy with the literature; one possibility is that very early in these strains' contemporaneous history one line was contaminated with the other and the slower-growing of the two then lost. In formally numbering alleles we have retrospectively assigned allele number \u20183\u2019 to the <i>axeB</i> mutation in the historic strain NP73, but follow recent recommendations (<a href=\"http://dictybase.org/Dicty_Info/nomenclature_guidelines.html\">http://dictybase.org/Dicty_Info/nomenclature_guidelines.html</a>) for new strains, and use the same number for gene disruptions using the same knockout construct."

To test whether inactivation of NF1 promotes axenic growth, we engineered a deletion at the locus in a wildtype strain, DdB, and found that the resulting mutant is able to grow axenically in HL5 medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, it grows more slowly than the established Ax2 strain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and does not grow well in suspension in this medium (see below), confirming earlier findings that additional mutations are necessary to potentiate the basal axenic phenotype (<a href=\"#bib83\">Williams et al., 1974a</a>, <a href=\"#bib84\">1974b</a>). Together, the identification of mutations in the original axenic strains on chromosome 3 and demonstration that inactivation of the affected gene results in a phenotype closely resembling <i>axeB</i> single mutants derived parasexually (<a href=\"#bib17a\">Clarke and Kayman, 1987</a>) gives adequate reason to believe that we have identified the original causative mutation. We therefore formally retain the name <i>axeB</i> for the locus, while naming the encoded protein NF1."

To examine fluid uptake in our NF1 knockout mutant, we incubated amoebae with fluorescent dextran and compared them with both the wildtype DdB strain and the established axenic mutant Ax2. When they are harvested directly from bacterial growth plates, NF1 mutants ingest fluid at about the same rate as an established axenic strain, Ax2, and more than four times more rapidly than wildtype cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). After prolonged incubation in HL5 medium without bacteria, Ax2 cells and NF1 mutants increase their uptake further while wildtype cells decrease it, such that after 24 hr mutants take in fluid at a rate more than twenty times higher than the wildtype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Fluid uptake is linear at the earliest times measured with no evidence for rapid recycling of fluid in any of these strains (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), in agreement with earlier studies of axenic mutants (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aubry et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Padh et al., 1993</a>).

A construct using the native polypeptide sequence reduced axenic growth of the NF1 null mutant considerably (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), almost completely suppressing macropinosome formation as assessed by confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and displayed an evenly cytosolic distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In contrast, a version in which two consecutive arginine residues were mutated in the \u2018arginine finger\u2019 motif required for GAP activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmadian et al., 1997</a>) (NF1-AS) did not retard growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) nor affect macropinosome formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), and localised transiently to membrane ruffles and macropinosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This further supports a role for NF1 GAP activity in limiting macropinocytosis. A full length construct expressing the human NF1 protein also adversely affected growth of mutant cells, but a version with the critical arginine residue mutated to alanine reduced growth by a similar amount, suggesting non-specific effects (unpublished data). Since the spontaneous inversion mutation we identified (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) affects the C-terminal region of the protein, we also tested whether the core RasGAP-Sec14-PH region of the <i>D. discoideum</i> NF1 protein could rescue the NF1 mutant; like the NF-AS version this did not suppress axenic growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and displayed an evenly cytosolic distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), suggesting that other regions of the protein are required for its correct localisation. The inactive NF1-AS form of the protein is presumably recruited by strong Ras activity at macropinocytotic crowns that it is then unable to attenuate. This localisation implies that the NF1 protein directly regulates signalling at the plasma membrane during ruffling, and together with the more extensive Ras signalling during macropinocytosis, suggests that this RasGAP regulates a pool of Ras responsible for this feeding process."

All tested GFP-tagged Ras constructs localised to the plasma membrane, except for dominant negative (S17N mutant) RasG and RasS, expression of which was apparently poorly tolerated in these strains (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). None of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> Ras expression constructs phenocopied the loss of NF1; constitutively active RasG was deleterious to growth, as was expression of wildtype or constitutively active RasS (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), suggesting that improper activation of these isoforms interferes with endocytosis or other Ras-influenced processes leading to detrimental effects on cell growth."

Confirming that the macropinosomes observed in NF1 mutants are mechanistically similar to those previously documented, we find that Ras activity at membrane ruffles in NF1 mutants is accompanied by recruitment of PH-domain reporters that bind the plasmanyl inositides produced by <i>Dictyostelium</i> class 1 PI3Ks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Clark et al., 2014</a>), as well as by actin polymerisation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). PH domains are also prominently recruited during macropinocytosis in wildtype cells; regions of recruitment tend to be larger in mutants reflecting the increased Ras signalling that results from the absence of NF1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This pattern of Ras activity and PIP3 formation is invariably observed in every instance of macropinocytosis in <i>Dictyostelium.</i> The contributions of other Ras effectors remain unclear; for example no increase in ERK activity is observed in NF1 mutants compared to wildtype cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This results in a markedly different outcome when the cells are incubated in HL5 medium: mutants can grow but the wildtype cannot. One possible explanation is that nutrient-uptake below a certain threshold leads to a growth arrest. To test this idea, we asked whether wildtype cells can maintain growth in an enriched axenic medium, as suggested by earlier work (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sussman and Sussman, 1967</a>). Wildtype cells incubated in stationary cultures in HL5 supplemented with foetal bovine serum (or bovine serum albumin, data not shown) were able to grow, albeit still much more slowly than NF1 mutants cultured in the same medium (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). The morphology of wildtype cells was not appreciably altered after several days of axenic growth, while NF1 mutants remained consistently more flattened and extensively ruffled than wildtype cells in the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Wildtype cells were also found to degrade DQ-BSA efficiently after axenic growth in the presence of serum (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Serum addition also stimulated the growth of NF1 mutants in shaking suspension (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These findings suggest that the additional nutrients in the richer broth allow these cells to avoid the starvation-triggered growth arrest that can occur in axenic media."

Mutant and wildtype strains grow well on bacteria (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>) and take up bacterium-sized polystyrene microspheres (1 \u03bcm and 1.8 \u03bcm diameter) at very similar rates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), although the standard strain Ax2 is marginally but consistently less effective at internalising smaller beads than the other strains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Against expectation, we found that wildtype cells cannot efficiently ingest yeast or beads greater than 3 \u03bcm in diameter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>), whereas NF1 mutant cells can ingest beads larger than 4 \u03bcm in diameter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) or yeast cells very readily (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In line with earlier findings in Ax2 cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Clarke et al., 2010</a>), RBD and PH domain reporters localised to phagosomes as they formed, essentially identically to their behaviour during macropinocytosis (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We conclude that, as well as controlling macropinocytosis, NF1 limits the size of nascent phagosomes, supporting the idea that these large-scale endocytic processes share regulatory as well as structural features. The striking improvement in phagocytosis of larger cells after NF1 deletion also suggests that variation in or loss of this gene can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences by enabling predators to target additional prey species (<a href=\"#bib57\">Porter, 2011</a>)."

In freshly selected mutants, we discovered coding sequence mutations only in the <i>Dictyostelium</i> orthologue of the tumour suppressor NF1. Importantly, all axenic mutants, across two distinct genetic backgrounds, bear mutations in this gene. While it is possible that mutations in other genes will result in similar phenotypes, it is clear that NF1 mutations must be the most frequent by far that cause axenic growth. The further mutations enabling faster growth in the established axenic strains remain to be identified, and their precise effect is still unclear. Our identification of the <i>axeB</i> gene as NF1 will provide a route towards creating new axenic strains from wild isolates, thus giving strains with minimal background mutations."

NF1 mutants retain a large growth advantage in the more complex medium, and so will still be selected during prolonged culture. Nevertheless, this protocol should be of use for short-term axenic culture of wildtype strains; standard defined medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin also enables slow growth of wildtype strains (unpublished data) suggesting that fully synthetic defined media should be attainable. This further supports the idea that the important effect of serum is the provision of bulk nutrients, preventing the nitrogen starvation that initiates <i>Dictyostelium</i> development (<a href=\"#bib46\">Marin, 1976</a>)."

Although axenic cells chemotax very well to the best-studied chemoattractant, cyclic-AMP, they are much less efficient than wildtype cells in chemotaxis to folic acid, due to interference from large, PIP3-rich, macropinosomes (<a href=\"#bib77\">Veltman et al., 2014</a>). It is now apparent that the reason for this poor chemotaxis is likely to be the inactivation of NF1 in axenic cells, leading to Ras and PI3K hyperactivity. Macropinosomes and intense patches of Ras activity and PIP3 also appear in cells chemotaxing to cyclic-AMP (<a href=\"#bib55\">Parent et al., 1998</a>) and it will be important to disentangle their contribution to chemotaxis by comparative studies of axenic and wildtype cells."

Further, Ras activity reporters localise strongly to membrane ruffles during macropinocytosis as well as to nascent phagosomes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sasaki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clarke et al., 2010</a>), and we found that the size of these sites of Ras activity is increased in NF1 mutants. The well-studied NF1 orthologues in mammals and yeast are specific to Ras subfamily small G proteins (<a href=\"#bib73\">Tanaka et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang et al., 1991</a>), and one of mutations we found in <i>Dictyostelium</i> corresponds exactly to one that abolishes the GAP activity of the human orthologue by altering the Ras-binding interface of the protein (<a href=\"#bib58\">Poullet et al., 1994</a>). These data, along with the effect of mutating the \u2018arginine finger\u2019 critical for RasGAP activity, suggest that <i>Dictyostelium</i> NF1 is most likely Ras-specific, but this remains to be demonstrated biochemically. The specificity of <i>Dictyostelium</i> NF1 towards different Ras isoforms remains unclear. Since the <i>rasG</i> and <i>rasS</i> null mutants have defective endocytic feeding but are still viable (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chubb et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hoeller et al., 2013</a>) it is likely that multiple Ras isoforms are involved, possibly including other less well-characterised genes."

Regions of conserved sequence to either side of the relatively well-characterised core of the protein are even more mysterious, but may be important for its function in <i>Dictyostelium,</i> perhaps by mediating its dynamic localisation. We find that GFP-tagged full length <i>Dictyostelium</i> NF1 localises transiently to macropinocytotic ruffles. This translocation has only been visualised in a mutant form of the protein with the \u2018arginine finger\u2019 motif mutated, because over-expression of the active protein almost completely inhibits macropinocytosis. It will be important to identify structural determinants of this localisation as a route towards a better understanding of the cell-biological function of NF1."

The control of NF1 function is not well understood, but our results suggest that it might be locally inactivated during macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. In an intriguing parallel, growth factor treatment of mammalian cells leads to rapid degradation of NF1 by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cichowski et al., 2003</a>) and also triggers membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis with similar kinetics (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brunk et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mellstr\u00f6m et al., 1983</a>). However, we could find no obvious fluid-uptake phenotype in NF1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that NF1 inactivation is not sufficient for stimulation of macropinocytosis in these cells (unpublished data). Given the known involvement of Ras signalling in promoting ruffling and macropinocytosis the possibility remains that NF1 function is conserved in metazoa, but in a context in which Ras activity is more heavily regulated, with additional layers of control not present in amoebae (<a href=\"#bib13\">Casci et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Johnson et al., 2005</a>)."

                                "text": "The <i>axeB</i> disruption plasmid was constructed by inserting the V18-tn5 cassette into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pBluescript2 KS+, then amplifying 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking regions of the <i>axeB</i> gene from strain DdB using the primers KOKpnI (5\u2032-GGTACCAAATGTATACTTGTATATGATG-3\u2032) with KOHindIII (5\u2032-AAGCTTGAGCTCTTCACCACCATTAAGT-3\u2032), and KOBamHI (5\u2032-GGATCCATTGGGTAGTTATCGATC-3\u2032), with KOEagI (5\u2032-CGGCCGTGCACAGTCTTTAGAAAATTTTG-3\u2032), and inserting them either side of it. The <i>nfaA</i> disruption plasmid was also based on pBluescript2 KS+ using, between BamHI and XhoI sites, the hygromycin resistance gene driven by the <i>act14</i> promoter; and the following primer pairs were used to amplify flanking segments: nfa2kpn (5\u2032-GGTACCTAATGGTGTAACTCAAGTTTTCG-3\u2032) with nfa2xho (5\u2032-CTCGAGTGGTAATGTTTTATTTGCTGTTG-3\u2032), and nfa2bam (5\u2032-GGATCCAGATATTCATTGTACATCCATCAG-3\u2032) with nfa2spe (5\u2032-ACTAGTATACTTATAAGAAACCTTCTTCAG-3\u2032). Expression constructs used the <i>act14</i> or <i>coaA</i> promoter to drive the resistance gene and the <i>act15</i> promoter to drive the gene fragment of interest, using the vector pDM1005 as backbone, a derivative of previously described extrachromosomal vectors (<a href=\"#bib76\">Veltman et al., 2009</a>). The GFP-Raf1-RBD included amino acids 1\u2013134 of the <i>H. sapiens</i> Raf1 polypeptide, with a short linker (TTSRT) between GFP and its N-terminal methionine. PH-CRAC-GFP contains residues 1\u2013126 of the <i>D. discoideum</i> CRAC protein. GFP-PH10 contains amino acids 1\u2013103 of <i>D. discoideum</i> PkgE (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ruchira et al., 2004</a>); this fragment is longer than the previously published version, but gives a similar localisation. The GFP-Ras constructs included an RS(GGS)<sub>4</sub>RS linker between the C-terminus of GFP and N-terminus of each Ras. During the construction of the full length NF1 expression construct, in the same vector backbone including an N-terminal GFP, silent mutations were incorporated at positions 409 and 813 of the <i>D. discoideum axeB</i> cDNA sequence to introduce a XhoI and a XmaI site, respectively. The consecutive arginine codons in the \u2018arginine finger\u2019 region were mutated by introducing changes in overlapping PCR primers during cloning. The NF1\u0394N\u0394C construct uses the same vector backbone and tag, and includes amino acids 1189 to 1779, with the wildtype arginine finger motif. Dual-colour experiments used plasmids containing both protein constructs as previously described (<a href=\"#bib76\">Veltman et al., 2009</a>)."

For each data point, 2 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells were removed and the uningested fluorescent yeast quenched by the addition of 0.1 ml of trypan blue solution (20 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mg/ml trypan blue).

Bacterially grown cells were resuspended at 10<sup>7</sup> per ml in KK2C containing 0.2% (wt/vol) BSA (KK2CB) (to reduce non-specific binding) and 20 beads added per amoebae.

To image lysosomal degradation of endocytosed protein, cells were incubated in Loflo medium (Formedium) plus 20 \u03bcg/ml DQ green BSA (Life Technologies). Images were acquired using a Zeiss 780 LSM microscope, with laser power and gain set identically for all strains and the brightness and contrast of images adjusted later identically. For DIC images, brightness and contrast was adjusted for visual clarity using ImageJ. To measure the frequency of macropinosome internalization, cells were harvested from mass-inoculation SM agar growth plates, washed three times in Loflo medium, then 1 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells plated per chamber of a Lab-Tek II 8-well chambered coverglass (Thermo, Waltham, MA) and allowed to settle for 10\u201315 min. Within 30 min of removal from bacteria, 0.4 mg/ml FITC- and 2 mg/ml TRITC-dextran were added, and movies recorded taking 5 Z-sections (1 \u03bcm apart) every 5 s. Pinosomes were counted if they appeared adjacent to ruffled cell projections and cups, and if they retained FITC fluorescence (FITC is rapidly bleached as endosomes that are acidified). To enable estimation of the rate of uptake, cells were tracked and included in the analysis only if they remained within the field for at least 5 min; these cells were tracked as long as they remained in the field to at most 10 min. To measure the extent of Ras signalling at the membrane of random growing cells, strains expressing the GFP-Raf1-RBD reporter were harvested during exponential growth in tissue culture dishes containing <i>K. aerogenes</i> in SM/5 broth, washed and plated in fresh SM/5 in Lab-Tek chambers as above. Tile scans were acquired of 25 fields, and cells were outlined manually using a custom built MatLab script (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Source code 1</a>). Normals of 3 pixels long were drawn at equidistant points along the perimeter spaced 2 pixels apart and the highest intensity value along this normal was determined. The patch threshold was set as all membrane values that were more than 3 standard deviations above the mean intensity of the cytosol. Over 100 cells from two independent experiments were analysed for each strain. To measure the extent of Ras signalling during pinocytosis, the same Ras-activity reporter strains were plated in Lab-Tek chambers in SM/5 as above, and movies of a single confocal section through the cells recorded with a 2.5 s interval. The maximum extent of GFP-RBD fluorescence across enclosed ruffles was measured in the first frame after they closed using ImageJ. Images of tagged Ras and NF1 proteins, Raf1-RBD, PH-CRAC, and LifeAct reporters were adjusted for brightness and contrast across the whole image of each channel, and cropped, for clarity."

Mutations that incapacitate the protein encoded by the <i>axeB</i> gene, an evolutionarily conserved Ras-GAP that is closely related to the human tumour suppressor NF1, leads to oversized ruffles that renders the <i>Dictyostelium</i> strains axenic. Since <i>axeB</i> mutants contain exaggerated macropinosomes, as evidenced by the use by various reporters of active Ras signaling, the authors conclude that the main function of NF1 is to restrict Ras activity at the flanks of the nascent macropinosomes (and related the phagosomes)."

To test this further, we have measured the initial rate of fluid uptake at the shortest times practicable (set by the need for a signal above noise) and find, as expected, that uptake by the wildtype is much slower than NF1 mutants; uptake is linear at these short times arguing against the existence of a fast-recycling compartment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Final imaging of WT cells grown axenically in the presence of serum showed that they are able to concentrate ingested fluid effectively (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Our model remains that WT cells ingest lower volumes of fluid than mutants, and so their growth is arrested by the conventional starvation response unless high levels of nutrients are present (as supplied by HL5 medium with 10% FBS).

We had already been attempting to express and purify NF1 fragments for biochemical assays for several months prior to submission of our manuscript, but met with difficulties at every stage, and have so far been unable to purify soluble recombinant protein. Experiments to investigate the localisation of our NF1-AS reporter in mutants lacking different Ras proteins were also unsuccessful because the reporter does not localise in the Ax2 (and AX3) backgrounds where these mutants are available. We note that both RasG and RasS mutants are both partially defective in macropinocytosis and yet the Raf1-RBD reporter still localises to nascent macropinosomes in both strains. This suggests that both RasG and RasS are involved in macropinocytosis (and likely substrates for NF1), but act redundantly."

Nevertheless, we engineered a construct to express GFP-tagged full length human NF1, with the codons optimized for <i>Dictyostelium</i>. Expression of this construct did indeed strongly reduce axenic growth of the NF1 mutant; unfortunately, so did a version in which the catalytic arginine residue of the GAP domain was changed to alanine. This experiment will be followed up in various ways but in the meantime we feel it is too difficult to interpret to merit inclusion in the body of the paper. Despite the evolutionary distance between <i>Dictyostelium</i> and humans, we firmly expect that determination of the basal function of NF1 in cellular contexts closely resembling those in which it first evolved (as we argue from our phylogenetic analysis) will deepen our understanding of its function in metazoan cells."
