However, mispairing of the therapeutic \u03b1\u03b2 chains with endogenous \u03b1\u03b2 chains reduces therapeutic TCR surface expression and generates self-reactive TCRs. We report a general strategy to prevent TCR mispairing: swapping constant domains between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains of a therapeutic TCR. When paired, domain-swapped (ds)TCRs assemble with CD3, express on the cell surface, and mediate antigen-specific T cell responses. By contrast, dsTCR chains mispaired with endogenous chains cannot properly assemble with CD3 or signal, preventing autoimmunity. We validate this approach in cell-based assays and in a mouse model of TCR gene transfer-induced graft-versus-host disease. We also validate a related approach whereby replacement of \u03b1\u03b2 TCR domains with corresponding \u03b3\u03b4 TCR domains yields a functional TCR that does not mispair. This work enables the design of safer TCR gene therapies for cancer immunotherapy."

However, mispairing of the therapeutic \u03b1\u03b2 chains with endogenous \u03b1\u03b2 chains reduces therapeutic TCR surface expression and generates self-reactive TCRs. We report a general strategy to prevent TCR mispairing: swapping constant domains between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains of a therapeutic TCR. When paired, domain-swapped (ds)TCRs assemble with CD3, express on the cell surface, and mediate antigen-specific T cell responses. By contrast, dsTCR chains mispaired with endogenous chains cannot properly assemble with CD3 or signal, preventing autoimmunity. We validate this approach in cell-based assays and in a mouse model of TCR gene transfer-induced graft-versus-host disease. We also validate a related approach whereby replacement of \u03b1\u03b2 TCR domains with corresponding \u03b3\u03b4 TCR domains yields a functional TCR that does not mispair. This work enables the design of safer TCR gene therapies for cancer immunotherapy."

Furthermore, T cells armed with dsTCRs were able to kill cancer cells and prevent tumor growth in mice.

The T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell surface binds to its cognate peptide antigen presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the target cell surface (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reinherz, 2015</a>). The TCR - a heterodimer that is uniquely rearranged in each T cell during its development - is the sole determinant of T cell specificity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dembi\u0106 et al., 1986</a>). Accordingly, transfer of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 genes encoding a tumor-reactive \u03b1\u03b2 TCR can impart anti-tumor reactivity to a cancer patient\u2019s T cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clay et al., 1999</a>). Upon reinfusion into the patient, these engineered T cells mediate potent anti-tumor cytotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Park et al., 2011</a>). This approach \u2013 termed TCR gene therapy \u2013 has demonstrated clinical responses for several malignancies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Morgan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Davis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Parkhurst, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Robbins et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>), which may be bolstered in the future through combination with complementary immunotherapies like dendritic cell-based vaccination and checkpoint blockade (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abate-Daga et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brahmer and Hammers, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mellman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sharma and Allison, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Topalian et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chodon, 2014</a>)."

Among these is that TCR-transduced \u03b1\u03b2 T cells express two \u03b1 and two \u03b2 chains, a non-physiological situation in which the introduced TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains can mispair with the endogenous TCR \u03b2 and \u03b1 chains, respectively. TCR chain mispairing reduces the level of correctly-paired, tumor-reactive TCR heterodimers expressed on the T cell surface, possibly reducing therapeutic efficacy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jorritsma et al., 2007</a>). More ominously, mispairing can generate self-reactive TCR heterodimers that do not undergo thymic negative selection. These mispaired TCRs engender autoreactivity in TCR-transduced human T cells <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">van Loenen et al., 2010</a>) and mediate lethal graft-versus-host disease in mice administered TCR-transduced T cells following a protocol mimicking human clinical trials (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bendle et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bunse, 2014</a>). Although no serious adverse events have been attributed to TCR mispairing in engineered T cell trials (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rosenberg, 2010</a>), autoreactive off-target and off-tumor engineered T cell responses have caused deaths (<a href=\"#bib26\">Linette et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Morgan et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2010</a>).

Endogenous TCR knockout prevents mispairing, but the extensive processing currently required to generate these cells is incompatible with clinical protocols. The ideal solution will prevent mispairing entirely, eliminating the risk of autoimmunity. Additionally, modifications made to the introduced TCR chains should avoid foreign sequences to minimize immunogenicity. Finally, these modifications must be restricted to the constant TCR domains, such that they can be applied without further optimization to any TCR of therapeutic interest. We describe a novel approach for preventing TCR mispairing that meets these criteria. We show that this approach is further improved by combining it with the complementary strategy of endogenous TCR knockdown."

The TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains each contain a membrane-distal variable immunoglobulin domain (V), which imparts specificity, and several constant domains including a membrane-proximal constant immunoglobulin domain (C), a connecting peptide (cp), a transmembrane helix (TM), and a short cytoplasmic tail (cyto) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To achieve functional form, the TCR \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer must assemble with six additional chains (CD3 dimers \u03b3\u03b5, \u03b4\u03b5, and \u03b6<sub>2</sub>), which facilitate export of the TCR complex to the cell surface and mediate signal transduction upon antigen binding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Call and Wucherpfennig, 2005</a>). If the TCR/CD3 complex is not assembled properly prior to export, it is degraded (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonifacino, 1989</a>). Assembly with CD3 requires contacts within the constant domains of both the TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Call et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuhns and Davis, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Xu and Call, 2006</a>), most critically the basic residues within the transmembrane domains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Call et al., 2002</a>)(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We designed interchain domain-swapped (ds) TCRs in which select constant domains of the TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains are exchanged in a reciprocal manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Correctly paired \u03b1/\u03b2 dsTCRs retain all domains necessary to assemble with CD3 and to enact tumor-targeted immunity. By contrast, mispaired heterodimers comprising one dsTCR chain and one wild-type (wt) TCR chain lack domains necessary to assemble with CD3 or to enact autoimmune responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>)."

The murine pro-B cell line, BaF3, will grow in the absence of IL-3 only when provided Jak-Stat signaling via dimerized signaling domains of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). A fusion of CD3\u03b5 to EpoR (\u03b5E) was previously shown to drive proliferation of BaF3 when incorporated in the TCR/CD3 complex, indicating that the CD3 \u03b4\u03b5 and \u03b3\u03b5 dimers cluster on one face of the wtTCR, juxtaposing the CD3\u03b5 chains (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kuhns et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

We have observed that some TCR is exported to the surface of transfected 293Ts even when CD3 assembly is incomplete (i.e. 26%, 0%, 52%, and 100% residual export respectively when omitting CD3\u03b4, CD3\u03b5, CD3\u03b3, or CD3\u03b6 from transfection). We suspected that this accounted for the low level of apparent pairing between dsTCR and wtTCR chains observed on 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). To determine whether dsTCRs form a complex with endogenous CD3 in T cells, we transduced the Jurkat human T cell line with wt- and dsTCRs and used flow cytometry to assess surface expression. Both dsTCR<sub>C</sub> and dsTCR<sub>cp</sub> assemble endogenous CD3, express on the cell surface, and bind cognate A2/MART1 multimers to an extent similar to the wtTCR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). By contrast, hybrid constructs comprising one dsTCR chain and one wtTCR chain were not detectable on the surface of transduced Jurkat cells, indicating that, as expected, these mispaired constructs failed to form a mature complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Virtually all transduced (Myc271<sup>+</sup>) cells were positive for A2/MART1 staining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), indicating the dsTCRs competed favorably for CD3 recruitment in the presence of the endogenous Jurkat TCR. To determine whether dsTCR/CD3 complexes are functional, dsTCR-transduced Jurkat T cells were coincubated with K562 target cells expressing either cognate A2/MART1 or control A2/NYESO1 single-chain trimer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hansen et al., 2009</a>).

We therefore transduced primary T cells with wt- and dsTCRs to assess their function in a more physiologically relevant context. As expected, wtTCR was detected in only a subset (74%) of transduced (LNGFR<sup>+</sup>) cells, indicating\u00a0~25% of T cells express an endogenous TCR that out-competes F5 TCR for CD3 recruitment and cell surface expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Dextramer staining was lower for dsTCRs than wtTCRs in primary T cells (25% and 11% of LNGFR+ cells, for dsTCR<sub>C</sub> and dsTCR<sub>cp</sub>, respectively; MFI\u00a0=\u00a021% and 13% that of wtTCR). This indicates a larger subset of endogenous TCRs outcompete the dsTCRs for CD3 recruitment. Nonetheless, T cells transduced with either wtTCR or dsTCRs were functional, secreting IFN-\u03b3 and upregulating cell surface CD25 in an antigen-specific manner when coincubated with target cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I,J</a>). As with Jurkat cells, simulated mispaired constructs elicited no such activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I,J</a>).

To investigate whether dsTCR chains can mispair with any of the diverse array of endogenous TCR chains expressed across primary T cells, we devised an assay for measuring mispairing without regard to antigenic specificity. We tagged the N-termini of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains of F5 TCR with cMyc and V5 epitope tags, respectively, and confirmed that the addition of these tags did not alter TCR surface expression on Jurkat T cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then delivered each chain individually (i.e. Myc-\u03b1 only or V5-\u03b2 only), such that the export of the tagged TCR chain is dependent on mispairing with endogenous TCR chains. The wt\u03b1 and wt\u03b2 chains of F5 TCR mispaired with endogenous TCR chains in 88% and 58% of transduced T cells, respectively. By contrast, neither ds\u03b1 nor ds\u03b2 chains exhibited detectable mispairing with endogenous TCR chains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Mice that develop TI-GvHD due to TCR chain mispairing exhibit destruction of the hematopoietic compartment and rapid weight loss, generally necessitating sacrifice within 1\u20132 days of onset of cachexia. We transduced T cells with wt- and dsTCR derivatives of OTI TCR, as this TCR resulted in the highest incidence of TI-GvHD of those TCRs tested in the initial report of the model. Based on our finding that dsTCR chains do not mispair with endogenous TCR chains, we expected to recapitulate TI-GvHD in wtTCR-transduced T cell recipients, but not in dsTCR-transduced T cell recipients. Indeed, mice that received wtTCR(IRES)-transduced T cells - in which the transduced wtTCR chains were linked by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence \u2013 exhibited significant cachexia following IL-2 administration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Although some of these mice regained weight and survived, 47% (7/15) developed TI-GvHD to an extent that necessitated euthanasia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bendle et al., 2010</a>), the incidence of TI-GvHD could be reduced but not eliminated by replacing the IRES with a viral 2A sequence to ensure stoichiometric expression of the wtTCR chains. In this wtTCR(2A) group, less weight loss was observed and only 1/15 mice developed fatal TI-GvHD. By contrast, cachexia was not observed for mice that received dsTCR<sub>C</sub>(2A)-transduced T cells, and none (0/25) of these mice developed TI-GvHD. Thus, dsTCRs prevent mispairing and thereby prevent mispairing-related autoimmune complications in a model of TCR gene therapy."

Mouse T cells transduced with OTI wtTCR or dsTCR<sub>C</sub> produced a similar complement of cytokines upon stimulation with cognate peptide-MHC multimer (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The ovalbumin-expressing murine thymoma line, E.G7, grew in all control mice injected with LNGFR-transduced T cells, but did not grow detectably in any mice injected with either wtTCR- or dsTCR-transduced T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Tumor cell killing was antigen-specific, because EL4\u00a0\u2013 the ovalbumin-negative parental line from which E.G7 was derived \u2013\u00a0grew readily in mice injected with dsTCR-transduced T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The relative efficacies of wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced T cells were compared by titrating down the number of T cells injected prior to tumor cell injection. Both wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced T cells slowed tumor growth when mice were injected with 1 T cell per 500 tumor cells, and prevented tumor growth entirely at higher tested ratios (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

However, TI-GvHD was not eliminated entirely, indicating incomplete knockdown of endogenous TCR. We hypothesized that combining dsTCRs with endogenous TCR knockdown would improve cell surface expression of dsTCRs while also eliminating TI-GvHD entirely. To investigate this combination approach, we transduced mouse T cells with vectors that co-delivered 1) shRNA targeting endogenous TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 genes and 2) codon-optimized wt- and dsTCR versions of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific P14 murine TCR. As previously shown (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bunse, 2014</a>), the \u03b2 chain (V<sub>\u03b2</sub>8) of P14 wtTCR was disproportionally detected on the cell surface relative to the \u03b1 chain (V<sub>\u03b1</sub>2) - indicative of mispairing - even when translational stoichiometry was ensured through the use of a viral 2A sequence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Co-delivery of shRNA resulted in knockdown of endogenous TCR surface expression to\u00a0~40% of normal levels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), improving the balance of P14 wtTCR chains expressed on the surface and increasing tetramer staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Reflecting the lack of mispairing exhibited by dsTCRs, the domain-swapped \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains were detected in equal amounts on the cell surface with or without endogenous TCR knockdown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, knockdown greatly improved surface expression and tetramer binding of the P14 dsTCR by reducing competition for assembly with CD3 chains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

By contrast, no TI-GvHD was observed in mice receiving P14 dsTCR-transduced T cells, whether or not shRNAs were co-delivered. As with OTI dsTCR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), P14 dsTCR did not induce TI-GvHD because the P14 domain-swapped \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains did not mispair with endogenous chains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). By contrast, individually delivered P14 wild-type \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains mispaired with endogenous chains even when both endogenous chains were knocked down. In fact, knockdown of both endogenous chains increased mispairing of P14 wt\u03b1, suggesting the reduction of competing endogenous \u03b1 enabled more mispairing of the weak P14 wt\u03b1 with the remaining endogenous \u03b2 chain. Prevention of TCR mispairing via endogenous TCR knockdown therefore relies on both the reduction of endogenous TCR and the equal (over)expression of the transduced TCR chains. Taken together, these results suggest that a combination approach of endogenous TCR knockdown and dsTCR transduction may optimize safety and efficacy over either approach alone."

This is an attractive therapeutic approach as it provides a continuous supply of antigen-specific na\u00efve T cells with optimal replicative potential (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hinrichs et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, expression of a pre-rearranged TCR in HSCs suppresses rearrangement of the endogenous TCR in these cells via allelic exclusion (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hinrichs et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Vatakis, 2013</a>). As allelic exclusion in TCR-transduced HSCs is incomplete, however, there remains a risk that TCR mispairing can precipitate autoimmunity.

In contrast to dextramer binding, these functional outputs were reduced for chimeric dsTCRs relative to wtTCR, indicating chimeric domain-swapping partially impaired signaling capacity. Replacing the chimeric TCR cytoplasmic signaling domains with those from \u03b1\u03b2 TCR did not substantively alter the function of chimeric dsTCRs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As observed in Jurkats, chimeric ds\u03b1<sub>\u03b4</sub>, ds\u03b1<sub>\u03b3</sub>, and ds\u03b2<sub>\u03b4</sub> chains did not mispair productively with wild-type \u03b1\u03b2 TCR chains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013H</a>). Only the wt\u03b1/ds\u03b2<sub>\u03b3</sub> mispaired construct exhibited low levels of dextramer binding (7% of wt) and secreted IFN-\u03b3 (20% of wt), indicating some allowance for pairing between constant TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b3 domains. Thus, substitution of constant domains of tumor-specific \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs with corresponding \u03b3\u03b4 TCR domains produces a chimeric receptor that mediates functional, antigen-specific T cell immunity with minimized mispairing risk."

However, mispairing between introduced and endogenous TCR chains produces autoreactive human T cells <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">van Loenen et al., 2010</a>) and causes graft-vs-host disease in mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bendle et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bunse, 2014</a>), indicating that TCR gene transfer poses a non-theoretical risk of autoimmunity. As the potency of TCR gene therapy is augmented through combination with other immunotherapies (e.g. checkpoint blockade), there may be a concomitant rise in mispairing-related serious adverse events. This work describes a domain-swapping strategy to prevent TCR mispairing, thereby improving the safety of this promising approach."

Interchain domain-swapped TCRs prevent mispairing-related autoreactivity through three potential mechanisms: (1) dsTCR chains mispair with wtTCR chains inefficiently due to juxtaposition of non-interacting domains (i.e. neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 self-associate); (2) mispairing between wt and ds chains results in a receptor that incompletely assembles with CD3 chains and is degraded; (3) mispaired wt/dsTCRs that escape degradation and express on the surface with an incomplete complement of CD3 chains will have impaired signaling capacity. Thus, proper dsTCR/CD3 complex assembly is central to the differential function of correctly paired versus mispaired dsTCRs. The detailed mechanism by which dsTCRs assemble with CD3 chains remains open. The transmembrane domains and connecting peptides of wtTCRs participate in complex assembly while the ectodomains contribute to complex stability and signaling (<a href=\"#bib8\">Call et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuhns and Davis, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Xu and Call, 2006</a>). The dsTCRs reorient these domains with respect to one another. Despite this, dsTCRs assemble with CD3 chains with proper juxtaposition of CD3\u03b5 chains, express on the cell surface, and mediate functional, antigen-specific responses, including tumor cell killing. This indicates that dsTCR/CD3 complexes preserve the transmembrane contacts between the TCR and CD3 chains that are essential for complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib8\">Call et al., 2002</a>). If transmembrane orientation is preserved, it is unlikely that the short, rigid CD3 connecting peptides can contact the reoriented TCR ectodomains, resulting in presumed (though undemonstrated) disruption of these stabilizing contacts. This could account for the generally lower surface expression observed for dsTCRs relative to the wtTCR. The dsTCR<sub>cp</sub> construct additionally reorients the connecting peptides with respect to the transmembrane domains, consistent with its generally lower surface expression relative to the dsTCR<sub>C</sub> construct. That both of these constructs transduce extracellular ligand binding into intracellular signaling suggests that the function of the TCR/CD3 complex is remarkably robust toward structural perturbation."

                        "text": "The functional avidity of dsTCR-transduced T cells can be optimized for clinical application in several ways. First, wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced Jurkat T cells performed equivalently in functional assays, indicating the importance of high transduction efficiency. Second, assembly of dsTCRs with CD3 may be improved by reducing the number of endogenous TCRs competing for these chains. In this work, we showed that dsTCRs are compatible with TCR-transduced HSC transfer, as well as with shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous TCR genes. Combining dsTCRs with these adjunct approaches improved cell surface expression of dsTCRs and safeguarded against mispairing with residual endogenous TCR. Third, swapping domains closer to the V-C junction would avoid reorienting constant domains with respect to each other, thereby preserving all contacts with CD3. We attempted to optimize such a construct in this work (dsTCR<sub>V</sub> and dsTCR<sub>C\u03b4\u03b3</sub>), but found that all constructs that swapped domains at the V-C junction abrogated TCR surface expression completely. Interestingly, a conceptually related approach has been used to ensure correct pairing of heavy and light chains in bispecific antibodies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schaefer et al., 2011</a>), and the lead architecture (CrossMab<sup>CH1-CL</sup>) from that application swapped domains at the V-C junction (i.e. the elbow). It is unclear why the dsTCR<sub>V</sub> variant was entirely nonfunctional whereas analogously manipulated CrossMab antibodies bind antigen with affinity comparable to wild-type Fab. This may be attributable to a more flexible antibody hinge or to the specifics of how the domain-swap was achieved. Notably, the CrossMab approach differed from ours in that domains were swapped asymmetrically between chains (i.e. heavy chain residues were duplicated in the hinge/elbow region of both the heavy and light chains), so a similar modification to our approach may identify a functional dsTCR design that is swapped near the V-C junction."

The findings are of interest both for adding to the understanding of the structural constraints on T cell receptor assembly and signaling, and for creating a novel technological modality to add to the growing portfolio of methods for tumor-directed immunotherapy."
