They interact with particular viral RNAs, most of them being still unknown. To decipher the viral RNA signature on RLRs during viral infection, we tagged RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2) and applied tagged protein affinity purification followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of associated RNA molecules. Two viruses with negative- and positive-sense RNA genome were used: measles (MV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). NGS analysis revealed that distinct regions of MV genome were specifically recognized by distinct RLRs: RIG-I recognized defective interfering genomes, whereas MDA5 and LGP2 specifically bound MV nucleoprotein-coding region. During CHIKV infection, RIG-I associated specifically to the 3\u2019 untranslated region of viral genome. This study provides the first comparative view of the viral RNA ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 in the presence of infection."

They interact with particular viral RNAs, most of them being still unknown. To decipher the viral RNA signature on RLRs during viral infection, we tagged RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2) and applied tagged protein affinity purification followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of associated RNA molecules. Two viruses with negative- and positive-sense RNA genome were used: measles (MV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). NGS analysis revealed that distinct regions of MV genome were specifically recognized by distinct RLRs: RIG-I recognized defective interfering genomes, whereas MDA5 and LGP2 specifically bound MV nucleoprotein-coding region. During CHIKV infection, RIG-I associated specifically to the 3\u2019 untranslated region of viral genome. This study provides the first comparative view of the viral RNA ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 in the presence of infection."

                        "text": "Because of increasing global population and worldwide exchanges, infections by RNA viruses are expanding with a huge impact on public health. New infections are emerging almost every year (pandemic flu, West Nile encephalitis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, chikungunya, Ebola), tropical fevers are expanding (dengue, zika) and even previously controlled diseases are re-emerging (measles, poliomyelitis). Although several efficient vaccines against RNA viruses are used in human medicine, we still lack potent therapeutic treatments for the majority of viral infections as well as rational strategies to create efficient new vaccines. Recent progress in our understanding of cellular pathways controlling viral replication suggests that modulating host cell functions early upon viral infection could inhibit a large panel of RNA viruses (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Shirey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Es-Saad et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013</a>). The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) appear to be located at the frontline of the evolutionary race between viruses and the host immune system (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vasseur et al., 2011</a>). These are cellular proteins that detect invasion of viral nucleic acid species inside the cytoplasm and initiate innate immune responses against viral infections that limit virus replication and trigger an adequate adaptive immune response (<a href=\"#bib21\">Errett and Gale, 2015</a>). RLR signalling operates ubiquitously. Hence, RLRs represent attractive strategies for antiviral therapy and vaccine development."

                        "text": "The RLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a group of cytosolic RNA helicases that can identify viral RNA as non-self <i>via</i> binding to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs. To date three RLR members have been identified: RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene-I), MDA5 (Melanoma-Differentiation-Associated gene 5), and LGP2 (Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2) (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib39\">Loo and Gale, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dixit and Kagan, 2013</a>]). They share a number of structural similarities including their organization into three distinct domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>): i) an N-terminal region consisting of tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD), ii) a central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain with the capacity to hydrolyze ATP and to bind RNA, and iii) a repressor domain (RD) embedded within the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). These RNA helicases interact with particular signatures of viral RNA, most of which are still unknown. Upon ligand recognition, RLRs bearing the CARD domain (MDA5 and RIG-I), undergo a conformational change that permits the CARD domain to be recruited and to oligomerize with MAVS either in the peroxisome or the mitochondrion. This activates signalling pathways leading to translocation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kB into the nucleus to initiate expression and secretion of type I IFNs and other proinflamatory cytokines. Secreted type I IFNs bind to their receptors and activate the JAK/STAT signalling pathway inducing the expression of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) bearing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) (<a href=\"#bib18\">de Veer et al., 2001</a>). If the virus has no means for subverting the interferon pathway, the infected tissue turns into an antiviral state leading to i) apoptosis of the infected cells, ii) limited propagation of the virus by the expression of ISGs in neighbouring cells and iii) generation of a cytokine storm that triggers the specific adaptive immune response as well as favouring immune cell infiltration from the cardiovascular system."

RIG-I confers recognition of hepaciviruses and of members of the <i>Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae</i>, and <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i> families. For example, 5\u2019copy-back defective-interfering (DI) genomes produced by numerous negative-sense RNA viruses specifically associate with RIG-I and activate IFN induction (<a href=\"#bib63\">Strahle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baum et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Komarova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Runge et al., 2014</a>). MDA5 detects members of the <i>Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae</i>, and <i>Coronaviridae. Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, and Arenaviridae</i> are detected by both MDA5 and RIG-I.

This protocol allows exploring biologically active macromolecular complexes within infected cells. Here, we applied this method to study viral RNA signatures sensed by RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 cytosolic receptors upon infection with both negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses.

One-STrEP tag provides a reliable, rapid and efficient protocol for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and protein complexes purification (<a href=\"#bib32\">Komarova et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2013</a>). We tagged the RLRs N-terminally since previous studies have shown that adding N-terminal tags to RLRs had no negative effect on functional interactions with their RNA ligands (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pichlmair et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zhang et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Deddouche et al., 2014</a>). These cell lines were assigned ST-RLR cells (ST-LGP2, ST-MDA5 and ST-RIG-I, respectively). In addition, a stable cell line (assigned ST-CH) expressing the Cherry protein instead of tagged RLRs was generated as a negative control to allow subtraction of non-specific RNA binding. Using RT-qPCR analysis and affinity purification followed by western blot analysis we validated the expression of tagged RLRs by each stable cell line (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013F</a>). We then analysed the functional profiles of the ST-RLR cell lines upon transfection with RIG-I and MDA5 agonists by using a classical IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We observed that transfection of ST-MDA5 and ST-LGP2 cells with MDA5 agonist poly(I:C) elicited an increased IFN-I response. In contrast, transfection of ST-LGP2 cells with the RIG-I agonist 5\u2019triphosphate-RNA (5\u20193P) masked the IFN-I response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). These observations are in accordance with previous studies showing that over-expression of MDA5 or simultaneous co-expression of MDA5 and LGP2 synergize type I IFN response upon activation with MDA-specific agonists or upon infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bruns et al., 2013</a>). LGP2 over-expression has also been previously found to inhibit RIG-I signalling (<a href=\"#bib46\">Moresco and Beutler, 2010</a>). Altogether this demonstrates that the three stable cell-lines that we established express tagged RLRs that are functional and can be purified by affinity chromatography."

To assess CHIKV replication kinetics in tagged RLR cell lines we used a molecular clone of CHIKV (CHIKV-Rluc) at different MOI: 0.05, 1, 2.5. In this virus the reporter <i>Renilla</i> luciferase (<i>Rluc</i>) gene is expressed as an integrated part of the non-structural polyprotein of CHIKV. The CHIKV-Rluc allows monitoring the early stage of viral replication (<a href=\"#bib27\">Henrik Gad et al., 2012</a>). CHIKV-Rluc replicated in the 4 cell lines as detected by strong Rluc expression and classical growth kinetics for this virus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, similarly to MV we observed that CHIKV replication was reduced at low MOI in ST-RIG-I cells. This observation was confirmed by measuring the accumulation of E2 glycoprotein, a late viral product, in ST-RLR cells during infection with <i>wt</i> CHIKV.

Indeed, it is believed that at early stage of the viral cycle dsRNA intermediary products are sensed by RLR receptors to activate type I IFN signalling. CHIKV non-structural proteins translation and viral genome replication are performed at early steps of replication. This stage can be monitored using CHIKV-Rluc. We observed Rluc accumulation starting from 8\u2009hr post-infection in the ST-RLR and in ST-CH cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and C</a> left axis). In addition, dsRNA presence was assessed in cells infected with <i>wt</i> CHIKV by using intracellular staining with an anti-dsRNA antibody and flow cytometry analysis. We observed dsRNA accumulation starting from 10\u2009hr post-infection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> right axis). Further, efficient translation of the structural E2 glycoprotein that corresponded to the late stage of CHIKV replication was observed at 15\u2009hr post-infection in all three ST-RLR cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a> right axis).

Indeed, NGS data analysis showed specific MDA5 association with RNA sequences of positive polarity, which most likely correspond to the MV-N mRNA or a read-through transcript of the MV leader region containing N coding sequence (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). LGP2 associated RNA sequences represented only a short part of the N coding region and were also enriched in L gene-derived RNAs with both positive and negative polarities (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Surprisingly, we failed to detect any RIG-I specific reads aligning to the MV genome (not shown). This was unexpected since in the above-presented silencing experiment, RIG-I was the only important of the three RLRs sensor for innate immunity activation upon MV infection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Thus, we performed a second RIG-I purification and NGS experiment. For this second RIG-I/RNA sequencing the viral genome coverage ranged from 144X to 1856X.

MV 5\u2019 copy-back DI genomes are known interactors of RIG-I. Therefore, we looked for the presence of DI RNA molecules in ST-RIG-I cells infected with MV by using universal 5\u2019 copy-back DI genome specific primers. RT-PCR analysis failed to detect any 5\u2019 copy-back DI RNA in infected ST-RIG-I cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Interestingly, when the same cells were infected with MV\u25b3V virus deficient in V protein, two DNA fragments of approximately 1 and 4 kb were amplified from total RNA samples using 5\u2019 copy-back DI genome specific primers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Furthermore, sequencing analysis revealed that the 1\u00a0kb RT-PCR amplicon contained all the 5\u2019 copy-back DI-RNA features. Indeed, this 1236 nucleotide-long DI genome included genomic 'trailer' (Tr) and the reverse complement of the Tr sequences at the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 extremities and the exact complementary of the extremities of 201 nucleotides able to hybridize to form a stem-loop structure (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Sequencing analysis of the 4-kb amplicon suggested that it could correspond to a mosaic type of MV DI genome (<a href=\"#bib44\">Marriott and Dimmock, 2010</a>). Further, the immunostimulatory activity of RIG-I/RNA purified from MV\u25b3V infected cells demonstrated a significant increase in ISRE stimulation compared to RIG-I/RNA purified from MV infected cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

These cytoplasmic proteins detect invasion of viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells and trigger innate immunity. The inflammatory response is necessary for limiting viral replication and initiating a specific adaptive immune response. Most of the studies on RLR specific viral RNA ligands are performed in the absence of a productive virus infection (for review see [<a href=\"#bib71\">Yoneyama et al., 2015</a>]). These studies are based on transfection within cells of RNAs coming from infected cells, expression of viral-coding sequences from plasmids, or transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA or synthetic RLR agonists such as poly(I:C). Recently, to characterize RNA ligands of RLRs in the presence of active viral infections (Sendai and Influenza viruses, then MV and EMCV), NGS has been applied on RNAs isolated from infected cells by co-IP. In these studies the methodological approach was based on either Photo Activable-Ribonucleoside-enhanced CrossLinking and co-IP (PAR-CLIP) or simple co-IP followed by NGS. Using these approaches for Sendai and Influenza viruses only RIG-I specific RNA partners were analysed (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baum et al., 2010</a>), for EMCV only LGP2-specific RNA partners were sequenced (<a href=\"#bib19\">Deddouche et al., 2014</a>), and for MV RIG-I and MDA5 specific RNA partners were studied simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib54\">Runge et al., 2014</a>). The disadvantages of RNA-protein isolation by co-IP approaches are that (i) they rely on the availability of high-affinity antibodies against the protein of interest and (ii) they often lack an appropriate negative control. Negative control antibodies with different affinities and directed against proteins that are absent from the cells can easily underestimate the background noise generated by co-IP followed by NGS. Also, for the PAR-CLIP methodology, the incorporation of the nucleoside analogue 4-thiouridine (4SU) within RNA during the active cycle of viral replication could change the molecular properties of viral and cellular RNAs, thus creating an artificial environment."

In addition, a stable cell line expressing CH protein fused to the same One-STrEP-tag was used as a control for non-specific binding. These tools allow studying the three RLRs in the same setting and to characterize their specific viral RNA ligands in the course of infection. Indeed, we isolated specific RLR RNA ligands from these cells infected with MV and CHIKV, respectively a negative- and a positive-sense RNA virus. Three biological replicates were performed for each RLR and an appropriate negative control (CH/RNA) allowed subtracting non-specific binding and to perform rigorous statistical analyses."

Consistent with previous studies we observed that RIG-I/RNAs provided a stronger immunostimulatory activity in comparison to MDA5/RNA molecules (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ikegame et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Runge et al., 2014</a>).

The inflammatory response in non-hematopoietic cells is known to be dependent on MAVS, the adaptor molecule necessary for both RIG-I and MDA5, however which of the two receptors is involved in sensing CHIKV is still unknown (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schilte et al., 2010</a>). We found that RIG-I specifically interacts with the 3\u2019-UTR of CHIKV genome. Despite the higher coverage of the CHIKV genome compared to MV genome in our NGS data, we failed to observe specific enrichment in CHIKV reads on LGP2 and MDA5 receptors. The observation that RIG-I specifically interacts with CHIKV 3\u2019-UTR is very promising (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Indeed, the 3\u2019-UTR of positive-sense RNA viruses has already been shown to be particularly immunoactive (<a href=\"#bib55\">Saito et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schnell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kell et al., 2015</a>). CHIKV 3\u2019-UTR contains multiple 21 nucleotide-long repeated sequence elements forming dsRNA structures, which are possible targets for RIG-I (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2013b</a>). Interestingly, the 3\u2019-UTR has recently been described as a region particularly sensitive to the evolutionary pressure exerted by mosquito vectors (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we observed that in the mammalian host RIG-I targets the same viral region.

Indeed, RNaseL induces type I IFN <i>via</i> production of short-length RNA molecules of viral and cellular origins by the mechanism that includes interaction with MDA5 and RIG-I (<a href=\"#bib42\">Malathi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">2010</a>). In the current experimental setup we used a sample multiplexing that allowed an appropriate analysis of relatively long viral-derived RNA and not cellular RNA molecules. Alternatively, it is possible that MV RIG-I-specific RNA ligands are short length and thus not compatible with the classical Illumina NGS protocol applied in this study. In the future this protocol will be adapted to study small size RLR partners and to study RLR-specific cellular partners."

Using NGS, they mapped this RNA on the L region of the EMCV genome. Numerous functional assays were performed to validate that the L region is a key determinant of the MDA5 stimulatory activity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Deddouche et al., 2014</a>). This work supported previous studies showing that in an infected cell, MDA5 and LGP2 positively cooperate with each other (<a href=\"#bib68\">Venkataraman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Satoh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bruns and Horvath, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Childs et al., 2013</a>). In vitro studies of MDA5 suggested that MDA5 hypothetically recognizes long dsRNA molecules like poly(I:C) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kato et al., 2008</a>). MDA5 binds dsRNA from the stem of the molecule and starts forming filaments towards its extremities (<a href=\"#bib49\">Peisley et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Recent studies of autoimmune disorders have proposed that MDA5 detects aberrant secondary structures formed by self mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liddicoat et al., 2015</a>). All these are evidences that most certainly MDA5 natural ligands are RNA stem structures embedded within different RNAs. In concordance with this, our results show that MDA5 recognizes the integrity of the MV-N mRNA, certainly through the recognition of stem loop structures. Further, our in silico (Mfold) prediction of RNA secondary structures within the different parts of the MV genome suggested that MV-N mRNA had a potential to form stem loop structures (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>)."

Our data further confirmed this MDA5/LGP2 synergy. We demonstrated that upon MV infection MDA5 and LGP2 were binding similar viral RNA ligands. Indeed, these LGP2 specific RNAs were encompassing the MV-N segment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). However, while the whole MV-N mRNA was bound by MDA5, the LGP2-specific reads were mostly localized in the 5\u2019-end of the N region. Furthermore, when transfecting in vitro transcribed RNAs corresponding to the MDA5- and LGP2-specific regions of the MV genome in human epithelial cells, we identified a higher immunostimulatory activity of the 5\u2019-end of the N mRNA compared to RNA fragments of similar size but coming elsewhere from the genome (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). These data suggest that, upon MV infection, LGP2 and MDA5 specifically interact with the same RNA agonist and that LGP2 could be involved in stabilizing short MDA5 filaments formed on secondary structures localized at the 5\u2019-end of the MV-N mRNA."

Our results show that each of these cytosolic sensors has its individual RNA profile upon infection with different RNA viruses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>). Previous studies demonstrated RIG-I specific binding to the AU- and polyU/UC-rich regions of viral genomes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Saito et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schnell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Runge et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kell et al., 2015</a>). In our results RLR-specific binding cannot simply be explained by primary RNA composition or AU/GC content of RNA ligands. Indeed, we found RIG-I preferential binding to the AU-rich sequences (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), but this binding was observed only when a dsRNA-containing DI genome was produced by the recombinant MV\u25b3V. These results suggest that RIG-I recognizes specific RNA secondary structures. MDA5 and LGP2 specificity to AU-rich RNAs was less pronounced (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>). Additional studies should be performed to obtain a clearer view on the similarities and the differences of RNA structures recognized by each of the three RLRs. For this, we are currently applying our One-STrEP-RLR approach to three other RNA viruses as well as to an intracellular bacterium. As a consequence, this work offers new strategies for immune and antiviral therapies by targeting the RLR pathway for the therapeutic control of viral infections, enhancing the immune response for vaccines, and conceiving strategies for immune suppression to control inflammation or specific autoimmune diseases."

It is known that three RLR members (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) are playing the cytosolic receptor to response for RNA viruses. However, their individual biological ligands are not clear and the molecular mechanism between RLRs and the associated viral RNAs is also unknown. To address this issue, the authors established the One-STrEP-tagged RLRs assay system. This system is well designed and has not disturbed the biological functions of RLRs in stable cell lines. The authors also optimized the best time points to purify the RLR-associated viral RNA ligands under various conditions. The NGS study showed that the MDA5 recognizes the positive strand of MV N region and LGP2 recognizes both stands of L region. For CHIKV infection, RIG-I accesses both strands of 3'UTR in viral genome. The whole data set reveals how RLRs recognize the viral RNA ligands during infection."

How does host immune system recognize RNA signatures, and what kind of RNA signatures could be recognized by RNA sensors, are two important questions regarding innate immunity and development of antiviral strategy. This study has explored a new approach to identify immunostimulatory viral RNA signatures and found new features of RLR-mediated RNA sensing.

The evolutional pressure exerted by mosquito vectors on this region and the length of CHIKV 3\u2019-UTR are directly linked to the viral pathogenesis (Chen et al., 2013, PMID: 24009512; Stapleford et al., 2016, PMID: 26807575).

MV belongs to the order <i>Mononegavirales,</i> in which the relative efficiency of expression of the various viral genes depends on a gradient of transcription. Indeed, MV transcription is initiated from a single promoter at the 3\u2019 end of the genome and at each gene junction the virus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase either falloff or continue the transcription of the downstream gene (Collins et al., 1980, PMID: 7420539; He et al., 1999, PMID: 10400712; Plumet et al., 2005, PMID: 15890929). Thus, due to this gradient of transcription, promoter-proximal genes are expressed more efficiently than promoter-distal genes, a differential level that corresponds to the virus needs. To provide a clear vision of MV transcriptome, we now introduced a figure with NGS analysis of total RNA from MV-infected cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and discussed this in the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cNGS analysis reveals that distinct regions of MV genome are specifically recognized by distinct RLRs\u201d, first paragraph)."

However, we used statistical methods that are well adapted to analyse count data with a low number of replicates. These methods have been shown to be among the most reliable (Soneson and Delorenzi, 2013, PMID: 23497356) and to control the false positive rates to expected levels."

In order to assess the immunostimulatory activity of RLR-specific RNA fragments synthesised in vitro and containing the RLR specific signatures, human PBMCs were transfected ex vivo. Indeed, we observed an increased secretion of type-I IFN. However, we were unable to discriminate what percentage of the response was TLR-dependent or RLR- dependent. In the presence of TLR7/8 inhibitor, the cytokine response was strongly reduced (Data not shown). Therefore, using immune cells represented a technical bias that makes it complicated to address this question in the allotted period. However, we believe that studying the RLR response in non-immune cells that do not respond through the TLR pathway is highly pertinent. Indeed, RLRs are ubiquitously expressed, and any cell is susceptible of recognizing viral RNA in their cytoplasm. In addition, non-immune cells are classically used as a model to study the RLR response (Plumet et al., 2005, PMID: 15890929; Runge et al. 2014, PMID: 24743923 Schilte et al., 2012, PMID: 20123960). Consequently, validation experiments were done using MV-permissive epithelial cells naturally lacking TLR7/8 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>)."
