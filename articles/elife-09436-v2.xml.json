This study sought to identify actionable gene targets by selective targeting of the molecular networks that support sarcoma cell proliferation. Silencing of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an amidotransferase that converts aspartate into asparagine, produced the strongest inhibitory effect on sarcoma growth in a functional genomic screen of mouse sarcomas generated by oncogenic <i>Kras</i> and disruption of <i>Cdkn2a</i>. ASNS silencing in mouse and human sarcoma cell lines reduced the percentage of S phase cells and impeded new polypeptide synthesis. These effects of ASNS silencing were reversed by exogenous supplementation with asparagine. Also, asparagine depletion via the ASNS inhibitor amino sulfoximine 5 (AS5) or asparaginase inhibited mouse and human sarcoma growth in vitro, and genetic silencing of ASNS in mouse sarcoma cells combined with depletion of plasma asparagine inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells may represent a metabolic vulnerability with potential anti-sarcoma therapeutic value."

This study sought to identify actionable gene targets by selective targeting of the molecular networks that support sarcoma cell proliferation. Silencing of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an amidotransferase that converts aspartate into asparagine, produced the strongest inhibitory effect on sarcoma growth in a functional genomic screen of mouse sarcomas generated by oncogenic <i>Kras</i> and disruption of <i>Cdkn2a</i>. ASNS silencing in mouse and human sarcoma cell lines reduced the percentage of S phase cells and impeded new polypeptide synthesis. These effects of ASNS silencing were reversed by exogenous supplementation with asparagine. Also, asparagine depletion via the ASNS inhibitor amino sulfoximine 5 (AS5) or asparaginase inhibited mouse and human sarcoma growth in vitro, and genetic silencing of ASNS in mouse sarcoma cells combined with depletion of plasma asparagine inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells may represent a metabolic vulnerability with potential anti-sarcoma therapeutic value."

Next, the researchers compared gene expression in the mouse sarcoma cells with gene expression in normal mouse muscle cells and found that certain genes appeared to be more highly expressed in the sarcoma cells.

Certain STS types present with tissue-specific features, such as skeletal muscle differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Parham and Barr, 2013</a>). For most STS tumors, cure depends on radical resection and/or radiation of the tumor, and therapeutic options for tumors that have spread regionally and/or systemically are limited (<a href=\"#bib16\">Linch et al., 2014</a>). The genetic spectrum of STS is heterogeneous. Many tumors carry complex karyotypes with variable genetic changes; others express specific oncogenic mutations or exclusive chromosomal translocations within a relatively simple karyotype (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bovee and Hogendoorn, 2010</a>). For RMS, two main genotypes have been described: those characterized by expression of the fusion oncogenes <i>PAX3:FOXO1</i> or <i>PAX7:FOXO1</i> and those that lack these fusions. The most common oncogenic mutations in the latter group of fusion-negative RMS tumors are in the Ras pathway (<a href=\"#bib25\">Shern et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

These genes are enriched in mouse sarcomas and in human RMS as compared to normal mouse or human skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hettmer et al., 2011</a>), and may include transcripts of fundamental importance for sarcoma growth. To examine the contributions of each of these candidate genes to sarcoma growth, we performed a customized shRNA-based proliferation screen. The strongest inhibitory effect on sarcoma cell proliferation was observed after silencing of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), the enzyme that catalyzes cellular synthesis of the non-essential amino acid asparagine. We found that adequate availability of asparagine is required in rapidly proliferating sarcomas cells, likely to support nascent polypeptide synthesis, and that asparagine starvation impedes sarcoma growth. Thus, small molecules targeting asparagine availability (<a href=\"#bib23\">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</a>) could be useful as anti-sarcoma therapeutics."

The myogenic differentiation status of the <i>Ras</i>-driven sarcomas generated in this system depends largely on the cell type transduced, also known as the \u201ccell-of-origin\u201d: <i>Kras; p16p19<sup>null</sup></i> satellite cells typically gave rise to RMS, whereas the identical oncogenetic lesions introduced into fibroadipogenic precursors within the MFA cell pool almost always produced sarcomas lacking myogenic differentiation features (non-myogenic sarcomas, NMS) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hettmer et al., 2011</a>)(<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We previously showed that <i>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </i>mouse sarcomas from each of these cellular origins recapitulate transcriptional profiles across the entire spectrum of human RMS and used this information to identify 141 genes of potential significance for sarcoma growth (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hettmer et al., 2011</a>). To evaluate the functional contributions of each of the previously identified sarcoma-relevant genes, we designed a customized shRNA proliferation screen, using 5 distinct shRNAs per candidate gene (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1\u20134</a>). The screen was carried out in one <i>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </i>RMS and one <i>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </i>NMS cell line, and shRNAs were delivered in puromycin-selectable pLKO lentiviral vectors. Correlation coefficients of 0.8348 and 0.9501 between puromycin-treated and untreated cells confirmed adequate transduction efficiencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,F</a>). As shRNA mediated silencing of Kras (G12v)-IRES-GFP, the driver oncogene used to initiate the mouse sarcomas, markedly inhibits the growth of <i>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </i>sarcoma cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>), shRNAs directed against either GFP or KRAS served as positive controls in this screen and showed clear growth-inhibitory effects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D, 1H-I</a>). Control shRNAs (cntrl-shRNA) directed against LACZ, red fluorescent protein (RFP) and luciferase (LUC) served as negative controls, and showed no growth-inhibitory effects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D, 1H-I</a>). Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis, using an external control set of shGFP-infected and cntrl-shRNA-infected RMS and NMS cells (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary files 3\u20134</a>), validated the ability of this system to distinguish between shRNAs with and without growth-inhibitory effects on sarcoma cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,G</a>). ROC analysis also determined a false discovery rate of &lt;30% for shRNAs associated with a reduction in proliferation to &lt;52% of the average of cntrl-shRNA-infected RMS cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>) and &lt;40% of cntrl-shRNA-infected NMS cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013H</a>). In both RMS and NMS cells, silencing of ASNS (Asparagine Synthetase) produced by far the strongest anti-proliferative effect (p&lt;0.0001, q&lt;0.01, 4\u20135 of 5 shRNAs with FDR&lt;30%; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,I</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary files 5\u20136</a>). ASNS silencing reduced the growth of <i>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </i>RMS and NMS cells to 30.16% and 6.69% of the average of control RMS and NMS cells, respectively. Effective depletion of ASNS protein by the target-specific shRNAs employed in our screen was confirmed by Western Blot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,J</a>)."

Functional genomic screening of genetically engineered mouse sarcomas revealed that asparagine synthetase (ASNS) exerted the strongest observed effect on sarcoma cell proliferation within a small group of genes upregulated in both mouse and human sarcomas. ASNS is the amidotransferase that converts L-aspartic acid into L-asparagine in an energy-consuming enzymatic reaction requiring ATP and a nitrogen source that is L-glutamine in eukaryotic cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</a>). Depletion of functional ASNS in both mouse and human RMS cells reduced the proportion of cells in S phase and impeded synthesis of nascent polypetide chains. Similarly, ASNS silencing in melanoma cells was recently reported to result in cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#bib15\">Li et al., 2015</a>). The effects of ASNS reduction in sarcoma cells were reversed by exogenous supplementation with asparagine, supporting the notion that rapidly growing sarcoma cells depend on adequate availability of intrinsic or extrinsic asparagine to support tumor growth. Moreover, ASNS inhibition significantly slowed mouse sarcoma growth in vivo only when combined with depletion of plasma asparagine, likely reflecting the ability of systemic asparagine in the tumor environment to replenish intracellular asparagine availability after ASNS inhibition.\u00a0We speculate that asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells represents a metabolic vulnerability that could be exploited therapeutically to inhibit rapid tumor growth."

Glycine starvation prolonged the G1 phase of the cell cycle and reduced proliferation, in part because sufficient amounts of this amino acid are required to support de novo purine biosynthesis in rapidly dividing cells. Unlike purine synthesis, protein synthesis in glycine-starved cells remained relatively intact (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jain et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, we found that asparagine starvation of mouse and human sarcoma cells impedes synthesis of nascent polypeptide chains thereby slowing cell proliferation. These results are consistent with observations in soybean, barley and maize where free asparagine levels in developing seeds correlate positively with higher protein levels at maturity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Pandurangan et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, limiting the extracellular supply or blocking the synthesis of single amino acids is known to suppress global translation initiation via activation of GCN2 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor EIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sood et al., 2000</a>). Thus, asparagine in the tumor cell environment may have important functions in controlling the synthesis and turnover of protein in sarcoma cells."

For instance, our data do not exclude the possibility that glutamate deprivation and/or aspartate excess resulting from changes in asparagine biosynthesis negatively impact cell survival and proliferation. However, aspartate carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle (<a href=\"#bib26\">Son et al., 2013</a>), and increased aspartate levels after ASNS knockdown might be predicted to benefit the redox state of sarcoma cells. In addition, it has been suggested that increased glutaminase expression in cancer cells can counterbalance decreased glutamate levels, especially in a glutamine-rich environment (<a href=\"#bib9\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with this notion, we found that glutaminase expression was increased by 7- to 11-fold in mouse sarcoma cells compared to normal mouse muscle (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that this mechanism may be used by sarcoma cells to counteract glutamate reductions that may result from ASNS silencing."

This study also noted that asparagine is the last amino acid synthesized in the TCA cycle and that its amination depends exclusively on glutamine (<a href=\"#bib30\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). Amino acid availability is known to stimulate mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1, which integrates environmental and intracellular signals to regulate cell growth (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jewell et al., 2015</a>).

Indeed, within the cluster of sarcoma genes evaluated, the top-scoring cellular functions were cell cycle control and cell division (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hettmer et al., 2011</a>). However, we note that in addition to ASNS, our list of candidate targets included genes encoding 3 other enzymes relevant for amino acid biosynthesis: branched chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1) and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Both PHGDH and PSAT1 contribute to serine/ glycine biosynthesis, which plays an important role in supporting nucleotide synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jain et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Labuschagne et al., 2014</a>), and recent publications indicate that high expression of PHGDH in tumor tissue is required for cell growth in epithelial malignancies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Locasale et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Possemato et al., 2011</a>).

ASNS in tumor tissue has been linked to the transactivating effects of oncogenic effectors such as <i>TP53</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Scian et al., 2004</a>) and metabolic stress (<a href=\"#bib1\">Balasubramanian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cui et al., 2007</a>). For example, in pancreatic cancer, glucose deprivation upregulated ASNS expression, which, in turn, protected tumor cells from apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation itself (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cui et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, upregulation of ASNS in response to amino acid restriction, such as plasma asparagine depletion by treatment with asparaginase (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cui et al., 2007</a>), is part of a normal physiological adaptation response to counteract nutrient deprivation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Balasubramanian et al., 2013</a>). As sarcomas outgrow the existing vasculature, tumor cells are continuously exposed to a microenvironment in which the supply of nutrients is limited. Increased <i>Asns</i> mRNA expression in <i>Kras;p16p19<sup>null\u00a0</sup></i>mouse sarcomas as compared to normal muscle could occur in response to amino acid and glucose deprivation in rapidly growing sarcomas."

Lymphoblasts are thought to be exquisitely sensitive to asparaginase treatment due to their low ASNS expression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</a>). Growth inhibitory effects of asparaginase on sarcoma cells in vitro were previously reported by Tardito et al (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tardito et al., 2006</a>). However, the response of sarcoma cells to asparaginase alone is moderate to poor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tardito et al., 2006</a>)) when compared to the published spectrum of asparaginase sensitivity of primary lymphoblasts (EC50 concentrations between &lt;0.002 and &gt;10 IU/ml; (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fine et al., 2005</a>)). One published report on the efficacy of asparaginase as a single agent documented remissions in 7 of 32 children with ALL, but there was no objective response in a single patient with RMS (<a href=\"#bib11\">Jaffe et al., 1971</a>). Yet, asparaginase is a well-characterized drug with a relatively favorable toxicity profile that does not overlap with the toxicities of conventional cytostatics used in RMS treatment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Haskell et al., 1969</a>), and the further development of specific, cell-permeable chemical inhibitors of ASNS may open additional therapeutic opportunities (<a href=\"#bib23\">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</a>), especially when combined with systemic asparagine depletion."

Instead, the screen was designed to evaluate the functional contributions of a particular group of sarcoma signature genes that were expressed at higher levels in both <i>Ras</i>-driven mouse sarcomas and human sarcomas. Within this cluster of sarcoma genes, top-scoring cellular functions were cell cycle control and cell division (Hettmer et al., 2011)."

Recently published findings indicate that high expression of PHGDH in tumor tissue is a requirement for cell growth in epithelial malignancies (Locasale et al., 2011; Possemato et al., 2011), and both PHGDH and PSAT1 contribute to serine/glycine biosynthesis which plays an important role in supporting nucleotide synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells (Labuschagne et al., 2014; Jain et al., 2012). Branched chain amino acids provide anaplerotic substrates for the TCA cycle (Boroughs and DeBerardinis, 2015). However, in our screen, silencing of PSAT1, PHGDH or BCAT1 did not result in growth inhibition, suggesting that sarcoma cells show lesser dependence on these pathways."

However, increased glutaminase expression in cancer cells (Huang et al., 2014) could counterbalance glutamate reduction, especially in a glutamine-rich environment. Aspartate, on the other hand, carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle (Chen et al., 2013), and increased aspartate levels after ASNS knockdown conceivably would benefit the redox state of sarcoma cells. Nonetheless, we recognize that disruption of Gln/Glu metabolism may represent an additional mechanism by which modulation of asparagine availability disrupts sarcoma cell growth."

Metabolic pathways promoting cancer cell survival and growth. Nat Cell Biol, 17, 351-9.; Chen et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014). However, we agree with the reviewers that impaired peptide biosynthesis may not be the only mechanism responsible for the asparagine dependence of sarcoma cells observed in this study. Recently published data revealed that, surprisingly, asparagine supplementation suppressed cell death in glutamine-deprived cells (although it did not restore TCA anaplerosis and proliferation) (Huang et al., 2014). Thus, Asparagine appears to promote cellular adaptation to metabolic stress such as glutamine depletion. Zhang et al. also noted that asparagine is the last amino acid synthesized in the TCA cycle and that its amination exclusively depends on glutamine (Huang et al., 2014). Amino acid availability is known to stimulate mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1, which integrates environmental and intracellular signals to regulate cell growth (Jewell et al., 2015). Taken together, these observations by ourselves and others suggest that Asparagine may serve a central role as a cellular sensor of TCA cycle intermediate/reduced nitrogen availability and, ultimately, as a metabolic regulator of cell behavior."
