Developmental studies of sound localization have shown that adaptation to asymmetric hearing loss can be achieved either by reinterpreting altered spatial cues or by relying more on those cues that remain intact. Adaptation to monaural deprivation in adulthood is also possible, but appears to lack such flexibility. Here we show, however, that appropriate behavioral training enables monaurally-deprived adult humans to exploit both of these adaptive processes. Moreover, cortical recordings in ferrets reared with asymmetric hearing loss suggest that these forms of plasticity have distinct neural substrates. An ability to adapt to asymmetric hearing loss using multiple adaptive processes is therefore shared by different species and may persist throughout the lifespan. This highlights the fundamental flexibility of neural systems, and may also point toward novel therapeutic strategies for treating sensory disorders."

The ferrets either learn to remap the altered between-ear comparisons, caused by losing hearing in one ear, onto their new locations. Alternatively, the ferrets learn to locate sounds using only their good ear. Each strategy is suited to localizing different types of sound, but it was not known how this adaptive flexibility unfolds over time, whether it persists throughout the lifespan, or whether it is shared by other species."

In the experiments, adult humans were trained to localize different kinds of sounds while wearing an earplug in one ear. These sounds were presented from 12 loudspeakers arranged in a horizontal circle around the person being tested. The experiments showed that short periods of behavioral training enable adult humans to adapt to a hearing loss in one ear and recover their ability to localize sounds."

Which of these adaptive strategies the participants used depended on the frequencies present in the sounds. The cells in the ear and brain that detect and make sense of sound typically respond best to a limited range of frequencies, and so this suggests that each strategy relies on a distinct set of cells. Keating et al. confirmed in ferrets that different brain cells are indeed used to bring about adaptation to hearing loss in one ear using each strategy. These insights may aid the development of new therapies to treat hearing loss."

                        "text": "A major challenge faced by the brain is to maintain stable and accurate representations of the world despite changes in sensory input. This is important because the statistical structure of sensory experience varies across different environments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mlynarski and Jost, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Qian et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Seydell et al., 2010</a>), but also because long-term changes in sensory input result from a range of sensory impairments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Feldman and Brecht, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Keating and King, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sengpiel, 2014</a>). Adaptation to altered inputs has been demonstrated in different sensory systems, particularly during development, and serves to shape neural circuits to the specific inputs experienced by the individual (<a href=\"#bib24\">Margolis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mendonca, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Schreiner and Polley, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sur et al., 2013</a>). However, many ecologically important aspects of neural processing require the integration of multiple sensory cues, either within or across different sensory modalities (<a href=\"#bib32\">Seilheimer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Seydell et al., 2010</a>). A specific change in sensory input may therefore have a considerable impact on some cues whilst leaving others intact. In such cases, adaptation can be achieved in two distinct ways, as demonstrated by recent studies of sound localization following monaural deprivation during infancy (<a href=\"#bib16\">Keating et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">2015</a>)."

These spectral cues make it possible to localize sounds using a single ear, but only for sounds that have relatively flat spectra (solid lines) and are sufficiently broadband (shape of spectra in narrow frequency bands varies little with location \u2013 see shaded gray region). When spectral features are artificially added to the pre-filtered sound source (dotted lines), these added features can be misattributed to the filtering effects of the head and ears.

Subjects sat at the centre of this array, facing in the direction indicated by the arrow. (<b>B</b>) Spectral profile for a random-spectrum stimulus (black). Spectra were filtered to eliminate abrupt spectral transitions to which the auditory system is insensitive (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The overall amount of spectral randomization was also fixed on each trial (SD = 10 dB). Although the spectrum varied considerably across trials (many different examples are shown in gray), the mean spectrum was relatively flat (red). (<b>C</b>) Our randomization procedure allowed us to set the amount of randomization and overall level of each stimulus, but these parameters could still vary within individual frequency bands. We can measure this for a single stimulus by dividing its spectrum (gray) into one-octave bands and calculating the mean \u00b1 SD amplitude values for each band (black). This indicates that the level (mean) and amount of randomization (SD) of each frequency band fluctuates on each trial. (<b>D,E</b>) To determine whether these differences have an impact on sound localization, we compared the random-spectrum stimuli presented on correct (pink) and incorrect (blue) trials. Relative to mislocalized stimuli, we found that the amount of spectral randomization was smaller for correctly localized stimuli, but only at higher frequencies (<b>D</b>, indicated by asterisk; significant interaction between frequency and correctness of response, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, ANOVA; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, post hoc test). In other words, the spectra of correctly-localized sounds tended to be relatively flat at high frequencies. No differences in sound level were observed between stimuli on correct and incorrect trials (<b>E</b>). Data show mean \u00b1 SEM. (<b>F</b>) To understand the implications of this for sound localization, we subdivided trials into groups (deciles) based on the amount of spectral randomization at high frequencies (1<sup>st</sup> decile represents 10% of trials with the smallest amount of spectral randomization) and quantified sound localization accuracy (% correct) for each group. This indicates that some of our random-spectrum stimuli were more difficult to localize than others, with performance declining as spectral randomization increased at high frequencies. It also supports the view that increasing amounts of spectral randomization progressively degrade the usefulness of spectral cues, which are most prominent at high frequencies."

To the extent that adaptive changes in binaural cue sensitivity are possible in adulthood, as suggested by other sensory manipulations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Trapeau and Schonwiesner, 2015</a>), these may occur at the expense of cue reweighting. It is therefore unclear whether the same adult individuals can adapt to a unilateral hearing loss using multiple adaptive processes. Although numerous studies have shown that spatial hearing is more plastic early in life (<a href=\"#bib17\">Keating and King, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Knudsen et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Popescu and Polley, 2010</a>), behavioral training can facilitate accommodation to altered cues in adulthood (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carlile, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carlile et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kacelnik et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shinn-Cunningham et al., 1998</a>). Here, we show that adult humans are equally capable of using both adaptive processes, provided they are given appropriate training.

In order to directly measure the efficacy of training, earplugs were worn only during training sessions. This contrasts with previous work in which adult humans received minimal training, but were required to wear earplugs for extended periods of everyday life (<a href=\"#bib12\">Florentine, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kumpik et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">McPartland et al., 1997</a>). On ~50% of trials, subjects were required to localize flat-spectrum broadband noise (0.5\u201320 kHz), which provide all of the available auditory spatial cues (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blauert, 1997</a>). With these cue-rich stimuli, trials were repeated following incorrect responses (\u201ccorrection trials\u201d) and subjects were given performance feedback.

The first of these additional stimulus types comprised broadband noise with a random spectral profile that varied across trials (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These stimuli disrupt spectral localization cues because it is unclear whether specific spectral features are produced by the filtering effects of the head and ears or are instead properties of the sound itself (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Keating et al., 2013</a>). Consequently, if subjects adapt to asymmetric hearing loss by giving greater weight to the spectral cues provided by the non-deprived ear, we would expect to see less improvement in sound localization performance for random-spectrum sounds than for flat-spectrum sounds.

Improved localization of pure tones would therefore indicate adaptive processing of binaural cues. Because interaural time differences (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs) are respectively the primary cues for localizing low- (&lt;1.5 kHz) and high-frequency (\u22651.5 kHz) tones (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blauert, 1997</a>), we tested each of these stimuli separately.

Our results also demonstrate that subjects adapt using a combination of cue remapping and cue reweighting. In contrast, previous work has shown that cue remapping did not occur when subjects wore an earplug most of the time for several days, and were therefore able to interact with their natural environments under these hearing conditions, but received relatively little training (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kumpik et al., 2010</a>). This suggests that the nature of adaptation may depend on the behavioral or environmental context in which it occurs. Consequently, it should be possible to devise training protocols that would help subjects to adapt to altered auditory inputs in ways that do not ordinarily occur, or occur more slowly, during the course of everyday life."

Whereas equal amounts of binaural cue remapping occurred at different frequencies, spanning the range where both ITDs and ILDs are available, reweighting of spectral cues was restricted to those frequencies where these cues are most prominent. This suggests that the neural substrates for cue remapping and reweighting are at least partially distinct, with separate populations of cortical neurons displaying different types of spatial plasticity depending on their frequency preferences and sensitivity to different spatial cues."

However, reweighting of these cues is likely to reflect a change in the way they are integrated with other cues, which is thought to occur in the inferior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chase and Young, 2005</a>). This is consistent with the finding that adaptive changes in sound localization behavior in monaurally deprived adult ferrets rely on descending projections from the cortex to the inferior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bajo et al., 2010</a>).

All stimuli were generated in Matlab, sent to a real-time processor (RP2; Tucker Davis Technologies), then amplified and routed to a particular loudspeaker using a power multiplexer (PM2R; Tucker Davis Technologies)."

Different intensities and stimulus types were randomly interleaved across trials. Broadband noise stimuli (0.5\u201320 kHz) either had a flat spectral profile (flat-spectrum) or a spectral profile that varied randomly across trials (random-spectrum). Spectral randomization was produced by adding a vector to the logarithmic representation of the source spectrum (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This vector was created by low-pass filtering the spectra of Gaussian noise stimuli so that all energy was removed at frequencies &gt; 3 cycles/octave (<a href=\"#bib16\">Keating et al., 2013</a>). This removed abrupt spectral transitions to which humans are relatively insensitive (i.e. the width of any remaining peaks and notches exceeded 1/6<sup>th</sup> of an octave) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hofman and Van Opstal, 2002</a>).

Their unpredictable nature also prevented subjects from learning which spectral features were properties of the sound source. If subjects had learned that particular spectral features were invalid cues to sound location (i.e. they were not caused by the filtering effects of the head and ears and were instead properties of the sound source), they might have learned to ignore these features when judging sound location. This would have prevented us from measuring cue reweighting because our ability to do so requires subjects to misattribute spectral properties of the stimulus to the filtering effects of the head and ears."

Successive errors made on correction trials were followed by \u201ceasy trials\u201d, on which the stimulus was repeated continuously until subjects made a response. Recent work has shown that head-movements may enhance adaptation to changes in auditory spatial cues (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carlile et al., 2014</a>). On easy trials, subjects were therefore allowed to move their heads freely until a response was made. Subjects were also not allowed to respond during the first 3\u2009s of easy trials (i.e. any responses made during this period were ignored), which was visually indicated to subjects by the GUI background turning blue. In previous work, ferrets received broadly similar feedback when performing a sound localization task (i.e. incorrect trials were followed by correction trials and easy trials, with the latter allowing for the possibility of head-movements) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Keating et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">2015</a>).

The mean signed error was also calculated to provide a measure of sound localization bias (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kumpik et al., 2010</a>). Although we measured cue remapping at a number of frequencies above 1.5 kHz (2, 4 and 8 kHz), we found comparable training-induced changes in both bias (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.18) and error magnitude (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.58).

Note that the scale of the reverse correlation map (RCM) does not necessarily resemble that of the HRTF because the RCM is affected by the amount of spectral randomization present in stimuli (greater randomization typically produces larger RCM features) as well as the dependence on individual spectral features for localizing sounds in particular directions (i.e. if responses to a particular location can be induced by multiple spectral features or cues, then any given feature will not always be present when responses are made to that location; averaging over these data therefore reduces the scale of features detected by reverse correlation)."

For frequencies above and below 4 kHz, we therefore calculated the average change in spectral feature strength separately, which provided a low- and high-frequency measure of cue reweighting. To facilitate comparison between different adaptive measures, we also separately calculated the average amount of cue remapping for tones above and below 4 kHz. Measures for different adaptive processes, which are expressed in different units, were then standardized by converting them to z scores."

We then identified a rectangle that had the same area but constrained its height to be equal to the maximum firing rate. The width of this rectangle then provided a measure of bandwidth that approximates the width at half-maximum for a Gaussian tuning curve (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartlett et al., 2011</a>)."

The data from different groups were then pooled and re-sampled with replacement to produce two new samples, and the difference between these samples was measured using the same statistic as before.

The principal finding is that (i) cue reweighting to the intact open ear monaural spectral cues and (ii) cue remapping of the distorted ILD and ITD binaural cues to new spatial location both occur in this process of accommodation. Some previous electrophysiological data from ferret cortex is also included that concurs with the behavioural findings in humans. The reviewers agree that this is a well-crafted study that represents a logical step in a sequence of nice experiments from the King group at Oxford over the last few years. The experiments are well executed and the analysis is sound. The reviewers found the results not overly surprising, but they thought they were nonetheless important and worthy of wide dissemination."

On the one hand, the manuscript draws attention to the fact that human accommodation training is based on a small number of relatively brief training episodes (in contrast to the chronic occlusion of previous studies). The demonstration of effective accommodation to this episodic exposure to the distorted cues is itself the most interest finding. On the other hand, the ferret electrophysiological data is obtained from animals reared with a chronic ear-plug since the onset of their hearing. Presumably, the training that these animals received also involved some form of feedback, however, those methods are not mentioned in the manuscript. More critical, however, are the differences in the chronic vs. transient nature of the exposure to the distorted cues. While it may be that both approaches are sufficient to induce the sort of cue reweighting and remapping that is argued for, these differences and resulting potential confounds do need to be grappled with more directly in the Discussion. An extension of the discussion about the differences between the ferret and human data, and how this impacts the main conclusions, is a crucial point that all reviewers felt needs far more attention."

This would have prevented us from determining the weight given to spectral cues.

We attempted to minimize this trial-to-trial variability by constraining the overall amount of spectral randomization on each trial (SD = 10 dB). Nevertheless, within individual frequency bands, the amount of energy (sound level) and spectral randomization (SD of the amplitude values within a given frequency band) fluctuated across trials. This could have made some stimuli more difficult to localize than others by impoverishing certain spatial cues to varying degrees."

We then asked whether there were differences between the stimuli presented on correct versus incorrect trials. We found that the spectra of correctly localized stimuli were flatter than average (i.e. had lower spectral randomization), but only at high frequencies. We found no relationship between trial accuracy and variations of sound level within individual frequency bands. Together, these results confirm our claim that spectral randomization impairs sound localization primarily by limiting the usefulness of high-frequency spectral cues. This provides additional validation for our experimental approach and strengthens the case for using random-spectrum stimuli. We have therefore added this analysis to <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

In the present manuscript, we elected to focus on what happens when monaural spectral and dichotic cues are both useful, as is often the case in natural environments. In particular, we wanted to know what subjects would do spontaneously, without us providing feedback that biased them toward one adaptive strategy or the other. However, it would be interesting to determine what happens when specific cues are explicitly devalued during training. We do not currently have data of this type, and we believe it would require an entirely separate study to do justice to this approach. For example, there are a variety of different factors (e.g. frequency content) which could bias subjects towards using one strategy or the other, but it is unclear which of these is important. It is also possible that the importance of these different factors varies as a function of the task performed, or the environment in which it occurs. Addressing these issues properly represents a key challenge for future work but is beyond the scope of the current manuscript."

On the one hand, the manuscript draws attention to the fact that human accommodation training is based on a small number of relatively brief training episodes (in contrast to the chronic occlusion of previous studies). The demonstration of effective accommodation to this episodic exposure to the distorted cues is itself the most interest finding. On the other hand, the ferret electrophysiological data is obtained from animals reared with a chronic ear-plug since the onset of their hearing. Presumably, the training that these animals received also involved some form of feedback, however, those methods are not mentioned in the manuscript. More critical, however, are the differences in the chronic vs. transient nature of the exposure to the distorted cues. While it may be that both approaches are sufficient to induce the sort of cue reweighting and remapping that is argued for, these differences and resulting potential confounds do need to be grappled with more directly in the Discussion. An extension of the discussion about the differences between the ferret and human data, and how this impacts the main conclusions, is a crucial point that all reviewers felt needs far more attention.</i>"

Nevertheless, despite the methodological differences between our ferret neurophysiology and human behaviour, a surprising aspect of our data is the broad similarity of the findings from these experiments.
