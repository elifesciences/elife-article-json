However, its in vivo mechanisms are unclear. Here, we showed, in mice, that CDG elicits stronger Ab and T<sub>H</sub> responses than the mammalian 2\u20323\u2032-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), and generated better protection against <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> infection than 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP adjuvanted vaccine. We identified two in vivo mechanisms of CDG. First, intranasally administered CDG greatly enhances Ag uptake, including pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis in vivo. The enhancement depends on MPYS (STING, MITA) expression in CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells. Second, we found that CDG selectively activated pinocytosis-efficient-DCs, leading to T<sub>H</sub> polarizing cytokines IL-12p70, IFN\u03b3, IL-5, IL-13, IL-23, and IL-6 production in vivo. Notably, CDG induces IFN\u03bb, but not IFN\u03b2, in vivo. Our study revealed previously unrecognized in vivo functions of MPYS and advanced our understanding of CDG as a mucosal vaccine adjuvant."

However, its in vivo mechanisms are unclear. Here, we showed, in mice, that CDG elicits stronger Ab and T<sub>H</sub> responses than the mammalian 2\u20323\u2032-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), and generated better protection against <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> infection than 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP adjuvanted vaccine. We identified two in vivo mechanisms of CDG. First, intranasally administered CDG greatly enhances Ag uptake, including pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis in vivo. The enhancement depends on MPYS (STING, MITA) expression in CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells. Second, we found that CDG selectively activated pinocytosis-efficient-DCs, leading to T<sub>H</sub> polarizing cytokines IL-12p70, IFN\u03b3, IL-5, IL-13, IL-23, and IL-6 production in vivo. Notably, CDG induces IFN\u03bb, but not IFN\u03b2, in vivo. Our study revealed previously unrecognized in vivo functions of MPYS and advanced our understanding of CDG as a mucosal vaccine adjuvant."

This revealed two ways that cyclic di-GMP enhances the body's immune response to a vaccine. First, cyclic di-GMP improves the uptake of antigens by certain cells exposed to the vaccine, a process that ensures a large number of cells will alert the immune system to the perceived threat. Second, Blaauboer, Mansouri et al. explain that cyclic di-GMP selectively activates immune cells known as dendritic cells, which then produce proteins called cytokines that signal to other cells and coordinate the immune response. A gene called STING (stimulator of interferon genes) controls both cyclic di-GMP induced antigen uptake and the activation of dendritic cells. Further research into these processes is now needed to investigate whether cyclic di-GMP is a suitable mucosal pneumococcal vaccine adjuvant for humans."

It is ubiquitously found in bacteria, but is absent in higher eukaryotes.

Cholera toxin is the most potent experimental mucosal adjuvant. CDG also exhibits balanced T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, and T<sub>H</sub>17 immune responses (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ebensen et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gray et al., 2012</a>).

The ability of cyclic-di-GMP and related cyclic-di nucleotides to bind and activate STING, an ER membrane protein involved in type I IFN responses is well appreciated. Most of the work to date however in this area has focused on the mechanism of action of cyclic-di GMP and STING signaling in cells in culture. This study explores the in vivo mucosal adjuvant activity of cyclic-di GMP and the underlying mechanisms involved. In an elegant series of experiments the authors compare cyclic-di-GMP with cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) an endogenous second messenger also known to bind STING. The authors provide evidence for the superior adjuvant activity of the bacterial ci-di-nucleotide over cGAMP. Moreoever, they provide evidence that cyclic di-GMP promotes its adjuvant activity in vivo by enhancing Ag uptake and via its ability to mobilize mucosal DCs in vivo, to promote its adjuvant effects. The authors generated CD11c-specific deletion of STING and uncover DC intrinsic roles for STING in mediating the adjuvant activities observed. Several really interesting aspects come out of these studies. Firstly, the authors convincingly demonstrate that the effects of cyclic-di-GMP are independent of type I IFN, but rather involve type II and type III IFNs. Secondly, their studies indicate that some in vivo effects of cyclic-di-GMP proceed independently of STING. These latter observations indicate that there are likely additional cyclic-di-GMP receptors important in vivo."
