Due to their unpredictability and complexity, the mechanisms underlying hallucinations remain largely untested. Here we show that visual hallucinations can be induced in the normal population by visual flicker, limited to an annulus that constricts content complexity to simple moving grey blobs, allowing objective mechanistic investigation. Hallucination strength peaked at ~11 Hz flicker and was dependent on cortical processing. Hallucinated motion speed increased with flicker rate, when mapped onto visual cortex it was independent of eccentricity, underwent local sensory adaptation and showed the same bistable and mnemonic dynamics as sensory perception. A neural field model with motion selectivity provides a mechanism for both hallucinations and perception. Our results demonstrate that hallucinations can be studied objectively, and they share multiple mechanisms with sensory perception. We anticipate that this assay will be critical to test theories of human consciousness and clinical models of hallucination."

Due to their unpredictability and complexity, the mechanisms underlying hallucinations remain largely untested. Here we show that visual hallucinations can be induced in the normal population by visual flicker, limited to an annulus that constricts content complexity to simple moving grey blobs, allowing objective mechanistic investigation. Hallucination strength peaked at ~11 Hz flicker and was dependent on cortical processing. Hallucinated motion speed increased with flicker rate, when mapped onto visual cortex it was independent of eccentricity, underwent local sensory adaptation and showed the same bistable and mnemonic dynamics as sensory perception. A neural field model with motion selectivity provides a mechanism for both hallucinations and perception. Our results demonstrate that hallucinations can be studied objectively, and they share multiple mechanisms with sensory perception. We anticipate that this assay will be critical to test theories of human consciousness and clinical models of hallucination."

The participant volunteers were university students with no history of migraines or psychiatric disorders. The students watched an image of a plain white ring flicker on and off around 10 times per second against a black background. All individuals reported seeing pale grey blobs appear in the ring and rotate around it, first in one direction and then the other. These grey hallucinations are much simpler than the complex multi-shape hallucinations people generally experience and so they are easier to study objectively."

The next step is to investigate whether the experimental methods can also model the hallucinations produced by psychiatric disorders."

However, across these classes of hallucination, understanding has been severely limited by the multi-feature (color, form and motion) heterogeneous content that changes unpredictably over time, and typically requires subjective reports or subsequent depiction such as drawing to communicate subjective experience (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allefeld et al., 2011</a>). To study visual hallucinations, we constrained empty-field flicker to a thin annulus that was centred on the fovea\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) .

To test for a cortical contribution to the hallucinated blobs, we devised a version of the hallucination-contrast experiment that depended on cortical interocular cross-talk. We presented two small annuli, one to each eye using a mirror stereoscope, and flickered both rings either synchronously or asynchronously at 2.5\u00a0Hz to 20 new participants. In the asynchronous condition binocular neurons should receive flicker stimulation at ~5\u2009Hz (rather than 2.5\u00a0Hz). Accordingly, if the hallucinated content is the product of binocular neurons, viewers should experience higher contrast in the asynchronous condition as 5\u00a0Hz is closer to the 11\u2009Hz peak in contrast, we found in the first experiment. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> shows exactly this; hallucinations in the asynchronous 2.5\u2009Hz condition were perceived at a higher contrast than in the synchronous condition (<i>t</i>(19) = 2.60, p=0.018). Likewise, the same experiment performed at 21\u2009Hz yielded the opposite pattern of results, the synchronous condition gave higher contrast values (<i>t</i>(19) = 2.28, p=0.034; interaction: <i>F</i>(1, 19) = 8.06, p=0.011), as hallucinations produced by &gt;21\u2009Hz flicker were perceived as lower in contrast in our first experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

For example, binocular rivalry alternations slow during viewing or when the stimulus is moved through visual space (<a href=\"#bib12\">Blake et al., 2003</a>). Participants continuously tracked hallucinated alternations for a 5-min period in a small annulus, immediately followed by a further 5 min of tracking in a larger annulus, that did not spatially overlap with the prior stimulus (order was counter-balanced). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> shows that dominance durations increased over time during a session of same-sized stimulus. Further, in the second period of hallucination tracking, the new different-sized and non-overlapping annulus did not \u2018follow on\u2019 from the slower dynamics, but returned to the original shorter durations. These data suggest that hallucinated bistability can undergo a form of sensory adaptation that is local in visual space. To test if these changes in alternation rate were due to adaptation to the hallucinated content or due to adaptation to the actual perceptual flicker, six participants tracked alternations for 10 consecutive 30\u00a0s periods at three different flicker rates (8.5, 10.6 and 14.2\u2009Hz). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> again shows adaptation, with an increase in dominance durations over time, however across the whole period the alternation rate was not statistically different between the three flicker rates (<i>F</i>(2,24) = 1.76, p=0.19), suggesting the change in alternation rate was not due to flicker adaptation, but most probably due to neural fatigue in neurons representing the hallucinatory bistable structure."

Given that our interest was in hallucinated motion, we applied the motion-energy model directly to the cortical activity patterns rather than to the stimulus pattern. The output of the motion detectors within each bank were linearly combined to form a net motion-energy signal that represented the valence of motion in the detector\u2019s preferred direction. These net motion signals were then fed into distinct neural populations that encoded the perceptual states of Left (counter-clockwise) and Right (clockwise) motion respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, bottom). Perceptual rivalry between these two neural populations was achieved through mutual inhibition and firing rate adaptation (see Appendix 1: <a href=\"#equ11\">Equations 11\u201313</a>). Models of this class replicate spontaneous perceptual switching between ambiguous stimuli and the association of higher switching rates with higher stimulus contrast/energy (<a href=\"#bib21\">Laing and Chow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Shpiro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wilson, 2003</a>).

Standing waves were observed for flicker frequencies in the range 8\u201318\u2009Hz, which we interpret as hallucinatory. Further, it was also possible to induce spatially irregular patterns by adding in weak random connections between the E cells shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> (data not shown). Beyond those frequencies the cortical model produced spatially uniform responses (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>) which we interpreted as non-hallucinatory. The space-time signatures of the flicker-induced standing waves evoked identical responses from both the Left and Right motion detectors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Consequently, those ambiguous motion signals induced spontaneous switching between the two populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The dominance times of each perceptual decision (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) exhibited a long-tailed distribution (<i>M</i> = 5.1\u2009s, <i>SD</i> = 1.6\u2009s) that was qualitatively similar to those observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, it is interesting to note the differences in the shape-parameter (a) of the gamma fits, between the behavioral and model data. This difference could be summed up by describing the model data as being closer to a normal distribution than the behavioral data. One possible reason for the difference could be our choice of Gaussian noise in the rivalry model. Future work could probe different noise distributions to fine tune a model of bistable hallucinations."

Here we show a hallucinated bistable stimulus, in which both the content (form and motion) and alternations in motion are endogenously generated. Counter-phase physical stimuli are known to induce motion percepts that spontaneously switch between the two candidate directions of motion. Our model suggests that uniform flicker can induce spatiotemporal responses in primary visual cortex that are very similar to those induced by counter-phase physical stimuli, given the appropriate choice of spatial and temporal frequencies. We argue that the same neural mechanism that contributes to apparent motion of a counter-phase physical stimulus also contributes to hallucinated experience. It is up to future research to divulge if sensory decisions in endogenously generated content are resolved using the same neural machinery as exogenously sourced perceptual information."

The eight contrast values of the perceptual annulus remained the same when the flickering annulus was presented at 21.3\u2009Hz. However, results from Experiment 1 suggested that hallucinations evoked by 2.5\u2009Hz flicker would be considerably lower in effective contrast. Thus, in blocks in which the annulus was presented at 2.5\u2009Hz, perceptual annuli that would have been presented with a Michelson contrast of 100% were instead presented at 8% to ensure enough data points at lower contrasts for accurate curve fitting and interpolation. The luminance of the darkest section in this perceptual ring was 58.13\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The white fixation point had a radius of 0.140. In synchronous blocks, the annulus presented to each eye flickered in phase with the other, while in asynchronous blocks the annuli flickered exactly out of phase.

The probe was drawn by frames of grey Gaussian blobs (diameter of 1.5\u00b0) that moved around the annulus. Probe contrast levels were denoted by reference to their darkest shade expressed as a percentage of the darkest possible on-screen shade such that 0% would be white (luminance 74.97\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>) and 100% would be black (luminance 0.5\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>). Using this formulation, the six contrast levels in order of ascending visibility were 9.5%, 10%, 11%, 13%, 17%, and 25%, and the corresponding luminance at the centre of each Gaussian blob were 54.09\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 52.43\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 51.45\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 49.02\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 43.31\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 33.45\u2009cd/m<sup>2</sup> respectively."

Responses were not timed and trials progressed immediately upon receiving a response. The fixation point was replaced with a cross during the 2\u2009s inter-trial interval. There was one block of 56 trials for each flicker frequency in each experiment, and block order was randomized between participants. The effective contrast of the hallucinations was estimated from a cumulative Gaussian curve fitted to the proportion of trials on which the participant reported the perceptual annulus as being lower in contrast than the flicker hallucinations at each contrast level of the perceptual annulus. This was done separately for each flicker frequency, using GraphPad Prism version 6.07 for Windows (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA).

Participants viewed the flickering annulus during the on-period and reported the dominant direction of perceived hallucinatory rotation by pressing a key to indicate clockwise or counterclockwise motion in the subsequent off-period. There was a single block of 100 trials; each 6\u2009s trial was composed of a 2\u2009s on-period and 4\u2009s off-period."

In two separate two minute trials for each stimulus, participants tracked the direction of perceived motion of the hallucinatory blobs in the flickering annulus or rotating sphere, or the dominant pattern in binocular rivalry. Participants were required to hold down the key that best represented their perception at each moment in time. There were two keys for the two dominant perceptual alternatives of each stimulus (that\u00a0is, one each for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of flicker hallucinations, one each for rightward and leftward motion of the dots on the front face of the rotating sphere, and one each for the red horizontal and green vertical gratings in the binocular rivalry stimulus), and a third key for an ambiguous percept. Participants completed blocks for each stimulus type one after the other, but the order of pairs of blocks for each stimulus type was randomized between participants."

It corresponds exactly to the preferred stimulus for the LEFT motion detector. The slow flicker stimulus is akin to a strobe stimulus with a frequency that is well below the range where hallucinations are observed in the psychophysics. The expectation was that neither the true motion stimulus nor slow strobe-like flicker should induce standing waves in the cortical model."

The two leftmost columns represent the illusory responses and the two rightmost columns represent the non-illusory responses. To our surprise, the true motion stimulus (panel C) evoked standing waves in the cortical response (panel G) that were akin to those evoked by flicker and counter-phase stimulation (panels E and F). Nonetheless, the cortical response to true motion still contained more leftwards motion than rightwards motion. This is shown by the stronger response of the LEFT motion detector <math id=\"inf73\"><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow id=\"XM96\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mn>0.062</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math> compared to that of the RIGHT detector <math id=\"inf74\"><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow id=\"XM97\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mn>0.034</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math> in panel K. That disparity in the two motion signals was sufficiently strong that the LEFT neural population consistently won the perceptual competition without any spontaneous switching (panel O). The perceptual decision to the true motion stimulus was thus steady and correct despite the formation of waves in cortex."

This is consistent with previously published findings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rule et al., 2011</a>)\u00a0where standing waves only arise for a limited band of flicker frequencies. Consequently, neither LEFT nor RIGHT motion signals were detected (panel L) and the perceptual decision (panel P) hovered around zero. Strobe-like flicker thus did not evoke any illusory sensation of motion, as is the case with the psychophysical observations."

The authors refer to the illusion as a form of a hallucination and suggest that the tools used to characterize the illusion could be used to characterize hallucinations. Based on the data and the model developed to account for the observed illusion the authors postulate the same neural mechanism that underlies the apparent motion induced by counterphase flicker, also underlies the reported flicker induced bistable illusory motion. Both reviewers were very positive about the work, complimenting the experimental design, the analysis and clear writing.

A detailed quantitative neural model of cortical processing is then shown to account for the data. Publication is strongly recommended after the two points below are resolved."
