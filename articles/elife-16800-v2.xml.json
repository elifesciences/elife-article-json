However, widespread adoption of these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices."

However, widespread adoption of these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices."

For example, Eysenbach reported that articles published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> (<i>PNAS</i>) under their open\u00a0access\u00a0(OA) option were twice as likely to be cited within 4\u201310 months and nearly three times as likely to be cited 10\u201316 months after publication than non-OA articles published in the same journal (<a href=\"#bib40\">Eysenbach, 2006</a>). Hajjem and colleagues studied over 1.3 million articles published in 10 different disciplines over a 12-year period and found that OA articles had a 36\u2013172% advantage in citations over non-OA articles (<a href=\"#bib54\">Hajjem et al., 2006</a>). While some controlled studies have failed to find a difference in citations between OA and non-OA articles or attribute differences to factors other than access (<a href=\"#bib35\">Davis, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Davis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Frandsen, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Gaul\u00e9 and Maystre, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Lansingh and Carter, 2009</a>), a larger number of studies confirm the OA citation advantage. Of 70 studies registered as of June 2016 in the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) Europe database of citation studies, 46 (66%) found an OA citation advantage, 17 (24%) found no advantage, and 7 (10%) were inconclusive (<a href=\"#bib124\">SPARC Europe, 2016</a>). Numerical estimates of the citation advantage in two reviews range from -5% to 600% (<a href=\"#bib131\">Swan, 2010</a>) and 25% to 250% (<a href=\"#bib140\">Wagner, 2010</a>). The size of the advantage observed is often dependent on discipline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Importantly, the OA citation advantage can be conferred regardless of whether articles are published in fully OA journals, subscription journals with OA options (hybrid journals), or self-archived in open repositories (<a href=\"#bib40\">Eysenbach, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Hajjem et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Gargouri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Research Information Network, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib142\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib131\">Swan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib140\">Wagner, 2010</a>). Moreover, at least in some cases, the advantage is not explained by selection bias (i.e., authors deliberately posting their better work to open platforms), as openly archived articles receive a citation advantage regardless of whether archiving is initiated by the author or mandated by an institution or funder (<a href=\"#bib43\">Gargouri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib154\">Xia and Nakanishi, 2012</a>)."

There is evidence that publishing articles openly can help researchers get noticed. A study of over 2,000 articles published in <i>Nature Communications</i> showed that those published openly received nearly double the number of unique tweeters and Mendeley readers as closed-access articles (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adie, 2014a</a>). A similar study of over 1,700 <i>Nature Communications</i> articles found that OA articles receive 2.5\u20134.4 times the number of page views, and garnered more social media attention via Twitter and Facebook than non-OA articles (<a href=\"#bib142\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). There is tentative evidence that news coverage confers a citation advantage. For example, a small quasi-experimental 1991 study found that articles covered by the <i>New York Times</i> received up to 73% more citations that those not covered (<a href=\"#bib103\">Phillips et al., 1991</a>).

Unfortunately, academic institutions often rely on proxy metrics, like journal impact factor (IF), to quickly evaluate researchers\u2019 work. The IF is a flawed metric that correlates poorly with the scientific quality of individual articles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Brembs et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Neuberger and Counsell, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">PLOS Medicine Editors, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Seglen, 1997</a>). In fact, several of the present authors have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (SF-DORA) recommending IF not be used as a research evaluation metric (<a href=\"#bib3\">American Society for Cell Biology, 2013</a>). However, until institutions cease using IF in evaluations, researchers will understandably be concerned about the IF of journals in which they publish. In author surveys, researchers repeatedly rank IF and associated journal reputation as among the most important factors they consider when deciding where to publish (<a href=\"#bib90\">Nature Publishing Group, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib122\">Solomon, 2014</a>). Researchers are also aware of the associated prestige that can accompany publication in high-IF journals such as <i>Nature</i> or <i>Science</i>. Thus, OA advocates should recognize and respect the pressures on researchers to select publishing outlets based, at least in part, on IF."

Of these OA journals, thirty-nine had IFs over 5.0 and nine had IFs over 10.0. Examples of OA journals in the biological and medical sciences with moderate to high 2015 IFs include <i>PLOS Medicine</i> (13.6), <i>Nature Communications</i> (11.3), and BioMed Central\u2019s <i>Genome Biology</i> (11.3).

Researchers can also publish in high-IF subscription journals and self-archive openly (see section\u00a0\"Publish where you want and archive openly\"). We hope that in the next few years, use of IF as a metric will diminish or cease entirely, but in the meantime, researchers have options to publish openly while still meeting any IF-related evaluation and career advancement criteria."

Studies used by some to argue the weakness of peer review at OA journals, such as the John Bohannon \u2018sting\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bohannon, 2013</a>) in which a fake paper was accepted by several OA journals, have been widely criticized in the academic community for poor methodology, including not submitting to subscription journals for comparison (<a href=\"#bib65\">Joseph, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Redhead, 2013</a>). In fact, Bohannon admitted, <i>\u2018\u2018Some open-access journals that have been criticized for poor quality control provided the most rigorous peer review of all\u2019\u2019.</i> He cites <i>PLOS ONE</i> as an example, saying it was the only journal to raise ethical concerns with his submitted work (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bohannon, 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "Subscription journals have not been immune to problems with peer review. In 2014, Springer and IEEE retracted over 100 published fake articles from several subscription journals (<a href=\"#bib134\">Van Noorden, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib125\">Springer, 2014</a>). Poor editorial practices at one SAGE journal opened the door to peer review fraud that eventually led 60 articles to be retracted (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bohannon, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Journal of Vibration and Control, 2014</a>). Similar issues in other subscription journals have been documented by Retraction Watch (<a href=\"#bib100\">Oransky\u00a0and\u00a0Marcus, 2016</a>). Problems with peer review thus clearly exist, but are not exclusive to OA journals. Indeed, large-scale empirical analyses indicate that the reliability of the traditional peer review process itself leaves much to be desired. Bornmann and colleagues reviewed 48 studies of inter-reviewer agreement and found that the average level of agreement was low (mean ICC of\u00a0.34 and Cohen\u2019s kappa of\u00a0.17) \u2013 well below what what would be considered adequate in psychometrics or other fields focused on quantitative assessment (<a href=\"#bib17\">Bornmann et al., 2010</a>). Opening up peer review, including allowing for real-time discussions between authors and reviewers, could help address some of these issues."

Authors can use open reviews to demonstrate to academic committees the rigorousness of the peer review process in venues where they publish, and highlight reviewer comments on the importance of their work. Researchers in their capacity as reviewers can also benefit from an open approach, as this allows them to get credit for this valuable service. Platforms like Publons let researchers create reviewer profiles to showcase their work (<a href=\"#bib109\">Publons, 2016</a>)."

These policies involve an agreement by the faculty to grant universities non-exclusive reuse rights on future published works. By putting such a policy in place prior to publication, faculty work can be openly archived without the need to negotiate with publishers to retain or recover rights; open is the default. We expect to see adoption of such policies grow in coming years."

At <i>PeerJ</i>, for example, a one-time membership fee of $199 USD allows an author to publish one article per year for life, subject to peer review.\u00a0(Note:\u00a0Since <i>PeerJ</i> requires the membership fee to be paid for each author up to 12 authors, the maximum cost of an article would be $2,388 USD. However, this is a one-time fee, after which subsequent articles for the same authors would be free.)

Cogent\u2019s OA journals all function on a flexible payment model, with authors paying only what they are able based on their financial resources. Importantly, most OA journals do not charge any additional fees for submission or color figures. These charges, as levied by many subscription publishers, can easily sum to hundreds or thousands of dollars (e.g. in Elsevier\u2019s <i>Neuron</i> the first color figure is $1,000 USD,\u00a0while each additional one is $275).

Researchers in any country can request a partial or full waiver if they cannot pay. Some publishers, such as BioMed Central, F1000, Hindawi, and PeerJ, have membership programs through which institutions pay part or all of the APC for affiliated authors. Some institutions also have discretionary funds for OA publication fees. Increasingly, funders are providing OA publishing funds, or allowing researchers to write these funds into their grants. PLOS maintains a searchable list of both institutions and funders that support OA publication costs (<a href=\"#bib108\">Public Library of Science, 2016</a>).

The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been a leader in this respect. In 2008, the NIH implemented a public access policy, requiring that all articles arising from NIH-funded projects be deposited in the National Library of Medicine\u2019s open repository, PubMed Central, within one year of publication (<a href=\"#bib112\">Rockey, 2012</a>). NIH also requires that projects receiving $500K or more per year in direct costs include a data management plan that specifies how researchers will share their data (<a href=\"#bib87\">National Institutes of Health, 2003</a>). NIH intends to extend its data sharing policy to a broader segment of its portfolio in the near future. Since 2011, the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) has also encouraged sharing data, software, and other research outputs (<a href=\"#bib89\">National Science Foundation, 2011</a>). All NSF investigators are required to submit a plan, specifying data management and availability. In 2015, U.S. government agencies, including the NSF, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Defense (DoD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and more announced plans to implement article and data sharing requirements in response to the White House Office of Science and Technology (OTSP) memo on public access (<a href=\"#bib62\">Holdren, 2013</a>). A crowd-sourced effort has collected information on these agency policies and continues to be updated (<a href=\"#bib148\">Whitmire et al., 2015</a>)."

The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) requires that all manuscripts reporting results produced using public funds must be made immediately available (<a href=\"#bib91\">NWO, 2016</a>). Similar policies are in place at CERN (<a href=\"#bib23\">CERN, 2014</a>), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (<a href=\"#bib132\">UNESCO, 2013</a>), and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, 2015</a>)\u00a0among others, and are increasingly covering data sharing. Funders recognize that certain types of data, such as clinical records, are sensitive and require special safeguards to permit sharing while protecting patient privacy. The Expert Advisory Group on Data Access (EAGDA) was recently established as a collaboration between the Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the Medical Research Council to advise funders on best practices for creating data sharing policies for human research (<a href=\"#bib144\">Wellcome Trust, 2016a</a>)."

Internationally, the number of open access policies has been steadily increasing over the last decade (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

Many open data and software repositories have mechanisms for assigning digital object identifiers (DOIs) to these products. The use of persistent, unique identifiers like DOIs has been recommended by the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles to facilitate data citation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Data Citation Synthesis Group, 2014</a>). Researchers can register for a unique Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Haak et al., 2012</a>) to track their research outputs, including datasets and software, and build a richer profile of their contributions. Together, these developments should support efforts to \u2018\u2018make data count\u2019\u2019, further incentivize sharing, and ensure that data generators and software creators receive greater credit for their work (<a href=\"#bib75\">Kratz and Strasser, 2015</a>)."

Open practices can make it easier for researchers to connect with one another by increasing the discoverability and visibility of one\u2019s work, facilitating rapid access to novel data and software resources, and creating new opportunities to interact with and contribute to ongoing communal projects. For example, in 2011, one of the present authors (BAN) initiated a project to replicate a sample of studies to estimate the reproducibility of psychological science (<a href=\"#bib96\">Open Science Collaboration, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Open Science Collaboration, 2014</a>). Completing a meaningful number of replications in a single laboratory would have been difficult. Instead, the project idea was posted to a listserv as an open collaboration. Ultimately, more than 350 people contributed, with 270 earning co-authorship on the publication (<a href=\"#bib98\">Open Science Collaboration, 2015</a>). Open collaboration enabled distribution of work and expertise among many researchers, and was essential for the project\u2019s success. Other projects have used similar approaches to successfully carry out large-scale collaborative research (<a href=\"#bib71\">Klein et al., 2014</a>)."

In many scientific fields, widely used state-of-the-art data processing and analysis packages are hosted and developed openly, allowing virtually anyone to contribute. Perhaps the paradigmatic example is the <i>scikit-learn</i> Python package for machine learning (<a href=\"#bib101\">Pedregosa et al., 2011</a>), which, in the space of just over five years, has attracted over 500 unique contributors, 20,000 individual code contributions, and 2,500 article citations. Producing a comparable package using a traditional closed-source approach would likely not be feasible,\u00a0and would, at the very least, have required a budget of tens of millions of dollars. While scikit-learn is clearly an outlier, hundreds of other open-source scientific packages that support much more domain-specific needs depend in a similar fashion on unsolicited community contributions e.g., the NIPY group of projects in neuroimaging (<a href=\"#bib49\">Gorgolewski et al., 2016</a>). Importantly, such contributions not only result in new functionality from which the broader scientific community can benefit, but also regularly provide their respective authors with greater community recognition, and lead to new project and employment opportunities."

There are many initiatives aimed at increasing open practices, and not yet enough published evidence about their effectiveness. For example, journals can offer badges to acknowledge open practices such as open data, open materials, and preregistration (<a href=\"#bib95\">Open Research Badges, 2016</a>). Initial evidence from a single adopting journal, <i>Psychological Science</i>, and a sample of comparison journals suggests that this simple incentive increases data sharing rates from less than 3% to more than 38% (<a href=\"#bib69\">Kidwell et al., 2016</a>). More research is needed across disciplines to follow\u00a0up on this encouraging evidence. UCLA\u2019s Knowledge Infrastructures project is an ongoing study that, among other objectives, is learning about data sharing practices and factors that discourage or promote sharing across four collaborative scientific projects (<a href=\"#bib16\">Borgman et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Darch et al., 2015</a>)."

There is a logical argument that having access to the data, code, and materials makes it easier to reproduce the evidence that was derived from that research content. Data sharing correlates with fewer reporting errors, compared to papers with unavailable data (<a href=\"#bib149\">Wicherts, 2016</a>), and could be due to diligent data management practices. However, there is not yet direct evidence that open practices per se are a net benefit to research progress. As a first step, the University of California at Riverside and the Center for Open Science have initiated an NSF-supported randomized trial to evaluate the impact of receiving training to use the Open Science Framework for managing, archiving, and sharing lab research materials and data. Labs across the university will be randomly assigned to receive the training, and outcomes of their research will be assessed across multiple years."

However, preregistration is rarely practiced outside of clinical trials where it is required by law in the U.S. and as a condition for publication in most journals that publish them. Research suggests that preregistration may counter some questionable practices, such as flexible definition of analytic models and outcome variables in order to find positive results (<a href=\"#bib68\">Kaplan and Irvin, 2015</a>). Public registration also makes it possible to compare publications and registrations of the same study to identify cases in which outcomes were changed or unreported, as is the focus of the COMPare project based at the University of Oxford (<a href=\"#bib27\">COMPare, 2016</a>). Similar efforts include the AllTrials project, run by an international team (<a href=\"#bib2\">AllTrials, 2016</a>), and extending beyond just preregistration of planned studies to retroactive registration and transparent reporting for previously conducted clinical trials. Another example is the AsPredicted project, which is run by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and University of California Berkeley, and offers preregistration services for any discipline (<a href=\"#bib6\">AsPredicted, 2016</a>). To initiate similar research efforts in the basic and preclinical sciences, the Center for Open Science launched the Preregistration Challenge, offering one thousand $1,000 awards to researchers that publish the outcomes of preregistered research (<a href=\"#bib22\">Center for Open Science, 2016</a>)."

Not all researchers are comfortable with the same level of sharing, and there are a variety of ways to be open (see <a href=\"#B1\">Box 1</a>). Openness can be thus defined by a continuum of practices, starting perhaps at the most basic level with openly self-archiving postprints and reaching perhaps the highest level with openly sharing grant proposals, research protocols, and data in real time.

Training of researchers early in their careers is fundamental. Graduate programs can integrate open science and modern scientific computing practices into their existing curriculum. Methods courses could incorporate training on publishing practices such as proper citation, author rights, and open access publishing options. Institutions and funders could provide skills training on self-archiving articles, data, and software to meet mandate requirements. Importantly, we recommend integrating education and training with regular curricular and workshop activities so as not to increase the time burden on already-busy students and researchers."

This in my opinion is the big issue. Until researchers are persuaded that making their outputs open is not going to adversely impact them (and ultimately come to believe that it will benefit them) then changing behaviour is always going to be difficult. As such I was surprised that section 3.2 seemed to suggest that Funder mandates are sufficient to bring about this change.
