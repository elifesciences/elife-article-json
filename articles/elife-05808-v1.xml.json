In addition, we generated CaRuby-Nano dextran conjugates and an AM-ester variant for bulk loading of tissue. We tested the new indicator using in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrating the high sensitivity of CaRuby-Nano as well as its power in dual color imaging experiments."

These changes in calcium levels can span several orders of magnitude, and can be either localized to very small parts of the cell or span the entire cell."

One common method uses proteins that fluoresce when viewed under a fluorescence microscope each time the protein senses increases of calcium. Most of these probes fluoresce green, and so to view a second signal that occurs in the cell at the same time it's easier to use a probe that fluoresces with a different color, such as red. However, the red-shifted probes that are currently available either produce unreliable results because they tend to leak through cell membranes, or are not very sensitive to calcium ions. New types of red-shifted probes are therefore urgently needed."

Now, Collot, Wilms et al.\u2014including several of the researchers involved in the 2012 research\u2014have enhanced the properties of CaRuby by modifying the chemical structure of the probes. This increased the ability of CaRuby to bind calcium ions, making it more sensitive to small calcium changes. Testing the usefulness of the newly developed probes\u2014called CaRuby Nano\u2014in mouse nerve cells revealed the probes are highly sensitive and can even detect the calcium signal resulting from a single nerve impulse."

In one experiment, the release of chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters was stimulated, which caused calcium ions to flow into the observed nerve cells. The researchers succeeded in simultaneously detecting a green signal indicating an increase in neurotransmitter levels and a red signal produced by the corresponding release of calcium. Such dual-color imaging was not possible with previous probes. Finally, it was shown that CaRuby-Nano can also be used to produce dual-color images of the brain activity of live mice."

The dominance of fluorescein and eGFP in the design of such probes has resulted in an overcrowding of the green spectral band. This makes simultaneous imaging of spatially overlapping signals problematic and emphasizes the need for red-shifted probes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Oheim et al., 2014</a>). Many of the very favorable photophysical properties of fluorescein and eGFP are shared by the X-Rhodamine chromophore, which is finding increasing use in the development of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicators (<a href=\"#bib4\">Eberhard and Erne, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Egawa et al., 2011</a>). A major problem of red-shifted fluorophores is that they are significantly more lipophilic than fluorescein-like dyes. This leads to more leakage through cell membranes as well as to intracellular compartmentalization. These effects can be minimized by using the probes as conjugates of inert hydrophilic compounds such as dextrans. This conjugation commonly uses one of the carboxylic groups of the BAPTA moiety, affecting the calcium affinity of BAPTA-based indicators (<a href=\"#bib27\">Tsien, 1980</a>). Consequently, these indicator-dextran conjugates are strongly shifted to lower affinities making them all but useless for sensitive and quantitative [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] measurements. Importantly, this lower affinity cannot be compensated for by increasing the concentration of the probe. Such a strategy would lead to a disproportionally large increase in the calcium buffering capacity of the indicator (<a href=\"#bib14\">Neher, 2005</a>), resulting in a stronger disruption of cellular signaling than for a low concentration of high affinity indicator (<a href=\"#bib10\">Markram et al., 1998</a>)."

This side arm efficiently allows conjugation reactions without significant perturbation of the calcium binding affinity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Zamaleeva et al., 2014</a>).

We introduced an oxygen atom on one of the aromatic rings of BAPTA by a S<sub>N</sub>Ar reaction. This oxygen also serves as a link for the azido side arm, which was repositioned in the new CaRuby variant (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, the fluorophore, which is commonly placed <i>para</i> to the nitrogen of the BAPTA, has an affinity-lowering effect due to its electron withdrawing nature and was therefore placed at a <i>meta</i> position in order to reduce its effect on the ligating nitrogen. These modifications resulted in a CaRuby variant with sub-micromolar affinity (\u2018CaRuby-Nano\u2019). In cuvette calibration experiments CaRuby-Nano was found to have a K<sub>D</sub> of 258 \u00b1 8 nM, with a 50-fold (\u00b12) increase of fluorescence on binding [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>) and a maximum quantum yield of 0.45 (<a href=\"#fig1s2 fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2,3</a>).

Visually identified Purkinje cells showing iGluSnFR expression (7\u20139 days after viral transfection) were filled with CaRuby-Nano via patch-clamp recording (6 kD dextran; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Activation of the glutamatergic climbing fiber input evoked clear fluorescence transients in both color channels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Glutamate signals were confined to distinct subsections of the dendritic tree (i.e., limited to sites of synaptic glutamate release), whereas the resulting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients were global, with similar amplitudes throughout different regions of the dendritic tree (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Lev-Ram et al., 1992</a>).

This makes CaRuby-Nano only slightly higher affinity than the commonly used green emitting indicator Fluo-4 (335 nM). On calcium binding CaRuby-Nano shows a 50-fold fluorescence increase (vs. 14-fold and 100-fold for OGB-1 and Fluo-4, respectively). The quantum efficiency of calcium bound CaRuby-Nano (0.45) is lower than that of OGB-1 (\u223c0.7) but significantly higher than that of Fluo-4 (\u223c0.14). These values classify CaRuby-Nano as an ideal indicator for the quantification of small intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). Using a range of different experiments we have demonstrated that CaRuby-Nano is well suited for both in vitro and in vivo imaging experiments requiring high sensitivity to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] changes. Finally, we show that CaRuby-Nano can be combined with activity indicators emitting in the green-yellow spectral band, to allow multiplexed imaging. The versatility of the probe is further increased by the azido function, which can easily be reduced to an amine group, thus opening the field to functionalization with numerous molecular tools such as antibodies, benzylguanine (SNAP tag) or peptides to facilitate specific sub-cellular targeting."

First, an oxygen atom was introduced on one of the BAPTA's cycles in order to electronically enrich the latter. Then, this oxygen atom served as an anchor to a spacer terminated by an azide function for further functionalizations either by click chemistry or by reducing it into an amine for coupling with for example, a carboxylic acid. Finally, the fluorophore moiety, an extended rhodamine which is positively charged and therefore has an electron withdrawing effect, was moved from the <i>para</i> position of the aniline to the <i>meta</i> position. As expected, these modifications lead to a significant increase of affinity towards calcium, yielding a CaRuby with a dissociation constant of 258 \u00b1 8 nM."

In Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, the interplay between fluorescence gain (F<sub>max</sub> = F<sub>peak</sub>/F<sub>resting</sub>), indicator brightness, and indicator K<sub>D</sub> will determine the signal amplitude and SNR for a given [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient amplitude. Assuming that dyes based on the same fluorophore have similar brightness, the K<sub>D</sub> and the fluorescence gain will determine the suitability of indicators for detecting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients of a given size. Other factors, such as the need to remain in a linear regime of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-to-fluorescence relation or the need to avoid excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, will also play a role in choosing the best suited indicator. As these factors have been discussed in detail previously (<a href=\"#bib29a\">Yasuda et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Higley and Sabatini, 2008</a>), we here focus only on signal amplitude and SNR."

In consequence, the noise level of fluorescence is equal to the square root of the fluorescence intensity. To estimate how this noise determines the uncertainty of the calculated dF/F<sub>0</sub> values and ultimately which SNR can be achieved at a given maximum brightness, we performed a Monte-Carlo analysis: Random Poisson noise was added to the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent fluorescence curves shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix figure 1A</a>, this was repeated 10,000 times. In addition a signal baseline consisting of 50 points was generated by drawing samples from a Poisson distribution with a mean of the fluorescence expected at resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. For each iteration the dF/F<sub>0</sub> ratio was calculated. Finally the average dF/F<sub>0</sub> curve as well as the corresponding standard deviation (SD) over all iterations were determined. As the brightness of the sample (i.e., fluorescence intensity at maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) strongly influences the SNR, this analysis was initially performed at a fixed maximum brightness of 1000 photons (e.g., the signal resulting from four detected fluorescence photons per excitation pulse at a 3 \u00b5s pixel dwell time). While the resulting noise appears negligible against the raw Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding curve in <a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix figure 1A</a>, the propagated error following dF/F<sub>0</sub> normalization is substantial (<a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix figure 1B</a>) and the resulting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent SNR (SNR<sub>([Ca2+])</sub> = Fluorescence<sub>([Ca2+])</sub>/SD<sub>([Ca2+])</sub>) curves clearly show that as a consequence of the brighter baseline fluorescence the higher affinity CaRuby-Nano is expected to always yield a better SNR than CaRuby-Me under the simulated conditions. Under sufficiently bright conditions, such as those assumed in <a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix figure 1A\u2013C</a>, the much larger signal achievable at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] over \u223c400 nM outweighs this SNR advantage."

As expected we find that for a given indicator, the dimmer the imaging conditions, the larger a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient needs to be for reliable detection (assumed to require SNR \u2265 2). On the other hand, the required [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient amplitude for reliable detection at a given brightness strongly depends on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of the indicator, with higher affinity CaRuby-Nano requiring substantially smaller transients than CaRuby-Me (<a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix figure 1F</a>). What is a level of brightness that can be expected in biological imaging? Tan et al. reported a photon-flux range of 1\u20134 photons per \u00b5s at rest when using Oregon\u2013Green 488 BAPTA-1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tan et al., 1999</a>) (OGB-1), which would correspond to approximately 3\u201312 photons at fully saturating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Thus, even when summing the signal from dozens of pixels, maximum brightness is expected to be in the range of 100\u2013500 photons for standard pixel dwell times (1\u20134 \u00b5s). At this brightness CaRuby-Me would require Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients reaching \u223c290 nM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to cross the SNR = 2 threshold (just below the level of the transients evoked by a single action potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons [<a href=\"#bib32\">Maravall et al., 2000</a>]) whereas CaRuby-Nano would require transients under 100 nM."
