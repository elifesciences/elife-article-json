We have developed a theory called Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS) based on the hypothesis that GRNs are organised so that they remain robust in the face of unpredictable environmental and evolutionary changes. BQS makes strong and diverse predictions about the network features that allow stable responses under arbitrary perturbations, including the random addition of new connections. We show that the GRNs of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, yeast, mouse, and human all verify the predictions of BQS. BQS explains many of the small- and large\u2010scale properties of GRNs, provides conditions for evolvable robustness, and highlights general features of transcriptional response. BQS is severely compromised in a human cancer cell line, suggesting that loss of BQS might underlie the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, and highlighting a possible sequence of GRN alterations concomitant with cancer initiation."

The number of long feedback loops created and the length of the longest feedback loops are also indicated. Supplementary file 1 lists all the 48 edge insertions that result in the creation of long feedback loops when inserted in the GM12878 GRN. Note the high participation of JUNB and BATF as sources and of FOSL1/2 as targets. Three of these destabilizing interactions are actually observed in the K562 cancer cell line: from JUNB to BCLAF1, from BATF to EGR1, and from JUNB to EGR1. These interactions are highlighted in a bold character. The GRN of the GM12878 cell line contains 67 TFs and 59 interactions among them. Since in a network with 67 nodes there are 67*(67-1) = 4422 possible directed links with different source and targets, 4422-59 = 4362 additional regulations can be inserted between the TFs in the GM12878 GRN. Four regulatory connections between TFs are observed both in GM12878 and in K562: BCLAF1\u2013&gt; BHLHE40, CTCFL\u2013&gt; BHLHE40, EGR1\u2013&gt; JUNB, FOSL1\u2013&gt; JUNB. Of all the potential additional regulatory connections among the TFs of the GM12878 cell line, 56 are observed in the K562. Therefore, the likelihood of observing in K562 one of the 4362 potential regulations of GM12878 is 56/4362 \u2248 0.013. The likelihood of observing in K562 one of the potentially destabilising regulations of GM12878 is 3/48 = 0.062. Finally, two of the potentially destabilising interactions of the GM12878 have a particularly strong destabilization potential: an additional transcriptional regulation from JUNB to FOSL2 will create five long feedback loops and an additional transcriptional regulation from JUNB to E2F1 will create 3. Once again, our analysis highlights genes that may play a key role in cancer progression (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kouzarides and Ziff, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Engelmann and P\u00fctzer, 2012</a>).",

We have developed a theory called Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS) based on the hypothesis that GRNs are organised so that they remain robust in the face of unpredictable environmental and evolutionary changes. BQS makes strong and diverse predictions about the network features that allow stable responses under arbitrary perturbations, including the random addition of new connections. We show that the GRNs of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, yeast, mouse, and human all verify the predictions of BQS. BQS explains many of the small- and large\u2010scale properties of GRNs, provides conditions for evolvable robustness, and highlights general features of transcriptional response. BQS is severely compromised in a human cancer cell line, suggesting that loss of BQS might underlie the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, and highlighting a possible sequence of GRN alterations concomitant with cancer initiation."

The number of long feedback loops created and the length of the longest feedback loops are also indicated. Supplementary file 1 lists all the 48 edge insertions that result in the creation of long feedback loops when inserted in the GM12878 GRN. Note the high participation of JUNB and BATF as sources and of FOSL1/2 as targets. Three of these destabilizing interactions are actually observed in the K562 cancer cell line: from JUNB to BCLAF1, from BATF to EGR1, and from JUNB to EGR1. These interactions are highlighted in a bold character. The GRN of the GM12878 cell line contains 67 TFs and 59 interactions among them. Since in a network with 67 nodes there are 67*(67-1) = 4422 possible directed links with different source and targets, 4422-59 = 4362 additional regulations can be inserted between the TFs in the GM12878 GRN. Four regulatory connections between TFs are observed both in GM12878 and in K562: BCLAF1\u2013&gt; BHLHE40, CTCFL\u2013&gt; BHLHE40, EGR1\u2013&gt; JUNB, FOSL1\u2013&gt; JUNB. Of all the potential additional regulatory connections among the TFs of the GM12878 cell line, 56 are observed in the K562. Therefore, the likelihood of observing in K562 one of the 4362 potential regulations of GM12878 is 56/4362 \u2248 0.013. The likelihood of observing in K562 one of the potentially destabilising regulations of GM12878 is 3/48 = 0.062. Finally, two of the potentially destabilising interactions of the GM12878 have a particularly strong destabilization potential: an additional transcriptional regulation from JUNB to FOSL2 will create five long feedback loops and an additional transcriptional regulation from JUNB to E2F1 will create 3.

Cells receive signals from both their internal and external environments, and respond by changing how they express their genes. This allows a cell to make the right amount of different proteins when needed. The proteins that a cell produces can then, in turn, influence how the cell's genes are expressed. This set of interactions between genes and proteins is called a gene regulatory network, and is akin to a computer program that the cell runs to define its behaviour. At present, we understand very little about why these networks take on the forms seen in living cells."

Albergante et al. call this property Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS): the network is <i>qualitatively stable</i> because its state does not change when the activity of particular regulatory links in the network changes, and it is <i>buffered</i> against its stability being compromised by the random addition of new links."

In addition, using BQS to analyse the gene regulatory network of bacteria such as <i>E. coli</i> reveals points in the network that, if disrupted, would make the network unstable, potentially harming the cell. Therefore, in the future, an understanding of BQS could help efforts to design new drugs to treat a range of infections and diseases."

However, one might argue that this work has had less impact on our understanding of the reasons underlying the network topologies observed and on the possible selective pressures leading to the emergence of common network features. Here we present a simple theory, Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS), motivated by biological robustness, which has strong explanatory power and provides a number of hard, readily verifiable predictions for the topological structure of interaction networks, at both global and local scales. Besides leading to new predictions\u2014that are consistently verified\u2014BQS provides a theoretical justification for the ubiquitousness of network features already observed. BQS is therefore an important step in providing a general mechanistic explanation for the overall structure of GRNs at different scales and in shedding new light on previous observations."

Although much is now known about how cells respond to particular stresses or environmental cues, little is known about how cells remain stable and respond appropriately whatever the contingency. Over evolutionary time it is also advantageous for organisms to be robust to genetic changes, including those that occur as a consequence of the shuffling of genes during sexual reproduction. In order for cells to be fully robust, changes to any of the thousands of individual quantitative parameters\u2014for example the concentration of a transcription factor or its affinity for its cognate DNA sequence\u2014cannot be critical because contingencies may cause these to change. We propose that the robustness of a biological system should therefore depend on qualitative, not quantitative, features of its response to perturbation."

We show that published GRNs, including those of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, mouse and humans are robust in this way, a property we term \u2018Buffered Qualitative Stability\u2019 (BQS).

A mathematical theory called \u2018Qualitative Stability\u2019 has determined how the topological structure of a network is related to robustness (<a href=\"#bib63\">Quirk and Ruppert, 1965</a>). This theory, discussed in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, shows that certain network topologies remain stable even if the strength of any of the network interactions is varied in an arbitrary way. Qualitatively Stable GRNs would be robust, for example, to changes in the concentration of a transcription factor or its affinity for its cognate DNA sequence."

In addition, 2-node feedback loops can be Qualitatively Stable depending on the precise nature of their interactions (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The danger inherent in feedback loops was first analysed by James Clerk Maxwell who showed that mechanical governors regulating the output of steam engines can fail if the input changes faster than the system response, causing \u2018an oscillating and jerking motion, increasing in violence till it reaches the limit of action of the governor\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Maxwell, 1868</a>). Because there is an inevitable time lag between a transcription factor (TF) binding to the promoter of a gene and the production of the protein product of that gene, this form of instability can occur if GRNs contain feedback loops consisting of three or more TFs. This concept is supported by the behaviour of the repressilator, a well-known gene circuit consisting of a 3-gene feedback loop, which has been shown to produce oscillations of increasing intensity in vivo (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elowitz and Leibler, 2000</a>)."

Notably, all the 3-gene feedback loops observed in real GRNs share the same peculiar structure, with implications discussed below. In contrast, when networks of the size and connectivity of the biological GRNs are constructed with randomly placed links, they display an exponential increase in feedback loops consisting of three or more genes, which number in the thousands (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, heavily shaded bars, and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>).

The dataset was constructed by adding to the network derived by <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al. (2002)</a> new interactions derived under different experimental conditions, and the absence of a measure of confidence for the interactions makes it difficult to assess the strength of the experimental support for the interactions that form the feedback loops. The above considerations suggest that a moderate rate of false positives may be present in the dataset. The sensitivity of loop count to noise in the data therefore suggests that loop counting may not provide a good indication of the role of BQS by itself in this case. Moreover, <a href=\"#bib47\">MacIsaac et al.

Some of these codes (called `strong\u2019) are associated with particularly reliable biological techniques (<a href=\"#bib68\">Salgado et al., 2012</a>). The information provided by RegulonDB can be used in different ways to assess the statistical validity of our analysis. A first approach is to use the number of evidence codes as an indicator of the confidence level of an interaction: the larger the number of evidence codes, the greater the confidence. A second approach is to restrict the network only to those interactions supported by strong evidence codes. We decided to study the effect of varying the number of general or strong evidence codes on the results discussed. \u2018kEc\u2019 indicates the network constructed using only those interactions supported by at least k evidence codes, while \u2018kSEc\u2019 indicates the network constructed using only those interactions supported by at least k strong evidence codes. The number of genes (<b>A</b>), TFs (<b>B</b>), and interactions of the networks (<b>C</b>) vary with the number of evidence codes. However, the edge density (<b>D</b>) is rather stable, suggesting that the global properties of the GRN are mostly preserved in the different types of network. The number of feedback loops is very limited regardless of the number of evidence codes used (<b>E</b>). 2Ec and 2SEc have similar edge density (<b>D</b>) and number of illegal feedback loops (<b>E</b>), thus suggesting that taking two evidence codes gives a network similar to the one obtained by considering only strong biological evidence. In the yeast dataset derived by <a href=\"#bib30\">Harbison et al. (2004)</a> each interaction is associated with a p-value that measures the probability that such an interaction has been detected due to experimental error. Selecting a large threshold p-value increases the probability of false positives, but decreases the probability of false negatives. <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al. (2002)</a> reported that a threshold p-value of 10<sup>\u20133</sup> provides a good trade-off for this kind of data. However, a reliable theory would be expected to display a limited sensitivity to a small variation of the threshold. The number of genes (<b>F</b>), TFs (<b>G</b>), and interactions of the network (<b>H</b>) change with different thresholds. Nevertheless, the edge density is quite stable (<b>I</b>). As with the RegulonDB data (<b>A</b>\u2013<b>D</b>), these results suggest that the main characteristics of the network are mostly preserved under different statistical constrains. The number of feedback loops remains low for reasonable variations around the selected threshold (<b>J</b>), and the increase in number is compatible with the expected increase in the rate of false positives. Interestingly, looking at feedback loop number, a \u2018phase transition\u2019 becomes apparent for large thresholds. This behaviour suggests the use of great care when performing this type of analysis on very noisy data."

This stability provides a type of \u2018damping\u2019, which will tend to restore the state of the GRN when challenged with contingencies that might otherwise induce chaotic or unpredictable behaviour.

                                "text": "In principle the Qualitative Stability observed in GRNs might be easy to break by addition of another link to the network. For example, a long feedback loop can be created by the addition of a feedback connection from a TF lower down in a network path to a TF higher up in that path. This could occur, for example, through a mutation in the promoter of the target gene allowing it to be bound by a new TF. It is also possible that stress conditions could cause TFs to act inappropriately at promoters they do not normally regulate. In this way Qualitative Stability could be lost, and GRNs could become unstable. Thus, we predict that if long feedback loops are detrimental because of their instability, then GRNs would be configured to minimize destabilization via the addition of new connections. We call network paths that can be transformed into loops by the addition of a single new link \u2018incomplete feedback loops\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013E</a>). The abundance of incomplete feedback loops in the GRNs of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and human is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a> (lightly shaded bars). Data for <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>. For each of these GRNs there are &lt;2000 incomplete feedback loops and they tend to be of a relatively small size. A similar empirical observation has been made regarding transcriptional cascades (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rosenfeld and Alon, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">The modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</a>). This is in stark contrast to comparable random networks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, heavily shaded bars, and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), which on average have a thousand-fold greater number of incomplete feedback loops (&gt;10<sup>5</sup>) of a significantly larger size. Statistical analyses suggest that there is an extremely small probability (&lt;10<sup>\u221219</sup>) that the absence of long incomplete feedback loops is a chance event in the three organisms considered (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). These results are relatively robust to variations in the confidence levels of the <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> GRN (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>), and remain valid when different random models are considered (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Note that the distribution of incomplete feedback loops is indicative of the different topological structures that can be observed in the network, and is not necessarily monotonically decreasing (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

In addition, these topologies efficiently prevent random mutations from introducing possible sources of destabilization. Note that feedback loops involving more than three genes are also highly susceptible to the creation of additional long feedback loops making them strongly disadvantageous to stability. We say that networks configured to minimize the number of real and incomplete long feedback loops possess Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS). Networks having this property are <i>stable</i> to perturbations and are also <i>buffered</i> against the potentially destabilising effects that occur when new links are added.

Since a TF must be both regulated and regulating to take part in a feedback loop, one way that GRNs could satisfy BQS and minimise the risk of unstable loops being formed, is by having a high proportion of TFs that are not regulated by other TFs. Consistent with this prediction, the percentage of unregulated TFs in <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa,</i> human and other yeast datasets is very high (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>). Comparison with random networks indicates that the probability of obtaining this proportion of unregulated TFs by chance is between 10<sup>\u221268</sup> and 10<sup>\u221239</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>).

BQS also makes strong predictions about the small-scale local structure of GRNs. To investigate this, we dissected each of the GRNs into a series of small motifs comprising three or four genes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Milo et al., 2002</a>). A single motif can, in principle, break Qualitative Stability by forming a feedback loop composed of three or more genes. As we have shown above, such motifs are essentially absent from real GRNs. However, motifs may be susceptible to feedback loop formation through the addition of a link, and we can therefore speak of \u2018buffered motifs\u2019 as motifs that are resilient to this, and therefore enhance BQS locally. Note that, to prevent possible biases introduced by the large number of non-TF genes, only motifs completely formed by TFs were considered. Using symmetry arguments, we grouped 3- and 4-gene motifs into buffered and non-buffered categories, which are equi-probable in a random network (confirmed by <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4B,E,F,H,K,L</a>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013F</a> show that in the real GRNs of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and human, buffered motifs (blue) are much more abundant than would be expected by chance, while unbuffered (green and violet) motifs are much less abundant; and indeed, unbuffered motifs which are particularly susceptible to breaking BQS (violet) are rare. Similar results hold for other confidence levels of <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013L</a>), other confidence levels of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3M\u2013X</a>), <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2,D</a>), and other yeast datasets (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013J</a>).

In general, some of these connections will create long feedback loops (red dashed arrow), while others will not (green dashed arrow). As we have shown, robustness appears to exert a strong selective pressure on the topology of GRNs. To assess the extent of this pressure we used an extensive computational approach to estimate the probability that a random edge addition between two TFs creates a long feedback loop in the GRNs. All the possible edge insertions were tested in the real GRNs of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and human, and the values were compared with those estimated in the corresponding random networks. The extent of buffered stability is quite remarkable: 4363 new interactions can be added to the human GRN, but only 48 of them will create long feedback loops (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). By contrast, addition of single extra links to random networks would lead to the creation of approximately 2000 different feedback loops on average: a hit rate of approximately 50%. The probability that real GRNs will gain long feedback loops by random edge additions is low (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>, lightly shaded bars), and is significantly smaller than that found for comparable random networks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>, heavily shaded bars). Nevertheless, these probabilities are non-zero, indicating a trade-off between stability and the need for cells to regulate gene expression."

Three aspects are noteworthy. Firstly, of the seven 2-node feedback loops in the <i>E. coli</i> GRN, four are embedded into the two potentially unstable motifs depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, whilst the other three are isolated from other feedback loops and so are either stable or likely to act as switches. Secondly, the genes comprising the two illegal motifs are involved in drug resistance (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ariza et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Martin and Rosner, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Nishino et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Keseler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and/or acid resistance (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sayed et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Keseler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This raises the possibility that limited instances of deviation from BQS may arise through evolution as a short-term expediency allowing survival in a changing environment. Thirdly, both loops share a remarkably similar sub-structure: two linked 2-gene feedback loops connected by one link into a 3-node feedback loop. It has been previously shown in chemical networks that such a configuration can display chaotic behaviour (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sensse and Eiswirth, 2005</a>). It is tempting to speculate that these illegal motifs act as localized sources of chaos, allowing a cell population to quickly explore very diverse gene expression levels, thus accelerating the emergence of resistant phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lopez-Maury et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, compatible with the idea that chaotic behaviour should be tightly controlled, most of the genes depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a> are highly regulated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

Even within an individual tumour a wide range of cellular phenotypes is often observed (<a href=\"#bib50\">Marusyk et al., 2012</a>). To some degree, this is likely to be a consequence of the genotypic heterogeneity of tumours. However, cancer cells also appear to be phenotypically less stable than normal cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brock et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gupta et al., 2011</a>). Might this phenotypic instability result from a breakdown of BQS in cancer cells? There is currently only a single cancer cell line, the human leukaemia cell line K562, for which a high quality system-wide GRN has been derived (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gerstein et al., 2012</a>). We therefore investigated the topological differences between the GRNs of K562 and the human non-cancer cell line GM12878. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> show that the feedback loop distribution in the GRN of the leukaemia cell line is strikingly different from that of the non-cancer cell line. In K562, significantly more moderately long feedback loops of 4\u20138 genes are present (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), and the number of loops formed by 3\u20135 genes is comparable to the number expected in a random network (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The number of incomplete feedback loops is also significantly larger in K562 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). In addition, poorly buffered motifs are abundant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>) and the TFs cross regulation is less extreme (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>)."

JUNB and FOSL1 are proto-oncogenes that are components of the AP-1 transcription complex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kouzarides and Ziff, 1989</a>) and have been reported to be part of a long feedback loop in ovarian cancer (<a href=\"#bib74\">Stelniec-Klotz et al., 2012</a>); EGR1 is a regulator of tumour suppressor genes and an oncogene itself (<a href=\"#bib9\">Baron et al., 2005</a>); and the TFs of the C/EBP family have been described as both tumour promoters and suppressors (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nerlov, 2007</a>). These genes are also active in the non-cancer cell line GM12878, yet their destabilizing role in cancer arises from a rewiring of the network. GM12878 satisfies BQS whilst K562 comparatively does not, and yet the two GRNs have similar numbers of genes and regulatory connections (in fact, the K562 TF network has a lower link density than that of GM12878). Finally, the probability of introducing long feedback loops by random edge additions is significantly larger in the cancer cell line than in non-cancer cells, but still lower than the value expected in a random network (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). These findings suggest that cancer cells break BQS and have a vastly less stable GRN than normal cells, which is however less unstable than expected in a random network."

Therefore, we investigated how many of the long feedback loops observed in K562 cancer cells could have originated from these relatively unbuffered network structures in non-cancerous GM12878 cells. We find that the three genes that contribute the most to the formation of long feedback loops in the cancer cell line (EGR1, FOSL1, and JUNB) are all involved in the formation of the longest incomplete feedback loops observed in the non-cancer cell line (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). As highlighted earlier (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), single insertions of a new connection into the non-cancer human cell line can create 48 different long feedback loops. Of these 48 potentially destabilising interactions of the non-cancer cell line, three are actually observed in the cancer cell line, namely JUNB-BCLAF1, BATF-EBF1, and JUNB-EBF1. The likelihood of these potentially destabilising interactions occurring in the cancer cell line is 3/48 = 0.063. In comparison, there are a total of 4363 additional links that could be made between the TFs of the non-cancer cell line. Of these potential links, 56 are observed in the cancer cell line. Hence, the links observed represent 56/4363 (0.013) of all the possible ones. Therefore, the destabilizing interactions are five times more abundant than would be expected by chance (0.063 vs 0.013), consistent with the idea that destabilizing interactions were positively selected for during the microevolution process underlying cancer progression. This suggests that, despite the diverse biological histories of these two cell lines (the networks of GM12878 and K562 share only four common links between TFs), the progression of K562 into a cancerous state has involved changes to regions of the GRN in the progenitor normal cells that displayed weaker BQS. Such genetic factors are therefore likely to play a pivotal role in the process of cancer progression in other cell types."

As discussed in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, such conditions are ideal to minimize cell heterogeneity and to obtain high quality equilibrium networks that are ideally suited for theoretical analysis. However, during the lifetime of an organism GRNs are dynamic and the set of actual transcriptional regulations can change (<a href=\"#bib46\">Luscombe et al., 2004</a>). GRNs transitioning from one transcriptional program to another are unlikely to be at steady state and, under these circumstances, transcriptional robustness may be less important. We decided to test if BQS could provide new insights into the role of robustness during such structural changes. To this end, we used the data presented in <a href=\"#bib24\">Garber et al. (2012)</a> to reconstruct the GRN of murine dendritic cells at four different time points after stimulation by pathogens: at the time of stimulus application (marked as \u20180 hr\u2019) and after the cells have been exposed to the stimulus for 30 min (\u20180.5hr\u2019), 1 hr (\u20181 hr\u2019), and 2 hr (\u20182 hr\u2019). Since the number of TFs studied in these networks is much smaller than the number considered previously, a different simulation algorithm has been used (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

As indicated by <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, the GRN has a very limited number of long feedback loops (only three with three or more genes), in striking contrast with the hundreds observed in randomly generated networks of the same link density. Interestingly, all of the long feedback loops depend on the transcriptional interaction between SFPI1 and E2F1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Notably E2F1 plays a crucial role in the cell cycle and is only transiently activated at commitment to cell division at the end of G1. Therefore, all of the long feedback loops detected are likely to be transient. Similarly, the number of incomplete feedback loops is very small, and much lower than would be expected in random networks (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Motif analysis is also consistent with BQS: there is a much higher proportion of unregulated transcription factors than would be expected by chance (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), and the proportion of stable 3- and 4-node motifs is heavily biased towards the buffered stable forms that enhance BQS (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). Additionally, the mode of cross regulation\u2014with transcription factors tending to be either highly regulating or highly regulated (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>)\u2014also follows the distribution predicted by BQS. Finally, the probability of creating additional long feedback loops in the network by randomly inserting a new regulatory connection is only 0.18, much lower than the value of 0.74 expected in a comparable random network."

A significant number of new long loops are created, peaking at 1 hr and declining slightly by 2 hr (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,E</a>). 22 long feedback loops remain at 2 hr, but interestingly all depend on the transcriptional interaction between RUNX1 and CEBPB. The probability of creating additional long feedback loops is noticeably larger at 1 and 2 hr than in the previous networks (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>). There is also a significant increase in the number of 4-node unbuffered motifs at 1 hr, though this does not persist in the \u20182 hr\u2019 GRN. However, some components of BQS remain unchanged in the stimulus response. Incomplete feedback loops still remain preferentially short (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A,E,I</a>), TF cross regulation remains essentially unchanged (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1D,H,L</a>) and the numbers of unbuffered 3-node motifs (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1B,F,J</a>) and unregulated TFs (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1C,G,K</a>) remain low.

Moreover, evidence of evolutionary pressures acting primarily on the topology of biological networks has been observed (<a href=\"#bib76\">Tanay et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cross et al., 2011</a>). The biological principles and selective pressures underpinning the emergence of these characteristics are an active area of research (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rosenfeld and Alon, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Tyson and Nov\u00e1k, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2011</a>) and the identification of general principles is of pivotal importance for the progression of our understanding. By hypothesizing that GRNs must retain stability under a wide variety of circumstances, and so display Qualitative Stability, we provide a novel, simple and powerful explanation for numerous new and previously observed features of GRNs at different scales. We show that the GRNs of six different organisms display a remarkable lack of long feedback loops, which makes them Qualitatively Stable. This means that perturbations in the strength of any individual interaction\u2014the extent to which a TF activates one of its target genes\u2014will not disturb the state of the network. Thus, GRNs are robust to a very wide range of perturbations. Indeed, the selective pressure for Qualitative Stability appears to be so strong that GRNs are heavily buffered to retain this property under the random addition of new network connections, a property we term Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS). BQS is revealed in numerous different features of GRNs: the lack of long incomplete feedback loops, the high proportion of unregulated TFs, the lack of TFs that are both highly regulated and highly regulating, and the preponderance of buffered over unbuffered motifs. As well as providing stability to immediate disturbances (such as insults that cause a TF to regulate a promoter that it does not normally interact with), BQS also provides robustness to genetic changes that occur as a consequence of sexual recombination of alleles and to mutations that occur over evolutionary time. BQS therefore enhances the evolvability of GRNs, allowing them to function reproducibly in different genetic and environmental contexts. It is worth noting that the scarcity of feedback loops in <i>E. coli</i> has been remarked before (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</a>), but the selective pressures underpinning this fact were not explored."

However, defects in the GRN data are very unlikely to undermine our conclusions, for various reasons. First, as we have clearly shown, random networks with the same link density as the real GRNs do not satisfy BQS, whereas the real GRNs do. Second, as illustrated thoroughly in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013J</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013X</a>, the compliance of real GRNs to BQS is essentially preserved when the rates of false positives and negatives are varied in the <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> GRN datasets. Third, the non-cancer (GM12878) and cancer (K562) cell lines show very different BQS properties, despite having similar link densities. Since the data from both sets of cells were derived under similar conditions and with the same algorithmic tools, they would presumably have similar rates of false positives and negatives. A similar comparison can also be made between the stimulated and unstimulated dendritic cells."

Changes in the transcriptional profile of cells are generally slow, requiring from tens of minutes to hours (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alon, 2006</a>). As a consequence, it may be unhelpful for a cell to propagate transcriptionally a signal in a long cascade, and this might also explain the limited number of long incomplete feedback loops observed. While it is likely that timing effects play a role in the organization of GRNs, there are several reasons for believing that robustness is still fundamental. First of all, certain transcriptional changes take place over very long time scales, indicating that a fast response time is not always necessary. Moreover, each TF in a transcriptional cascade is potentially post-transcriptionally controlled (e.g., from signalling pathways), and therefore the signal need not proceed linearly from the top to the bottom of the pathway, but instead genes at the bottom of a cascade could be activated independently. Additionally, it should be remembered that BQS still allows a long pathway (for example A-B-C-D-E) to have a short link between the start and end (A\u2013E in this example); when we enumerated incomplete feedback loops we considered all the possible transcriptional paths through the network, whilst a fast transcriptional propagation may only involve the shortest path. Finally, we note that several key features of BQS that we observe in GRNs, including the prevalence of buffered 3- and 4-node motifs, the lack of transcriptional hubs with similar numbers of incoming and outgoing links, and the high prevalence of unregulated TFs are independent of signaling pathway length."

As we have demonstrated here, BQS demands that GRNs are free of long feedback loops, even under the addition of new links. The question remains, to what extent feedback operates in post-transcriptional regulation rather than the purely transcriptional networks we have examined here. It was not possible for us to perform a similar analysis of post-transcriptional regulation because strongly validated system-wide data describing such interactions are not currently available. However, the biological literature provides some clues. Motif analysis of post-transcriptional networks reveals that BQS-compliant feedforward loops are overrepresented, while BQS-breaking feedback loops are not (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gerstein et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">The modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Joshi et al., 2012</a>). This suggests that Qualitative Stability may still be an important principle governing the topology of these networks. Additionally, it has been noted that stable motifs are more common than unstable ones even in post-transcriptional signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib56\">Milo et al., 2002</a>), suggesting again a role for Qualitative Stability in these networks. Nevertheless, the existence of feedback loops in post-transcriptional networks (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harris and Levine, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tsang et al., 2007</a>) supports the idea that the severe constraints of BQS are \u2018loosened\u2019 to allow more responsive dynamic functionalities in post-transcriptional regulation. Consistent with these expectations, short feedback loops involving two or three genes appear to be present in some developmentally regulated gene networks (<a href=\"#bib61\">Peter et al., 2012</a>). This raises the hypothesis that the different levels of gene regulation (transcriptional vs post-transcriptional) provide a way of segregating control modules with different robustness properties."

Such robustness is desirable under normal conditions, but can be detrimental during a transcriptional response that requires effective and fast changes in the set of transcribed genes. Consistent with this idea, our analysis indicates that a certain level of instability builds up during a response to a stimulus that produces a transcriptional response. Quite remarkably our results also suggest that two hours after such a stimulus the GRNs considered are \u2018on the verge of stability\u2019, as the deactivation of just one transcriptional interaction will make the network robust according to the BQS rules. It is worth pointing out, however, that each cell in a population is responding to a stimulus independently and potentially at a different pace. Therefore, the apparent post-stimulus instability observed may be the result of sampling transcriptional occupancy of cells at different stages of the transcriptional response. Future experimentation focused on the robustness property of cells and single cell GRN reconstruction will likely clarify which interpretation is correct."

This is consistent with the role of the unstable motifs in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and supports the idea that a small breakdown of BQS might be a hallmark of recent or rapid selection pressure.

The discovery that the transcriptional interactions most critically involved in the formation of long feedback loops in the cancer cell line K562 are also present in the longest incomplete feedback loops in the non-cancer cell line GM12878 may provide clues to mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression. Our theory suggests that random perturbations to the GRN of normal cells will probably leave its stability unchanged. Destabilization of the GRN is likely to involve those genes that are on the edge of stability, for example genes participating in long incomplete loops. It is striking that the two gene families with the highest <i>destabilization potential</i> in the non-cancer cell line (JUN and FOSL) are actually found to be the two gene families with the highest <i>destabilization role</i> in the cancer cell line. These observations are consistent with the notion of cancer as a \u2018systems disease\u2019 that involves changes that lead to destabilisation of the GRN.

The theory deals with systems at equilibrium and considers the effect of small perturbations. Stable systems are characterized by the ability to react to these perturbations by returning to their original equilibrium state. In qualitative networks, each node is associated with a quantity or concentration and the presence of an arrow from node A to node B indicates that changing the concentration of A has an effect on B. The sign of the arrow indicates whether increasing A increases (positive arrow) or decreases (negative arrow) B. The absence of an arrow indicates that increasing the concentration of A does not directly affect the concentration of B.

Under biological constraints relevant for GRNs, isolated double negative feedback loops (i.e., not connected with other feedback loops formed by two or more nodes) are unstable only to the extent that they form switches that can exist in one of two stable states. Double positive feedback loops are potentially capable of a more complex behaviour. However, when considered in isolation with negative self-regulation under constraints relevant to GRNs, they are likely to display a switch-like behaviour (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banerjee and Bose, 2008</a>). Remarkably, in both GRNs for which sign information is available these conditions are verified: in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> the only double positive feedback loop is isolated and in <i>E. coli</i> all non-isolated two-gene feedback loops are part of the potentially chaotic motifs discussed above, and are therefore not relevant for these particular 2-node stability arguments. Hence, the only scenario in which condition 2 potentially threatens Qualitative Stability in GRNs is a \u2018daisy chain\u2019 of linked 2-node feedback loops; in the single case where such a daisy chain is observed (in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>) both 2-node feedback loops are of the positive/negative type and so result in a form compatible with Qualitative Stability. Taken together, the above considerations indicate that condition 3 is the most significant in a rigorous comparative study on the GRNs."

It is therefore not surprising that a delay introduced into feedback loops can lead to oscillations and instability, and this is one additional reason contributing to feedback loops containing &gt;2 nodes not being Qualitatively Stable. Gene expression is a complex multi-step process and the role of regulatory mechanisms as potential sources of delay is an active area of research (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gorgoni et al., 2014</a>). The complexity of the problem, and the difficulty in obtaining quantitative information, limit our ability to assess the role of delays on our model. A delay that is fast compared to transcriptional regulation can be ignored due to the separation of the time-scales. When this is not the case, delays are potential sources of instability, especially in the presence of feedbacks of any size. Delays may be stronger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, as transcription and translation are spatially separated. This may partially explain why the GRNs of yeast and GM12878 have a remarkably limited number of feedback loops of any size."

The theory of Qualitative Stability has been developed by means of differential equations and the conditions discussed above properly apply only to deterministic autonomous systems. This results in our model being a simplification when compared to biological networks such as GRNs. It has been observed that cells limit the noise in gene expression (<a href=\"#bib65\">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</a>), suggesting the existence of biological mechanisms that reduce the extent of stochasticity. Therefore, whilst our model is likely to be largely compatible with the biological behaviour, noise may play a role in triggering GRN reorganization in response to strong stimuli."

For murine dendritic cells, random networks were constructed by preserving the number of transcription factors and interactions among them. Note that consequently the number of feedback loops and incomplete feedback loops is an underestimate with respect to the data considered in the other random networks. Self-regulating interactions were ignored. Since genes not encoding for TFs do not regulate other genes, a full-network analysis would <i>artificially increase</i> the stability property of the network. Therefore, to limit the bias introduced by the limited number of transcription factors, the number of incomplete loops, the motif abundance, the number of regulatory connections, and the probability of adding additional long feedback loops when a new regulatory connection is inserted were computed considering only the interactions among transcription factors. For each different type of random network, 1000 instances were generated for the data presented in the main Figures, while 100 instances were generated for the data presented in the Figure Supplements."

Therefore, using a method designed to preserve features such as degree distribution is likely to result in a network carrying the seed of robustness. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of the degree-preserving model commonly used in motif analysis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Milo et al., 2002</a>) for the <i>E. coli</i> GRN. This model, implemented by the function \u2018rewire\u2019 of igraph, reshuffles the original network in such a way to completely preserve the original in-degree and out-degree <i>for each single node</i>. Our results (not shown) indicate that feedback loops are relatively uncommon in degree-preserving random networks, regardless of the number of rounds of rewiring. However, incomplete feedback loops were more abundant and longer when compared to the real GRNs, even though to a lesser extent than purely random networks. Finally, the distributions of 3- and 4-node motifs were perturbed in such a way as to decrease the number of buffered motifs and to increase the number of unbuffered ones. However, the degree-preserving algorithm was unable to generate networks displaying an equal number of the 3- and 4-node motifs for the classes highlighted in the article, in stinking difference from a purely random model, even after 70,000 rounds of rewiring. Taken together, these observations support the idea that GRNs carry a strong signature of BQS and that random models constrained to be similar to GRNs will inherit, at least in part, many features of BQS. Our results also support the idea that purely random models may be the ideal null models to explore and highlight pervasive features of networks."

I don't think the present MS. really does justice to the already quite extensive literature out there, very physics based, on GRN and this needs to be addressed at the outset.

But when I look at the biological networks that I am familiar with, such as the SOS network in E. coli, an organism which is one of the test cases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), it is by no means obvious to me that there are just 3 at most links to that network: it is quite complicated.

The theory summarized briefly in the Materials and Methods section of the manuscript provides necessary conditions for stability of a system of interacting components based on the sign of the elements in the 'community matrix'. Briefly, the system is stable against perturbations if it lacks positive, double-negative and long feedback loops. By comparative and statistical analysis of cellular and random networks, the authors show that GRN's seem to avoid the destabilizing network motifs. The only exception to this rule is the analysed transformed cell line.

Although we agree that this may be an additional selection pressure reducing the number of long loops, we think it is unlikely to be the primary explanation, for various reasons. First of all, certain transcriptional changes take place over very long time scales, indicating that a fast response time is not always necessary. Moreover, each transcription factor of a transcriptional cascade is potentially post-transcriptionally controlled (e.g. from signalling pathways), and therefore the signal need not proceed linearly from the top to the bottom of the cascade, but instead genes at the bottom of a cascade could be activated independently. Additionally, it should be remembered that BQS still allows a long pathway (for example A-B-C-D-E) to have a short link between the start and end (A-E in this example); when we enumerated incomplete feedback loops we considered all the possible transcriptional paths through the network, whilst a fast transcriptional propagation may only involve the shortest paths. Finally, we note that several key features of BQS that we observe in GRNs, including the prevalence of buffered stable 3- and 4-node motifs, the lack of transcriptional hubs with similar numbers of incoming and outgoing links, and the high prevalence of unregulated TFs are independent of signal pathway length. We added a paragraph to the Discussion (new paragraph 3) explaining this point. We also added a paragraph in the \u201cCondition for Qualitative Stability of networks and its application to GRN\u201d subsection of Materials and methods (new paragraph 9) discussing the possible effect of time delays."

Since a detailed analysis would be too extensive for an article focused on robustness, we decided to not to include a graphical representation of our results, but we can provide such a representation to the editors and reviewer if desired. As discussed therein, a degree-preserving model is strongly constrained by the original network considered and, in the case of GRNs, is likely to result in a network carrying the seed of robustness. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of the degree preserving model commonly used in motif analysis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Milo et al., 2002</a>) for the <i>E. coli</i> GRN. This model reshuffles the original network in such a way to completely preserve the original in-degree and out-degree <i>for each single node</i>. Our results (not shown) indicate that feedback loops are relatively uncommon in degree preserving random networks, regardless of the number of rounds of rewiring. However, incomplete feedback loops were more abundant and longer when compared to the real GRNs, even though to a lesser extent than purely random networks. Finally, the distributions of 3- and 4-node motifs were perturbed in such a way as to decrease the number of buffered motifs and to increase the number of unbuffered ones. However, even after 70,000 rounds of rewiring, the degree-preserving algorithm was unable to generate networks displaying an equal number of the 3- or 4-nodes motifs for the classes highlighted in the article, in striking difference from a purely random model. Taken together, these observations support the idea that GRNs carry a strong signature of BQS and that randomised models seeded by the real GRNs, and constrained to be very similar to GRNs will inherit, at least in part, many features of BQS. Our results also support the idea that purely random models may be the ideal null models to explore pervasive features of networks and that when the property under examination is strongly embedded into the system the use of highly constrained models may be disadvantageous. As we have demonstrated throughout our article, by comparison to random networks and by the analysis of the degrees of single TFs, robustness is strongly embedded in GRNs, since not only they are practically free from long feedback loops, but they are also configured in such a way that this property is preserved under quite extensive perturbation of their topology."

To address this we have expanded the explanation presented in the \u201cConditions for Stability for networks and its applicability to GRN\u201d subsection of Materials and methods. The rule requiring invertibility of the sign matrix is not a relevant feature due to its implication of biochemical identity. The rule prohibiting autocatalytic positive self-regulation is not relevant to systems with finite resources such as GRNs, since saturating effects on transcription (for example due to limiting numbers of RNA polymerases) along with protein degradation means that autocatalytic TFs will reach a stable steady-state rather than increasing to arbitrarily high values. This argument of finite resources obviating positive self-regulation has also been applied to the study of Qualitative Stability by May in ecosystems (<a href=\"#bib52\">May, 1973a</a>). The rule requiring the absence of double positive and double negative feedback loops requires more attention. Under biological constraints relevant for GRNs, isolated (i.e. not connected with other feedback loops formed by two or more nodes) double negative feedback loops are unstable only to the extent that they form switches that can exist in one of two stable states. Double positive feedback loops are potentially capable of a more complex behaviour. However, when considered in isolation with negative self-regulation, they generally display a switch-like behaviour. Remarkably, in both GRNs for which sign information is available these conditions are verified: in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> the only double positive feedback loop is isolated and in <i>E. coli</i> all non-isolated two-gene feedback loops are part of the potentially chaotic motifs discussed above, and are therefore not relevant to this particular stability arguments. Therefore the only scenario in which condition 2) potentially threatens Qualitative Stability in GRNs is a \u2018daisy chain\u2019 of linked 2-node feedback loops; in the single case where such a daisy chain is observed (in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>) both 2-node feedback loops are of the positive/negative type and so are compatible with Qualitative Stability. Since this analysis further supports the concept of BQS in GRNs, we have added a more extensive discussion on 2-node motifs to the subsection \u201cBQS highlights critical network modules\u201d in Results. We also agree that stability is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for robustness. We thank the reviewer and editors for pointing this out and have added a new paragraph in the Introduction to clarify this point (new paragraph 3)."

Moreover, in analyzing dendritic cells responding to a pathogen (subsection \u201cBQS and transcriptional response\u201d of Results), we see that a potentially stable network moves into a less stable configuration.

We would also like to point out that for similar reasons as described in Shen-Orr et al. the motif distributions highlighted would be preserved under moderate augmentation of the network by post-transcriptional modifications. Additionally, due to the nature of the randomization process used, the results presented in Shen-Orr et al. are compatible with a network configured to strongly limit the creation of long feedback loops even when as much as 25% of the network is perturbed.

I don't think the present MS. really does justice to the already quite extensive literature out there, very physics based, on GRN and this needs to be addressed at the outset. The authors might claim too much credit for what they have discovered. I found that the review in Nature Genetics by Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si and Zolt\u00e1n N. Oltvai ``\u2019Network Biology:Understanding the cell\u2019s functional Organization\u2019 to be an excellent introduction and to have it characterized as ``predominantly descriptive, rather than predictive' to be rather harsh. Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS) may be an interesting subject (since it is qualitative and not quantitative really I could lump it into the ``predominantly descriptive' category as well). I think more credit has to be given to the ideas of scale-free networks, hierarchical architecture and hub connectivity</i>."
