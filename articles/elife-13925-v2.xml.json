However, the few inputs that are present are organized similarly to how they eventually will be organized in adults. After birth, the number of inputs gradually increases until the rats are approximately 12 days old, at which point the pattern of connections is indistinguishable from what we observe in adults. Thus it appears that retrosplenial inputs are fully mature before activity patterns emerge in the parahippocampal region."

                        "text": "The parahippocampal region (PHR) is important for learning and memory. It consists of two functionally different networks, one of which, involved in spatial functions, comprises the presubiculum (PrS), parasubiculum (PaS), medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and postrhinal cortex (POR). The other important for object representation and processing of contextual information, comprising lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and perirhinal cortex (PER; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Canto et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Knierim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Witter et al., 2014</a>). PrS, PaS, and MEC harbor cells representing an animal\u2019s position (grid cells), direction (head direction cells), borders in the environment (border cells) and speed of the animal (speed cells; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fyhn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Solstad et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kropff et al., 2015</a>). Even though a complete mechanistic understanding on how these spatial codes emerge is still lacking, it is believed that both intrinsic connectivity and extrinsic afferents are necessary to produce the receptive fields observed (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brandon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Koenig et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bonnevie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Couey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Newman et al., 2014</a>). One approach applied to identify the critical elements underlying the functioning of these cell types, has been to study the developmental aspects of PHR networks. The different spatially modulated neuron types in PHR emerge at different periods during development. Border cells and head-direction cells can both be observed at the end of the second- and beginning of the third postnatal week (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bjerknes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bjerknes et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tan et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, adult-like grid cells in layer II of MEC first appear during the fourth postnatal week (<a href=\"#bib38\">Langston et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wills et al., 2010</a>). The early presence of head-direction cells is apparently paralleled by a similarly early developed shared connectivity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bjerknes et al., 2015</a>), while the late development of grid cells is paralleled by a corresponding late development of the relevant intrinsic connectivity in MEC (<a href=\"#bib38\">Langston et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Couey et al., 2013</a>). Regarding main inputs, sparse connections between the hippocampal formation (HF) and PHR are present from birth, reaching adult-like morphological features during the second postnatal week (<a href=\"#bib22\">Deng et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">O'Reilly et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">O'Reilly et al., 2015</a>). A similar developmental timeline has also been reported for functional connections from PrS/PaS to MEC (<a href=\"#bib12\">Canto et al., 2011</a>). However, the timeline of development of cortical afferents to HF and PHR is still unknown."

Lesions of RSC result in impairments in navigational tasks (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vann et al., 2009</a>). In addition, RSC in rodents is necessary for fear conditioning, both when context or complex multimodal stimuli are used as conditional stimuli (<a href=\"#bib32\">Keene and Bucci, 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Corcoran et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cowansage et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Robinson et al., 2014</a>) and in rabbits RSC neurons are responsive to auditory cues when used as a CS in a memory task (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gabriel et al., 1991</a>), suggesting that RSC has a general role in memory processes. The effect of lesioning RSC on navigation and memory performance is surprisingly similar to that seen after lesions that inflict the HF-PHR. It has thus been postulated that interactions between RSC and HF-PHR are crucial for spatial processing. In the adult, RSC projections target preferentially POR, PrS, PaS, and MEC (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jones and Witter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sugar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kononenko and Witter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Czajkowski et al., 2013</a>). In this paper, we aimed to ascertain the relevance of the RSC-PHR projection for the development of the functionally different neuron types in PHR. We hypothesized that if inputs from RSC are important for the development of head-direction- and/or border cells, these inputs should be present before eye-opening. Alternatively, if inputs from RSC are only important for the formation of stable grid cells, these inputs might develop after eye-opening, likely reaching adult-like morphology during the third and fourth week. We injected RSC of rats at different postnatal ages, ranging from postnatal day 0 to 28 (P0-P28), with anterograde tracers. Using retrograde tracing, we identified RSC neurons originating the developing PHR projections. The anterograde experimental material was used to analyze the organization of RSC-PHR projections in postnatal rats and to compare these results with data previously obtained in the adult. We further analyzed the development of axon morphology and densities of axonal plexus in PHR."

These nomenclatures mainly follow the same cytoarchitectonic- and histochemical criteria and are therefore directly comparable. For a summary and direct comparison of the different nomenclatures, we refer to a recent review on the RSC-HF-PHR connectivity (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sugar et al., 2011</a>). In the current manuscript, we chose to use the nomenclature of <a href=\"#bib66\">Vogt (2004)</a>. We defined the border between area (A)29 and A30 as the area where layer II changes from being very condensed in A29, to less condensed in A30. The rostral border of RSC, towards the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was defined as the area where layer II/III widens and where layer IV shifts from being clearly demarcated in RSC towards being more diffusely organized in ACC. The ventral border of RSC with PHR, more specifically with PrS, was defined by the appearance of a cell free lamina dissecans in PrS, not present in RSC. In adult rats, A29 can be further subdivided into three different cytoarchitectonic subdivisions; A29a, b and c, which are involved in different cognitive functions (<a href=\"#bib63\">van Groen et al., 2004</a>). However, in the immature cortex, these cytoarchitectonic areas are not apparent. We therefore chose to define a continuous measure of the dorsoventral positions within RSC (see methods for details). This measure is indirectly related to the classical cytoarchitectonic subdivision since the classical borders of A29a, b and c follow approximately our continuous definition of the dorsoventral axis of RSC."

Of the 82 animals used in this study, 20 animals either did not survive surgery or no injection sites were observed in RSC. In the remaining 62 animals we obtained 113 injections in RSC. Eight of these injections only involved layers I and/or layers II-III and did not result in any labeled fibers in HF-PHR. These experiments were therefore excluded from further analyses. The remaining 105 injections all covered at least parts of layer V of RSC and involved different parts of RSC. We obtained one (n=21), two (n=31), three (n=6) or four (n=1) ipsilateral injections in RSC of each brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In our analyses, we regarded each of these injections as independent experiments. Most of the experiments (n=93) were performed in animals aged P15 or younger since other comparable corticocortical projections are developed before eye-opening and the functional cell types are present in HF-PHR at this age (<a href=\"#bib38\">Langston et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">O'Reilly et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bjerknes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">O'Reilly et al., 2014</a>).

The injections are color-coded according to age (see color code bottom left). Injections were performed in either the left or right hemisphere but to ease visualization, all injections were plotted in the right hemisphere. Dentate gyrus (DG), CA3-1, subiculum (SUB), fasciola cinereum (FC), pre- and parasubiculum (PrS and PaS), medial- and lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC), A35-36 and postrhinal cortex (POR) are color coded, while the rest of the brain is colored green.

Triangle explained in C. (<b>C</b>) One example, as shown in B, of the algorithm used for calculating normalized 2D coordinates of the injections. The pial surface area of A29 and A30 was divided into triangles (grey area). The shortest vector (black line) between the injection (red sphere) and the cortical surface was calculated. Thereafter, we calculated the coordinate of the intersection of the vector and the plane within the triangle (yellow dot) which represented the 'transposed' location of the injection. The normalized dorsoventral coordinate of each injection was defined by calculating the shortest vector from the transposed injection to dorsal (<math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>) and ventral border of A29 or A30 (<math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>). The normalized rostrocaudal coordinate was obtained by first calculating a line along the rostrocaudal extend of A29 and A30, positioned equally distant from the dorsal and ventral borders (magenta line). Next, we calculated the shortest vector between the injection and this line (red line) and found the intersection between the two. The rostrocaudal coordinate was obtained by calculating the cumulative distance from the cross section to the rostral (<math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>) and caudal end of RSC (<math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>).

In some (n=44), we observed a few retrogradely labeled neurons within the dorsal half of subiculum (SUB). This potentially may lead to false positive labeling, which will be addressed in the detailed descriptions below. In accordance with previous studies in adults, we observed anterogradely labeled fibers in the striatum, anterior nuclei of the thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex and visual cortices and in the brainstem (<a href=\"#bib60\">van Groen and Wyss, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jones et al., 2005</a>). However, a detailed assessment of these projections is outside the scope of this paper and here we will detail the projections to PHR. We observed anterogradely labeled fibers in layers I, III and V-VI of PrS (in all of the experiments included in the analyses, n=105), layers V-VI of PaS (n=90), layers V-VI of MEC (n=90), layers V-VI of medial LEC (n=14) and in all layers of posterior POR (n=75). In some cases, we also observed single fibers in layers I and/or III of MEC (n=34). Additionally, we observed few fibers (if present typically one or two fibers in an experiment) in the dorsal half of SUB (n=41) and/or in the dorsal CA fields (n=16). In contrast to previously published data (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burwell and Amaral, 1998b</a>), we did not observe any labeled fibers in PER in any of our experiments. This includes the oldest aged pups (P27-28) and the adult cases, suggesting that this lack of perirhinal projections is not a developmental feature. It is thus obvious that all experiments shared RSC-PHR projection patterns, but there were also marked differences from case to case depending on the location of injection within RSC. This will be systematically described in the next sections."

First the transverse measurements (s<sub>#,a</sub>, visualized by black lines in C1) and the dorsoventral measurement (<math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><mi>d</mi><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></mrow></math>) in all sections in all animals were normalized to the longest measurement of the respective subdivision in the particular animal (red (transverse) and blue (dorsoventral) numbers in C1). Next, we binned the dorsoventral axis of each PHR subdivision (represented by turquois lines in C1) in the same amounts of bins as the maximum number of sections containing PHR in a single series (<math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>; 23 in the example) and calculated the transverse extends of each row of bins in each animal (<math id=\"inf7\"><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mo></mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>, numbers not shown). Thereafter, we calculated the means of the normalized transverse measurements across all animals for each bin (<math id=\"inf8\"><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>t</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math>, red numbers in C2), and the mean across all animals of the normalized dorsoventral extend of PHR (<math id=\"inf9\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow></math>; blue number in C2). The ratio of the mean transverse extends and the mean dorsoventral extend was calculated such that each dorsoventral level was expressed as a value relative to the dorsoventral extent of PHR (<math id=\"inf10\"><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math>; red numbers in C3). Finally, the number of bins along the transverse axis for each dorsoventral level (<math id=\"inf11\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>T</mi><mi>i</mi><mrow><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>) was calculated (C4)."

Using the distribution patterns as represented in the flatmaps (see methods for details), we identified five clusters. However, the injection sites in RSC associated with each of the clusters were not clustered in RSC such that several of the injections associated with one cluster of distribution patterns partly overlapped with injection sites associated with other labeling clusters in PHR. None of the clusters of labeling in PHR was associated with distinct age groups of animals. We therefore concluded that RSC does not contain regions having distinct projection patterns to PHR, but more likely has a continuous topographical organization of projections to PHR. Therefore, we next assessed whether the labeling patterns in PHC changed systematically in relationship to the rostrocaudal and/or the dorsoventral position of the injections in RSC. For the analysis of the projection patterns, we initially subdivided the injections into two groups depending on whether the injections were located in A29 (n=50) or A30 (n=55). We also subdivided each of the two areas into four equally sized rostrocaudal regions; the rostral quarter of RSC (n=16), intermediate-rostral quarter of RSC (n=22), intermediate-caudal quarter of RSC (n=48) and caudal quarter of RSC (n=19)."

First, we pooled the projection patterns of all experiments in each of the eight injection groups described above. We subsequently analyzed the 'mean' projection pattern of each group, as represented on flatmaps of PHR (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, the pooled flatmaps are sensitive to the number of bins covered by the labeled axons in each experiment. Experiments in young animals with single labeled fibers in PHR or experiments with small injections resulting in few labeled axons in PHR will contribute fewer 'labeled bins' to the pooled flatmaps, and the pooled flatmaps might therefore be biased towards the experiments with many bins containing labeled axons. Therefore, we also calculated, for each experiment, the center of mass of the projections to respectively layers I and III of PrS, layers V-VI of PrS and PaS combined, and layers V-VI of MEC and LEC combined. The centers of mass served as a quantifiable measure of the location of the labeled axons in PHR, which is independent of the number of fibers labeled in each experiment."

Injections in the three more caudal subdivisions of A29 and A30 resulted in labeling in PHR at successively more ventral levels.

The topography along the transverse axis of PrS and PaS seen after A29 and A30 injections was observed already during the first postnatal week. In addition, in all age groups, caudal injections resulted in more extensive labeling in ventral PHR compared to rostral injections. However, injections in younger animals tended to have less labeled fibers in ventral PHR. To investigate this phenomenon more carefully, we plotted the coordinates of the centers of mass of the axonal labeling as a function of age and the location of the injection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This analysis indicated that already from the earliest postnatal ages, the position of the centers of mass are organized as described above. Already at the earliest ages, we observed that different rostrocaudal levels of RSC project to different dorsoventral levels of PrS and PaS. Even though we observed a tendency for the youngest animals to not display labeling more ventrally in PHR, age had no significant effect on the position of the centers of mass along the dorsoventral axis in neither layers I and III of PrS (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, \u03b2=0.000, 95% CI [\u22120.005, 0.004], t<sub>99</sub>=\u22120.157, p=0.876), in layers V-VI of PrS and PaS (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, \u03b2=\u22120.002, 95% CI [\u22120.006, 0.001], t<sub>99</sub>=\u22121.328, p=0.187), nor in layers V-VI of MEC and LEC in older animals (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, \u03b2=\u22120.003, 95% CI [\u22120.007, 0.001], t<sub>85</sub>=\u22121.299, p=0.198).

To this end, we reanalyzed a dataset described in earlier publications from our lab (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jones et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jones and Witter, 2007</a>). Analyses of the cases individually, suggested that the organization of the projection pattern as we described in young animals was also present in adult animals. After injections in A30, a dense fiber plexus was observed distally in layers I and III of dorsal PrS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Additional labeled fibers were observed in layers V-VI of distal PrS, PaS and medially in MEC, comparable to the projection pattern we observed after injections in A30 of pups (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Compared to injections in A30, injections in A29 resulted in labeled fibers more proximally in PrS and more laterally in MEC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This topographical organization seems to be graded, since the injection located at the border between A29 and A30 displayed labeled fibers in a mediolateral position between the dorsally- and ventrally injected cases (compare <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> with A and B respectively). Compared to rostrally placed injections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>), we observed that caudally placed injections displayed more labeled axons in ventral PrS and MEC, and the area receiving the densest projection in both PrS and MEC was shifted more ventrally (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the RSC to PHR projections in the postnatal brain are similarly organized to the adult ones."

We conclude that the postnatal RSC projects densely to all layers of PrS and posterior POR and deep layers of PaS and MEC and weakly to deep layers of LEC and to SUB. Our retrograde experiments showed that the origin of these projections were neurons located in superficial parts of layer V of RSC. These findings are in accordance with previous work in the adult (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shibata, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Burwell and Amaral, 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jones and Witter, 2007</a>). Additionally, we report that the RSC projections to PrS, PaS and EC are topographically organized similarly already in the youngest postnatal rats and in adult rats (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). The notion that rostral RSC only projects to dorsal PHR, while caudal RSC projects to additional more ventral parts of PHR is in accordance with previous work in the adult (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shibata, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jones and Witter, 2007</a>). Second, dorsal RSC (A30) projects preferentially to distal PrS, PaS and medial MEC, while more ventral parts of RSC (A29) project significantly more to proximal PrS and more lateral parts of MEC.

Furthermore, these partner domains in PrS and MEC are selectively innervated by different areas of SUB along its transverse axis such that distal SUB projects to distal PrS and medial MEC, while more proximal parts of SUB, with the exclusion of the very proximal part, project to proximal PrS and more lateral MEC (<a href=\"#bib68\">Witter, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">O'Reilly et al., 2013</a>). This indicates the existence of a connectional route linking A30, medial MEC, distal SUB and distal PrS to each other. A parallel route links A29 with more lateral MEC, more proximal SUB and proximal PrS. Although no clear transverse gradients in spatial modulation have been reported in MEC, electrophysiological properties of neurons show a transverse gradient, indicative that more medially positioned grid cells might be more precisely spatially tuned (<a href=\"#bib13\">Canto and Witter, 2012</a>). Furthermore, neurons in distal SUB are more spatially modulated compared to those in proximal SUB (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sharp and Green, 1994</a>). All observations thus point to a differentiation of A29 and A30 where A30 is connected preferentially to more spatially modulated neurons in medial MEC and distal SUB compared to A29 which is more connected to neurons in lateral MEC and more proximal SUB."

Even though we did not perform a formal quantification of the number of labeled fibers in PHR, we only observed single unbranching fibers in animals aged P1-2. During the first postnatal week, the number of axons generally increased, and the fibers displayed several branching points towards the end of the first postnatal week. The first terminal plexus with adult-like densities were observed in P12 animals. Even though several other factors, such as tracer type and the number of layer V RSC neurons involved in the injection also had an impact on the number of fibers observed in each experiment, we are confident that the most important predictor of labeled fiber density was the age of the animal. Interestingly, the time window of increased density of RSC afferents in PHR is paralleled by several anatomical and physiological changes in PHR. EC afferents originating in PaS and PrS become functional from P8 and mature gradually until they are fully adult-like around P14 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Canto et al., 2011</a>). Similar developmental timescales have also been reported for the functional development of intralaminar projections within EC (<a href=\"#bib42\">O'Reilly et al., 2010</a>)."

Even though no published experiments have investigated whether border cells and head-direction cells are present before the second postnatal week, our data indicate that the topographical organization of RSC terminals in PHR is present before spatially modulated neurons are present in PHR and that adult-like axonal densities can be observed approximately at the same time-point as the first border cells and head-direction cells are observed in PHR. This conclusion is comparable to what has been observed for intrinsic HF-PHR connectivity which is also topographically organized already at early postnatal periods, demonstrating increased plexus densities for intrinsic HF-PHR projections during ongoing development (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fricke and Cowan, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Borrell et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">O'Reilly et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">O'Reilly et al., 2014</a>). It is also comparable to what has been reported in several other developing brain systems. For instance, for thalamocortical projections in the visual system of both monkeys, cats and ferrets, the first arriving axons in the visual cortex already show a topographical organization into ocular dominance columns (<a href=\"#bib29\">Horton and Hocking, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Crowley and Katz, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Crair et al., 2001</a>). Similarly, the rat ventral posterior thalamic nucleus issue projections to the somatosensory cortex in which the first arriving axons target distinct areas later forming a defined barrel (<a href=\"#bib14\">Catalano et al., 1996</a>). Sensory inputs to the olfactory bulb are present long before neurons display a receptive field. Moreover, the development of these inputs is independent of activity in sensory receptors, which suggests that the development of topographies in the olfactory bulb is experience independent (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lin et al., 2000</a>). The same conclusion apparently holds for the projections from RSC to PHR, These findings are different from what has been reported for the retinogeniculate projection in several species. In this projection, there is an overshoot of axonal terminals, which are initially diffuse and later pruned into an adult-like topography (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rakic, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Linden et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shatz, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Godement et al., 1984</a>). These differences might imply that distinct molecular- or activity based principles governs the axonal termination patterns in different neural projections."

The densities of the terminal plexus appear to develop gradually without any clear signs of pruning, though it remains to be determined whether connectional reorganization occurs at the synaptic level during development. The first plexus with adult-like densities can be observed around P12 which is around the time when the first spatially modulated neurons in PHR have been observed (P11), but before eye-opening and before the animals starts to navigate (around P15) and thus before adult like grid cells are observed in PHR (after P25; <a href=\"#bib38\">Langston et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wills et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bjerknes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bjerknes et al., 2015</a>).

Next, we binned the dorsoventral axis of each PHR subdivision in 29 equally sized bins, since the maximum number of sections containing PHR in a single series was 29.

This procedure thus resulted in, for each subdivision, 29 dorsoventral levels with different transverse extents, expressed as a value relative to the dorsoventral length of PHR. The transverse extents were subsequently turned into square bins (calculated as the average extent along the transverse axis x 29 and rounded to the nearest integer, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C4</a>) so that each subdivision could be represented as a flatmap containing 29 rows of bins with a variable amount of square bins in each row (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A5</a>)."

In PrS, the distance from each labeled axon to the proximal border of PrS was measured, while in deep layers of PaS the distance from each labeled axon to the distal border of PaS was measured.

In the adult brain, these four subdivisions are positioned along the dorsoventral extend of RSC. In the immature cortex, only the cytoarchitectonic border between A29 and A30 is clearly identifiable. We therefore chose to define the dorsoventral location of the injections in A29 and A30 as a continuous coordinate. This measure is thus indirectly related to the classical discrete cytoarchitectonic subdivisions. We used the recently released reference 3D-atlas brain (<a href=\"#bib45\">Papp et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">2015</a>) to map all injections in a standardized space, irrespective of age. First, we identified coordinates of the dorsal, ventral, rostral and caudal border of respectively A29 and A30 in the atlas brain. The lines between the respective coordinates were smoothed using local regression. Next, we calculated the cutting angles of our experimental brains relative to the atlas brain and made sections of the standard atlas brain with the same cutting angles. We identified atlas-sections containing landmarks and cytoarchitectonic borders present in the section containing the center of each injection. The atlas coordinate of the center of each injection was recorded and served as an age-normalized 3D point-measure of the injection location within RSC. For illustrative purposes, the coordinates of all injections were plotted within the 3D volume (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, ITK-SNAP, NIH)."

In general, the manuscript is fine, however, quite some improvements can be made to the manuscript. The use of A30 and A29 is correct, but some explanation about other nomenclature for these regions is needed. Furthermore, A29 consists of more than one region, and connections from the sub-areas are not the same. Therefore, injections should be subdivided into these sub-areas. <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> indicates that all projections to PHR arise from layer 5 in RSC, even so it should be mentioned that injections cover what layers in RSC. By the way, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> is of too low quality (and from what age are the injections?), also the pre/parasubicular injection seems to only retrogradely label A29. While the illustrations of the paper are fine, for the interested reader it would be of use to have some schematic drawing(s) of the described connections, and the timeline of their development. Finally, the schematic maps (e.g., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and further) showing the topography are very hard to read, they should be made more accessible to the average reader."

We have clearly stated the controversy in the subsection \u201cGeneral projection patterns\u201d. Since this is only a small detail, we have dealt with this when describing the lack of projections in PER. In the Burwell paper, retrograde tracers were used. In our hands, retrograde tracers are generally more sensitive, but less specific than iontophoretically injected anterograde tracers, therefore the labeling in perirhinal cortex might have been the result of transport by passing fibers or we may have missed very sparse and relatively long projections by using anterograde tracers and relatively short post-injection survival times."

Any reason to expect (or not) that there are potential sex differences in the temporal maturation of these connections given that there are sex differences in behavior/disorders related to these brain areas?</i> This was done to save animals. In each litter we obtained approximately 5 females and 5 males. To avoid having five unused animals from each litter we chose to do experiments on both genders. We thereby reduced the numbers of litters by 50%. In the literature, there are no strong data indicative of sex differences, neither in development nor in connectivity of the areas of research."

However, to subdivide A29 further is impossible in the youngest pups since the cytoarchitectonic differences are not apparent at this age. We therefore chose to define the dorsoventral axis of RSC as a continuous measure. The reasoning for this is that a continuous \u201csubdivision\u201d is comparable across all ages while the classical cytoarchitectonic subdivision is only usable for the oldest pups. We have now inserted a statement on this both in the Results section (first paragraph) and in the Methods section (subsection \u201cLocation of labeled fibers\u201d, end of second paragraph). We acknowledge that our continuous measure is only indirectly related to the classical cytoarchitectonic subdivision since the classical borders of A29a, b and c follow only approximately our continuous definition of the dorsoventral axis of RSC. In our material we find that the transverse coordinate of center of mass of the RSC projections to PHR show an approximately linear relationship with the dorsoventral coordinate of the injection in RSC. We did not observe any discrete \u201cjumps\u201d. This suggest that the topographical organization of projections from RSC to PHR is not organized into discrete projection patterns from each of A29a, b or c (or A30) but is rather organized in a continuous gradient over the dorsoventral RSC, similar to what has been reported for the adult situation."
