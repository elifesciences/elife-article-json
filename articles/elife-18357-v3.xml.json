                    "text": "In response to proteasome dysfunction, mammalian cells upregulate proteasome gene expression by activating Nrf1. Nrf1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident transcription factor that is continually retrotranslocated and degraded by the proteasome. Upon proteasome inhibition, Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved to become active. However, the processing enzyme for Nrf1 remains obscure. Here we show that the aspartyl protease DNA-damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2) is required to cleave and activate Nrf1. Deletion of DDI2 reduced the cleaved form of Nrf1 and increased the full-length cytosolic form of Nrf1, resulting in poor upregulation of proteasomes in response to proteasome inhibition. These defects were restored by adding back wild-type DDI2 but not protease-defective DDI2. Our results provide a clue for blocking compensatory proteasome synthesis to improve cancer therapies targeting proteasomes."

Nrf1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident transcription factor that is continually retrotranslocated and degraded by the proteasome. Upon proteasome inhibition, Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved to become active. However, the processing enzyme for Nrf1 remains obscure. Here we show that the aspartyl protease DNA-damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2) is required to cleave and activate Nrf1. Deletion of DDI2 reduced the cleaved form of Nrf1 and increased the full-length cytosolic form of Nrf1, resulting in poor upregulation of proteasomes in response to proteasome inhibition. These defects were restored by adding back wild-type DDI2 but not protease-defective DDI2. Our results provide a clue for blocking compensatory proteasome synthesis to improve cancer therapies targeting proteasomes."

Some cancer treatments aim to kill cancer cells by inhibiting proteasomes, but these treatments may be unsuccessful if the bounce-back response is not also prevented. Therefore, understanding how Nrf1 is activated is an important issue."

The luminal region of Nrf1 is continually retrotranslocated to the cytosol by the p97/VCP ATPase complex, accompanied by deglycosylation and ubiquitination. Under normal circumstances, Nrf1 is promptly degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, when proteasome activity is compromised, Nrf1 escapes degradation and is proteolytically cleaved to the active form which enters the nucleus and enhances expression of target genes including proteasome subunits (<a href=\"#bib8\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Steffen et al., 2010</a>).

Our approach used the well-characterized subcellular localization of Nrf1 accumulation in the nucleus in response to proteasome inhibition. HEK293A cells were transfected with pooled siRNA (a pool of 4 unique siRNAs per gene) and then treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to induce accumulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Steffen et al., 2010</a>). Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-Nrf1 antibody. The ratio of the nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescent intensities was assessed by high-content microscopy and automated image analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). p97 siRNA treatment served as a positive control, which abolished Nrf1 translocation following bortezomib treatment while increasing cytoplasmic Nrf1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</a>). We observed a high degree of assay robustness (Z\u2019-factor\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.5, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) in the primary screen. The initial candidate genes with B score\u00a0&lt;\u00a0\u20133.2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) or which were picked up by visual inspection of the raw image data were further tested using four individual siRNAs in two different cell lines (HEK293A and HT1080 cells) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The subsequent candidates that had more than two hits in either cell line were finally examined whether the siRNAs mitigated upregulation of <i>PSMA3</i>, a proteasome subunit gene. Consequently, we obtained 14 candidate genes that may impair activation of Nrf1 in response to bortezomib treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These hits included SEL1L, a co-factor of the ubiquitin ligase HRD1, which catalyzes ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of Nrf1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Iida et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Steffen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Tsuchiya et al., 2011</a>) and FAF2/UBXD8, a p97-recruiting molecule in ERAD (<a href=\"#bib6\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>), validating our screening approach (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B, and D</a>)."

In negative and positive (p97 siRNA) control cells treated with bortezomib, the majority of Nrf1 is localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). DDI2 knockdown partially inhibited nuclear translocation of Nrf1, accompanied by an increase in cytoplasmic Nrf1. To determine if there is a defect in Nrf1 processing by DDI2 knockdown, we examined which Nrf1 species were observed in each knockdown. In negative control cells, Nrf1 was hardly detected in the absence of bortezomib, but bortezomib treatment increased the processed, active form of Nrf1 as well as the full-length, cytosolic form that is retrotranslocated into the cytosol by p97 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</a>). In p97 knockdown cells, the luminal ER form of Nrf1 that is N-glycosylated accumulated while the processed form almost disappeared both in the presence and absence of bortezomib. In DDI2 knockdown cells, Nrf1 was not detected in the absence of bortezomib, similar to control cells. However, in the presence of bortezomib, the full-length, cytosolic form of Nrf1 markedly accumulated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These results indicate that DDI2 is involved in conversion of full-length, cytosolic Nrf1 to the processed, active form."

In contrast, the full-length form of Nrf1 that is significantly accumulated in DDI2 knockdown cells was not sensitive to Endo H treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Note that bortezomib treatment alone causes some accumulation of Endo H-sensitive N-glycosylated Nrf1 and that the deglycosylated species was detected at almost the same molecular weight as the processed, active form of Nrf1 observed in cells treated with bortezomib alone, similar to previously reported observations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</a>).

The HIV-1 protease typically cleaves substrates between two hydrophobic residues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Konvalinka et al., 2015</a>). Nrf1 has been shown to be cleaved between Trp103 and Leu104 to become active (<a href=\"#bib8\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</a>), which conforms with the cleavage motif by retroviral aspartyl proteases. Accordingly, we asked whether the protease activity of DDI2 is required for Nrf1 processing. DDI2 has a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) at the N-terminus and a RVP domain near the C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Bortezomib treatment increased the processed form of Nrf1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Knockdown of DDI2 reduced the processed form and increased full-length Nrf1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This effect was rescued by introducing siRNA-resistant wild-type DDI2 but not a protease-dead DDI2 in which the active site aspartic acid 252 was replaced with asparagine (D252N). We also found that a DDI2 mutant lacking the UBL domain only partially restored the effect of DDI2 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These results suggest that the protease activity of DDI2 is required for cleavage of Nrf1 and that the UBL domain plays some role in the cleavage."

We observed that knockout and D252N DDI2 knock-in cells had significantly lower proteasome activity compared to wild-type DDI2 knock-in cells, suggesting that DDI2 is also involved in basal expression of proteasomes through its catalytic activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

                        "text": "In conclusion, we identified DDI2 as a protease that is required for Nrf1 processing and the bounce-back response induced by proteasome inhibition. However, there remain several questions to be answered. How can the involvement of DDI2 be reconciled with a previous report that demonstrated a defect in Nrf1 processing by strong inhibition of the proteasome, leading to the conclusion that the proteasome is the processing enzyme for Nrf1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</a>)? In terms of substrate specificity, the cleavage site of Nrf1 (P1: W, P1\u2019: L) does not seem to be a sequence preferred by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Toes et al., 2001</a>); rather it conforms to a cleavage motif of RVP (<a href=\"#bib2\">Konvalinka et al., 2015</a>). It could be that the proteasome activity is required for function of DDI2 or some other factors that is involved in Nrf1 processing. Related to this, the mechanism by which DDI2 acts as a Nrf1 processing protease remains unclear. DDI2 is not induced by bortezomib at either protein or mRNA level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, the subcellular localization of DDI2 seems to be unaffected by bortezomib treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Since DDI2 is suggested to be active even when the\u00a0proteasome activity is not compromised (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>), a specific activation mechanism under proteasome impairment may not exist. An intriguing finding is that the UBL domain of DDI2 plays some role in Nrf1 processing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It has been shown that the UBL domain of Ddi1p is an atypical UBL that binds ubiquitin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Nowicka et al., 2015</a>). Binding of DDI2 with ubiquitinated proteins, possibly Nrf1 itself, would be promoted by proteasome inhibition and may facilitate Nrf1 processing by DDI2. Lastly, whether DDI2 directly cleaves Nrf1 remains unknown. We have tested a recombinant fragment of Nrf1 encompassing the processing site as a substrate for recombinant DDI2, but failed to detect its cleavage. Other factors might be required for in vitro reconstitution of Nrf1 processing by DDI2, such as substrate unfolding, co-activators of DDI2, and a set of specific experimental conditions. Understanding the mechanism by which DDI2 cleaves Nrf1 and establishing an in vitro assay for the\u00a0enzymatic activity of DDI2 should provide useful information for developing a DDI2 inhibitor that would block compensatory proteasome synthesis to improve cancer therapies targeting proteasomes."

Each different clone of the same genotypes was also considered as a biological replicate in the experiments using mutant cell lines obtained by the\u00a0CRISPR-Cas9 system. Technical replicates were multiple analyses of the same sample in an experiment. The results are expressed as mean + standard error of the mean (SEM) of three biological replicates (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Significant differences were considered as probabilities less than 5% (p&lt;0.05)."

The manuscript starts with an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen aimed at identifying genes important for Nrf1 activation. This yielded 14 candidate genes, including DDI2, which is known to have an aspartyl protease domain homologous to that of the HIV protease. Subsequent experiments demonstrated diminished nuclear localization and processing of Nrf1, and diminished induction of proteasome genes, in DDI2-deficient cells treated with proteasome inhibitor. It was also shown that the active site of DDI2 is required to promote processing of Nrf1 and bortezomib-induced expression of proteasome genes. The authors also showed that DDI2 can be targeted by inhibitors of HIV protease and that these inhibitors improve the efficacy of Bortezomib."

In p97-depleted cells, the accumulated Nrf1 band was sensitive to Endo H treatment, consistent with the previous studies and indicating that the two bands correspond to glycosylated \u201cG\u201d and deglycosylated \u201cDeG\u201d forms of Nrf1.

Curiously, the migration of \u201cDeG\u201d and \u201cFL\u201d does not correspond to each other. This phenomenon was also observed in a previous report, though the precise reason is yet unknown (Radhakrishnan et al. 2014).

We examined bortezomib sensitivity of DDI2 knock-in and knock-out cells as well as Nrf1 knock-out cells. Although DDI2 knock-out cells tended to be more sensitive to bortezomib than DDI2 wild-type knock-in cells, the effect was not significant. Also, at least in our hands, Nrf1 knock-out, which has been shown to increase bortezomib sensitivity, did not confer significant sensitivity to bortezomib in HCT116 cells. As it is known that contribution of Nrf1 on proteasome expression depends on cell types, the results might not be generalized. We also examined whether a synergistic effect of bortezomib and LPV or NFV was observed in DDI2 knock-out or Nrf1 knock-out cells. The synergistic effect was slightly decreased but still observed in both cell lines. Thus, the HIV protease inhibitor could inhibit Nrf1 processing via DDI2 as suggested in our previous Figure 4B. However, since the decrease in the synergistic effect was so modest that we cannot conclude that synergistic cytotoxicity in combination treatment with bortezomib is mainly caused by Nrf1 or DDI2. Accordingly, we deleted sentences regarding Figure 4 in the revised manuscript."

However, Nrf1 was also decreased in combination treatment with bortezomib and 1 \u03bcM lopinavir, though cell death was not induced in this condition. This effect was not observed in co-treatment with bortezomib and nelfinavir, suggesting that this was an off-target effect of lopinavir.
