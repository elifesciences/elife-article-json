These cell classes play key roles in regulating local circuit operations and rhythmogenesis by releasing GABA in precise temporal patterns onto distinct domains of principal cells. In this study, we show that each of the three major PV cell classes further splits into functionally distinct sub-classes during fast network events in vivo. During the slower (&lt;10 Hz) theta oscillations, each cell class exhibited its own characteristic, relatively uniform firing behavior. However, during faster (&gt;90 Hz) oscillations, within-class differences in PV interneuron discharges emerged, which segregated along specific features of dendritic structure or somatic location. Functional divergence of PV sub-classes during fast but not slow network oscillations effectively doubles the repertoire of spatio-temporal patterns of GABA release available for rapid circuit operations."

These cell classes play key roles in regulating local circuit operations and rhythmogenesis by releasing GABA in precise temporal patterns onto distinct domains of principal cells. In this study, we show that each of the three major PV cell classes further splits into functionally distinct sub-classes during fast network events in vivo. During the slower (&lt;10 Hz) theta oscillations, each cell class exhibited its own characteristic, relatively uniform firing behavior. However, during faster (&gt;90 Hz) oscillations, within-class differences in PV interneuron discharges emerged, which segregated along specific features of dendritic structure or somatic location. Functional divergence of PV sub-classes during fast but not slow network oscillations effectively doubles the repertoire of spatio-temporal patterns of GABA release available for rapid circuit operations."

The spatio-temporal control of principal cell assemblies during endogenous brain rhythms is orchestrated by GABAergic interneurons (<a href=\"#bib78\">Soltesz, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Somogyi et al., 2014</a>). Versatility and precision in the GABAergic coordination of principal cell excitability arise from the diversity of interneurons that enables the selective timing of GABAergic inputs to specific spatial domains of principal cells. Within the CA1 region of the rodent hippocampus, 21 distinct interneuronal classes are currently recognized, each possessing unique input\u2013output connectivity patterns, developmental profiles, and characteristic molecular and electrophysiological properties (<a href=\"#bib47\">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</a>). The distinct features of interneuronal classes enable these cells to be selectively recruited to entrain principal cell populations into different oscillatory patterns of activity, including the theta, gamma, epsilon, and ripple waves that are associated with specific behaviors (<a href=\"#bib60\">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Soltesz and Deschenes, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Buzsaki and Chrobak, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Colgin and Moser, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maier et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "The parvalbumin expressing (PV) interneurons, in particular, have been identified to serve major mechanistic roles in a variety of network functions, including local circuit operations, learning and memory, rhythmogenesis, sensory processing, and critical period plasticity (<a href=\"#bib69\">Pouille and Scanziani, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Buzsaki and Wang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kuhlman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</a>). Furthermore, PV cells have also been linked to a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ogiwara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gibson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Verret et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Trouche et al., 2013</a>). A key property of PV cells is speed; indeed, these interneurons can fire fast action potentials at high frequencies with little accommodation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kawaguchi, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buhl et al., 1996</a>), possess fast membrane time constants, and release GABA with high temporal precision following the arrival of presynaptic action potentials at the release sites, enabling PV cells to serve as the rapid signaling elements of interneuronal\u2013principal cell networks (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartos et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Jonas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hu et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, PV cells are known to sharply segregate into three major classes that are differentiated based on the distinct post-synaptic domains that they innervate (<a href=\"#bib47\">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</a>). Axo-axonic (chandelier) cells (AACs) make synaptic contacts exclusively on the axon initial segments of principal cells (<a href=\"#bib80\">Somogyi, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Somogyi et al., 1983</a>). In contrast, basket cells (BCs) innervate the somata and proximal dendrites of the target cells, whereas the bistratified (Bistrat) cells provide GABAergic inputs to the basal and apical dendritic domains (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buhl et al., 1994</a>). In spite of the key functional importance of these specialized rapid signaling elements within the network, our understanding of the cellular sources of GABA from PV cells during fast network oscillations in vivo without anesthesia remains limited. For example, although AACs have received a lot of attention as playing major roles in the synchronization of principal cell populations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Howard et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Szabadics et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Woodruff et al., 2010</a>), to date only a single AAC has been reported from the CA1 region under non-anesthetized in vivo conditions (<a href=\"#bib93\">Viney et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, in spite of a series of recent studies examining anatomically and immunocytochemically identified (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lapray et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Varga et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Viney et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Katona et al., 2014</a>) or optogenetically \u2018tagged\u2019 interneurons in vivo without anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib70\">Royer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>), there are no data on the preferential phase-specific discharges of AACs and Bistrat cells during high-frequency (&gt;90 Hz) oscillations in vivo in awake animals."

The cells were recorded using juxtacellular techniques (<a href=\"#bib68\">Pinault, 1996</a>) that enabled the non-invasive recording (i.e., without disturbance of the intracellular milieu of the recorded neuron), high-fidelity labeling, and rigorous post-hoc identification of single cells. In addition to providing new insights into the precise patterns of discharges by AACs and Bistrat cells during brain state-dependent rhythms of the hippocampus, we report that during fast, but not slow, network oscillations each of the three major PV interneuron class splits into two functionally distinct sub-classes that segregate according to characteristic morphological properties. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanisms of hippocampal oscillations and describe a unique form of functional fission of previously established PV cell classes that effectively doubles the available repertoire of spatio-temporal patterns of GABA release during rapid circuit operations."

A summary of the n = 27 PV cells, including the immunocytochemical tests and EM verification used for each cell, is presented in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Axons of the BCs were largely confined to the stratum pyramidale, where they formed synapses on the somata and proximal dendrites of PCs. Electron microscopic verification of somatic axonal targets of BCs was performed in n = 4 cells. In contrast, the dendritically projecting Bistrat cells had the majority of their axons in the stratum radiatum and some in the stratum oriens. Since the axons of Bistrat cells avoided the stratum pyramidale, the axons provided a feature of Bistrat cells that clearly distinguished them from the other two cell classes. The AACs projected to the stratum pyramidale, where they formed synapses exclusively on the axon initial segments. The targets of n = 5 AACs were identified at the EM level (number of boutons examined: 11, 10, 10, 8, 4, all synapsing on axon initial segments). Out of the two AACs not tested at the EM level, one AAC was tested for ankyrinG, a marker for axon initial segments (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</a>). The axon terminals of the tested AACs were found to be in close juxtaposition with ankyrinG immunopositive profiles (not shown). The remaining AAC was tested for the expression of special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1), because SATB1 is expressed in BCs and Bistrat cells but not in AACs (<a href=\"#bib93\">Viney et al., 2013</a>). As expected, the AAC was found to be immunonegative for SATB1 (not shown)."

Accordingly, theta (5 Hz\u201310 Hz), gamma (25 Hz\u201390 Hz), and epsilon (90 Hz\u2013130 Hz) oscillations were studied during running, whereas ripples (90 Hz\u2013200 Hz) occurred during rest."

Epsilon is distinct from other high frequency oscillations in terms of generation mechanisms and location. Specifically, epsilon oscillations reflect network events generated locally in CA1 (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schomburg et al., 2014</a>), and most pyramidal cells (PCs) show strong phase locking to the trough of the epsilon oscillations, indicating large synchrony of PC discharges during these events (<a href=\"#bib6\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schomburg et al., 2014</a>). Another important point regarding the nomenclature of fast rhythms is that our running-associated epsilon oscillations are similar, but not identical, to the high gamma oscillations recorded during theta in other studies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Csicsvari et al., 1999a</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Canolty et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>), because these latter studies employed a generally wider frequency band for detecting high gamma oscillations compared to our filter setting for epsilon."

However, because the non-theta-associated 90 Hz\u2013140 Hz and 140 Hz\u2013200 Hz fast oscillations during rest can appear under similar behavioral conditions, share similar generation mechanism, and differ mostly in the strength of incoming CA3 input (<a href=\"#bib84\">Sullivan et al., 2011</a>), for the purposes of the current study we considered them together under the collective term \u2018ripples\u2019 (90 Hz\u2013200 Hz). This approach avoids the sorting of events according to a sharp 140 Hz boundary into 90\u2013140 Hz or 140 Hz\u2013200 Hz oscillations and still allows the comparative study of the firing of interneurons during transient events that fall towards the lower- vs higher-end of the continuum of 90 Hz\u2013200 Hz oscillations (see below)."

While every cell showed theta modulation of its firing (p &lt; 0.001 for all cells, Rayleigh test), the strength of theta modulation differed between the three cell classes. Specifically, AACs showed the most prominent theta modulation, followed by the intermediate level of modulation of the BCs, whereas Bistrat cells were only weakly modulated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Statistical analysis of the strength of theta modulation of action potential discharges revealed significant differences between the three cell classes (modulation strength, from the highest to low: AACs: r = 0.44 \u00b1 0.1; BCs: r = 0.25 \u00b1 0.1; Bistrat cells: r = 0.17 \u00b1 0.05; p &lt; 0.01; Kruskal\u2013Wallis test; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Thus, AACs did not preferentially fire close to the theta peak during running, as they were reported to do so under anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib45\">Klausberger et al., 2003</a>). The preferential discharges of the AACs during the theta cycle were followed by the BCs that fired on average during the late descending phase (310\u00b0 \u00b1 23\u00b0), while Bistrat cells discharged near the trough (0\u00b0 \u00b1 17\u00b0), around the time that the mean preferential discharges of most PCs take place (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mizuseki et al., 2011</a>). These data suggest that the different PV interneuron classes deliver GABA in a sequential manner along the long (axon initial segment\u2013somato-dendritic) axis of the CA1 PCs, and that the bulk of this spatio-temporally organized inhibition sweeps through the PC populations from the axon initial segment to the dendrites within about 40 ms during running-associated theta (calculated for an average, 8 Hz theta rhythm)."

As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> for the AACs, BCs, and Bistrat cells, there was a high degree of within-class uniformity in how members of these three cell groups discharged during theta oscillations. On the other hand, it should also be noted that even though the AACs, BCs, and Bistrat cells comprised statistically different groups in terms of their average strength of theta modulation and phase of preferential firing, the cell clusters were close to each other in the phase vs modulation strength plot in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. Therefore, extracellularly recorded fast spiking single units (e.g., recorded with tetrodes or silicon probes) without direct anatomical identification cannot be unambiguously classified as belonging to one of these three cell classes based on the theta-related firing alone, even if the unit is identified as expressing PV (e.g., with optogenetic tagging; [<a href=\"#bib70\">Royer et al., 2012</a>])."

While the precise roles of gamma rhythm in information processing are not fully understood, there is an overall agreement that perisomatic inhibition is mechanistically important in the generation of gamma-frequency oscillations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Buzsaki and Wang, 2012</a>). Gamma oscillations appear during the falling phase of the running-associated theta rhythm (see peak gamma activity centered around 60 Hz in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interestingly, although fast spiking PV cells are important in gamma oscillations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Buzsaki and Wang, 2012</a>), not all PV cells in our recordings fired in a gamma-modulated manner (number of cells significantly modulated: BCs: 9/12; Bistrat cells: 6/8; AACs: 4/5). Furthermore, the modulation strength was only moderate (in agreement with <a href=\"#bib89\">Tukker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Varga et al., 2012</a>), and there was no difference between the perisomatically (BCs, AACs) vs dendritically (Bistrat cells) projecting PV interneurons in terms of the strength of modulation (BC: r = 0.18 \u00b1 0.07; Bistrat cells: r = 0.18 \u00b1 0.05; AAC: r = 0.17 \u00b1 0.08; p = 0.79; Kruskal\u2013Wallis test). BCs preferentially fired during the middle ascending phase of the individual gamma waves (110 \u00b1 18\u00b0), significantly earlier than the other two cell classes (p &lt; 0.01; Watson\u2013Williams test) that discharged on average during the late ascending phase (Bistrat cells: 148 \u00b1 23\u00b0) or close to the peak of the gamma oscillations (AACs: 181 \u00b1 15.4\u00b0). These data indicate that the majority of cells in each PV class was moderately modulated by gamma-frequency oscillations, and that the BCs preferentially fired earlier during the individual gamma waves compared to either the Bistrat cells or the AACs."

From the cell class-specific theta-related firing of PV interneurons described above and the relative timing of epsilon oscillations during theta, we predicted that AACs were unlikely to be strongly modulated by these running-associated high-frequency oscillations. Specifically, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> (re-plotted from the data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> to emphasize the distribution of firing probabilities during theta), the peak firing of AACs took place slightly before the peak of the epsilon oscillations (asterisk in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

Although the ripple-related firing rates of BCs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lapray et al., 2012</a>), Bistrat cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Katona et al., 2014</a>), and a single AAC (<a href=\"#bib93\">Viney et al., 2013</a>) have been reported in recent studies from the CA1 region of non-anesthetized animals, we re-examined the firing of our PV interneurons during ripple events in order to gain a better understanding of the relative firing rates, strength of modulation, and the phase-preferential firing of these three cell classes. In agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lapray et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Katona et al., 2014</a>), BCs discharged at a high rate (77 \u00b1 28 Hz) during ripple events, dramatically increasing their discharge probability (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Bistrat cells also significantly increased their discharge probabilities during ripples, but their firing frequency was about half of that of the BCs during the ripple events (36 \u00b1 16 Hz, p &lt; 0.01 with respect to BCs, Mann\u2013Whitney; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast to BCs and Bistrat cells, the AACs on average, as a group (n = 7), showed no significant changes in firing rates during ripple events (blue line in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Further analysis showed that the AACs fired the majority (68.3 \u00b1 17.3%, n = 7) of their ripple-related spikes during the beginning of the ripple events (before the ripple reached its maximal amplitude), in broad agreement with the discharge dynamics noted by <a href=\"#bib45\">Klausberger et al., 2003</a>."

Therefore, Bistrat cells were weakly modulated during the running-associated epsilon waves but strongly modulated during the rest-associated ripples (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>).

Furthermore, the data showed that whether or not a Bistrat cell fired during a ripple correlated with the oscillation frequency of the individual ripple events (i.e., with the intra-ripple or \u2018core\u2019 frequency of the LFP oscillations; these are highlighted in red in the example traces in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Namely, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>, the core frequency of the ripples when Bistrat cells discharged was significantly higher than the core frequency of those ripples during which the Bistrat cells did not discharge (mean core frequency of ripple events without Bistrat cell spikes: 122.5 \u00b1 18 Hz, n = 191 events; with spikes: 140 \u00b1 17 Hz, 347 events; n = 8 cells, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann\u2013Whitney test).

Indeed, there was no difference in the running-associated theta-related firing of C- and O-Bistrat cells in our sample either (firing frequency during theta: O-Bistrat: 34.6 \u00b1 14.7 Hz; C-Bistrat: 27.2 \u00b1 6.5 Hz; p = 0.67, Mann\u2013Whitney; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; theta phase preference: O-Bistrat: 2.6 \u00b1 14.6\u00b0; C-Bistrat: 357.6 \u00b1 12.3\u00b0; strength of modulation of firing during theta, r: O-Bistrat: 0.17 \u00b1 0.06; C-Bistrat: 0.19 \u00b1 0.04; p = 0.7, Mann\u2013Whitney). In contrast, during rest-associated ripples, O-Bistrat cells fired significantly faster than C-Bistrat cells (O-Bistrat: 44.2 \u00b1 11.0 Hz; C-Bistrat: 19.8 \u00b1 3.7 Hz; p = 0.035, Mann\u2013Whitney; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), with no differences in other aspects of ripple-related firing (phase preference: O-Bistrat: 122.41 \u00b1 6.63\u00b0; C-Bistrat: 134.07 \u00b1 10.35\u00b0; strength of modulation during ripples, r: O-Bistrat: 0.65 \u00b1 0.09; C-Bistrat: 0.57 \u00b1 0.03; p = 0.25, Mann\u2013Whitney). The different firing rates of the O-Bistrat and C-Bistrat cell sub-classes during ripples demonstrate the emergence of intra-class functional differences among Bistrat cells during fast network oscillations. In addition, the fact that O-Bistrat cells had especially high firing frequencies during ripples suggests that dendrites in the radiatum are not required for elevated levels of discharges in these cells during ripple events."

The H-BCs were clearly distinct from their more canonical counterparts (referred to as classical or C-BCs below), whose somata were located within the PC layer and the C-BCs had vertically oriented dendrites that spanned across the oriens to the radiatum, with branches extending into the lacunosum-moleculare layer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Given that the canonical property of PV cells is their uniquely rapid signaling capability (<a href=\"#bib59\">Norenberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chiovini et al., 2014</a>), our focus was on the fast (&gt;90 Hz) oscillations. Since the epsilon rhythm occurs embedded within the theta oscillations, we first analyzed the discharge patterns of PV interneurons during theta waves. The data showed that the AACs fired with the strongest theta modulation. Unlike AACs from anesthetized rats (<a href=\"#bib45\">Klausberger et al., 2003</a>), AACs in our awake head-fixed mice clearly did not fire with the highest probability close to the peak of theta rhythm (180\u00b0), but in fact discharged at 251\u00b0 (the 71\u00b0 difference corresponds to a 25 ms delay for an average, 8 Hz theta with a cycle duration of 125 ms). Although inter-species differences cannot be ruled out, the one AAC previously reported from the CA1 of non-anesthetized freely moving rats in the literature also discharged well after the theta peak (at 225\u00b0) (<a href=\"#bib93\">Viney et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that all of the 20 optogenetically tagged PV cells in a recent study conducted in freely moving mice discharged during the descending phase of the theta rhythm and none fired preferentially at the peak (<a href=\"#bib70\">Royer et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, it appears that in animals during running, the axon initial segments of PCs receive a barrage of GABA inputs from AACs during the descending phase of the theta cycle (at 251\u00b0 on average), followed by inputs from BCs onto their cell bodies and proximal dendrites about 20 ms later (at 310\u00b0), and then, with another approximately 20 ms delay on average, near the theta trough (360\u00b0 or 0\u00b0), Bistrat cells release GABA onto the basal and mid-level apical dendrites. Thus, the pattern of discharges by the three cardinal PV interneuron classes is organized to generate a spatio-temporally exquisitely orchestrated axon initial segment to somata/proximal dendrites to mid-level dendrites sweep of fast GABAergic inhibition in a relatively short time window (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, \u2018Theta\u2019)."

Second, BCs as a group also differed from the Bistrat cell and AAC classes in exhibiting the highest rates of firing during ripple events. Third, we found marked differences between Bistrat cell and BC discharges during ripples with low core frequencies, indicating that Bistrat cell-derived dendritic inhibition is only recruited during high-frequency sharp-wave ripple events.

The latter finding indicates a behavioral state-independent leadership position (referred to as primacy below) of BCs in interneuronal firing sequences during fast oscillatory cycles, extending our previous observations of a frequency-invariant temporal ordering of BC and oriens-moleculare interneuron (OLM cells project to the distal dendritic regions of CA1 PCs) discharges, where the preferred phases of firing of BCs were also significantly earlier than the mean phase of discharges by the OLM cells during both epsilon and ripple events (<a href=\"#bib91\">Varga et al., 2012</a>)."

First, Bistrat cells without dendrites in the stratum radiatum, the O-Bistrat cells, fired at significantly higher rates during ripple events than their C-Bistrat counterparts. These closely correlated morphological and physiological differences firmly establish the O-Bistrat and C-Bistrat cell groups as distinct interneuronal sub-classes and highlight the fact that intense action potential discharges during sharp-wave ripples can be generated by interneurons without dendrites in the stratum radiatum."

In addition, E-AACs showed significantly elevated frequency of action potential discharges during ripples. Third, H-BCs fired more intensely during ripples and discharged more doublets of action potentials during individual ripple cycles than the C-BCs. Differences in somatic layer position, in conjunction with significant physiological differences, qualify these distinct AACs and BCs as separate, novel interneuronal sub-classes (note that layer-specific location together with differential spiking behaviors in vivo was also used as the basis of the differentiation of a previously unified cell class into neurogliaform and ivy cell sub-classes [<a href=\"#bib32\">Fuentealba et al., 2008</a>]). Importantly, these newly identified differentially discharging PV sub-classes are likely to be not negligible in terms of their abundance, as the population of PV interneurons in the stratum oriens has been estimated to be about 30% of the number of PV cells within the stratum pyramidale (in 1000s: BCs: 1.3/3.9; Bistrat cells: 0.5/1.6; AACs: 0.3/1) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</a>).

Among the circuitry related differences that may contribute to the functional splitting of the PV classes during fast oscillations, it is interesting to consider the potential role of the primacy of the BCs discussed above. What consequences would the consistently early firing of BCs during cycles of fast network oscillations have on the excitability of the other PV cells? One clue to this question may be related to the fact that BCs are known to synapse not only on PCs but also on the other PV expressing cells as well (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cobb et al., 1997</a>). A second potential clue is that BC axons are largely confined to the stratum pyramidale (<a href=\"#bib36\">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Foldy et al., 2007</a>), thus, PV cells whose cell bodies and proximal dendrites are located outside the PC layer will be in a privileged position to escape inhibition from BCs. A third relevant point is that our data showed that the average phase-preferential discharges of Bistrat cells, and the two epsilon and ripple-modulated AACs in our sample, were delayed by about 1.4 ms (calculated for a 140-Hz ripple) with respect to the mean phase of firing by BCs during fast network events, a period of time that is approximately a monosynaptic delay. Therefore, firing of BCs early during each ripple cycle is expected to deliver synaptic inhibition to other BCs as well as to AACs and Bistrat cells. The inhibition to other BCs would arrive after the BCs fired their first action potentials, thus, it can only prevent the firing of subsequent action potentials by BCs during each individual ripple cycle. Indeed, although BCs are known to be able to fire at 100s of Hz with little or no accommodation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kawaguchi, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buhl et al., 1996</a>), most BCs fired only a single spike per ripple cycle. The exceptions were precisely those BCs whose cell bodies were outside of the PC layer (and thus largely outside of the BC axonal cloud) the H-BCs, which discharged at higher intra-ripple frequencies and fired frequent doublets during ripple cycles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The early firing of BCs is expected to inhibit the later-discharging AACs and Bistrat cells as well, likely contributing to their relatively lower frequencies of firing during ripples. However, AACs whose cell bodies are outside of the PC body layer would be predicted to be able to largely escape the BC-derived inhibition, which is consistent with our observation that such E-AACs significantly increased their firing rates during ripple events (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). While future studies will be needed to identify the precise factors shaping the temporal ordering of interneuronal discharges, the early firing of BCs during fast network events is likely to differentially regulate the excitability of those interneurons whose cell bodies are located inside vs outside the termination zone of BC axons."

Nevertheless, even though only a single cell was attempted to be juxtacellularly labeled in each animal, the database of PV cells presented in this paper is the largest collection of anatomically and immunocytochemically identified fast-spiking cells that have been recorded from non-anesthetized animals in vivo to date. Interneurons are a minority (estimated to be 38,500/349,500 or about 11%) of the total CA1 neuron population, and PV cells comprise approximately a quarter of the interneurons in the CA1 (9200/38,500, 23.9%) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</a>). Among the PV cell classes, BCs are estimated to be the most numerous (14% of all CA1 interneurons), followed by the Bistrat cells (6%) and the AACs (4%) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baude et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</a>).

Nevertheless, our results also highlight new criteria that may now be employed. For example, although a hypothetical extracellularly recorded unit that increases its firing during sharp-wave ripples may involve any of the three major PV classes, BCs and AACs can be sharply distinguished based on the strength of epsilon modulation of their firing (note that all BCs were strongly epsilon modulated, whereas AACs were weakly or not significantly modulated). Similarly, Bistrat cells can be distinguished from BCs based on their phase-preferential firing during theta and ripples, in combination with their modulation during epsilon waves. Such insights are important in light of the fact that numerous studies have been conducted using extracellular unit recordings from freely moving animals using tetrodes and silicon probes, and post-hoc analysis of existing data may now be attempted to dissect the role of specific PV cell populations in particular behavioral tasks."

After neurobiotin labeling of the recorded interneurons (1.5\u20132% in 0.5 M NaCl in the juxtacellular electrode [<a href=\"#bib68\">Pinault, 1996</a>]), the experiments were terminated and the animals were perfused within 4 hr under deep anesthesia.

The brains were cut into 60-\u03bcm thick sections with a vibratome. Neurobiotin was first visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and samples including soma/dendrite/axons were selected for further immunohistochemical analysis. Specific protein expressions were checked with the help of the following antibodies: rabbit anti-PV (Swant, Switzerland), mouse anti-PV (Sigma-Aldrich, Carlsbad, CA), rat anti-somatostatin (Millipore, Temecula, CA), goat anti-SATB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), goat anti-mGluR1a (Frontier Science Co., Ltd, Japan).

Documentation of the immunoreactivity was performed with either a CCD camera attached to a Zeiss Axioscope microscope or confocal microscopy with an Olympus FV1000 or Zeiss LSM780 microscope. Finally the neurobiotin filled cells were visualized with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), dehydrated and embedded for electron microscopy. Fully recovered cells were 3D reconstructed with Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) system using a 100\u00d7 objective (N = 1.3).

Preferred firing phase and strength of modulation during oscillations of individual cells were calculated as described earlier (<a href=\"#bib91\">Varga et al., 2012</a>) and expressed as orientation and length of vectors calculated by summing the spike phases normalized by the number of spikes. Depending on the orientations of the different phase angles, the length of the normalized vector (r) ranged from 0 (no phase preference) to 1 (all phase angles identical). This length of the vector was used to measure the magnitude of phase modulation, and the direction of r indicated the mean phase angle of the cell (<a href=\"#bib91\">Varga et al., 2012</a>). Differences between cell classes (BCs, Bistrat cells, AACs) and sub-classes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) in terms of phase locking were evaluated using Watson\u2013Williams circular test (<a href=\"#bib73\">Senior et al., 2008</a>). In order to determine whether the firing probability of a given cell was significantly lower or higher during ripples than outside ripples, simulations were performed either by randomizing the spike location (<a href=\"#bib91\">Varga et al., 2012</a>) or by shuffling the ripple location (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lasztoczi et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "The core frequency of ripple epochs was calculated with three different methods. The first method used the inverse of the averaged times between zero crossings of the ripple signal within the ripple boundaries and divided by two. The second method computed the inverse of the time between neighboring peaks of ripples within the ripple boundaries (<a href=\"#bib90\">Tukker et al., 2013</a>). The third method generated wavelet transforms on the 90\u2013200 Hz filtered LFP signal using \u2018cmor5-1\u2019 function in the Matlab Wavelet Toolbox. The peak values of the wavelet transforms were measured and counted as the core frequency (<a href=\"#bib66\">Patel et al., 2013</a>). All three methods were tested on artificial ripple events and found to show similar core frequency detection. We report our data throughout the manuscript with the wavelet method. For the analysis associated with <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, events detected on the 90\u2013200 Hz band-pass filtered LFP signals during rest were sorted based on the presence or lack of action potentials of the recorded Bistrat and BC cells. Core frequencies of events with or without spikes were statistically compared with Wilcoxon signed rank test. With the exception of the inset in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation."

It might be helpful to point this out in your revised submission, and also to provide more complete information on the given cells, perhaps in a table (see 1st point of reviewer#1, and 1st point of reviewer#2). Second, it was felt that additional analyses needed to be done which considered gamma (see 3rd point of reviewer#3 below) and in general, clarity and explanation about frequency ranges of analyses (see 3rd point of reviewer #2, 2nd point of reviewer #3), as well as wording consistency (see 1st point of reviewer#2). It is suggested that the authors could start by specifying the ranges considered based on what criteria (what previous works, why etc.). It is recognized that it is confusing in the literature and people use different ranges and terminology for theta, gamma, ripple etc., but the reviewers urge the authors not to add to the confusion in the literature, and present analyses accordingly. Third, the reviewers request that more explanations be provided in the revised work, and that it would be helpful to include schematic figures to summarize results and speculations presented (see 2nd and 3rd points of reviewer#1, 1st and 2nd points of reviewer#2 and first point of reviewer#3)."

In this work, the authors do this, considering phase and firing of identified interneurons during oscillatory activities in vivo. Juxtacellular recordings are used in head-fixed mice, allowing long, stable recordings. From this perspective, sub-classes of fast-spiking PV+ interneurons are noted with particular morphological differences. The results are clearly described and the long discussion is helpful in putting the work in perspective. However, I have some comments."

One important and new observation is, that one subpopulation of PV-expressing basket cells (BCs) with soma location in the stratum oriens generates action potentials during ripple activity at higher frequencies than the remaining PV-BC types. The authors argue that this sub-population is in the privileged position to escape from periosmatic inhibition provided by other PV-BCs with soma and axon in the principal cell layer and thereby provide perisomatic inhibition to the CA1 circuitry, including other PV-interneurons. The authors further argue that this is reflected in the delay of only 1.4 ms between the discharge of the privileged PV-BC sub-population and the other PV cells. Although this prediction is indeed acceptable, its functional significance or relevance on network function or encoding of information is not well addressed and leaves the reader with the open question 'what is it good for?' The other new finding of the study is that a sub-population of axo-axonic cells (AACs) with soma location in the stratum oriens discharge during ripple activity."

This is an interesting observation; however, a major concern is the low number (two) of recorded and identified AACs which form the basis of this conclusion. A generalization of morphologically and functionally driven sub-classifications of AACs is therefore highly speculative. A further main and more general criticism relates to the quality of the written results section. Too many text passages are included in brackets which could easily be included in the flow of the main body of the text. Makes reading a bit clumsy. Moreover, inconsistencies in the usage of abbreviations and not necessary figure legends included in the main body of the text makes the reading of the manuscript at its present stage less accessible."

A clear definition at some point is therefore needed. More critical is however the sub-classification of AACs with soma location in stratum oriens on a very small sample (2 cells; see above). In order to improve the validity of the subdivision of AACs, a higher number of identified cells would be urgently needed. The observed difference in their activity in comparison to AACs with axon in the principal cell layer during ripple oscillations indicates that they receive different excitatory inputs. This is discussed by the authors. A parallel set of experiments (in vitro) would be helpful to directly test this hypothesis and to prove whether the two subsets of AACs receive different total excitatory inputs (spontaneous EPSCs, evoked responses). Finally, additional values on the intrinsic properties of the two AAC subclasses as well as more detailed morphological characteristics such as total dendritic and axonal length as provided for the two bistratified cell sub-classes would be important to possibly strengthen the proposed functional sub-classification. This could be done under in vitro conditions."

One explanation regarding the sub-classes in respect to PC innervation is that they may innervate different sub-classes of PCs (superficial versus deep PCs). This is an interesting hypothesis which the authors could have addressed in order to strengthen the functional significance of the various interneuron sub-classes. Again, this could be done under in vitro conditions."

In fact, none of the interneurons recorded in this or an earlier study (<a href=\"#bib91\">Varga et. al, 2012</a>) shows any ripple-inhibited neurons.

Panel B illustrates the firing probabilities of the 6 PV subclasses during ripples, including the doublets discharged by the H-BCs, highlighting the elevated ripple-related firing by the interneuronal subclasses located outside of the stratum pyramidale and the BC axonal cloud (H-BCs and E-AACs), and by the Bistrat cells that lack dendrites in the stratum radiatum (O-Bistrats). While at the moment we cannot offer a full mechanistic understanding of the patterning of discharges by the PV classes and subclasses during the various oscillations, we put forward a mechanistic hypothesis that proposes that cells with somata outside the stratum pyramidale escape inhibition from BCs and thus fire more than their counterparts in the stratum pyramidale.

In order to improve the validity of the subdivision of AACs, a higher number of identified cells would be urgently needed. The observed difference in their activity in comparison to AACs with axon in the principal cell layer during ripple oscillations indicates that they receive different excitatory inputs. This is discussed by the authors. A parallel set of experiments (in vitro) would be helpful to directly test this hypothesis and to prove whether the two subsets of AACs receive different total excitatory inputs (spontaneous EPSCs, evoked responses). Finally, additional values on the intrinsic properties of the two AAC subclasses as well as more detailed morphological characteristics such as total dendritic and axonal length as provided for the two bistratified cell sub-classes would be important to possibly strengthen the proposed functional sub-classification.

We have now included a sentence in the Discussion about potential functional relevance of basket cell doublets in synchrony (Traub et al., Nature 1996; the suggestion in the latter paper was that the doublet interval acts as a local circuit time constant that can match approximately the conduction delay between spatially separated circuits, and although the Traub paper focused on gamma, the mechanism, at least in principle, may be generalizable to faster, more local rhythms as well). With regards to the superficial versus deep PC question, we agree that this is a very interesting topic (Lee/Soltesz Neuron 2014) and we comment on the possibility that the various PV subclasses may be differentially involved in these subcircuits.

We described the latter findings in a revised sentence: \u201cFurther analysis showed that the AACs fired the majority (68.3+-17.3%, n=7) of their ripple-related spikes during the beginning of the ripple events (before the ripple reached its maximal amplitude), in broad agreement with the discharge dynamics noted by Klausberger et al., 2003\u201d.
