Protein chaperones promote native folding of nascent polypeptides and refolding of misfolded species, thereby buffering mutations that compromise protein structure and function. Here, we show that RNA chaperones can also act as mutation buffers that enhance organismal fitness. Using competition assays, we demonstrate that overexpression of select RNA chaperones, including three DEAD box RNA helicases (DBRHs) (CsdA, SrmB, RhlB) and the cold shock protein CspA, improves fitness of two independently evolved <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutator strains that have accumulated deleterious mutations during short- and long-term laboratory evolution. We identify strain-specific mutations that are deleterious and subject to buffering when introduced individually into the ancestral genotype. For DBRHs, we show that buffering requires helicase activity, implicating RNA structural remodelling in the buffering process. Our results suggest that RNA chaperones might play a fundamental role in RNA evolution and evolvability."

Protein chaperones promote native folding of nascent polypeptides and refolding of misfolded species, thereby buffering mutations that compromise protein structure and function. Here, we show that RNA chaperones can also act as mutation buffers that enhance organismal fitness. Using competition assays, we demonstrate that overexpression of select RNA chaperones, including three DEAD box RNA helicases (DBRHs) (CsdA, SrmB, RhlB) and the cold shock protein CspA, improves fitness of two independently evolved <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutator strains that have accumulated deleterious mutations during short- and long-term laboratory evolution. We identify strain-specific mutations that are deleterious and subject to buffering when introduced individually into the ancestral genotype. For DBRHs, we show that buffering requires helicase activity, implicating RNA structural remodelling in the buffering process. Our results suggest that RNA chaperones might play a fundamental role in RNA evolution and evolvability."

Briefly, an <i>E. coli</i> strain propagated under conditions of weak selection is expected to accumulate deleterious mutations and experience a concomitant decline in fitness compared with its ancestor. Similarly, strains adapting to a novel environment will accumulate not only beneficial but also deleterious mutations, which may hitchhike along with beneficial alleles and can be exposed as deleterious in the old environment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fares et al., 2002</a>). In both scenarios, buffering can be inferred if (over)expression of a candidate chaperone leads to a greater fitness gain in the low-fitness evolved strain compared with its ancestor. We therefore performed pairwise competition experiments (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lenski, 1991</a>) between the <i>E. coli</i> REL606 strain, which is the ancestor of the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE), and two evolved <i>mutS</i> mutator strains that were sampled from a lineage after \u223c20,000 (20k) and \u223c40,000 (40k) generations of adaptation to a minimal glucose-limited medium (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sniegowski et al., 1997</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Performing 24-hr competitions in the alternative LB medium, we observed reduced fitness relative to the REL606 ancestor for the 40k but not for the 20k genotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Reduced fitness in the 40k strain cannot be proximately attributed to the <i>mutS</i> mutation, which underlies the mutator phenotype; this mutation arose \u223c3000 generations into the LTEE (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sniegowski et al., 1997</a>) and is already present in the 20k strain.

To explore mechanistic diversity in buffering, we considered the cold shock protein CspA. By binding with low specificity to single-stranded RNA, CspA can prevent the formation of unwanted secondary structure and thereby narrow the RNA folding landscape (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang and Hou, 1997</a>)\u2014a mechanism of action reminiscent of the ubiquitous protein chaperone DnaK (Hsp70), which cycles on and off nascent polypeptide chains to allow ordered stepwise folding (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hartl et al., 2011</a>). We found that overexpression of CspA is associated with fitness gains in both low-fitness genotypes but not in the corresponding ancestral strains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). By contrast, overexpression of a mutant version of CspA with severely reduced nucleic acid-binding activity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hilier et al., 1998</a>) did not confer fitness benefits upon overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

In particular, we wanted to know whether mutations in <i>lamB</i> and <i>rplS</i> stand out amongst other mutations in their predicted effect on RNA structure. Several metrics that quantify mutational impact on RNA secondary structure do indeed suggest comparatively severe effects for <i>rplS</i><sup><i>syn</i></sup> (e.g., the correlation of base pairing probabilities, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Similarly, of all the mutations in the evolved \u0394<i>mutH</i> strain, the <i>lamB</i> mutation is predicted to have the most severe repercussions for local RNA structure as measured by maximum local base pair distance (<i>d</i><sub><i>max</i></sub>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, these correlates should be interpreted with caution. Existing measures of RNA structural change, however accurate, will only indicate how disruptive a given mutation is to the RNA structure but not whether the resulting defect can be rescued by chaperone activity, or whether it matters at the organismal level. Consequently, we would not necessarily anticipate a robust relationship between fitness loss, buffering, and indicators of RNA structural change. More mundanely, we cannot quantify the reliability of any (structural) predictor without a larger set of experimentally characterized mutations that are both deleterious and amenable to buffering. In short, while suggestive, these findings do not conclusively implicate RNA structure as the vehicle for fitness loss."

Considering <i>lamB</i>, one possibility is that an increase in local stability caused by the mutation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) introduces a translational roadblock that is resolved by RNA chaperone activity. Alternatively, one might envisage a more complex scenario, where the non-synonymous <i>lamB</i> mutation gives rise to a dominant negative protein product and RNA chaperone overexpression ameliorates fitness defects by facilitating degradation of the mRNA, thus reducing levels of mutant LamB protein. Both of these mechanisms are speculative, and endorsing either one (or a third or fourth option) would be premature. Rather, competing mechanistic hypotheses will have to be confirmed or debunked through targeted follow-up experiments. For example, a logical first step to eliminate one of the hypotheses above would be to measure LamB levels (predicted to increase and decrease upon chaperone overexpression, respectively). In designing insightful follow-up studies, a few issues deserve wider consideration."

Conversely, synonymous mutations can affect translation kinetics and protein folding (<a href=\"#bib25\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>) and therefore have fitness repercussions at the protein level. As a corollary, some mutations might be amenable to buffering by both protein and RNA chaperones. For example, the former might rescue misfolded proteins, whereas the latter removes translational roadblocks that predispose to misfolding.

Here, we used DBRH mutants in which the central glutamic acid residue has been recoded to yield lysine, a change known to abolish RhlB ATPase activity, which is required for helicase activity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Vanzo et al., 1998</a>). Mutations in the nucleic acid-binding domain of CspA were previously evaluated for their impact on both nucleic acid binding and protein stability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hilier et al., 1998</a>). The F20L mutation was found to only weakly affect protein stability but strongly reduce nucleic acid binding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hilier et al., 1998</a>) and was therefore chosen for our study. Plasmids carrying the mutated genes were constructed by and purchased from DNA2.0."

To detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short indels, paired end reads were first aligned to the reference genome (NC000913) using bwa mem (version 0.7.6a, arXiv:1303.3997). Subsequently, duplicate reads were removed using samtools (version 0.1.19), and only those with non-zero mapping quality and no suboptimal alignments were considered further. SNPs and indels were then called using the mpileup function in samtools, requiring a minimum base quality of 30. Mutations were validated by visual inspection of read mappings in the Integrated Genome Viewer. Non-reference alleles had to be present at a frequency of p &gt; 0.75 to be considered bona fide mutations. To ensure that we did not miss pertinent SNPs/indels in non-unique regions present in structural RNAs, we repeated the above procedure without filters on mapping quality and including suboptimal alignments. We identified no additional candidate mutations. Screening for larger deletions and duplications was performed by computing per-base coverage using the genomeCoverageBed function in bedtools (version 2.17.0) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>), subsequent smoothing across 250bp windows, normalizing by GC content, and applying a rolling filter to control for long-range effects, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tenaillon et al., 2012</a>). This approach confirmed the <i>mutH</i> deletion in the mutator strain. We found no other large deletions. Similarly, no duplications were detected after visually inspecting neighbouring regions with unusual differences in coverage (&gt;1.5-fold). All candidate regions were found to be due to local drop-offs in neighbouring regions rather than excess coverage in focal windows. For REL606-derived strains, candidate genomic differences compared with the ancestral genome were identified using the PALOMA (<a href=\"#bib37\">Vallenet et al., 2012</a>) and BRESEQ (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barrick et al., 2009</a>) pipelines. Sequencing data for the MG1655-derived strains and the 20k strain have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (accession no. PRJEB7107). Sequencing data for the REL606-derived 40k clone was previously deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (accession no. SRR1536189)."

Briefly, we designed single-stranded oligonucleotides, \u223c70 nt in length, that were complementary to the region of interest and carried the desired point mutation (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a>). They were transformed by electroporation into the TB56 (Ara+) and TB62 (Ara\u2212) strains supplemented with pSIM6. In both TB56 and TB62 (kindly provided by Tobias Bergmiller), the native <i>mutS</i> promoter has been replaced with an <i>ara</i> promoter. In the presence of 0.2% arabinose, the strains have wild-type MutS levels, whereas in the presence of 0.2% glucose, MutS expression is repressed. Growing strains in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose therefore increases the likelihood that oligo-born mutations are fixed due to impaired mismatch repair. Following electroporation, cells were grown overnight at 32\u00b0C on LB agar plates supplemented with 0.2% arabinose, and the presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing target regions from individual colonies on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer using the Big Dye Terminator 1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

As alluded to above, making systematic computational predictions here is non-trivial. First, neither strain bore mutations in known structural RNAs (also see point 1 below), so we lacked obvious candidates for buffering. In fact, all mutations in the evolved \u0394<i>mutH</i> strain were located in coding regions of nonessential genes, where it is difficult to assess the biological significance of RNA structural change. Second, existing computational tools can model mutational effects on RNA secondary structure, but provide no insight into whether a given mutation can be rescued by RNA chaperones. Third, it is not obvious how to extrapolate from molecular fitness, i.e. how disruptive a mutation is at the RNA structural level, to organismal fitness. For example, a relatively small change in structure in a highly expressed gene might matter more than a strongly disruptive mutation in a gene that is not even expressed. Given the likely complex determinants of whether rescue can occur, we would have needed a much larger set of deleterious mutations amenable to buffering to train and validate a predictive algorithm. Thus, while we provide multiple metrics of RNA structural change (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary Files 1-3</a>), some of which do indeed suggest that the deleterious mutations we identify are associated with structural change of above average severity, we believe that these correlations should be treated with a healthy amount of caution. This is why we opted to pursue the systematic experimental approach described above."

This demonstrates that, in both evolved strains, there are mutations that have fitness-relevant effects during the early growth phases (up to mid-exponential). Second, 40k/evolved <i>\u0394mutH</i> strains that overexpress one of the RNA chaperones outcompete strains of the same genotype that carry an empty control plasmid, suggesting that mutations with early-growth-phase relevance are being buffered by chaperone overexpression. For most chaperone/genotype combinations there are quantitative differences in relative fitness after 2h and 24h, consistent with the possibility that differential survival during later growth can further exacerbate or ameliorate fitness differences. It is interesting to note that buffering in the evolved <i>\u0394mutH</i> strain is consistently stronger after 24h whereas the picture is more variable in the 40k strain. We suggest (in the Results and Discussion section) this might reflect a larger number of contributory mutations in the 40k strain. This suggestion is further supported by the observation that competitions involving the isolated <i>lamB</i> mutation broadly replicate overall trends for the evolved <i>\u0394mutH</i> strain (i.e. smaller fitness differences in exponential phase), in line with this mutation being a strong contributor to overall fitness effects. In contrast, fitness effects of the <i>rplS</i> mutation introduced in isolation into the ancestor of the 40k strain does not track overall fitness patterns for this strain, again consistent with the presence of multiple fitness-relevant mutations in this strain."

However, it is important to highlight that finding a mutation to be non-synonymous does not automatically disqualify it from consideration as causing an issue at the level of RNA structure. Both synonymous and non-synonymous sites affect mRNA folding. It simply places a heavier burden of proof on future experiments to show that either the effect on protein sequence is irrelevant or that it is relevant but buffering nonetheless mediated at the RNA level (as in a hypothetical scenario where the mutation has a dominant negative effect on the protein but RNA chaperone overexpression leads to beneficial degradation). We discuss these issues in the revised manuscript."
