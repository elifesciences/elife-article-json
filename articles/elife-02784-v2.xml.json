In this study, we report a connection between the cytoplasmic domain of TANGO1 and SLY1, a protein that is required for membrane fusion. Knockdown of SLY1 by siRNA arrested Procollagen VII in the ER without affecting the recruitment of COPII components, general protein secretion, and retrograde transport of the KDEL-containing protein BIP, and ERGIC53. SLY1 is known to interact with the ER-specific SNARE proteins Syntaxin 17 and 18, however only Syntaxin 18 was required for Procollagen VII export. Neither SLY1 nor Syntaxin 18 was required for the export of the equally bulky Procollagen I from the ER. Altogether, these findings reveal the sorting of bulky collagen family members by TANGO1 at the ER and highlight the existence of different export pathways for secretory cargoes one of which is mediated by the specific SNARE complex containing SLY1 and Syntaxin 18."

In this study, we report a connection between the cytoplasmic domain of TANGO1 and SLY1, a protein that is required for membrane fusion. Knockdown of SLY1 by siRNA arrested Procollagen VII in the ER without affecting the recruitment of COPII components, general protein secretion, and retrograde transport of the KDEL-containing protein BIP, and ERGIC53. SLY1 is known to interact with the ER-specific SNARE proteins Syntaxin 17 and 18, however only Syntaxin 18 was required for Procollagen VII export. Neither SLY1 nor Syntaxin 18 was required for the export of the equally bulky Procollagen I from the ER. Altogether, these findings reveal the sorting of bulky collagen family members by TANGO1 at the ER and highlight the existence of different export pathways for secretory cargoes one of which is mediated by the specific SNARE complex containing SLY1 and Syntaxin 18."

There are at least 28 different kinds of collagens, composed of homo or hetero trimers of polypeptide chains coiled around each other to form a triple helix (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shoulders and Raines, 2009</a>). These unbendable triple helices, which can be up to 450 nm long, as in the case of Collagen VII, are too big to fit into the conventional transport carriers of the secretory pathway that have been identified thus far (<a href=\"#bib23\">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011</a>). How are these bulky proteins exported from the ER?"

A protein called TANGO1 has been identified for its requirement in the export of Procollagen VII (PC VII) from the ER in tissue culture cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2009</a>). The knockout of TANGO1 in mice results in the production of a pup that dies at birth due to defective bone mineralization. The cause is a block in the secretion of multiple collagens needed for the differentiation of chondrocytes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wilson et al., 2011</a>). TANGO1 is also required for collagen secretion in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lerner et al., 2013</a>). TANGO1 binds PC VII via its SH3 domain in the lumen of the ER (<a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2009</a>). On the cytoplasmic side, TANGO1 binds cTAGE5 and both these proteins contain a proline rich domain that interacts with the COPII components SEC23/24 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>). We have proposed that binding of PC VII to TANGO1 in the lumen promotes the binding of TANGO1's proline rich domain to SEC23/24. This retards the recruitment of SEC13/31 to SEC23/24 and thus delays the events leading to the biogenesis of the COPII vesicle (<a href=\"#bib23\">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011</a>). Upon growth to a size that is large enough to encapsulate PC VII, TANGO1 dissociates from both PC VII and SEC23/24. The binding of SEC13/31 to SEC23/24 completes the assembly of COPII components on a patch of the ER. These events then lead to the export of PC VII, presumably in a mega carrier from the ER (<a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>). Ubiquitination of SEC31 by the CUL3-KLHL12 ligase complex has been reported to control the exit of Procollagen I (PC I) from the ER (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Malhotra, 2012</a>). Sedlin is reported to help in the export of PC I and II from the ER by regulating the cycling of SAR1 activation state that is essential for COPII assembly at the ER (<a href=\"#bib44\">Venditti et al., 2012</a>). TANGO1 is not required for PC I export from the ER, and it is not known whether PC II export is TANGO1 dependent. Together these data indicate that COPII components are required for the export of procollagens from the ER, however, they also suggest the possibility that not all procollagens exit the ER by the same mechanism."

                        "text": "We now show the involvement of SLY1 (or SCFD1) in specific ER export events. SLY1 is a member of the STXBP/unc-18/SEC1 family of proteins that regulate the assembly or the activity of SNAREs in membrane fusion events (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carr and Rizo, 2010</a>). The yeast ortholog <i>SLY1</i>, an essential gene, has been described as a single copy suppressor of the <i>YPT1</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dascher et al., 1991</a>) and implicated in forward and retrograde trafficking (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ossig et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2005</a>). In contrast with its essential roles in yeast, a temperature sensitive mutant of Sly1 in zebra fish is not lethal on the cellular level but rather creates developmental defects in embryonic stages (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nechiporuk et al., 2003</a>). In mammals, SLY1 has been reported to function in conjunction with Syntaxin 5 (STX5) in the ER to Golgi transport and might also function in the assembly of pre-Golgi intermediates (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rowe et al., 1998</a>) together with Syntaxin 18 (STX18) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</a>) and Syntaxin 17 (STX17) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Steegmaier et al., 2000</a>). SLY1 has been shown to interact with the COG4 complex and suggested to play a role in intra Golgi and retrograde transport (<a href=\"#bib18\">Laufman et al., 2009</a>). It is important to note that in mammalian cells, these proposed roles of SLY1 in traffic between ER and Golgi membranes are based entirely on the use of artificial temperature sensitive mutant protein Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-Glycoprotein (G) protein and the artificial cargo signal sequence (ss)-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The role of SLY1 in the trafficking of endogenous cargoes and its potential mechanism of action is therefore a matter of debate."

Our data show the presence of SLY1 in the TANGO1 immunoprecipitate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). SLY1 is a cytoplasmic protein but our findings suggest that it interacts with the ER exit sites anchored TANGO1, so is there a pool of SLY1 associated with ER exit sites where TANGO1 resides? We have previously documented the use of a human cell line called RDEB/FB/C7 that stably expresses and secretes Collagen VII (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2009</a>). We used lentivirus to express SLY1-GFP in RDEB/FB/C7 cells. In fixed cells, the GFP signal is localized throughout the cytoplasm with a slight accumulation in the perinuclear region. After prepermeabilization of the cells with saponin and extensive washes to remove the cytoplasmic pool of proteins before fixation, a pool of SLY1-GFP was found to colocalize with the ER exit sites specific COPII component SEC31 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Arrowheads mark single exit sites that label for SEC31 and SLY1. In addition, a perinuclear SLY1-containing and SEC31-lacking pool was observed. This perinuclear pool of SLY1 partially overlaps with GM130, a marker of the early Golgi cisternae (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Our data show that although most of SLY1 was Golgi localized, we detected a small pool that co-localized with Sec31. At present, we do not know whether recruitment of SLY1 to the ER exit site is by direct binding to TANGO1 or indirectly through other proteins on the cytoplasmic side."

A block in retrograde transport leads to an accumulation of GRP78/BIP in the Golgi apparatus and its subsequent secretion from the cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yamamoto et al., 2003</a>). GRP78/BIP was localized to the ER in SLY1 knockdown cells and control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Moreover, GRP78/BIP was not detected in the medium collected from control, SLY1- or TANGO1-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To further quantitate the involvement of SLY1 in transport between the Golgi apparatus and the ER, we used a procedure to trap cycling proteins in the ER as described previously (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pecot and Malhotra, 2006</a>). HeLa cells treated with control siRNA or cells depleted of TANGO1 or SLY1 were transfected with the following constructs: one encoding ERGIC53, a protein that cycles between the early Golgi/ERGIC compartment and the ER, fused to FKPB and GFP, and another encoding the invariant chain of the major histocompatibility complex class II receptor (Ii) fused to FRAP-HA. In HeLa cells, the Ii chain lacking its MHC counterpart is retained in the ER (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lotteau et al., 1990</a>). Rapamycin is known to bind FRAP and this dimer tightly binds FKBP. This procedure can therefore be used to test if FRAP- and FKBP-containing proteins reside in close proximity and thus are accessible to each other. We observed the cells by fluorescence microscopy at steady state and 15, 30, and 60 min after the addition of Rapamycin or in control cells without the addition of Rapamycin. Colocalization of the two constructs was assessed by calculating the Pearson's colocalization coefficient. Knockdown of TANGO1 or SLY1 did not affect the kinetics of ERGIC53 redistribution to the ER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We therefore conclude that under our experimental conditions, knockdown of SLY1 or TANGO1 does not affect retrograde trafficking."

This is similar to the known effects of TANGO1 knockdown on the selective export of secretory cargo from the ER. Interestingly, TANGO1 knockdown by siRNA does not affect the secretion of the bulky PC I (<a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>). Is SLY1 required for the trafficking of PC I? RDEB/FB/C7 cells were transfected with siRNA oligos specific for SLY1, TANGO1 or scrambled siRNA as a control and treated with ascorbic acid, as described above. 20 hr after the last change of medium, the cell lysates and the medium were western blotted with anti-Collagen I antibody. Our results reveal that the secretion of collagen I is not blocked by knockdown of SLY1 or TANGO1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To further ascertain that SLY1 has no role in PC I export, we transfected Saos 2 cells with siRNA oligos specific for SLY1, TANGO1 or a scrambled siRNA and after 48 hr Saos 2 cells were washed, and then incubated with fresh medium containing ascorbic acid for 20 hr. The knockdown efficiency was determined by western blotting the cell lysates and revealed a reduction greater than 75% in the levels of SLY1 and TANGO1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The intracellular and secreted PC I was measured by western blotting the cell lysate and the medium, respectively. As in RDEB/FB/C7 cells, knockdown of SLY1 or TANGO1 in Saos 2 cells did not affect the secretion of PC I (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In fact, in both cells lines, we detected a marginal increase in the secretion of Collagen I that is accompanied by an increase in the internal levels of Collagen I in the knocked down cells. This suggests a potential effect on the transcriptional regulation of Collagen I expression rather than a defect in its trafficking."

The assembly of the outer coat proteins SEC13/31 completes the biogenesis of COPII vesicles by inactivation of SAR1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>). TANGO1 links PC VII to the inner COPII coat by interacting with the SEC23/24 complex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2009</a>). To further ascertain the involvement of COPII coat assembly at the ER for PC VII export, we depleted either of the SAR1 isoforms A and B or both in RDEB/FB/C7 cells using an siRNA mixture described earlier (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cutrona et al., 2013</a>). Probing of cell lysates with anti SAR1 antibody revealed a doublet of bands at the predicted size of SAR1. As one can observe in the single knockdowns these bands correspond to the two SAR1 isoforms, the upper, weaker band being SAR1 B and the lower, stronger SAR1 A. Single knockdowns result in an almost complete depletion of the individual isoforms, with double knockdown the efficiency is approximately 75% for SAR1 A while SAR1 B is still fully depleted (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The same procedure of SAR1 knockdown was repeated and 48 hr after transfection with the specific siRNA oligos, the cells were washed, and then incubated with fresh medium containing ascorbic acid for 20 hr. The medium and the cell lysates were western blotted with an anti-Collagen VII antibody. Knockdown of SAR1 A alone had marginal effect on the secretion of PC VII, whereas the knockdown of SAR1 B was largely ineffective. However, knockdown of both SAR1 A and B led to an almost total block in PC VII secretion, which accumulated in the cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). To visualize the intracellular site of PC VII accumulation, we transfected RDEB/FB/C7 cells to deplete both SAR1 A and B as described above, and 24 hr later ascorbic acid was added to the culture medium. 48 hr later, the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against Collagen VII and SEC31, respectively. In cells depleted of SAR1 A and B, PC VII accumulated in large structures (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) similar to the patches of PC VII seen in RDEB/FB/C7 cells depleted of TANGO1 or SLY1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). As expected the COPII component SEC31 localized to punctate structures resembling ER exit sites in control cells, but not in cells depleted of SAR1 A and B. Here, SEC31 localized mostly in the cytosol and almost no SEC31 positive punctae were visible (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

The question we asked was whether the location of COPII components and PC VII in cells that are depleted of SLY1 is different compared with control cells that are exporting Collagen VII. Since PC VII is rapidly exported from the ER after its synthesis, our positive control, to test this hypothesis, was cells transfected with scrambled siRNA oligos for 72 hr and then kept for 3 hr at 15\u00b0C to accumulate secretory cargo in the ER and then shifted to 37\u00b0C for 30 min to restart cargo export from the ER.

In SAR1 (A and B) knockdown cells, as expected, SEC31 was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm and not associated with the ER exit sites.

SLY1 interacts with several of these ER to Golgi SNARE proteins (<a href=\"#bib33\">Peng and Gallwitz, 2004</a>). To further elucidate the function of SNAREs in the export of PC VII, we tested SLY1 interacting SNAREs, specifically the ER localized STX18 and STX17 as well as the ER and Golgi membrane associated STX5 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rowe et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Steegmaier et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</a>).

The medium from RDEB/FB/C7 cells treated with siRNAs for STX5, 17 and 18 was collected as previously described and western blotted for the presence of PC VII. We observe that both knockdown of STX5 and 18 reduced the amount of PC VII being secreted. STX17 had only marginal effect on the secretion of PC VII (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>). The secretion of Collagen I to the media was assessed in Saos2 cells. We observed a reduction of secreted protein, when cells were treated with siRNAs for STX5. Neither depletion of STX17 nor depletion of STX18 affected the levels of secreted Collagen I (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Alongside, we quantified by immunofluorescence the number of cells that accumulate PC VII and I intracellularly. For this, we counted at least 30 cells in each of five random fields. In STX18 and STX5 knockdown samples more than 80% of the cells accumulated PC VII in the ER compared to 25% of the cells in the control (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D,E</a>).

The function of TANGO1 is facilitated by cTAGE5 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Saito et al., 2011</a>). cTAGE5 and TANGO1 interact through their second (proximal to the proline rich domain) coiled\u2013coiled domains at the ER exit sites. cTAGE5 does not have a luminal domain and cannot therefore bind PC VII directly (<a href=\"#bib38\">Saito et al., 2011</a>). The TANGO1\u2013cTAGE5 complex is proposed to stall the COPII vesicles at the ER exit sites as they are being packed with PC VII and this procedure is proposed to result in the production of a transport intermediate for the export of PC VII from the ER (<a href=\"#bib23\">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011</a>).

These findings also highlight that the sorting of cargoes into different export routes is not driven solely by the size of the secretory cargoes. While the mechanism regulating this sorting event remains unclear it is worth highlighting that TANGO1 in <i>Drosophila</i> is localized to the basal endoplasmic reticulum specific exit sites (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lerner et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, TANGO1 in <i>Drosophila</i> is required for the export of Collagen IV, which is secreted into the basal face of the cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lerner et al., 2013</a>).

                                "text": "Our surprising finding is that SLY1, which is known to interact with STX18, a t-SNARE for membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hatsuzawa et al., 2000</a>), is required for the export of PC VII from the ER. The function of SLY1, which is a member of the STXBP/unc-18/SEC1 protein family, remains unclear. For example, it is not known whether SLY1 regulates the activity of the SNARE complex, or helps with the fusion or the disassembly of the SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carr and Rizo, 2010</a>). SLY1 at the ER -Golgi interface has been shown to interact with a large number of SNAREs and could thus regulate a number of different SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dascher and Balch, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Steegmaier et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</a>). The t- and v-SNAREs of the ER Golgi anterograde and retrograde trafficking routes are summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. So far the SNARE complexes reported for the forward trafficking from ER to Golgi are complexes of Golgi t-SNAREs and a specific v-SNARE. However, there is no evidence that the ER attached t-SNAREs such as STX17, STX18, Sec20 and USE1/P31 are required for the forward transport to the Golgi complex. It could be argued that SLY1 and STX18 function to recycle a specific component, a v-SNARE; for example, from ERGIC/early Golgi cisternae and without which, the cells terminate the export of PC VII out of the ER. However, cycling of KDEL containing protein BIP and ERGIC53 as well as the export of other secretory cargoes including the bulky PC I is unaffected under these experimental conditions. Additionally, we do not see any obvious accumulation of PC VII containing large vesicles in between the ER and the Golgi. We therefore favor the possibility that SLY1 and STX18 are required for the fusion of membranes to the ER to generate an export carrier for PC VII. The working hypothesis for the export of PC VII from the ER follows (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>)."

Their model is reminiscent of our scheme in which we place molecular components such as TANGO1 for the concentration of PC VII followed by the fusion of membranes to grow the PC VII enriched ER domain. However, the TANGO1 mediated concentration of PC VII requires the involvement of COPII components, SEC23/24. Additionally, the protrusion visualized by the microscopy based analysis might correspond to growth of ER patch by SLY1 and STX18 dependent fusion of the recycling (ERGIC) membranes. The challenge is to find proteins that connect PC I with the COPII machinery, the SNAREs required for the trafficking of PC I, and the visualization of membranes that we propose are added to grow the patch of PC VII containing ER membrane into a vectorial carrier en route to the cell surface for secretion."

At the indicated time points, the cells were fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. ERGIC53 was visualized by GFP fluorescence, and Ii with a HA-antibody and an Alexa594-labeled secondary antibody. Colocalization of the two proteins was assessed in at least 30 cells from five different focus fields of an representative experiment by calculating the Pearson's colocalization coefficient using ImageJ software and the Colocalization Analysis plug-in. Pearson's colocalization coefficient of 1 means total colocalization whereas 0 indicates no colocalization."

Indeed, TANGO1 is one of these factors. But given the established roles of SLY1, STX18, and other related proteins in mediating vesicle fusion, it has not yet been shown that SLY1 is directly involved in this process. An alternative explanation is that PCVII is an especially sensitive cargo, and its incorporation into COPII vesicles is hindered by general trafficking perturbations that do not affect most other cargos. Furthermore, how do the authors know that membranes are the limiting component for PCVII vesicle formation upon SLY1 knockdown?

The reviewers have requested that we show more on the interaction between TANGO1 and SLY1. Unfortunately, at present, this is beyond the scope of the paper. TANGO1 coprecipitates with SLY1 only in cells that are chemically crosslinked and we believe they are in a complex of a large number of other proteins. It is, therefore, unclear whether these two proteins bind directly. We were fortunate that we could identify this interaction but defining the mechanism of their binding is not possible at present. We have rewritten the paper extensively to address the reviewers\u2019 concerns and better describe the data rather than a potential model based on our findings. Our data highlights the existing of separate pathways for the export of Procollagen VII and Procollagen I from the ER. In other words, size alone is not the reason for the separate pathways of procollagen export from the ER. Our revised manuscript highlights this new message. In addition, we have added a table that summarizes our current understanding of the SNARE proteins localized at the ER-Golgi interface. This will help the readers to understand the complexity of this process and appreciate our findings."
