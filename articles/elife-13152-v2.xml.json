Here, we demonstrate that PlyC is a potent agent for controlling intracellular <i>Spy</i> that often underlies refractory infections. We show that the PlyC holoenzyme, mediated by its PlyCB subunit, crosses epithelial cell membranes and clears intracellular <i>Spy</i> in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative studies using model membranes establish that PlyCB interacts strongly with phosphatidylserine (PS), whereas its interaction with other lipids is weak, suggesting specificity for PS as its cellular receptor. Neutron reflection further substantiates that PlyC penetrates bilayers above a PS threshold concentration. Crystallography and docking studies identify key residues that mediate PlyCB\u2013PS interactions, which are validated by site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report that a native endolysin can traverse epithelial membranes, thus substantiating the potential of PlyC as an antimicrobial for <i>Spy</i> in the extracellular and intracellular milieu and as a scaffold for engineering other functionalities."

Here, we demonstrate that PlyC is a potent agent for controlling intracellular <i>Spy</i> that often underlies refractory infections. We show that the PlyC holoenzyme, mediated by its PlyCB subunit, crosses epithelial cell membranes and clears intracellular <i>Spy</i> in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative studies using model membranes establish that PlyCB interacts strongly with phosphatidylserine (PS), whereas its interaction with other lipids is weak, suggesting specificity for PS as its cellular receptor. Neutron reflection further substantiates that PlyC penetrates bilayers above a PS threshold concentration. Crystallography and docking studies identify key residues that mediate PlyCB\u2013PS interactions, which are validated by site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report that a native endolysin can traverse epithelial membranes, thus substantiating the potential of PlyC as an antimicrobial for <i>Spy</i> in the extracellular and intracellular milieu and as a scaffold for engineering other functionalities."

Other similar enzymes could not act in this way, and further studies confirmed that PlyC could move around inside a throat cell without causing it damage. Shen, Barros et al. also determined that PlyC has a pocket on its surface that binds with a specific component of the throat cell membrane, a molecule called phosphatidylserine. This interaction \u2013 which is a bit like a lock and key \u2013 grants PlyC access into the cell."

In experiments with human epithelial cell lines A549 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or Detroit 562 (data not shown), rates of <i>Spy</i> adherence ranged from 1\u00a0to\u00a05% of the inoculum and rates of internalization ranged from 1\u00a0to\u00a010% of the adherent streptococci, which are consistent with previous <i>Spy</i>/epithelial cell co-culture studies (<a href=\"#bib28\">LaPenta et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ryan et al., 2001</a>) as well as in vivo findings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kugelberg et al., 2005</a>). Using this co-culture system, the bacteriolytic efficacy of three endolysins known to lyse <i>Spy</i> in vitro (PlyC (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nelson et al., 2006</a>); B30 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Donovan et al., 2006</a>); and Ply700 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Celia et al., 2008</a>)) were evaluated for activity against intracellular <i>Spy</i>. Although we anticipated the enzymes would need to be engineered with cell penetrating peptides or transduction domains in order to acheive intracellular activity, treatment with 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml WT PlyC reduced intracellular colonization (colony forming units; CFUs) by 95% (p&lt;0.001) within 1\u2009hr, and lower concentrations displayed a dose response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). In contrast, the B30 and Ply700 streptococcal phage endolysins failed to significantly decrease the intracellular <i>Spy</i> CFUs. We then assessed PlyC in a co-culture with primary human tonsillar epithelial cells grown from a tonsillectomy as a more clinically relevant model since these cells are known to be the major reservoir for recurrent <i>Spy</i> pharyngotonsillitis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Osterlund et al., 1997</a>). Roughly 90% of intracellular <i>Spy</i> were eliminated when treated with 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml PlyC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), similar to the effect in immortalized A549 epithelial cells, although the lower dose treatments did not demonstrate significant killing. At present, it is not known if the differences in efficacy are due to differences in the\u00a0distribution of cellular receptors between the cell types or other phenotypic differences. Nonetheless, these data indicate that the native PlyC holoenzyme can be internalized by mammalian cells and that the endolysin retains bacteriolytic efficacy against <i>Spy</i> in the intracellular environment."

Taken together, the data show that the subunit PlyCB mediates translocation of the PlyC holoenzyme across the plasma membrane, where it is subsequently trafficked and quantitatively lyses intracellular <i>Spy</i>."

At neutral pH, the PlyCB octamer is net positive (pI = 8.5), and its solvent accessible surface contains 48 cationic residues, two arginines and four lysines on each monomer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Cationic amino acid patches are known to frequently promote membrane adhesion and often result in membrane penetration of proteins, as described for cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dietz, 2010</a>). To explore the roles of cationic residues in PlyC, we mutated the exposed Arg and Lys residues on PlyCB to Glu in order to independently determine the role of each mutation in <i>Spy</i> binding and lysis, as well as PlyC cellular uptake. Four of five holoenzyme constructs, PlyC(PlyCB<sub>K70E,K71E</sub>), PlyC(PlyCB<sub>K23E</sub>), PlyC(PlyCB<sub>K59E</sub>), and PlyC(PlyCB<sub>R66E</sub>), were soluble and tested for lytic activity in a turbidity reduction assay. A fifth mutant, PlyC(PlyCB<sub>R29E</sub>) was insoluble and could not be further studied. The holoenzymes incorporating PlyCB<sub>K23E</sub> and PlyCB<sub>K70E,K71E</sub> were fully active in external <i>Spy</i> degradation, but PlyC(PlyCB<sub>K59E</sub>) and PlyC(PlyCB<sub>R66E</sub>) only had \u224815% and 1% of WT PlyC activity, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>)."

In contrast, PlyCB binding to 30\u2009mol% PS is extremely strong. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a> shows PlyCB binding to stBLMs with PS concentrations between 10 and 30\u2009mol%.

On membranes that contained 30\u2009mol% PS, both the affinity of the protein (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> = 40 \u00b1 10 nM) and its surface density were very high. Buffer rinses of stBLMs that contained PS at \u226515\u2009mol% removed the bound protein only partially (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). While membrane binding of PlyCB is extremely strong at high PS concentration, its affinity decreases rapidly at lower PS content. At 15\u2009mol% PS, the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> increases to \u22480.5\u2009\u03bcM, and at 10\u2009mol% PS, PlyCB binding is reduced to the level of binding equal to 30\u2009mol% PI or PG.

The protein is deeply inserted in the membrane and spans its entire thickness, headgroup to headgroup. Some protein is superficially adsorbed as evidenced by a protein CVO peak at a distance of \u224820\u2009\u00c5 above the membrane surface. Flushing the membrane with protein-free buffer removed this adsorbed protein, as shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>. The CVO profile after the flush shows that the PlyCB protein retained within the membrane is almost symmetrically distributed across the tethered bilayer and occupies up to 10% of its volume. The protein CVOs shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,b</a> for stBLMs in contact with protein-containing solutions extend beyond the size of a single PlyCB octamer and could therefore only be modeled by continuous spline-based distributions. In contrast, the CVO profiles in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>, after the buffer rinse, indicate a compact protein conformation within the membrane. With the bilayer structure modeled as a continuous distribution of components (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shekhar et al., 2011</a>), we used the PlyCB crystal structure (PDB: 4F87) (<a href=\"#bib36\">McGowan et al., 2012</a>) and optimized its distance and orientation at the membrane, as described earlier (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nanda et al., 2010</a>). This rigid body modeling approach (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>, black trace) resembled the protein distribution determined in a spline fit (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>, red trace), which suggests that the inserted protein spans the bilayer at a well-defined angle that leads to a match with the bilayer thickness. Data resampling (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nanda et al., 2010</a>) determined the most likely model for the protein within the bilayer and established confidence limits for the model parameters. These are indicated as dashed lines in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."

In combination with the residues identified to affect intracellular translocation, this suggests that the groove is a binding site for anionic lipids. To explore this hypothesis, a 1.7-\u00c5 X-ray crystal structure of PlyCB<sub>R66E</sub> was determined (PDB: 4ZRZ). Superimposing this structure on that of a high-resolution structure of WT PlyCB (PDB: 4F87) reveals that the mutated E66 side chain maintains the same location as R66 in the WT protein, and a hydrogen bond with E36 is preserved (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>).

As an alternative method, we used RosettaLigand (<a href=\"#bib37\">Meiler and Baker, 2006</a>) to model PS and PE docking to one subunit of the PlyCB octamer near the groove surrounded by R29, K59, and R66. Because the burial of the lipid fatty tails cannot be adequately accounted for in this approach, these ligands were trimmed to three different lengths (details, see 'Materials and methods'), with the longest construct retaining the \u03b1 carbons of the fatty acid chains. In all, approximately 30,000 dockings were performed with each ligand. Possible complexes were selected using two criteria. The first candidate set was selected of models with the lowest interface energy scores (Rosetta total energy of the complex minus the sum of the energies of the isolated protein and ligand) and is composed of 152 PS and 125 PE candidates. Each of the candidates was visually inspected to exclude models in which (1) the phosphate group binds outside of the potential binding groove or (2) there would be unavoidable clashes if the fatty acid tails were complete, narrowing down the count of viable docking poses to 36 PS and 39 PE complexes. The best accepted PS model had an interface energy 3.74 kcal/mol lower than that of the best model for PE (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>). In 11 PS candidates, including the three best models with different tail constructs, the seryl carboxyl formed a salt bridge with R29 and there was also a salt bridge between the phosphate group and R66. In 18 PE candidates, including the three best models with different tail constructs, there was a salt bridge between the amine and E63, as well as between the phosphate group and R66. These electrostatic interactions dominated the energetics, and resulted in opposite orientations of PE and PS relative to the protein.

We also observed that PlyCB colocalizes with cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB), a lipid raft marker that binds GM1 gangliosides (<a href=\"#bib29\">Latif et al., 2003</a>), and both CTxB and PlyCB internalization were inhibited by chelation of cellular cholesterol after pre-treatment with filipin III (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c,d</a>). This suggests that PlyCB entry is mediated by a lipid-raft-dependent process such as caveolae-mediated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, we ruled out other possible internalization pathways. Cytochalasin D, a macropinocytosis inhibitor that induces depolymerization of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wakatsuki et al., 2001</a>), did not affect PlyCB internalization, nor did PlyCB colocalize with transferrin, a ubiquitous marker of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (data not shown).

Accordingly, there have been extensive efforts to deliver these enzymes across the plasma membrane, the physical barrier that prevents internalized bacteria from being targeted by antimicrobials. CPPs have been suggested as fusion tags for endolysins to direct them against intracellular pathogens (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borysowski and Gorski, 2010</a>). Toward this end, we did not expect WT PlyC to internalize cells, and therefore fused PlyC to TAT, one of the best characterized CPPs. In comparing the ability of TAT-labeled PlyC and WT PlyC (used as a control) to lyse intracellular <i>Spy</i> (data not shown), we found that <i>both</i> lysed the pathogen inside of cells, inspiring the investigations reported here."

Nonetheless, our results suggest a moonlighting role based on structural motifs within the PlyCB subunit whereby a cationic binding groove is a central determinant of interaction with plasma membranes and subsequent internalization. We propose that PlyC internalization is a three-step process that involves (1) membrane binding through electrostatic interaction and specific ligation with PS, (2) cellular entry by caveolae (or lipid raft)-dependent endocytosis, and (3) cytosolic transport where PlyC comes into contact with intracellular <i>Spy</i>. Interestingly, TAT-mediated protein transduction was reported to occur in a similar pathway (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gump and Dowdy, 2007</a>), suggesting that PlyC internalization is comparable to cellular uptake of TAT. Whether eventual co-localization between PlyC and <i>Spy</i> involves endosomal escape or phagolysosomal fusion is currently unknown and requires further studies."

In semi-quantitative terms, this result is echoed in the Rosetta protein-ligand docking models. For PS and PE, only distinguished through the seryl carboxyl, the results for lipids with truncated fatty acid chains suggest that PS has a lower interface energy (by &gt;3.5 kcal/mol) than that of PE. A part of this energetic difference comes from an interaction between the carbonyl group of the fatty acid tail and R66, not observed for PE because of its consistently different orientation relative to the protein. For the shorter fragments (ligand without fatty acid chains and glycerol backbones, see Materials and methods), the best models for PS and PE do not differ significantly in interface energy, at least partly because the tail carbonyl group is absent. Obvious caveats apply to these results: (1) in a real binding event, the phospholipid ligand is membrane-embedded which may restrict viable conformations in the bound state, despite the fact that the membrane is dynamic and flexible, and (2) trimming of the fatty acid tails may eliminate some contribution of the hydrophobic effect in the bound state, which may, however, be comparable for PS and PE. Despite these caveats, all low-energy candidate models demonstrate strong interactions between the ligand phosphate group and one of the two neighboring arginines \u2013 a type of electrostatic interaction that has been experimentally observed in other systems (<a href=\"#bib64\">Woods and Ferre, 2005</a>) \u2013 in support of the hypothesis that the lipid binding site is adjacent to R29, K59, and R66. We note that the docking calculations are consistent with the experimental PlyCB-membrane binding data, even though the agreement could be fortuitous if various approximations in the docking analysis compensate. Indeed, the free-energy difference between docked PS and PE compares well with the difference in \u0394G observed between PlyCB binding to PS-containing membranes and to membranes without this specific phospholipid ligand. PlyC binding to purely zwitterionic membranes is weak and has not been thoroughly studied, but the binding to non-specific anionic lipids or the binding of PlyCB<sub>R66E</sub> to PS are good proxies which both show \u0394\u0394<i>G</i> values around 4 kcal/mol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) \u2013 a difference of the same order of magnitude as that observed in\u00a0the docking result. We therefore suggest that the docking studies, while somewhat simplified, capture the essence of the specificity observed for PS lipid."

Disruption of membrane asymmetry is known to follow apoptosis. On the other hand, recent studies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Segawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">van den Eijnde et al., 2001</a>) show that membrane inversion is not unique for cell death, and some viruses, such as the vesicular stomatitis virus, utilize PS as the cellular receptor (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carneiro et al., 2006</a>). It is therefore plausible that PS can also act as a receptor for PlyC, even more so since PS equilibration across the plasma membrane is more likely for cells that are stressed by pathogen invasion. In an analogous system, annexin A5 binds PS reversibly in a calcium-dependent manner and is often used as a marker for apoptosis. Upon binding to PS-containing membrane patches, annexin A5 forms a convex trimer which nanomechanically elicits membrane invagination and the formation of endocytotic vesicles that are actively transported by the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib65\">van Genderen et al., 2008</a>). This translocation pathway is not restricted to apoptotic cells, because other proteins can be trapped in such annexin-A5-mediated portals of entry (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kenis et al., 2004</a>). Accordingly, PlyC might penetrate cells in a similar mechanism, as PlyCB possesses eight potential PS binding sites, each on the convex outer surface of the octamer. While further experimental evidence is required, it is tempting to speculate that parallels between the PS-driven membrane interaction of annexins and PlyC may produce membrane invaginations that lead to PlyC endocytosis."

The typical roughness factor of the Au film, \u03b2 \u2248 1.4, was earlier determined (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budvytyte et al., 2013</a>). A Solartron 1287A potentiostat and 1260 frequency analyzer were used to measure impedance spectra of the stBLMs. An a.c. voltage with amplitude of 10 mV was applied across the sample while the measurements were carried out within a frequency range of 1\u2009Hz to 100 kHz. Data acquisition was performed with the <i>Zplot</i> and <i>Zview</i> software packages (Scribner Associates, Southern Pine, NC) and the results analyzed by fitting the data to equivalent circuit models (ECMs) as described (<a href=\"#bib34\">McGillivray et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Valincius et al., 2006</a>).

The SPR setup allows for simultaneous EIS measurements, and the quality of the lipid membranes was assessed before each binding experiment. stBLMs with a resistivity below 40 k\u03a9\u00d7cm<sup>2</sup> were rejected. In the optical set-up, a fan of monochromatic light (\u03bb = 763.8 nm) hits the sample at a range of incident angles, and a 2D CCD detector records the intensity of the reflected light. The position of the intensity minimum on the CCD defines the resonance angle, recorded as a function of time. The resonance angle corresponding to the neat bilayer is measured as a reference and its change recorded as increasing concentrations of PlyCB in PBS at 150\u2009mM NaCl, pH 7.4, are added to the stBLM.

Briefly, crystals grew in sitting drops at room temperature from purified PlyCB at 14 mg/ml mixed with 43% methylpentanediol, 30\u2009mM ammonium sulfate, 70\u2009mM Na HEPES, pH 6.0. X-rays were produced by a rotating anode generator (MicroMax 007HF,\u00a0Rigaku, The Woodlands, TX) and diffraction data that yielded a resolution of 1.7\u2009\u00c5 were measured by RAXIS IV<sup>++</sup> image plates and processed using <i>d</i>*<i>trek</i> software (Rigaku). The initial model of the mutant was made by omitting the amino acid side chains 29, 36, 59, 63, and 66 from the precedent structure (PDB code: 4F87). The omitted side chains were imaged using difference maps and added to the model during refinement. Refinement converged with <i>R<sub>f</sub></i> = 0.25 and rmsd bond lengths of 0.011\u2009\u00c5. The refined mutant structure shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a> has been deposited in the PDB with accession code 4ZRZ."

To relieve preexisting strain according to the Rosetta\u2019s energy function, an energy minimization was performed including all side chains with <i>RosettaLigand ligand_rpkmin</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Davis and Baker, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Meiler and Baker, 2006</a>). 216 PS structures were extracted from a fully hydrated DOPC:DOPS (3:1) bilayer MD model (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shenoy et al., 2012a</a>). A corresponding set of PE structures was obtained by removing the seryl carboxyl group of PS. Because the burial of the lipid fatty tails cannot be adequately accounted for in this approach, the lipid tails were trimmed as follows: (A) fatty acid tails were kept up to the \u03b1 carbon. (B) Only the phosphate and headgroup were kept. (C) The lipid headgroup was truncated after the <i>sn</i>-3 position of the glycerol. All 216 PS (or PE) conformations in the bilayer model were included in the ligand conformer library. A second conformer library containing 25 to 50 conformations, depending on the construct, was generated using Frog2 web interface (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miteva etal., 2010</a>). All docking trajectories were started from a position close to the PlyCB cationic groove containing R29, K59, and R66, featuring the crystallographically observed putative phosphate site shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>. Ligand docking poses were sampled within a sphere of 5\u2009\u00c5 radius centered at the initial site using <i>RosettaLigand</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Davis and Baker, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Meiler and Baker, 2006</a>), which uses a Monte Carlo search algorithm and supports modeling with flexible ligand and protein side chains. For each of the input ligands,\u00a010,000\u201316,000 models were generated. To compile candidate set 1, the models were ranked by their interface energies. To generate candidate set 2, the models were selected if there existed at least one pair of non-hydrogen atoms between ligand and docking site residues (Y26, R29, E26, K59, V62, E63, and E66) within 3.5\u2009\u00c5 distance that were potentially capable of forming an H bond or salt bridge."

The reviewers agreed that this manuscript describes the important and unexpected finding that one phage lysin appears to enter the eukaryotic cell and there be effective in killing the common human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> residing within. The importance of this is that tonsillar epithelial cells serve as a reservoir for this microbe in asymptomatic carriers and antibiotic treatment failures. There was a consensus of enthusiasm for this manuscript, which both advances knowledge of molecular trafficking into eukaryotic cells, and does so with potentially important practical implications."

One uses the immortalized A549 lung epithelial cell line and the other one uses primary tonsillar epithelial cells freshly isolated from tonsillectomies. In both co-culture models, ~2% of inoculated <i>Spy</i> adhere to the epithelial cells and of those that adhere, 2-10% are internalized, yielding an overall internalization rate of ~0.04 to 0.2%. The adherence/internalization data for the A549 cells is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Note, while not included in this manuscript, we have done similar co-culture studies with <i>Spy</i> on Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells. In all three co-culture models, the rates of adherence range from 1-5% of the inoculum and rates of internalization range from 1-10% of the adherent streptococci. We did not include the Detroit 562 data in the manuscript because we found the A549 cells easier to grow and used them for all subsequent experiments. Our rates of adherence and internalization in the three models are consistent with the literature as referenced by Ryan et al. and LaPenta et al. Both these manuscripts were already referenced in the original submission, but we now include an expanded statement in our revised manuscript discussing how our adherence/internalization rates compare to previous publications."

For instance, a murine model of streptococcal skin infection by Kugelberg et al. shows that ~0.01% of inoculated <i>Spy</i> persist after Fucidin (a clinically-used antibiotic) treatment, suggesting intracellular <i>Spy</i> may have evolved as a mechanism to avoid antibiotic eradication. In addition, in situ image analysis by Thulin et al. reveals that high amount of viable <i>Spy</i> present in the soft tissues of human biopsies. Although not ideal, we believe our co-culture model mimics the level of <i>Spy</i> colonization/internalization found in vivo."

Although most published <i>Spy</i>adherence/invasion co-culture experiments utilize immortalized epithelial cells including the same A549 cells we investigated, we also sought to include experiments on primary cell lines to account for potential differences that may arise from the immortality of the A549 cells. As stated in response to question 1 above, we saw no significant difference in <i>Spy</i> adherence and internalization between primary tonsillar epithelial cells, immortalized A459 lung epithelial cells, and immortalized Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells (Detroit data not presented in the manuscript). However, as the reviewer points out, we did indeed note a lower level of PlyC killing efficiency in the primary cells compared to the immortalized A549 cells. It is unknown whether these findings are due to experimental variation, differences in growth/metabolism between the primary and immortalized cells, or differences in membrane lipid composition as suggested by the reviewer. Given that our data shows PlyCB binds phosphatidylserine, it is certainly plausible that cell-specific lipid composition may affect PlyC internalization rates and subsequent intracellular killing efficacy. At present, we do not know the lipid composition for these various cell lines, but the revised manuscript now includes a discussion about the differences in PlyC killing efficacy between the various cell lines consistent with the reviewer\u2019s comments."

Whilethe exact nature of the binding epitope on the streptococcal surface is presently unknown, it is strongly believed to be the carbohydrate present within the streptococcal wall teichoic acids, which is consistent with other phage-encoded endolysins that display cell wall binding domains. Although still circumstantial, there is growing evidence that the epitope may be a polyrhamnose moiety within the wall teichoic acids as streptococci sensitive to PlyC all possess the identical polyrhamnose moiety as determined by NMR studies (i.e. <i>S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae</i>, etc.). Moreover, PlyC readily acts on purified cell walls where no membranes are present and is easily inhibited by cell wall fragments lacking membranes, ruling out an essential role for phosphatidylserine or other membrane lipids. Lysis of <i>Spy</i> by PlyC occurs through passive osmotic lysis of the streptococcal membrane in areas where the protective peptidoglycan has been cleaved by PlyC. This \u201clysis from without\u201d mechanism is shared by all other endolysins derived from phage that infect Gram-positive hosts. After 16 years of studying PlyC, we have yet to find any evidence suggesting binding, interaction, weakening, or direct lysis of the streptococcal membrane by PlyC or PlyCB. Thus, as stated in our Discussion, we believe that PlyCB uses two completely different mechanisms to interact with the <i>Spy</i> peptidoglycan and the eukaryotic membrane, the latter being a moonlighting function."

First, we should have used the term \u201cintracellular trafficking\u201d or \u201cintracellular transport\u201d instead of \u201cinternalization\u201d to describe this set of experiments because it is the trafficking/transport that they were designed to test. The representative fields were chosen to show the diminished intracellular transport of PlyCB (green) and CTxB (red) after treatment with filipin III. In panel 7C, numerous intracellular vesicle containing both PlyCB and CTxB (yellow, signifying co-localization) are seen. In contrast, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> (i.e. pre-treated with filipin III) show no co-localization of the green PlyCB and red CTxB, suggesting the co-localization and intracellular transport observed in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> occurred via a lipid raft mechanism. Nonetheless, as the reviewer points out, some formed vesicles of PlyCB can still be observed in the filipin III treated <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>. We expected some PlyCB vesicles to form near the surface, which is what is seen if <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, but the lack of co-localization with CTxB or intracellular transport is the key finding. To help clarify this point, we have added additional arrows to <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> (now 9C) to highlight the yellow co-localization, removed the arrows to the green PlyCB in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> (now 9D) and we have expanded our discussion and implications of these findings. We do admit that future work will be needed on all intracellular pathways to fine tune our model, but the present data does implicate lipid rafts in the current working model for intracellular transport of PlyCB. We hope the changes to the revised manuscript clarify this point."
