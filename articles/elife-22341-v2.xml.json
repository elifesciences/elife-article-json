The volunteers had to perform various tasks while viewing the images. These tasks included focusing their attention on a small dot, categorizing the image, and stating whether the image had previously been shown."

This approach has been fruitful for the front end of the visual system, where relatively simple image computations have been shown to characterize the spiking activity of neurons in the retina, thalamus, and V1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carandini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wu et al., 2006</a>).

However, these models are insufficient to explain high-level perceptual functions such as the ability to read a page of text or recognize a face. These abilities are believed to depend on category-selective regions in ventral temporal cortex (VTC), but the computations that give rise to category-selective responses are poorly understood."

Achieving this goal requires four innovations: First, we need to develop a forward model that characterizes the relationship between visual inputs and the BOLD response in word- and face-selective cortex. Second, we need to dissociate bottom-up stimulus-driven effects from modulation by top-down cognitive processes and characterize how these processes alter the stimulus representation. Third, we need to localize the source of the top-down effects and integrate bottom-up and top-down computations into a single consolidated model. Finally, the neural computations should be linked to the measured behavior of the visual observer. In this study, we make progress on these four innovations and develop a model that characterizes bottom-up and top-down computations in word- and face-selective cortex."

However, we find that responses are not invariant to low-level properties of the stimulus: both image contrast and phase coherence modulate response amplitudes. For example, the response to a word in VWFA is 2.4 times stronger when the word is presented at 100% contrast as compared to 3% contrast. These bottom-up effects (see also <a href=\"#bib69\">Rainer et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Avidan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Yue et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nasr et al., 2014</a>) may be somewhat surprising given that theories of word recognition generally posit that the VWFA response is invariant to low-level features (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dehaene and Cohen, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Price and Devlin, 2011</a>). In fact, it is currently debated whether the VWFA should be considered a visual area or a \u2018meta modal\u2019 language region (<a href=\"#bib71\">Reich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Striem-Amit et al., 2012</a>). Our measurements indicate that when top-down signals are minimized, word- and face-selective cortex is sensitive to low-level image properties, and that an accurate model of the computations performed by these regions must consider not only the stimulus category but also low-level features of the stimulus."

Task effects are substantially stronger in VWFA and FFA than in early visual areas V1\u2013V3. The larger apparent task modulation in V1 compared to V2 and V3 might due to small eye movements that may have been made during the categorization and one-back tasks. Our interpretation of the observed IPS activity during the fixation task is that this activity reflects the decision-making process involved in judging the color of the fixation dot. Support for this interpretation comes from the fact that the root-mean-square contrast of the stimuli, computed over a small region surrounding the fixation dot (0.36\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.36\u00b0), correlates strongly with IPS responses during the fixation task (<i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.86)."

In some cases, the top-down modulation is even larger than the modulation achieved by manipulation of the stimulus. For example, the VWFA response to 3%-contrast words during the one-back task exceeds the response to 100%-contrast words. Note that the task effects cannot be explained simply by differences in spatial attention: the one-back task produces substantially larger responses than the categorization task despite the fact that both tasks require the locus of spatial attention to be on the stimulus.

In other words, although we are able to use our own visual systems to assign a label such as \u2018word\u2019 or \u2018face\u2019 to describe the data, we have not yet identified the operations that enable our visual systems to derive these labels in the first place. An additional limitation of our conceptual understanding is that it fails to account for the sensitivity of VWFA and FFA to low-level image properties. We therefore ask: Is it possible to develop a quantitative characterization of the bottom-up computations that can reproduce observed stimulus selectivity in human VTC?"

The first stage consists of a set of local oriented filters, akin to what has been used to model physiological responses in V1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Jones and Palmer, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carandini et al., 2005</a>). The second stage consists of a normalized dot product applied to the outputs of the first stage. This dot product computes how well a given stimulus matches a category template (for\u00a0example, a word template for VWFA, a face template for FFA). We construct category templates directly from the stimulus set used in the experiment; in a later section we explore how well this approach generalizes. The present model, termed the <i>Template model</i>, is almost certainly an oversimplification of the complex nonlinear processing performed in VTC. Nevertheless, the model is theoretically motivated, consistent with hierarchical theories of visual processing (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fukushima, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Heeger et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Serre et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">DiCarlo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Rolls, 2012</a>), and provides a useful starting point for characterizing the computations that underlie word- and face-selectivity. Moreover, unlike recently popular deep neural network models that also involve hierarchical processing (<a href=\"#bib55\">Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Yamins et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc and van Gerven, 2015</a>), the model we propose is parsimonious with only three free parameters, and is therefore straightforward to fit and interpret (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

This finding validates the basic architecture of the Template model, demonstrates how the Template model might be extended to account for increasingly large ranges of measurements, and provides a promising method to model response properties of other high-level visual regions not investigated here (for\u00a0example, place- and limb-selective cortex)."

Thus, not only is information regarding non-preferred categories present in each ROI, but this information is actively modulated when subjects perform a perceptual task on those categories. These observations support the view that the brain uses a distributed strategy for perceptual processing and that category-selective regions are components of a more general network of regions that coordinate to extract visual information (<a href=\"#bib34\">Haxby et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cox and Savoy, 2003</a>). An alternative scheme, more in line with a modular view of perceptual processing (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kanwisher and Wojciulik, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baldauf and Desimone, 2014</a>), is area-specific enhancement, in which the representation of a stimulus is enhanced only in the region that is selective for that stimulus (for\u00a0example, enhancement of words only in VWFA, enhancement of faces only in FFA). This scheme is not supported by our measurements (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3b and 3c</a>; formal model evaluation is performed in a later section).

Interestingly, the categorization and one-back tasks appear to act via the same scaling mechanism. The stronger scaling observed for the one-back task might be a consequence of increased amplitude or duration of neural activity. These results suggest that, at least for the perceptual tasks sampled here and the spatial scale of neural activity measured in this study, top-down cognitive processes do not impart additional tuning or selectivity but serve to amplify the selectivity that is already computed by visual cortex."

There are two candidate mechanisms. The first is that sensitivity to task is locally generated from the neuronal architecture of VTC itself. We explore an alternative hypothesis whereby top-down modulation is induced by input from another brain region that is sensitive to task demands. To identify this region, we perform a connectivity analysis in which we first subtract the bottom-up signal in VTC, as given by responses measured during the fixation task, from responses measured during the categorization and one-back tasks.

We implement this model, termed the <i>IPS-scaling model</i>, using response magnitudes extracted from a broad anatomical mask of the IPS. This strategy helps avoids the overfitting that might ensue from a more specific voxel-selection procedure tailored to the fine-scale and potentially idiosyncratic pattern of results from the connectivity analysis. For example, if we were to select the single cortical location in the IPS that best correlates with the top-down modulation of VTC, this would make voxel selection a critical part of the model and render the modeling analysis circular (<a href=\"#bib57\">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</a>).

The rationale is that neural activity in IPS is expected to be sustained over the duration of the decision-making process (<a href=\"#bib82\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>), and so the total amount of neural activity integrated over time should be larger for longer decisions. Assuming that the BOLD signal reflects convolution of a sluggish hemodynamic response function and fine-scale neural activity dynamics, small differences in the duration of neural activity (for\u00a0example, between 0 and\u00a02 s) are expected to manifest in differences in BOLD amplitudes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kayser et al., 2010a</a>) and only minimally in the shapes of BOLD timecourses.

According to the model, categorization of low-contrast stimuli is difficult because the IPS computations required to perform the task involve longer accumulation time, and this is reflected in the fact that IPS response magnitudes increase monotonically with reaction time. Thus, our model performs several critical functions: it relates the cognitive task performed by the subject to IPS activity, proposes a computational explanation of task difficulty, and posits that top-down modulation of VTC by IPS is a direct consequence of fulfilling task demands.

Second, the accuracy with which the model accounts for the data is reasonable but by no means perfect. For instance, the Template model does not capture the step-like response profile of VTC as phase coherence is varied (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), and the accuracy with which the model accounts for a wide range of stimuli that includes faces, animals, and objects, is moderate at best (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Third, we have thus far characterized VTC and IPS responses at only a coarse spatiotemporal scale (that\u00a0is, BOLD responses averaged over specific regions-of-interest). Given these limitations, the present work constitutes a first step towards the goal of developing a comprehensive computational model of human high-level visual cortex.

In the present measurements, the most striking example comes from stimulus contrast. When subjects perform the fixation task, the contrast-response function (CRF) in VWFA is monotonically increasing, whereas during the one-back task, the CRF flips in sign and is monotonically decreasing (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). This effect (similar to what is reported in <a href=\"#bib62\">Murray and He, 2006</a>) is puzzling if we interpret the CRFs as indicating sensitivity to the stimulus contrast, but is sensible if we interpret the CRFs as instead reflecting the interaction of stimulus properties and cognitive processes. The influence of cognition on visual responses forces us to reconsider studies that report unexpected tuning properties in VTC and IPS, such as tuning to linguistic properties of text in VWFA (<a href=\"#bib88\">Vinckier et al., 2007</a>) and object selectivity in parietal cortex (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sereno and Maunsell, 1998</a>). In experiments that do not tightly control the cognitive processes executed by the observer, it is impossible to distinguish sensory effects from cognitive effects. Our quantitative model of VTC-IPS interactions provides a principled baseline on which to re-interpret past findings, design follow-up experiments, and guide data analysis."

Although several models have been proposed, none of these straightforwardly account for the present set of measurements. The <i>response-gain</i> model (<a href=\"#bib60\">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</a>) posits that attention causes a multiplicative scaling of contrast-response functions. Our observations are consistent with the general notion of response scaling (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but importantly, we find that the amount of scaling differs for different stimuli. Whereas the response-gain model implies that scaling is constant and therefore contrast-response functions should grow steeper during the stimulus-directed tasks, we find the opposite (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). The <i>contrast-gain</i> model (<a href=\"#bib75\">Reynolds et al., 2000</a>) posits that attention causes a leftward shift of contrast-response functions (as if contrast were increased). This model does not account for our measurements, since the stimulus-directed tasks can generate responses to low-contrast stimuli that are larger than responses to high-contrast stimuli (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Finally, the <i>additive-shift</i> model\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Buracas and Boynton, 2007</a>) posits that attention causes an additive increment to contrast-response functions; we find that our observations are better explained by a scaling, not additive, mechanism (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5c</a>). Thus, the effects we report are novel, and previous models of attention cannot explain these effects. Furthermore, by investigating responses to a wide range of stimuli (including manipulations of not only contrast but also phase coherence and stimulus category) and by characterizing the source of attentional signals, our work develops a more comprehensive picture of information processing in the visual system."

First, our connectivity analysis and modeling of VTC-IPS interactions are based on the\u00a0correlation of BOLD responses and do not provide information regarding the directionality, or timing, of neural interactions. In other words, our correlational results do not, in and of themselves, prove that the IPS causes VTC modulation; rather, we are imposing an interpretation of the results in the context of a computational model. We note that our interpretation is in line with previous work on perceptual decision-making showing top-down influence (Granger causality) of IPS on visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kayser et al., 2010b</a>). Our working hypothesis is that sensory information arrives at VTC (as indexed by fixation responses), these signals are routed to IPS for evidence accumulation, and then feedback from the IPS modulates the VTC response (as indexed by categorization and one-back responses). Temporally resolved measurements of neural activity (for\u00a0example, EEG, MEG, ECoG) will be necessary to test this hypothesis. Second, the scaling of BOLD response amplitudes by IPS is consistent with at least two potential mechanisms at neural level: the IPS may be inducing a scaling on neural activity in VTC or, alternatively, a sustainment of neural activity in VTC. Some support for the latter comes from a recent study demonstrating that ECoG responses in FFA exhibit sustained activity that is linked to long reaction times in a face gender discrimination task (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ghuman et al., 2014</a>). Finally, IPS is part of larger brain networks involved in attention (<a href=\"#bib16\">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</a>) and decision-making (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>), and identifying the computational roles of other regions in these networks is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms of perception."

For each subject, we summarized RTs by computing the median RT across trials for each stimulus. To obtain group-averaged RTs, we added a constant to each subject's RTs in order to match the mean RT to the grand mean across subjects and then computed the mean and standard error across subjects (this normalization procedure compensates for additive offsets in RT across subjects). Category judgments were analyzed by calculating percentages of trials on which a given subject categorized a given stimulus into each of the three categories (word, face, other). Subjects were highly consistent in their judgments: for each stimulus, the most frequently reported category was the same across subjects and was reported more than 85% of the time. Category judgments obtained from the categorization task are used in the labeling and interpretation of experimental results (for\u00a0example, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>)."

The model accepts as input a grayscale image and produces as output the predicted response in VWFA and FFA during the fixation task. In brief, the model processes the image using a set of V1-like Gabor filters and then computes a normalized dot product between filter outputs and a category template. The category template can be viewed as capturing the prototypical image statistics of a word (VWFA) or face (FFA). The Template model makes no claim as to how the brain might develop category templates; they might be genetically hard-wired (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kanwisher, 2010</a>) or arise from experience with the environment (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gauthier et al., 1999</a>). The central claim is that the bottom-up information computed by VTC is, at least to a first approximation, the output of a template operation applied to the stimulus."

Similar to the SOC model, the Template model has a cascade architecture involving two stages of filtering, rectification, and normalization. The first stage of the Template model is taken directly from the SOC model, and the properties of this stage (for\u00a0example, filter design) were not tweaked to fit the data. The main difference between the Template and SOC models is that the Template model incorporates a specific second-stage filter (the template), whereas the SOC model uses a variance-like operation in the second stage that captures generic sensitivity to second-order contrast. Whether the Template model captures certain response properties, such as invariance to font in VWFA (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dehaene and Cohen, 2011</a>) or coarse luminance-contrast selectivity in FFA (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ohayon et al., 2012</a>), is an empirical question that can only be resolved through quantitative evaluation on experimental data. For example, our measurements indicate that VWFA responds strongly to polygons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>); the Template model already accounts for this effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>)."

Filters are constructed at a single scale with a peak spatial frequency tuning of 4 cycles per degree (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>) and a spatial frequency bandwidth of 1 octave (full-width at half-maximum of the amplitude spectrum). Filters are scaled such that filter responses to full-contrast optimal sinusoidal gratings are equal to one.

Given that we do not have sufficient sampling of stimuli to directly estimate templates from the data (but see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we adopted the simple strategy of constructing templates from our stimulus set. Specifically, we took the WORD and FACE stimuli at 100% contrast and used the first stage of the Template model to compute a V1-like representation of these stimuli. This produced for each category, ten points in a 63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a063\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0=\u00a031,752 dimensional space. We then computed the centroid of the ten points, producing a category template (example shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Because the category template is constructed from the same stimuli used in our experiment, it is guaranteed that the Template model predicts large responses to the preferred category (for\u00a0example, using a category template constructed from the face stimuli guarantees that the face stimuli produce large responses from the model).

The model can be viewed as a formal implementation of the concept of stimulus-specific scaling (schematized in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, lower right).

Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed by systematically leaving out each of the categorization and one-back responses. Since measurement noise is present in the fixation responses, treating the fixation responses as exact estimates of bottom-up responses would result in suboptimal model performance (especially in the case of bottom-up responses that are near zero). We therefore devised a procedure that allows flexibility in estimating bottom-up responses (see light lines in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). In the procedure, a separate parameter is used to model the bottom-up response associated with each stimulus. During model fitting, these bottom-up parameters are initially set to be equal to the measured fixation responses, parameters of the model excluding the bottom-up parameters are optimized, and then all parameters are optimized simultaneously. This procedure was also used for the alternative models described below. Note that the IPS-scaling model uses flexible parameters to accommodate bottom-up stimulus selectivity and does not attempt to characterize the image-processing computations that underlie bottom-up responses (such computations are in the purview of the Template model)."

This allows us to assess the validity of having a single threshold parameter in the model. (2) The <i>Drift diffusion model (axis-aligned category vectors)</i> uses category vectors that are aligned with the axes of the multi-dimensional neural space (four free parameters, similar to the previous model). For example, in this model, the word category vector is a vector that is one along the VWFA axis and zero along the hV4 and FFA axes. This model tests the idea that evidence for words and faces is contributed only by the VTC regions selective for those categories."

This dataset was collected from one subject (an author; male; age 34). Informed written consent was obtained, and the protocol was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board. The experiment was similar in design to the main experiment. Stimuli included 22 images from the main experiment (one image from each of the 22 stimulus types), 92 images from a previous study investigating object representation in ventral temporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</a>), and 19 other images not used in this paper. As in the main experiment, images were approximately 2\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00b0 in size. In each 4 s trial, a single image was flashed using an 800 ms ON, 200 ms OFF duty cycle. During a run, each image was presented in one trial, and 11 blank trials were also included. Each run lasted 608 s (10.1 min), and a total of 10 runs were collected. During stimulus presentation, the subject performed a variant of the fixation task. A small dot (0.1\u00b0\u00d70.1\u00b0) was present at the center of the display and switched to one of five shades of red (ranging from (40,0,0) to (255,0,0) in five equally spaced increments) every 1200 ms (repetitions allowed). The subject was instructed to press a button whenever the luminance of the central dot increased and a different button whenever the luminance decreased."

Beta weights extracted from FFA and VWFA were then modeled using several variants of the Template model. Model accuracy was quantified using 20-fold cross-validation (random subsets of the stimuli). (1) The <i>Template model (original)</i> is the same model used in the main experiment (three free parameters). Importantly, the category template in the model is fixed and not adjusted to the new dataset. (2) The <i>Template model (half-max average)</i> is a simple extension of the Template model in which the category template is estimated as follows: on each cross-validation iteration, using only the training set, identify responses that are at least half of the maximum response and then compute the centroid (in the V1-like representation) of the stimuli corresponding to these responses (three free parameters plus nonparametric fitting of the template). Note that this procedure is cross-validated in the sense that the category template is fit only to the training set; whether the estimated category template generalizes to novel stimuli is an empirical question that is assessed through cross-validation. (3) The <i>Template model (half-max cluster)</i> further extends the model to accommodate multiple category templates. The logic is that just as V1 models use filters at multiple orientations and spatial scales to characterize the overall V1 response, we might conceptualize FFA and VWFA as containing multiple templates tuned to different types of stimuli (for\u00a0example, different face viewpoints, different fonts). First, we identify responses that are at least half of the maximum response from the training set. We then perform <i>k</i>-means clustering (in the V1-like representation) on the stimuli corresponding to these responses. We use a cosine metric to quantify distance, and we select the solution that minimizes cluster assignment error across 100 random initializations of centroid positions. The obtained centroids are unit-length normalized and then used as category templates in the Template model. For simplicity and to avoid overfitting, we compute the predicted response as a simple sum across the independent responses of different category templates and use the same parameter values (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> in <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>) for different templates. We systematically vary the number of clusters from 1 through 8, and select the number that maximizes cross-validation performance (four free parameters\u2014three for <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, one for the number of clusters\u2014plus nonparametric fitting of templates)."

They show that responses in human FFA and VWFA are strongly influenced by both stimulus properties and task demands. They also identify a region of the IPS as a source of attentional modulation of the VTC. Finally, they propose a template-matching model that can reasonably account for the observed bottom-up and top-down activity fluctuations in VTC. Given that analyses of these types of experimental data have typically been framed more qualitatively, the reviewers agree that a quantitative and rigorous modeling approach is certainly a welcome contribution. The model also is noted as having the virtue of simplicity."

For example, the category template model provides good fits to the fixation-response data across contrast and phase coherence. How does these fits depend on the Gabor filter bank, the category template, and/or the parameters available in the normalization step? Moreover, the authors conclude that a scaling mechanism is in place for amplification of VTC responses. The alternative models that they draw in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> seem to make qualitatively quite similar predictions. How do they arrive at the conclusion of which mechanism is most supported by the data? Formal model comparison would be useful. Finally, why don't the top-down and drift-diffusion models make use of the category template model that is fit to the fixation data? This seems like a missed opportunity. Is this because the model fits are poor or a technical limitation?"

The model transforms images into weightings of a V1-like representation (gabor wavelet pyramid) and then projects these onto a template for faces and text. This amounts to little more than putting a linear classifier on a V1 like representation, which would seem much too simplistic to account for known properties of invariance in high-order visual cortex to things like view angle, lighting, rotation, scale, etc. Moreover, how well can the model predict responses to non-template stimuli? Because the templates are built as the centroid of responses of the actual stimuli used, it is not surprising that it can explain the face and word responses. As the authors point out, the more important tests are for stimuli outside of those that the model is built on. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> the phase coherence manipulation (as well as noise and some alternative stimuli) are relevant. However, the phase coherence manipulation in the data of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> look more like a step function then what the model predicts, suggesting poor fits. Moreover, the supplementary data show that the only way to save the template model for a more general set of stimuli is to basically build the templates based on what stimuli evoked half-maximal response, which is like tweaking the templates to match the responses. While the legend mentions train and test sets, which would suggest cross-validation that might alleviate some of these concerns, the details are omitted. If train and test are different sets of responses to the same presentations of images, then the cross-validation would say more about the consistency in response then whether the model generalizes to new stimuli."

The category model has no contrast-sensitivity and thus gives a flat response across contrast in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. How much difference would there be between models, if you just allowed the category model to be contrast-sensitive? Likewise, the category model does seem to step for phase coherence, but no description was given for this; is this because at the lower phase coherences the stimulus category cannot be discerned? Also, how is it that some of the category model fits show some decrease in response as a function of contrast for the preferred category? In general, it would be useful to move some of the supplementary material that describes the performance of other models (including for the RT data) to the main text, since the model comparisons are of central importance to this study."

The IPS region was found using a search process that sought signals that could account for task effects. It is therefore not surprising to learn (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, bottom) that these signals well fit the data. Indeed, the r=0.96 fit is a bit worrying in this regard and suggests the possibility of over-fitting. Here are some options to rectify: a) Explicitly describe the fitting as a demonstration exercise, not to be taken as independent evidence of the role of the IPS; b) Obtain data from a new set of subjects, using the IPS region identified in the initial set of subjects to replicate the result."
