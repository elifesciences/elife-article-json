Migrating cells typically form filopodia that extend from the cell surface, but the precise function of these structures in cell polarization and guided migration is poorly understood. Using the in vivo model of zebrafish primordial germ cells for studying chemokine-directed single cell migration, we show that filopodia distribution and their dynamics are dictated by the gradient of the chemokine Cxcl12a. By specifically interfering with filopodia formation, we demonstrate for the first time that these protrusions play an important role in cell polarization by Cxcl12a, as manifested by elevation of intracellular pH and Rac1 activity at the cell front. The establishment of this polarity is at the basis of effective cell migration towards the target. Together, we show that filopodia allow the interpretation of the chemotactic gradient in vivo by directing single-cell polarization in response to the guidance cue."

Migrating cells typically form filopodia that extend from the cell surface, but the precise function of these structures in cell polarization and guided migration is poorly understood. Using the in vivo model of zebrafish primordial germ cells for studying chemokine-directed single cell migration, we show that filopodia distribution and their dynamics are dictated by the gradient of the chemokine Cxcl12a. By specifically interfering with filopodia formation, we demonstrate for the first time that these protrusions play an important role in cell polarization by Cxcl12a, as manifested by elevation of intracellular pH and Rac1 activity at the cell front. The establishment of this polarity is at the basis of effective cell migration towards the target. Together, we show that filopodia allow the interpretation of the chemotactic gradient in vivo by directing single-cell polarization in response to the guidance cue."

The process of migration is also at the basis of pathological conditions such as inflammation and cancer metastasis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</a>). Migrating cells generate finger-like cellular extensions that contain parallel actin-bundles (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mallavarapu and Mitchison, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2009</a>), termed filopodia, that constitute a characteristic feature of metastasizing cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Machesky, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arjonen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pan et al., 2011</a>). It has been proposed that filopodia transport signalling molecules to neighbouring cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sanders et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Roy et al., 2014</a>), promote adhesion and are therefore important for generation of traction forces (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albuschies and Vogel, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fierro-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013</a>) and serve as a sensing organelle (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib58\">Wood and Martin, 2002</a>]). The latter notion arose from functional studies that were carried out in vitro and involved manipulations that could have affected different processes in addition to filopodia formation in chemotrophic growth cones (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zheng et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rajnicek et al., 2006</a>). Other studies demonstrated an EGF retrograde transport on protrusions of epidermoid carcinoma cells in culture (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lidke et al., 2005</a>), although the functional significance of the findings was not explored. Consistent with a role in sensing, filopodia formation was observed in response to VEGF that directs angiogenic sprouting (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gerhardt et al., 2003</a>), to FGF that instructs branching morphogenesis in the tracheal system (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ribeiro et al., 2002</a>), as well as in response to morphogen signals in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roy et al., 2011</a>). In the context of group cell migration, inhibiting filopodia formation decreased the migration velocity, yet the cellular basis for this effect has not been further investigated (<a href=\"#bib38\">Phng et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, it was suggested that the migration of neural crest cells as streams require filopodia function, since a neuronal crest subset failed to migrate properly in zebrafish mutants that lacked the <i>fascin1a</i> gene whose actin bundling function is required for filopodia formation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boer et al., 2015</a>). Nevertheless, the precise consequence of impaired filopodia formation in migrating single cells in vivo and the mechanism underlying their action during normal migration in the context of the intact tissue have thus far not been reported. As a useful in vivo model for exploring the regulation and function of filopodia in cell migration, we employed zebrafish Primordial germ cells (PGCs). These cells perform long-range migration as single cells within a complex environment from the position where they are specified towards their target (<a href=\"#bib42\">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tarbashevich and Raz, 2010</a>). PGC migration is guided by the chemokine Cxcl12a that binds Cxcr4b, which is expressed on the surface of these cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Doitsidou et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Knaut et al., 2003</a>). This specific receptor-ligand pair has been shown to control among other processes, stem-cell homing (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chute, 2006</a>), cancer metastasis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zlotnik, 2008</a>) and inflammation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Werner et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, similar to other migrating cells types in normal and disease contexts, zebrafish PGCs form filopodia, protrusions whose precise function in guided migration has thus far not been characterized."

We demonstrate that PGCs guided by Cxcl12a form more filopodia at the cell front, filopodia that exhibit higher dynamics and play a critical role in receiving and transmitting the polarized signal. Specifically, we show that the short-lived actin-rich filopodia formed at the front of cells migrating within a Cxcl12a gradient are essential for conferring polar pH distribution and Rac1 activity in response to the guidance cue, thus facilitating effective cell polarization and advance in the correct direction. Together, these results provide novel insights into the role of filopodia in chemokine-guided single cell migration, underlining their function in orienting cell migration."

To define the mechanisms that could contribute to the apparent polarity of migrating PGCs, we first measured the distribution of Cxcr4b on the cell membrane around the cell perimeter. Similar to findings in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells, in which the guidance receptor is evenly distributed around the cell membrane (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ueda et al., 2001</a>) and consistent with our previous results (<a href=\"#bib33\">Minina et al., 2007</a>), the level of a GFP-tagged Cxcr4b (expressed at low amounts that do not affect the migration) measured at the cell front and its back was similar (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Furthermore, the receptor turnover on the plasma membrane, as visualized by a Cxcr4b tandem fluorescent timer (tft) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</a>) expressed in PGCs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>), which are directed by the endogenous Cxcl12a gradient (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), did not reveal a significant difference between the front and the back of the cell. Together, employing the tools described above, we could not detect an asymmetric receptor distribution or differential turnover around the cell perimeter of PGCs in the wild type situation. These findings prompted us to explore qualitative and quantitative differences between the cell front and back, specifically by examining cellular structures that could contribute to the polarity of Cxcr4b signalling."

Filopodia-like structures devoid of F-actin were previously described (<a href=\"#bib38\">Phng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2009</a>)."

A characteristic wild type PGC is presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, showing polarized formation of an array of filopodia pointing in the direction of migration (arrow in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For a quantitative measure of this finding, we categorized the position of filopodia around the circumference of the PGCs as front, back or side filopodia as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013A\u2034</a>. We found that at any given time point, migrating PGCs show on average 5.6 \u00b1 0.5 filopodia, with a strong bias for filopodia generation at the cell front (wild type in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Whereas filopodia formed preferentially at the cell front, their distribution was independent of that of the forming blebs. Specifically, we found that blebs can form in parts of the cells where filopodia are not present (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>, red asterisk in 40\u2033, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) and conversely, filopodia were maintained close to a forming bleb (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>, arrowheads in 20\u2033, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

Interestingly, the dynamic parameters (persistence and length) were dramatically different between filopodia at the front and back of the cell.

                                "text": "Since PGCs migrate towards regions expressing higher levels of Cxcl12a and filopodia formation is biased in the same direction, we sought to determine whether Cxcl12a in the environment influences the generation of filopodia. To this end, we analysed filopodia distribution and their dynamics in <i>med</i><sup><i>NY05</i></sup> embryos lacking functional Cxcl12a (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). PGCs in <i>med</i><sup><i>NY054</i></sup> embryos show a dramatic increase in the number of filopodia (11.4 \u00b1 0.8, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, whole cell) relative to wild type (5.6 \u00b1 0.5, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, whole cell). PGCs in <i>med</i><sup><i>NY054</i></sup> embryos also show an even distribution of filopodia around the cell circumference, which is in sharp contrast to the polar distribution observed in the wild type embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Similar results were obtained upon disruption of the Cxcl12a/Cxcr4b signalling pathway by morpholino-mediated Cxcr4b knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Strikingly, irrespective of their position around the cell perimeter, filopodia of PGCs in <i>med</i><sup><i>NY054</i></sup> embryos revealed average persistence (51 \u00b1 3.1 s, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, whole cell) and maximum lengths (3.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, whole cell) similar to filopodia located at the back of wild type PGCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, wild type). Filopodia of PGCs in <i>med</i><sup><i>NY054</i></sup> embryos also included a higher frequency of those with no detectable actin, thus exhibiting further similarities to filopodia in the back of wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Next, we examined the effect of a uniform Cxcl12a distribution on filopodia formation. Here, we injected <i>cxcl12a</i> RNA into <i>med</i><sup><i>NY054</i></sup> embryos at a concentration, which is sufficient to interfere with PGC arrival at their target region in wild type embryos, but does not immobilize them (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In these experiments we co-injected morpholino against <i>cxcr7b</i>, the somatic decoy receptor for Cxcl12a (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boldajipour et al., 2008</a>), to avoid any local decrease in Cxcl12 levels that would result in gradient formation. Similar to the results observed in <i>med</i><sup><i>NY054</i></sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <i>med</i><sup><i>NYO54</i></sup> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, control), numerous, evenly distributed filopodia appeared on the cell surface of PGCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>, <i>cxcl12a</i>) and their persistence (58 \u00b1 3.0 s), as well as their maximum length (4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m) was significantly elevated to the same extent as filopodia in <i>med</i><sup><i>NYO54</i></sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). We conclude therefore, that the graded distribution of Cxcl12 determines the number, the distribution and the dynamic behaviour of filopodia around the PGC circumference."

We focused on the formation of filopodia as the PGCs switch from random to directed migration upon exposure to the chemokine gradient. A steep Cxcl12a gradient was generated in <i>med</i><sup><i>NYO54</i></sup> embryos by transplanting mCherry-labelled cells that were treated with c<i>xcr7b</i> morpholino and expressed either <i>cxcl12a</i> or control RNA (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). PGCs exposed to the control transplant generated randomly distributed filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and were not attracted to the transplanted cells (see <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a> control transplant, with snapshots presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, 2/23 cells migrated towards the transplant). In contrast, measuring the angle of filopodia to a Cxcl12a-expressing transplant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) we observed that PGCs exhibited gradual polarization of filopodia directed towards the attractant source. The biased filopodia orientation was followed by cell polarization (blue arrow in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) as manifested by the elongation of the cell along the axis of migration, positioning of the golgi to the back of the cell (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and migration towards the chemokine source (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, Cxcl12a transplant, with snapshots presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> of a single cell representing 15/17 cells that showed this response). These experiments show that PGCs respond to the Cxcl12a gradient first by formation of filopodia oriented towards the Cxcl12a source and then by cell polarization and migration in the direction of the chemokine."

Interestingly, cells migrating within an unmodified environment behaved similarly to those responding to artificial gradients. Specifically, in cases where migrating PGCs performed sharp turns, polarized filopodia formation preceded the change in migration direction (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Taken together, the observed PGC response to an artificial and endogenous chemokine gradient is consistent with the idea that filopodia formation constitutes an early response to distribution of Cxcl12 that is followed by cell polarization and directed migration."

This observation may imply that filopodia could play a role in the transmission of the Cxcl12a signal into the leading edge of the cell by locally increasing the surface area for ligand binding. To address this notion, we overexpressed fluorescently labelled Cxcl12a in cell clones within the embryo (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and followed its distribution relative to the cells and particularly, to the filopodia. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, Cxcl12a-Venus foci that were initially detected on the cell surface were subsequently internalized into the cell. Strikingly, a similar interaction between Cxcl12 foci and PGCs was observed on the surface of filopodia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Binding of Cxcl12 was observed at the tip of a filopodium (red arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) that extended about 12 \u00b5m away from the cell body, as well as closer to the cell body (yellow arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Retraction of the filopodium resulted in dragging of the distant Cxcl12 focus to the cell body and a bleb forming at this location engulfs the closer Cxcl12 focus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The internalization of Cxcl12a-Venus (yellow arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) is consistent with the idea that the ligand interacts with its receptor Cxcr4b on the filopodia membrane and elicits a signal directing cell polarization relevant for cell migration in the direction dictated by the chemotactic gradient. Whereas the filopodia at the cell front are more dynamic and higher in number, consistent with the uniform distribution of Cxcr4b on the cell membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we could detect interaction of overexpressed Venus-labelled Cxcl12 with filopodia at the back of the cell as well (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013A<b>\u2033</b></a>)."

For that purpose, we initially employed the insulin receptor substrate protein 53 (Irsp53), a key protein in the process of filopodia formation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Krugmann et al., 2001</a>). The Irsp53 protein contains an <span class=\"underline\">I</span>nverse-<span class=\"underline\">B</span>in-<span class=\"underline\">A</span>mphiphysin-<span class=\"underline\">R</span>vs (I-BAR) domain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mattila et al., 2007</a>) that promotes membrane deformation and includes actin binding sites (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yamagishi et al., 2004</a>). The protein also contains a partial CRIB motif for Cdc42-GTP mediated activation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Govind et al., 2001</a>) and an SH3 domain for interaction with additional filopodia regulators such as Mena (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krugmann et al., 2001</a>), Eps8 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vaggi et al., 2011</a>), mDia1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goh et al., 2012</a>), WAVE2 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goh et al., 2012</a>), N-WASP (<a href=\"#bib36\">Oh et al., 2013</a>), Lin7 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crespi et al., 2012</a>) and WIRE (<a href=\"#bib34\">Misra et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We found that the expression pattern of <i>irsp53</i> mRNA in zebrafish embryos spans the relevant early stages during which PGCs migrate. Specifically, <i>irsp53</i> RNA is maternally provided and ubiquitously present in 1-hr post fertilization (hpf) embryos, as well as at later stages (6 and 10 hpf, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We also found that an Irsp53-mCherry fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) was expressed in the cytoplasm and importantly, in filopodia (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, upper panel and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), particularly in those located at the cell front. The expression pattern of <i>irsp53</i> RNA and the subcellular localization of the Irsp53 fusion protein to filopodia are therefore consistent with the possibility that Irsp53 plays a role in filopodia formation in migrating PGCs."

Moreover, expression of the DN Irsp53 version in PGCs resulted in a significant decrease in filopodia number at the cell front (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). However, inhibition of Irsp53 function had no effect on filopodia formation in <i>med</i><sup><i>NY054</i></sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>), in which the filopodia exhibit posterior characteristics (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

AFAP1L1 was shown to play a role in tumour metastasis and to constitute a cancer prognostic marker (<a href=\"#bib15\">Furu et al., 2011</a>), to be localised to invadosomes and along with cortactin, to podosomes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Snyder et al., 2011</a>). AFAP1L1 contains two PH domains that serve as a link to the membrane, a serine-threonin-rich substrate domain (SD) in between, a leucine zipper (Lzip), an actin-binding domain (ABD) at the C- terminus, as well as one SH3 and two SH2 domains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Snyder et al., 2011</a>). While AFAP1L1 had not been previously implicated in filopodia formation, its subcellular localization in PGCs was intriguing and prompted our following investigation. Namely, when an mCherry-tagged version of Afap1L1a (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) was expressed in PGCs, it was found to be specifically enriched at the base of most filopodia (84 \u00b1 9.7%) at the level of the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), suggesting a function for the protein in filopodia formation or maintenance. We subsequently ascertained that <i>afap1l1a</i> RNA is expressed at the time at which PGCs migrate towards their target and showed that <i>afap1l1a</i> RNA is maternally provided and is uniformly expressed during early embryonic development (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

Remarkably, overexpression of the protein resulted in a significant increase in filopodia number as compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, whole cell). Furthermore, this treatment changed the distribution of the filopodia significantly, resulting in a decrease in filopodia number at the cell front and an increase in number at the sides and back of the cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>), effectively reversing the normal distribution of filopodia in the cell. Based on their increased persistence and length (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), the filopodia formed by cells overexpressing Afap1L1a were of the type generated at the back of PGCs. Similar to the Irsp53 effect, overexpression of Afap1L1a did not significantly alter bleb formation at the PGC front in embryos lacking the guidance cue (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that Afap1L1 could serve as a specific tool for manipulating the formation of filopodia in PGCs."

                                "text": "Since manipulating Irsp53 and Afap1L1a function in PGCs altered filopodia distribution and number, we were in a position to probe into the functional significance of the polar formation of filopodia as potential sensors of the guidance cue. To this end, we made use of our recent findings showing that in response to a graded Cxcl12a concentration in the environment, zebrafish PGCs exhibit increased pH at the cell front (7% higher on the logarithmic pH scale, reflecting difference of 15% at the level of H<sup>+</sup> concentration). This polar pH elevation could control the activity of various proteins important for cell motility (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stock and Schwab, 2009</a>) and in the case of PGCs, was shown to be essential for a local increase in the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 and thus, for directing actin polymerization to the cell front (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</a>). The loss of the Cxcl12a gradient leads the loss of the difference in pH between the cell front and its rear (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</a>). We reasoned that if filopodia were indeed important for Cxcl12 sensing, they should be functionally linked to pH elevation and Rac1 activity at the front of PGCs. To test this possibility, we first performed FRET-based pH measurements in cells in which filopodia formation was manipulated as described above. Strikingly, the reduction of filopodia formation at the cell front reduced (in the case of Irsp53), or abolished (in the case of the Afap1L1a) the increased pH at the leading edge (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Conversely, inhibiting the relative elevation of pH at the cell front by inhibiting the translation of the Carbonic anhydrase 15b (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</a>) had no effect on filopodia formation (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). To determine whether the reduction of filopodia formation at the cell front had any effect on Rac1 activity, we expressed a FRET-based Rac1 activity reporter in cells overexpressing Afap1L1a. Importantly, as compared with control cells, Rac1 activity was significantly reduced in these cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). A milder effect on the difference between the front and rear pH, as induced by DN Irsp53 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) could affect different proteins important for cell motility (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stock and Schwab, 2009</a>), but was not associated with a significant reduction in Rac1 activity as judged by the FRET level. Consistent with the idea that filopodia function upstream of the Cxcl12a signalling cascade, expression of a constitutively activated version of Rac1 (Rac1<sup>V12</sup>) in germ cells (that stop migrating as a result) had no effect on filopodia formation beyond the increase in their numbers observed in cells rendered immotile (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). These results suggest that when filopodia function at the cell front is hindered, the ability of the PGCs to effectively sense the chemokine gradient is impaired, as reflected by the lack of elevated pH and by the reduced Rac1 activity at the leading edge. These results are also consistent with the idea that as a cellular structure, filopodia function in controlling intracellular pH at the cell front and are formed independent of it."

The inhibition of front filopodia mediated by DN Irsp53 appears therefore to impair sensing of the Cxcl12 guidance cue as reflected by the altered characteristics of the migration route.

These differences in filopodia distribution and dynamics are governed by the graded distribution of the chemokine in the environment. The basis for this notion is the finding that filopodia formation in PGCs migrating within embryos lacking Cxcl12a was altered in a similar manner to that observed under conditions where the chemokine is uniformly expressed."

The formation of filopodia precedes further polarization such as directed bleb formation and onset of migration towards the chemoattractant source. A similar phenomenon was observed in neuronal growth cones, which respond to a glutamate gradient by an asymmetric distribution of filopodia prior to turning, in an in vitro setting (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zheng et al., 1996</a>). Similarly, endothelial tip cells of the early postnatal retina in mice respond to a source of VEGF by filopodia formation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gerhardt et al., 2003</a>) and RhoD-activated fibroblasts extend cytoneme-like protrusions towards an FGF source in vitro (<a href=\"#bib21\">Koizumi et al., 2012</a>). Whereas these observations were consistent with the idea that polarized filopodia formation constitutes a response to a guidance cue, the relevance for directed cell migration was not known. Our finding that the chemokine appears to bind and be transported on the filopodium, followed by internalization, is consistent with the idea that filopodia function in Cxcl12a uptake and in increasing the surface relevant for this action at the cell front. In this study, we carried out specific manipulations affecting filopodia formation and show an adverse effect on the ability of migrating single cells to respond to Cxcl12a by directional migration. The effect of specifically decreasing filopodia formation at the cell front (by inhibiting Irsp53 function) resulted in inefficient propagation of the external signal into the cell as evidenced by the strong reduction in the difference between the pH at the cell front and its back. In the same direction, overexpression of the Afap1L1 protein erased the normal front-back polarity with respect to filopodia distribution. In the absence of polar distribution of filopodia in the direction of the attractive cue, the cells could not effectively detect the graded chemokine cue, establish a stable front and thus, did not elevate the pH and Rac1 activity at the leading edge. These effects on the characteristic front-back cell polarity impaired the directional migration in response to a guidance cue, culminating in ectopic localization of the cells at the end of the migration process."

These filopodia extend in the direction of higher chemokine concentration and expand the surface for Cxcl12a binding, thereby further enhancing Cxcr4b signalling at the cell front and effectively enhancing the absolute differences in ligand levels detected along the front-back axis of the cell. We suggest that the positive feedback loop presented in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> allows the PGCs to interpret shallow gradients by forming a front that is more sensitive to the guidance cue. The uneven receptor activation along the back\u2013front axis of the cell that includes the filopodia is a prerequisite for the establishment of the intracellular elevated pH at the cell front that facilitates actin polymerization at this location (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</a>) leading to functional polarization of the cell. Under conditions of no, or uniform activation of Cxcr4b a cell front is not established. In such cases, the positive feedback loop that normally stabilizes the front in one aspect of the migrating cell is not present, affecting cell polarity and the features of migration in the direction of the chemokine source."

The enhanced signalling at the cell front results in further Irsp53 activation (5) and an elevation of pH (6). The increase in pH in turn, leads to an elevation in Rac1 activity at this aspect of the cell (7). Once established, the front inhibits other parts of the cell from assuming front characteristics including dynamic filopodia formation, elevated pH and Rac1 activation (8). Lower panels\u2014Irsp53 inhibition or Afap1L1a overexpression result in loss of dynamic filopodia at the cell front, abrogating the local increase in pH.

Anterior filopodia, in turn are required for receiving the cxcl12a signal that then polarizes the cell. They also conclude that there are two kinds of filopodia: some that are chemokine dependent and others that are not.

To this end, we examined the persistence of individual filopodia in 10-minute time-lapse movies, while monitoring for engulfment of filopodia by advancing blebs. First, only a third of the filopodia that extended at the cell front, are engulfed by inflating blebs. Still, the persistence of the remaining front filopodia in cells guided by physiological Cxcl12 gradients is lower than that of filopodia at the back of the cell.

Wild type PGCs that sense a gradient of Cxcl12a respond by elevation of the pH at the cell front, which leads to an increase in Rac1 activity at this location. Manipulating the distribution of the filopodia, such that their number at the cell front is reduced, adversely affects the efficiency with which the PGCs can perceive the chemokine signal and interpret it as a graded one. As a consequence, the establishment of higher pH at the cell front is hindered. Afap1L1 overexpression leads to a relative increase in filopodia number at the back of cells. Those cells encounter higher levels of the chemokine at their front, but are defective in perceiving the signal. The back aspect of the cell, while possessing more filopodia encounters less of the chemokine. We thus interpret the results such that Afap1L1 overexpressing cells with \u201cless efficient front-more efficient back\u201d simply fails to form the Cxcl12a-dependent intracellular polarization in the distribution of the pH. The increase in filopodia in the back did not win over the front but rather cancelled out the cell polarity that is normally induced by the chemotactic signal in the front."

We interpret the results to indicate that front filopodia contain a higher concentration of actin, such that it is always detected but have no information concerning an actual functional significance of the difference. We consider however low-actin filopodia a characteristic of back filopodia. As expected from the more posterior nature of filopodia formed in <i>medusa</i> mutants, the fraction of filopodia in which no lifeact could be detected is indeed elevated (now presented in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>)."

We do not believe the back filopodia cannot function in Cxcl12a-binding, since the receptor Cxcr4b is uniformly expressed around the cell circumference. Indeed, in data we provide in the revised version of the work (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1A'-A''</a>) ligand binding to back filopodia can be observed as well. This finding is now mentioned in the Results section."
