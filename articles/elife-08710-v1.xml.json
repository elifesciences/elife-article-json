This bacterium is a common cause of throat infections in humans, but it can also cause more serious, and sometimes life-threatening, infections. Similar thioester bonds were already known as the highly reactive \u2018warheads\u2019 of the complement proteins that are involved in the human immune system. As such, the obvious, but unproven, implication was that <i>S. pyogenes</i> had evolved similar weaponry to attack its human host."

Next, they expressed 12 of these putative thioester-containing protein domains (which they called TEDs for short) and solved the three-dimensional structures for four of them using X-ray crystallography. They then used mass spectrometry to confirm that the proteins contained thioester bonds, as predicted; the bonds could also be seen in the crystal structures."

For this purpose, Walden, Edwards et al. decided to focus on SfbI\u2014a TED-containing protein from <i>S. pyogenes</i>\u2014because it had been reported to bind to the human protein fibrinogen."

Walden, Edwards et al. found that SfbI could irreversibly bind to isolated fibrinogen, and even pull fibrinogen out of a mixture of proteins found in blood plasma. Both of these activities depended on SfbI's thioester bond, and importantly, no other proteins were pulled down from the blood plasma."

Fibrinogen is converted into long fibres of fibrin during blood clotting, and bacterial cells (<i>Lactococcus lactis</i>) that were engineered to express SfbI also bound to fibrin via the reactive thioester bond. Finally, Walden, Edwards et al. turned to whole-cell experiments, using a human cell line that mimics inflammation.

This is in complete contrast to other known methods of adhesion, which typically rely on the combined strength of many weaker non-covalent interactions. The cysteine\u2013glutamine thioester bond breaks, and a new bond then forms between the glutamine and its target\u2014a reaction that Walden, Edwards et al. liken to the firing of a \u2018chemical harpoon\u2019. The molecules targeted by TEDs are likely to vary, since the protein sequences of most TEDs share very little in common. Indeed, of the TEDs tested so far, only SfbI bound specifically to fibrinogen. But the fundamental principle uncovered here seems widespread."

Complement proteins are thought to react with the surface of pathogens, and irreversibly tag them for elimination by the host's immune system. These proteins (and related protease inhibitors) are evolutionarily ancient, but are the only known proteins with integral thioester bonds (<a href=\"#bib5\">Levashina et al., 2001</a>). In these proteins, the thioester is usually buried inside the structure, and is only activated when a large conformational change exposes it (<a href=\"#bib1\">Janssen et al., 2006</a>). The bacterial TEDs, in contrast, have a completely different shape and no such control mechanism. Instead, the cysteine\u2013glutamine bond is partially covered by adjacent loops of the protein chain that likely limit its reactivity."
