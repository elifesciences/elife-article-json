Here we report that the homologous voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels also exhibit high temperature sensitivity comparable to that of TRPV1, which is detectable under specific conditions when the voltage sensor is functionally decoupled from the activation gate through either intrinsic mechanisms or mutations. Interestingly, mutations could tune Shaker channel to be either heat-activated or heat-deactivated. Therefore, high temperature sensitivity is intrinsic to both TRP and Kv channels. Our findings suggest important physiological roles of heat-induced variation in Kv channel activities. Mechanistically our findings indicate that temperature-sensing TRP channels may not contain a specialized heat-sensor domain; instead, non-obligatory allosteric gating permits the intrinsic heat sensitivity to drive channel activation, allowing temperature-sensitive TRP channels to function as polymodal nociceptors."

Sensing the heat given off by an object or the temperature of the environment is possible, at least in part, because of proteins called temperature-sensitive TRP ion channels. These proteins are found in the cell membranes of nerve endings that are underneath the skin; and they open in response to heat, allowing ions to flow into the nerve cell. This in turn triggers a nerve impulse that is sent to our central nervous system and is perceived as heat and/or pain."

This is because parts of the ion channel\u2014which act like a \u2018voltage sensor\u2019 and only shift when the membrane voltage changes\u2014normally keep the channel closed and directly open the channel when they move. Like all other proteins, ion channels are made from smaller building blocks called amino acids; and by changing some of the amino acids in the voltage-gated channel Yang and Zheng could decouple these normally linked actions. The changes to the channel meant that it did not immediately open when the voltage sensor moved; and decreasing the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell had the same effect as changing these amino acids. Both approaches revealed that, after a change in membrane voltage caused the voltage sensor to move, the ion channel remained closed until a high temperature caused it to open. Yang and Zheng revealed that the response of the modified voltage-gated channel to temperature was comparable to that of a typical heat-sensitive TRP ion channel."

While Hodgkin and Huxley showed more than 60 years ago that temperature could profoundly influence membrane excitability (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</a>), it is in general not well understood how heat affects membrane excitability and how temperature-dependent changes in neuronal activity contribute to physiology. Neuronal action potentials are generated and modulated by a precise combination of ionic currents produced by the activity of ion channels. Activation of ion channels in turn is the result of complex conformational rearrangements in channel protein controlled by specific physical or chemical stimuli (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hille, 2001</a>). Heat contributes to activation energy for channel conformational changes, through which it regulates channel activity and the shape of action potential (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rodriguez et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liang et al., 2009</a>). For most ion channels, thermal energy affects the rate of conformational transitions by 2-to-5 folds per 10\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pusch et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rodriguez et al., 1998</a>). Within the physiological temperature range, thermal energy alone was found to be generally insufficient to initiate channel activation. Among the exceptions are a group of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels including TRPV1-4, TRPM8, TRPM3, TRPM4, TRPM5, TRPC5, and TRPA1. These channels are potently activated by heat in the absence of another stimulus and hence serve as key cellular temperature sensors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clapham, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zheng, 2013</a>). How these TRP channels respond to heat with exquisite sensitivity, however, remains mysterious."

As members of the tetrameric cation channel superfamily, TRP channels and Kv channels are structurally similar. They all have six transmembrane segments, with the S1 to S4 segments forming an isolated peripheral domain surrounding the ion-permeating pore composed of S5, S6, and the loop between them. Comparison of the crystal structures of Kv channels (<a href=\"#bib37\">Long et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2007</a>) and the cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liao et al., 2013</a>) further shows that detailed structural features of these two types of channels are also very similar. However, the two types of channels are functionally distinct. Kv channels are activated by membrane depolarization with a steep voltage dependence (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sigworth, 1994</a>), while TRP channels are only weakly activated at highly depolarized voltages (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zheng, 2013</a>). More importantly, unlike the temperature-sensitive TRP channels, Kv channels cannot be directly activated by changes in temperature, and the activity of Kv channels are generally considered to be not very heat-sensitive (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rodriguez et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cui et al., 2012</a>). The differences lead to the widely accepted assumption that through evolution some TRP channels have acquired specific protein structures that serve as a \u2018heat sensor\u2019. In the present study we tested this hypothesis by examining the temperature response of Kv channels."

As a voltage-gated channel, Shaker activates upon depolarization to about \u221260 mV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The threshold voltage for activation was only slightly shifted by raising temperature. The average <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> value remained low, at below 4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lower panel). Low temperature sensitivity is anticipated for Shaker and many other Kv channels, because opening and closing of the ion permeation pore in these channels is obligatorily coupled to movement of the voltage-sensor controlled by the membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sigworth, 1994</a>). At hyperpolarized voltages, the channel is locked in the initial closed state (C, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), in which the voltage-sensor is kept in the down conformation. A strongly voltage-dependent transition, involving the movement of \u223c13 e<sub>0</sub> gating charges across the transmembrane electric field (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schoppa et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zagotta et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996</a>), moves the channel to another closed state, C\u2032, from which it can transition to the open state, O, with little voltage dependence. Since thermal energy is insufficient to supply the activation energy for voltage-sensor to overcome transmembrane voltage, opening of the channel is dictated by the membrane potential.

It is intriguing that this is the voltage range at which the voltage-sensor starts to move, permitting the C\u2192C\u2032 transition. This can be seen in the voltage dependence of gating charge movement (Q-V curve, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Since it has been previously suggested that the voltage-dependent transition in TRPV1 is highly temperature-sensitive (<a href=\"#bib54\">Voets et al., 2004</a>), we wondered whether the transient <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> increase in Shaker might reflect temperature sensitivity of the voltage-sensor movement.

Removing Ca<sup>2+</sup> shifts the voltage range for channel activation, substantially increasing the separation between G-V and Q-V curves (<a href=\"#bib27\">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</a>). The change is achieved mainly through a dual-allosteric coupling between the C\u2032\u2192O transition and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage induced transitions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</a>). We observed two interesting effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal on the transient <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> increase. First, it substantially shifted the voltage range at which the transient <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> increase occurred, to around +100 mV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

This \u2018slippage\u2019 in coupling relaxes the obligatory gating by voltage, increasing the probability of transitioning from C into C\u2032 at mild depolarization (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shin et al., 2004</a>). In other words, CSI simultaneously makes Kv2.1 and Kv4.3 more TRPV1-like in both voltage- and heat-dependent activation. The <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> increase peaked at roughly \u221270 to \u221250 mV, where the probability of the channels being not open but in the CSI state was high (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Under such condition, both channels could be strongly heat-activated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In contrast to Kv2.1 and Kv4.3, the less temperature-sensitive Shaker channel does not undergo CSI (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aldrich, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fineberg et al., 2012</a>), so that its voltage-sensor is always obligatorily coupled to the activation gate, preventing the gate being activated by heat. To rule out the possibility that transient <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> increase was produced by artificial non-equilibrium gating generated by the voltage ramp protocol, we repeated the experiment with Kv2.1 using a much slower ramp protocol (from 200 ms to 1 s duration) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

Consistent with the conclusions we postulate above, V2 also exhibited a noticeable <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> change at the voltage range for channel opening. Interestingly, we observed that instead of heat activation, the channel exhibited a heat-induced deactivation behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013J</a>).

This yielded <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> values less than 1, as seen in the cold-activated TRPM8 channel (<a href=\"#bib42\">McKemy et al., 2002</a>). It remains to be determined whether the heat-induced deactivation process in V2 reflects a reversal of the heat-induced activation process in wild-type Kv channels and ILT. It is nonetheless important to note that V2 and ILT differ by only a few amino acids (V2 contains L382V in the S4\u2013S5 linker; ILT contains V369I, I372L, and S376T in the S4 segment).

Similarly, any temperature-dependent change in activity of the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels may also have important consequence in membrane excitability.

At hyperpolarized voltages, the strong voltage dependence of the C\u2190\u2192C\u2032 equilibrium ensures that the channel resides in the initial C state, so that the temperature-sensitive transition C\u2032\u2192O\u2032 cannot occur.

From the Gibbs equation, \u0394<i>G</i> = \u0394<i>H</i> \u2212 <i>T</i>\u0394<i>S</i>, it is clear that large \u0394<i>H</i> and \u0394<i>S</i> values make free energy change associated with the activation process, \u0394<i>G</i>, to be highly temperature-dependent. It is generally assumed that the large enthalpic and entropic changes come from a substantial conformational rearrangement in the TRP channels. The existence of large conformational rearrangements has been directly detected using fluorescent tags in TRPV1 as well as the CLC chloride channels (whose common gating process is also highly temperature-sensitive) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pusch et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bykova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39a\">Ma et al., 2011</a>). Nonetheless, the structural and mechanistic basis for large conformational rearrangements in temperature-sensitive TRP channels remains unknown. Consequently, it has been highly controversial how these TRP channels sense heat. Here we show that in Kv channels the voltage-dependent C\u2192C\u2032 transition, representing movements of the voltage-sensor, is not specially temperature sensitive, in agreement with a previous study of the Shaker channel (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rodriguez et al., 1998</a>). Instead, the C\u2032\u2192O\u2032 transition, representing later activation transitions of the channel protein, yields the transient increase in <i>Q</i><sub><i>10</i></sub> when the obligatory voltage-sensor control is alleviated. We and others showed that temperature-sensitive TRP channels also behave like an allosteric protein (<a href=\"#bib33\">Latorre et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Matta and Ahern, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jara-Oseguera and Islas, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). High temperature sensitivity of TRP channels may also originate from the C\u2032\u2192O\u2032 transition. A previous study demonstrated, based on a simple two-state C\u2190\u2192O gating scheme, that heat strongly shifts the gating equilibrium by deferentially affecting the forward and backward transitions which are also weakly voltage-sensitive (<a href=\"#bib54\">Voets et al., 2004</a>). The origin of the voltage-sensitive process in TRPV1 and other TRP channels remains unclear. It is nonetheless becoming clear that an S4-type voltage-sensor seen in Kv channels does not exist in TRP channels. Since voltage is a poor activator for TRPV1 but heat is a strong activator, it is unlikely heat solely works through the voltage-dependent process to open TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Matta and Ahern, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2010</a>). In the context of Scheme I, it appears that the observation by <a href=\"#bib54\">Voets et al. (2004)</a> is applicable to the horizontal transition instead of the vertical transition. Our study indicates that TRPV1 is heat-sensitive at a broad voltage range because the C\u2192C\u2032 transition is weakly voltage-dependent and not obligatory."

It is thus possible that the highly temperature-sensitive process of TRPV1 may come from the pore opening process. Indeed, nearly all the known TRPV1 agonists interact directly or indirectly with the pore domain: H<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jordt et al., 2000</a>), spider toxin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>), and divalent cations (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahern et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Luebbert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cao et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2014</a>) from the extracellular side, and capsaicin and resiniferatoxin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Szallasi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jordt and Julius, 2002</a>) from the intracellular side. While capsaicin and resiniferatoxin bind to sites adjacent to the pore-forming domains, the cryo-EM data indicate that they induce channel activation by altering the pore conformation while leaving the S1\u2013S4 peripheral domains mostly unchanged (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liao et al., 2013</a>).

                        "text": "To serve as biological heat sensors, temperature-sensitive TRP channels need to fulfill two fundamental requirements. First, its activity must be highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Second, heat-induced activity cannot be dependent on the presence of another stimulus; specifically, heat activation must be able to occur when the sensory neuron is in the resting state (at hyperpolarized membrane potentials). As discussed above, the first requirement is fulfilled because channel activation is associated with large \u0394<i>H</i> and \u0394<i>S</i> originated from a substantial conformational rearrangement. Results from the present study argue that the second requirement is fulfilled because the occurrence of heat-induced conformational rearrangements is not controlled by the voltage-dependent transition (or other stimulus-induced transitions). Allosteric but non-obligatory coupling of multiple stimuli to the opening of channel pore allows TRP channels to serve as polymodal cellular sensors."

They find that several different potassium channels have the high temperature dependence characteristic of thermosensitive TRP channels, but only in certain voltage ranges where, the authors argue, activation is partially \u201cdecoupled\u201d to voltage sensors. The results are convincing and the similar behavior of several wild type and mutant channels gives considerable strength to the general principles. The overall conclusion is that high temperature sensitivity is not unique to TRP channels and in Kv channels becomes apparent when focusing on the activation transition (reflected in G-V) rather than the voltage sensor movement (Q-V)."

This is important because the voltage ramps are not ideal for studying voltage-gated channels, and it appears that the kinetics of channel activation and fast inactivation are also highly temperature-sensitive (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C-G</a>). For Kv4.3, the outward current is heat-deactivated while the inward current is heat-activated (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)! Note that the heat-deactivation of V2 mutant channels was only shown with the outward current. In this regard, the authors may wish to verify their major conclusion by investigating the temperature sensitivity of the outward currents at depolarizing voltages above Ek using physiological concentrations of extracellular K+ (i.e., 3-5 mM). Note that extracellular K+ would also have profound effects on C-type inactivation, which could be temperature-sensitive. We anticipate that these additional control experiments should be easily accomplished."

Their allosteric explanation could be more precisely formulated with a general state diagram. They should be able to estimate the relative energetic contributions of heat and voltage sensor charge movement to opening the channel. One way of thinking about the results is that heat can't affect open probability under conditions where it would have to \u201covercome\u201d the resting state influence of the voltage sensors, effectively having to \u201cdrag\u201d the voltage sensors to the active state. But at intermediate voltages some of the voltage sensors are already activated so that the energy supplied by heat can overcome the remaining resting voltage sensors. Similar thinking could be applied to the closed-state inactivation and to the voltage-sensor mutant channels."

For example, the phrase 'temperature sensing domain\u201d implies that there is a domain, like the voltage sensor domain, that moves in response to temperature changes rather than to a voltage jump. This is not an analogous situation. Best is to introduce the topic as one of protein conformational changes with temperature in general, that there is relatively little examination of the temperature dependence of gating in most of the &gt;300 channels, and then introduce the recent strong interest in temperature dependence in TRP channels. Don't oversimplify by saying that there are known domains that 'sense' delta T. You finally hit the right theme when you say \u201cour findings strongly indicate that the temperature-sensing TRP channels may not contain a specialized heat-sensor domain; instead, non-obligatory allosteric gating permits the intrinsic heat sensitivity to drive channel activation.\u201d This was pointed out by Clapham and Miller, PNAS, and it would be appropriate to reference it."

This is important because the voltage ramps are not ideal for studying voltage-gated channels, and it appears that the kinetics of channel activation and fast inactivation are also highly temperature-sensitive (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C-G</a>). For Kv4.3, the outward current is heat-deactivated while the inward current is heat-activated (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)! Note that the heat-deactivation of V2 mutant channels was only shown with the outward current. In this regard, the authors may wish to verify their major conclusion by investigating the temperature sensitivity of the outward currents at depolarizing voltages above Ek using physiological concentrations of extracellular K+ (i.e., 3-5 mM). Note that extracellular K+ would also have profound effects on C-type inactivation, which could be temperature-sensitive. We anticipate that these additional control experiments should be easily accomplished."

The ramp protocol indeed does not guarantee equilibrium gating, but it is very effective in illustrating the transient nature of Q10 changes over a wide voltage range. In response to the critique, we have now conducted the ramp experiments at a substantially slower ramping speed. We also repeated the experiments under condition that yielded an outward current, as suggested. Neither operation eliminated the large transient Q10 increase.

Their allosteric explanation could be more precisely formulated with a general state diagram. They should be able to estimate the relative energetic contributions of heat and voltage sensor charge movement to opening the channel. One way of thinking about the results is that heat can't affect open probability under conditions where it would have to \u201covercome\u201d the resting state influence of the voltage sensors, effectively having to \u201cdrag\u201d the voltage sensors to the active state. But at intermediate voltages some of the voltage sensors are already activated so that the energy supplied by heat can overcome the remaining resting voltage sensors. Similar thinking could be applied to the closed-state inactivation and to the voltage-sensor mutant channels."

The Kv channels we examined in the present study serve as examples (at various degrees) of this type of specialized channels."

For example, the phrase 'temperature sensing domain\u201d implies that there is a domain, like the voltage sensor domain, that moves in response to temperature changes rather than to a voltage jump. This is not an analogous situation. Best is to introduce the topic as one of protein conformational changes with temperature in general, that there is relatively little examination of the temperature dependence of gating in most of the &gt;300 channels, and then introduce the recent strong interest in temperature dependence in TRP channels. Don't oversimplify by saying that there are known domains that 'sense' delta T. You finally hit the right theme when you say \u201cour findings strongly indicate that the temperature-sensing TRP channels may not contain a specialized heat-sensor domain; instead, non-obligatory allosteric gating permits the intrinsic heat sensitivity to drive channel activation.\u201d This was pointed out by Clapham and Miller, PNAS, and it would be appropriate to reference it."

While the coupling between the voltage sensor and the gate is intensively studied in Kv channels, that of TRPV1 is much less clear. Existing studies (including our recently published study, JGP 2014) demonstrated that allosteric coupling between the voltage-dependent transition and the closed-to-open transition of the pore can be used to satisfactorily describe voltage-dependent gating of TRPV1. In particular, the coupling between voltage and channel activation is much weaker in TRPV1 than that in most Kv channels. This is evident in the low open probability TRPV1 can reach upon strong depolarization, as well as the fact that the channel can be activated by ligand and heat at hyperpolarized voltages. This difference and its potential implication in the activation mechanism are discussed in the revised manuscript in a speculative manner."
