Dna2 requires ssDNA ends, and is dependent on the ssDNA-binding protein Rpa, which controls cleavage polarity. Here we present the 2.3 \u00c5 structure of intact mouse Dna2 bound to a 15-nucleotide ssDNA. The nuclease active site is embedded in a long, narrow tunnel through which the DNA has to thread. The helicase domain is required for DNA binding but not threading. We also present the structure of a flexibly-tethered Dna2-Rpa interaction that recruits Dna2 to Rpa-coated DNA. We establish that a second Dna2-Rpa interaction is mutually exclusive with Rpa-DNA interactions and mediates the displacement of Rpa from ssDNA. This interaction occurs at the nuclease tunnel entrance and the 5\u2019 end of the Rpa-DNA complex. Hence, it only displaces Rpa from the 5\u2019 but not 3\u2019 end, explaining how Rpa regulates cleavage polarity."

Dna2 requires ssDNA ends, and is dependent on the ssDNA-binding protein Rpa, which controls cleavage polarity. Here we present the 2.3 \u00c5 structure of intact mouse Dna2 bound to a 15-nucleotide ssDNA. The nuclease active site is embedded in a long, narrow tunnel through which the DNA has to thread. The helicase domain is required for DNA binding but not threading. We also present the structure of a flexibly-tethered Dna2-Rpa interaction that recruits Dna2 to Rpa-coated DNA. We establish that a second Dna2-Rpa interaction is mutually exclusive with Rpa-DNA interactions and mediates the displacement of Rpa from ssDNA. This interaction occurs at the nuclease tunnel entrance and the 5\u2019 end of the Rpa-DNA complex. Hence, it only displaces Rpa from the 5\u2019 but not 3\u2019 end, explaining how Rpa regulates cleavage polarity."

In the first step, several enzymes trim one of the two DNA strands at each broken end to leave single stranded \u201ctails\u201d. Dna2 is one enzyme that is involved in making these tails, but it can only bind to single-stranded DNA so it only acts after another enzyme has made some initial cuts. The exposed single stranded DNA then searches for an intact copy of itself elsewhere in the genome, which promotes its repair. It is important that only one of the two DNA strands is trimmed at each end otherwise the repair will fail. A protein called Rpa is bound to the DNA and is required for Dna2 to correctly trim the DNA. However, it is not clear exactly how Rpa2 regulates Dna2."

The experiments show that Dna2 adopts a cylindrical shape with a tunnel through which the single-stranded DNA passes through. The region of Dna2 that is capable of trimming DNA \u2013 which is called the nuclease domain \u2013 is embedded within the tunnel. The entrance to the tunnel is too narrow to allow double-stranded DNA to enter, so this explains why Dna2 can only act on double-stranded DNA that already has a small single-stranded section at the end."

These enzymes also act in a similar way to trim DNA before it is copied in preparation for cell division. Zhou et al.\u2019s findings provide an explanation for how Rpa determines which strand of DNA is trimmed by Dna2. Further work is needed to understand how Dna2 and Rpa work with other enzymes to trim DNA."

Most flaps are cleaved by Fen1 concomitant with their generation by strand displacement during Pol \u03b4 synthesis on the lagging strand. Flaps that escape early cleavage, or those extended by the Pif1 helicase, get long enough to be coated by the Replication Protein A (Rpa), which renders them resistant to Fen1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bae et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pike et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stith et al., 2008</a>).

The requirement for DNA threading prompted us to investigate how Dna2 gains access to Rpa-coated DNA. We provide the structure of a complex between a Dna2 \u03b1 helix and the Rpa70 OBN domain, both of which are flexibly-tethered and likely serve to recruit Dna2 to Rpa. We also establish a second Dna2-Rpa interaction that helps to displace Rpa from the 5\u2019 DNA end, explaining how Rpa restricts the cleavage polarity of Dna2."

In addition, the structure reveals an OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding) fold domain N-terminal to the nuclease domain, and a \u03b2 barrel domain that occurs between the nuclease and helicase domains and which is held in place by a stalk of two long alpha helices (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

The base of the cylinder is formed by the nuclease domain, which adopts a doughnut-like structure with the active site embedded in the central tunnel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The \u03b2 barrel and helicase 1A domains pack on top of the nuclease doughnut and extend the cylinder and central tunnel. The helicase 2A domain, which packs with the 1A domain as in the ADP states of other SF1 helicase structures, hangs over the tunnel opening at the top of the cylinder. Most of the DNA-binding sites of the nuclease and helicase 1A domains are inside the tunnel, whereas those of the helicase 2A domain are solvent exposed. The OB domain decorates the exterior of the nuclease domain, and is uninvolved in DNA binding. The nuclease domain is the hub that organizes the overall structure. It packs with the flanking OB and \u03b2 barrel-stalk domains, as well as the helicase 1B domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

A 7-nt segment at the 5\u2019 end contacts first the helicase 2A domain outside the tunnel and then the 1A domain inside the tunnel. The DNA crosses over from the helicase to the nuclease domains over the next two nucleotides, which are in the vicinity of the \u03b2 barrel domain in the middle of the tunnel, but do not make any protein contacts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The subsequent 6-nt segment binds to the nuclease domain. Here, the first three nucleotides are fully enclosed by the tunnel, while the last three nucleotides contact the tunnel opening. The DNA bases stack continuously, except for a base step at the helicase, one at the nuclease and one at the transition between the two domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Two of the three unstacked base steps are at pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairs, and this may contribute to the DNA binding at a well-defined register. An N-terminal acidic/amphipathic \u03b1 helix (\u03b11; residues 1 to 13) packs with the helicase domain of a symmetry-related complex. The \u03b11 helix is flexibly tethered to the rest of the protein, as the 6 residues that connect it to the OB domain have no electron density in the crystals. As shown later, this helix is one of the two Rpa-binding elements of Dna2."

On ATP hydrolysis, domain 1A would be the one releasing its DNA and rebinding it at the +1 nt register, restoring the initial open-cleft conformation. In the Dna2-ssDNA structure, however, the rebinding of 1A to DNA at the shifted register will have to await the transient dissociation of the nuclease domain from DNA. The increased half life of the closed cleft would likely also reduce the rate of exchange of ADP for ATP, as the \u03b3 phosphate binding site of the helicase fold is far less solvent accessible in the closed cleft."

In 5\u2019 flap processing, threading likely proceeds through initial, transient interactions at the nuclease domain entrance of the tunnel, with subsequent re-binding events occurring further along the tunnel interior. This threading is likely related to that of \u03bb exonuclease, where a 5\u2019 terminal phosphate binding site inside the enzyme is proposed to drive the forward movement of the DNA in an electrostatic ratchet mechanism (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>)."

The ssDNA consisted of deoxythymidine nucleotides, which have minimal secondary structure and thus do not require Rpa for cleavage by Dna2 (5\u2019(dT)<sub>6</sub> to 5\u2019(dT)<sub>24</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The short substrates that can span only the nuclease domain (5\u2019(dT)<sub>6</sub> and 5\u2019(dT)<sub>8</sub>) have Dna2 affinities approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of 5\u2019(dT)<sub>24</sub>, and they exhibit minimal cleavage (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). With the slightly longer 5\u2019(dT)<sub>8</sub>, low level cleavage occurs 7 and 8 nucleotides from the 5\u2019 end, indicating that the ssDNA extends to the helicase 1A domain (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The sites of cleavage indicate that Dna2 opens up \u223c2 base pairs (bps) of the duplex, since the tunnel entrance 3\u2019 to the scissile phosphate is too narrow to accommodate double-stranded DNA. As ATP is neither required, nor has a significant effect, this DNA unwinding is the result of threading, likely analogous to DNA unwinding by \u03bb exonuclease (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). Extending the ssDNA by 2 nts, (5\u2019(dT)<sub>10</sub>), results in a major increase in Dna2 affinity and cleavage, with the cleavage sites indicating the engagement of the helicase 2A domain after the unwinding of \u223c2 bps (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). With 5\u2019(dT)<sub>17</sub> where the ssDNA is long enough to reach both the 1A and 2A domains without duplex unwinding, there is a final increase in Dna2 affinity and cleavage that plateau at the levels of 5\u2019(dT)<sub>24</sub>."

Indeed, ATP but not the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP stimulates the cleavage of a 5\u2019(U)<sub>12</sub>\u2013(dT)<sub>12</sub> RNA-DNA overhang substrate by \u223c50% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, top panel). By contrast, ATP had a minimal effect on the cleavage of the corresponding all-DNA (dT)<sub>24</sub> substrate, while AMPPNP inhibited cleavage slightly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, bottom panel)."

We did not expect the isolated \u03b11OB, in the absence of the DNA-affinity provided by the nuclease and helicase domains, to displace Rpa from ssDNA, as the affinities of the \u03b11OB-Rpa and Rpa-ssDNA complexes differ by 5 orders of magnitude (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values of \u223c12 \u03bcM and \u223c100 pM, respectively). Instead, we reasoned that if \u03b11OB has a role destabilizing Rpa-ssDNA interactions, then this should be reflected in ssDNA interfering with \u03b11OB-Rpa association. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, addition of (dT)<sub>24</sub> substantially reduced Rpa binding to GST-\u03b11OB (lanes 1 to 3), consistent with \u03b11OB and ssDNA interacting with Rpa in a mutually exclusive manner. However, while one molar equivalent of (dT)<sub>24</sub> reduced the bound Rpa by a factor of \u223c4, the remaining Rpa was clearly above the background level of the GST-only reaction (lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that only one of the two Dna2-Rpa interactions is mutually exclusive with Rpa-ssDNA interactions. Consistent with this, addition of (dT)<sub>8</sub> had no discernible effect on the binding of GST-\u03b11 to Rpa70N (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), whereas it eliminated the binding of GST-OB to Rpa70AB in a manner dependent on the stoichiometry of (dT)<sub>8</sub> to Rpa70AB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

This is plausible, because while the DNA affinity of DBD-A\u2013DBD-B (~50 nM <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>) is substantially higher than its Dna2 affinity, those of the individual DBD-A (2 \u03bcM <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>) and DBD-B (20 \u03bcM <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>) are not, and as with the intact Rpa heterotrimer, they are thought to associate with and dissociate from DNA sequentially (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arunkumar et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fan and Pavletich, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fanning et al., 2006</a>). By itself, the transient displacement of DNA from DBD-A\u2013DBD-B will not lead to the release Rpa from ssDNA.

The amount of Rpa displacement was proportional to Dna2 loading, which was substantial with 5\u2019 overhang DNA (\u223c45% of the reaction lacking Rpa; lanes 1 and 3), but negligible with 3\u2019 overhang DNA (\u223c3%; lanes 4 and 6).

A 5\u2019 DNA end would have to thread halfway through the tunnel before it can access the helicase domain, while the threading of a 3\u2019 end starting at the helicase 2A domain would be opposed by the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 polarity of translocation, as we demonstrate.

In yeast, ATPase mutations do result in growth defects (<a href=\"#bib12\">Budd et al., 2000</a>), and it is possible this is due to the ATPase activity contributing to the bypassing of the RNA primer of Okazaki flaps, as suggested by our in vitro data. This may be reflected in the similarity of the Dna2 helicase domain to the Upf1 family of RNA/DNA helicases, which is extensive enough to indicate that Dna2 picked up an ancestral Upf1-like helicase during its evolution."

Crystals of Dna2 bound to 21-nt ssDNA and ADP (Dna2-ssDNA in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) were grown from a crystallization buffer of 80 mM MES, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM spermidine, 4\u20139% isopropanol, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 6.5, and 1 mM ADP. They contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of Dna2 bound to 5\u2019 overhang DNA, which consists of a 17-nt 5\u2019 overhanging ssDNA and a 6 base pair dsDNA (Dna2-5\u2019 overhang DNA in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), grew from a similar condition but in a different space group, and have one complex in the asymmetric unit and higher diffraction limits. As there is no electron density for the duplex, we presume it is disordered. All crystals were cryo-protected in crystallization buffer supplemented with 20\u201325% glycerol or ethylene glycol, and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The human DNA2 \u03b11-RPA70 OBN complex was crystallized by mixing an 8.7 mg/ml solution of the RPA70N polypeptide (residues 1\u2013120) with a 3-fold molar excess of a synthetic DNA2 \u03b11 peptide (residues 1\u201320) from 50 mM Tris-HCl, 35% PEG 1500, 2 mM TCEP, pH 8.0. Crystals were cryo-protected in crystallization buffer supplemented with 20\u201325% glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen."

Data sets were processed with the HKL2000 suite (<a href=\"#bib35\">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</a>). The structure of Dna2-ADP complex was determined using SAD with data collected at the selenium edge (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bricogne et al., 2003</a>). The phases were improved using solvent flattening and two-fold NCS averaging with multiple masks with the program DM (<a href=\"#bib43\">Winn et al., 2011</a>). The model was built using O (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jones et al., 1991</a>)and Coot (<a href=\"#bib16\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and refined with REFMAC5 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Winn et al., 2011</a>) and PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>) using tight NCS restraints on atom positions. Initial phases for the two Dna2-ADP-ssDNA complexes were obtained by molecular replacement with PHASER (<a href=\"#bib31\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) using the apo-Dna2 structure as the search model, and the structures were refined using REFMAC5 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Winn et al., 2011</a>) and PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>), with TLS parameterization of temperature factors of the high resolution Dna2-5\u2019 overhang DNA complex. The Ramachandran plot of the final model has 90.5%, 8.9%, 0.5% and 0% of the residues in the most favored, additional allowed, generously allowed and disallowed regions.

The paper describes a structure/function analysis of the Dna2 ATPase/nuclease and its interaction with RPA. It is well-written and fun to read. The structure has multiple interesting features. The paper establishes how the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease and SF1B helicase domains of Dna2 jointly bind ssDNA and how Dna2 interacts with RPA physically and biochemically to process DNA ends. The results furthermore provide the structural mechanisms for how Dna2 works on both 3' and 5' overhangs. The additional insight from biochemical experiments on how Dna2 might displace RPA from 5' but not 3' overhangs is a bonus. This work will be of tremendous and broad-based biological interest across many fields. It is a great paper in multiple respects. <i>eLife</i> is a highly suitable venue for publication."

This necessitates Dna2, which trims the flap until it is a poor substrate for Dna2 binding and incision as elaborated upon in our study, but an optimal substrate for Fen1 according to most published studies.

Is it possible that the barrel and stalk might transiently undock from the body of Dna2 to make binding more favorable to the SF1B domain, and this binding could then aid threading through the (now shorter) tunnel? Also, such a conformational change occurs in the FEN1 structure where flexibility evidently aids threading prior to the formation of the active complex, so perhaps this merits a comparative comment.</i>"

However, this will not help with the initiation of threading because the tunnel entrance, which is also the narrowest part of the tunnel, is formed by the crossover loop that is stapled on the rest of the nuclease by the iron-sulfur cluster."
