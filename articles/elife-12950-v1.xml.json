We find that an amino-terminal domain of PCM1 can restore ciliogenesis and satellite localization of certain proteins, but not others, pinpointing unique roles for PCM1 and a group of satellite proteins in cilium assembly. Remarkably, we find that PCM1 is essential for tethering the E3 ligase, Mindbomb1 (Mib1), to satellites. In the absence of <i>PCM1</i>, Mib1 destabilizes Talpid3 through poly-ubiquitylation and suppresses cilium assembly. Loss of PCM1 blocks ciliogenesis by abrogating recruitment of ciliary vesicles associated with the Talpid3-binding protein, Rab8, which can be reversed by inactivating Mib1. Thus, PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis by tethering a key E3 ligase to satellites and restricting it from centrioles."

We find that an amino-terminal domain of PCM1 can restore ciliogenesis and satellite localization of certain proteins, but not others, pinpointing unique roles for PCM1 and a group of satellite proteins in cilium assembly. Remarkably, we find that PCM1 is essential for tethering the E3 ligase, Mindbomb1 (Mib1), to satellites. In the absence of <i>PCM1</i>, Mib1 destabilizes Talpid3 through poly-ubiquitylation and suppresses cilium assembly. Loss of PCM1 blocks ciliogenesis by abrogating recruitment of ciliary vesicles associated with the Talpid3-binding protein, Rab8, which can be reversed by inactivating Mib1. Thus, PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis by tethering a key E3 ligase to satellites and restricting it from centrioles."

The process commences with the docking of ciliary vesicles at the distal appendages of the basal body, proceeds with the elongation of an axoneme concomitant with recruitment of Rab8-associated vesicles, and culminates with the fusion of the nascent cilium with the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kobayashi and Dynlacht, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sorokin, 1962</a>). Other proteins, including the BBSome and Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) complexes, contribute to growth, assembly, and maintenance of the cilium (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</a>). An extensive array of centriolar and basal body proteins has also been shown to play a critical role in ciliogenesis. Among these key regulators, Talpid3 is essential for ciliogenesis, and mutations in the gene encoding this protein lead to a panoply of developmental defects in model organisms and human ciliopathies, including Joubert Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alby et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bangs et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Davey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Malicdan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Roosing et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Stephen et al., 2015</a>). We have shown that Talpid3 associates with Rab8, a component of ciliary vesicles, and silencing Talpid3 compromises the efficient recruitment of ciliary vesicles to basal bodies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kobayashi et al., 2014</a>)."

Centriolar satellites (CS) are thought to play a role in trafficking of cargoes to the centrosome and cilium and are thought to promote ciliogenesis. Recently, an inhibitory role for centriolar satellite proteins has also been proposed, although many questions remain regarding the assembly of these granules and their function in ciliogenesis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib35\">Tollenaere et al., 2015</a>). For example, Mib1 was shown to associate with AZI1/Cep131 (hereafter Cep131) and PCM1 at centriolar satellites (<a href=\"#bib36\">Villumsen et al., 2013</a>), and while Mib1 over-expression was shown to promote ubiquitylation of both proteins, no impact on their stability was observed. Thus, although Mib1 over-expression inhibits ciliogenesis, the mechanistic connections, if any, between Cep131 and PCM1 ubiquitylation and the inhibition of ciliogenesis were unclear. In other studies, centriolar satellites were shown to play a second, restrictive role in ciliogenesis by regulating the timely redistribution of the BBSome subunit, BBS4 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stowe et al., 2012</a>). Thus, centriolar satellites could play opposing roles by promoting or antagonizing initiation of the ciliogenesis program."

                        "text": "Here, we find that PCM1 plays a prominent role in ciliogenesis by sequestering proteins in the centriolar satellite compartment. Importantly, PCM1 restricts Mib1 to satellites, preventing its translocation to centrioles, which would otherwise promote Talpid3 destabilization, a failure to recruit Rab8a, and inhibition of cilium assembly. Moreover, using PCM1 knock-out cells, we show that the ability of this protein to promote ciliogenesis by partitioning satellite proteins is not universal, allowing us to identify distinct roles in cilium assembly. Our studies provide novel insights into mechanistic roles for PCM1 in ciliogenesis and explain how centriolar satellites can play a positive role in ciliogenesis by antagonizing inhibitors of this process."

We isolated a clone with frame-shift mutations in exon 2 of <i>PCM1</i>, and the cell line was devoid of PCM1 protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We examined this cell line by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and found that in contrast with previous studies, in which ciliation was reduced by 20\u201350% after knock-down, gene ablation resulted in a complete failure to ciliate when cells were made quiescent through serum deprivation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and data not shown)(<a href=\"#bib24\">Lopes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stowe et al., 2012</a>).

We found that <i>PCM1</i> knock-out cells completely lacked centriolar satellites, which were visualized through immunofluorescent detection with a panel of antibodies against known satellite proteins (Cep131, Cep290, Cep90, and Mib1), and this defect could be rescued by expression of Myc-PCM1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Interestingly, the disappearance of each of these proteins at satellites was accompanied by their appearance at centrioles (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with these observations, the satellite proteins Cep72, Cep90, and Cep290 were also retained at centrosomes upon PCM1 knock-down (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lopes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stowe et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, we observed an overall reduction in abundance of several satellite proteins, including Cep131, BBS4, and Cep90 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). On the other hand, Mib1 levels were elevated upon loss of PCM1, and other proteins that populate the satellite compartment, centrioles, or ciliary vesicles, such as Cep290, Ofd1, Rab8, and Rab11, were unaffected, suggesting that the complete loss of PCM1 has specific effects on distinct centrosomal and peri-centrosomal components. We ruled out the possibility that these alterations resulted from changes in transcript levels or stability, rather than protein stability, by assessing steady state levels through quantitative reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR (qRT-PCR)(data not shown)."

In addition, only these two fragments were capable of forming PCM1-positive foci in the cytoplasm, and both exhibited a centriolar satellite-like localization similar to that observed with full-length PCM1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and data not shown). Consistent with these observations, both fragments were able to interact with several satellite proteins, including Mib1, Cep290, Cep131, Cep72, and OFD1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and data not shown). Furthermore, PCM1 1\u20131200 rescued the normal localization of Mib1 and Cep131 at centriolar satellite-like PCM1 foci and prevented aberrant localization to centrioles seen in PCM1 KO cells infected with the control virus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), confirming that this fragment is sufficient to recruit centriolar satellite proteins and prevent their aberrant centriolar localization."

Consistent with the notion that PCM1 serves as a platform to assemble centriolar satellites, we found that PCM1 interacted with Cep90 and C2CD3 through domains that overlapped with Cep131- and OFD1-binding regions but that were distinct from the CEP72- and Mib1-interacting domain. In line with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kamiya et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lopes et al., 2011</a>), PCM1 could associate with OFD1 through residues 600\u20131200 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). We also showed, for the first time, that PCM1 interacts with Mib1, Cep72, Cep90, C2CD3, and Cep131 through distinct, but sometimes overlapping, binding domains. Cep290 interacted with multiple PCM1 fragments, preventing us from more precisely mapping interacting regions (data not shown). Most strikingly, the PCM1 fragment spanning residues 1\u20131200, which could restore cilia and centriolar satellites, interacted with Mib1, OFD1, Cep131 and Cep290, but not Cep90 or C2CD3. In contrast, the PCM1 fragment containing residues 601\u20132025, which failed to restore cilia or centriolar satellites, interacted strongly with most of the proteins we analyzed, except for Mib1 and Cep72 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These results indicate a potentially important role for PCM1-Mib1 and PCM1-Cep72 interactions in both ciliogenesis and satellite assembly, while suggesting that other PCM1 interactions are not sufficient to restore these processes."

First, we examined the localization of Mib1 in wild-type and <i>PCM1</i> null cells. To help visualize centrosomes more accurately without the confounding effects of centriolar satellites, within which they are interspersed, we also treated cells with nocodazole, which effectively eliminates the latter, microtubule-dependent structures. Consistent with prior studies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Villumsen et al., 2013</a>), Mib1 did not co-localize with the centriolar marker, centrin, but primarily localized to satellites in untreated control cells, and this observation was made more evident by treatment of these cells with nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Interestingly, we found that in <i>PCM1</i> knock-out cells, the loss of satellites, observed in the presence or absence of nocodazole, was accompanied by re-localization of Mib1 to centrioles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). Furthermore, we observed identical results when PCM1 was ablated with an siRNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that depletion of PCM1 triggers the destabilization of satellites and thereby promotes the re-localization and accumulation of Mib1 protein at centrioles. Indeed, trafficking to centrioles might stabilize Mib1 at this location (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). PCM1 could therefore function to actively sequester Mib1 at satellites. To test this possibility, we rescued <i>PCM1</i> null cells with Myc-PCM1 and examined centriolar staining in nocodazole-treated cells. We found that re-expression of PCM1 restored both the exclusion of Mib1 from centrosomes and native levels of this protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4C,D</a>). Re-expression of the amino-terminal PCM1 1\u20131200 fragment also restored the exclusion of Mib1 from centrosomes and reduced Mib1 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with an ability of PCM1 to actively sequester Mib1. Moreover, ectopic expression of Mib1 resulted in its re-localization to centrioles (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>), suggesting that the number of binding sites for Mib1 (within centriolar satellites) may be saturable."

To this end, we performed analogous experiments in <i>TALPID3</i> null RPE1 cells, which we generated using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Like the <i>PCM1</i> knock-out, <i>TALPID3</i> null cells were unable to ciliate, but unlike our findings with <i>PCM1</i> null cells, <i>TALPID3</i> loss had no impact on Mib1 localization and was not rescued by Mib1 depletion (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

We speculated that if PCM1 anchoring plays a critical role in restricting the localization and levels of Mib1 and other centriolar satellite proteins, then <i>PCM1</i> ablation could mimic the effects of ectopically expressing Mib1, which likewise suppresses cilium assembly. Consistent with this idea, ectopic expression of wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, Mib1 prompted the disappearance of PCM1, Cep131, and, to a lesser extent, Talpid3, in RPE1 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This result was not restricted to RPE1 cells, since we observed similar or even more dramatic down-regulation of each of these proteins, particularly Talpid3, in U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The impact of Mib1 was specific, since ectopic expression of Mib1 led to diminished levels of certain centriolar satellite proteins (PCM1, Cep131, Cep290, Cep90), but not others (Ofd1, BBS4) (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Moreover, the abundance of centriolar/centrosomal proteins (Sas6) or modified tubulins (acetylated tubulin) was not affected (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). <i>PCM1</i> null cells have dramatically reduced overall levels of Cep131, which also localizes to centrioles (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and expression of wild-type, but not inactive, Mib1 completely eliminated centrosomal Cep131 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Expression of Mib1 led to the near-complete dissolution of centriolar satellites typified by PCM1 and Cep290 enrichment, whereas inactive Mib1 dramatically led to their stabilization (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Consistent with this observation, depletion of Mib1 with two distinct siRNAs led to dramatic up-regulation of centriolar satellites, concomitant with Cep131, Cep290, and PCM1 stabilization (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results strongly suggest that Mib1 is able to selectively regulate the stability of multiple centriolar satellite and centrosomal proteins."

In our previous proteomic screen for Talpid3-interacting proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kobayashi et al., 2014</a>), we identified Mib1 as a robust interactor. We confirmed this interaction by expressing either Mib1 or Talpid3 in cells and performing reciprocal immunoprecipitations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We did not observe an interaction between endogenous Mib1 and Talpid3, since these proteins normally reside in discrete compartments; instead, we found that ectopic Mib1 could bypass this restriction. We generated a series of Talpid3 truncation mutants and showed that an amino-terminal fragment spanning residues 1\u20131000 interacted most strongly with Mib1, although individual fragments spanning either half of this fragment also interacted with Mib1, albeit much more weakly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Next, we assessed whether ectopic Mib1 expression could promote ubiquitylation of Talpid3 in vivo. We co-expressed Talpid3, with either wild-type or catalytically inactive Mib1 and His-tagged ubiquitin, then affinity purified all ubiquitylated proteins through metal chelation chromatography. We found that Mib1 was highly ubiquitylated, most likely through auto-ubiquitylation, since the catalytically inactive mutant did not exhibit a similar high molecular weight ladder, in line with previous observations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Villumsen et al., 2013</a>). More importantly, expression of active Mib1 led to poly-ubiquitylation of Talpid3, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mib1 is required to target this substrate for degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We reasoned that the aberrant localization of Mib1 brought about by removal of PCM1, its centriolar satellite tether, could perturb the abundance of Talpid3, if indeed the latter protein were a substrate of this E3 ligase. Accordingly, we found that ablation of the <i>PCM1</i> gene led to a strong reduction in Talpid3 levels at centrioles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Next, we tested whether Mib1 sequestration by PCM1 is indeed a key limiting factor in the regulation of Talpid3 levels by depleting Mib1 in <i>PCM1</i> knock-out or control cells. Remarkably, silencing Mib1 with either of two siRNAs fully restored wild-type Talpid3 levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). Conversely, expression of active, but not inactive, Mib1 likewise drastically reduced the levels of centriolar Talpid3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). These studies established for the first time that Mib1, once released from PCM1, can relocate to centrioles and result in the ubiquitylation of Talpid3, promoting its down-regulation."

To address this question, we fused Mib1 to the PACT domain, which results in transport of linked proteins to the centrosome (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gillingham and Munro, 2000</a>). As expected, in the presence of PCM1, the PACT-Mib1 protein localized to centrosomes, whereupon this fusion protein, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, provoked a notable reduction in Talpid3 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). In addition, expression of PACT-Mib1, but not the inactive mutant, led to a dramatic reduction in ciliation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Thus, within the limits of our assay, we conclude that Mib1 can act locally at centrioles to de-stabilize Talpid3 (and likely other substrates) and abolish ciliogenesis."

Assembly of this organelle is initiated when mother centrioles mature to form basal bodies and dock ciliary vesicles with the assistance of their distal appendages (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kim and Dynlacht, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kobayashi and Dynlacht, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sorokin, 1962</a>). One of the earliest events, detectable within 90 min post-serum deprivation, is the accumulation of Golgi- and endosome-derived Rab8 vesicles at mother centrioles and emergence of a Rab8-positive axoneme. It is known that Rab8 interacts with the distal appendage protein, Cep164 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, Rab8 also associates with the distal centriolar protein, Talpid3, and depletion of Talpid3 abolishes Rab8 localization to basal bodies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kobayashi et al., 2014</a>). We found that Cep164-positive basal bodies were decorated with Rab8 in serum-starved, control cells, as expected (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). In striking contrast, <i>PCM1</i> null cells failed to recruit Rab8 to basal bodies. We showed that this defect stemmed from loss of PCM1, since it was rescued by expression of this protein. Importantly, the failure to recruit Rab8 could not be explained by the reduced overall abundance of Rab8 or its upstream regulator, Rab11 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Furthermore, the defect in Rab8 localization was not due to aberrant recruitment of Cep164 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), since Cep164 localization was not affected by PCM1 ablation."

This complexity makes it challenging to investigate whether the defects in ciliogenesis resulting from depletion of these proteins can be attributed to centriolar satellite dysfunction, abnormal centriole function, or both. This observation limits our ability to circumscribe the set of centriolar satellite proteins required for ciliogenesis. To this end, we focused on PCM1, as it is an essential organizer of centriolar satellites. By generating <i>PCM1</i> knock-out cells and performing structure-function analyses, we found that the pro-ciliogenic function of PCM1 is likely to depend on its interactions with a limited group of satellite proteins, a subset of which have been analyzed here. Thus, we showed that PCM1-dependent centriolar satellite tethering of Mib1, but not Cep90, is required for ciliogenesis. Use of these tools will accelerate our understanding of the contributions of individual satellite proteins to ciliogenesis through their function at one location or the other. Ongoing proteomic searches for satellite proteins that preferentially interact with the pro-ciliogenic N-terminal domain of PCM1 versus other PCM1 fragments should be most informative."

However, it is not clear whether the distribution and morphology of satellites have a direct impact on ciliogenesis. Specifically, it has been shown that over-expression of BBS4 and Cep72 disrupts centriolar satellite distribution and results in the formation of aggregates that sequester PCM1, which seems to negatively impact ciliogenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kim et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stowe et al., 2012</a>). We observed similar PCM1-associated foci when we re-introduced PCM1 fragments spanning 1\u20131200 or 1\u20131500 into null cells. We found that these foci co-stained with Mib1 and Cep131. Furthermore, these cells ciliated with a frequency comparable to wild-type cells.

We have elucidated a biochemical pathway linking PCM1 to Mib1, which is able to regulate the abundance of Talpid3\u2014and, most likely several other proteins at centrioles and centriolar satellites--through ubiquitylation, and Rab8 recruitment, which is required for the early stage of ciliogenesis. Although such a linear pathway is the most straightforward model for our observations, other possible explanations cannot be ruled out at this time. For example, it is possible that Mib1 and Talpid3 function through independent pathways and that Talpid3 is required for cilium assembly irrespective of PCM1 status and Mib1 activity. It will therefore be important to expand our view of the Mib1 regulatory network and to identify additional Mib1 targets. Nevertheless, our data vastly extend a model wherein centriolar satellites sequester proteins, such as BBS4, temporally modulating the assembly of the BBSome and the onset of cilium assembly (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stowe et al., 2012</a>). BBSome components, including BBS4, have been implicated in cilium assembly, although other studies have not observed such a role for BBS4 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Yen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mykytyn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hernandez et al., 2013</a>). Using these <i>PCM1</i> null cells, it should now be possible to investigate additional roles for PCM1 in sequestering key components at satellites. It is notable that inactivation of a single protein, Mib1, is able to restore Rab8 recruitment in <i>PCM1</i> null cells, as this finding suggests that fine-tuning of Mib1 abundance\u2014and therefore localization--may play a key, rate-limiting step in controlling ciliogenesis."

For example, knock-out mice deleted for both isoforms of Rab8 (<i>Rab8a/Rab8b</i>) are viable, and it is possible that another Rab (<i>Rab10</i>) compensates for the loss of this gene (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sato et al., 2014</a>), although the ability of <i>Rab10</i> to functionally substitute for Rab8 remains to be shown. It is also possible that Mib1 could target other components involved in ciliary vesicle assembly. It is also not known whether the related <i>Mib2</i> gene can play a role in ciliogenesis. These studies will be accelerated by the use of <i>Mib1</i> and <i>Mib2</i> knock-out mice, which have been created. These animals display strong Notch phenotypes, similar to zebrafish <i>Mib1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib12\">Itoh et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koo et al., 2007</a>). Thus far, ciliary phenotypes have not been observed or examined in these mice, to our knowledge.

In this\u00a0study, Mib1 was shown to interact with PCM1 and Cep131, and, interestingly, induction of cellular stress resulting from UV or heat shock led to the p38 MAPK-dependent inactivation of Mib1, reduced ubiquitylation of Cep131, PCM1, and Cep290, and enhanced ciliogenesis. While our respective studies are in agreement that Mib1 regulates ciliogenesis, our results differ in several significant ways. First, we have observed that each of the centriolar satellite Mib1 substrates (Cep131 and PCM1) are highly poly-ubiquitylated by ectopic Mib1, rather than being mono-ubiquitylated, and this leads to the de-stabilization of both proteins, in contrast with previous work (<a href=\"#bib36\">Villumsen et al., 2013</a>). In addition to these centriolar satellite proteins, we show that Talpid3, a centriolar protein required for ciliogenesis, is also poly-ubiquitylated under these conditions. Further, we found that removal of Mib1 led to the stabilization of both Cep131 and PCM1, enhancing the stability of centriolar satellites. We have replicated these findings in two cell lines. At present, we cannot explain the apparent discrepancy between our findings and the previous study and ascribe them to experimental differences (<a href=\"#bib36\">Villumsen et al., 2013</a>). We note that a recent study indicated that Mib1 could regulate the stability of another centrosomal protein, Plk4, through lysine 11-, 29-, and 48 ubiquitin linkages (<a href=\"#bib5\">\u010caj\u00e1nek et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, it should be most interesting to identify additional components regulated by Mib1 and, potentially, to link these findings to the original role of Mib1 in Notch signaling."

For example, we note that ~15% of prostate tumors exhibit deletions in the <i>PCM1</i> gene (cBioPortal). Given that the loss of cilia is an early event in the transformation of this tissue (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hassounah et al., 2013</a>), our studies suggest that further investigation of a role for <i>PCM1</i> in prostate tumorigenesis is warranted. One prediction of our model is that Mib1 may be aberrantly up-regulated or mis-localized in these tumors as a result of <i>PCM1</i> mutations, which, we have shown, could abolish cilium assembly. In this setting, and perhaps others, loss of <i>PCM1</i> and satellite tethering could play a signature role in the transformative process."

This logic of a PCM1-Mib1-Talpid3-Rab8 pathway is reasonable, but its in vivo relevance not entirely compelling, as there is no in vivo evidence for the role of Mib1 in cilia formation (Mib1 null mice show phenotypes consistent with loss of Notch signaling) and Rab8a null mutants are viable, which should be acknowledged by the authors."

In published papers reporting the Mib1 null mice, however, ciliogenesis was not studied. Indeed, the dominant phenotype in Mib1 knockout mice reflects defects in Notch signaling. It is not known whether MIB1-/- MEFs have a higher ciliation rate compared to wild-type cells, but since this has not been examined, it is not accurate to state that the knock-out study disagrees with our work. Apart from this fact, it is also well known that mutants often show compensation (and there is a second Mib gene, Mib2). This point is further driven home by the Rab8 knock-out data cited by Reviewer 2. These animals are indeed viable, as we point out in our revised manuscript, but they are viable most likely because there is compensation by other Rab family members. Thus, additional mouse models will be needed in the future to address the role of Mib1 (and, potentially, Mib2) in ciliation and development."

However, the total, steady-state levels of Talpid3 were not affected in PCM1 depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), strongly reinforcing our model that Mib1 regulation of Talpid3 occurs on centrioles. We have now performed additional experimentation in response to this critique by fusing Mib1 to the PACT domain, which targets proteins to centrosomes.

We have performed this experiment and now provide these data in new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. Specifically, we localized Mib1 to centrioles by expressing a PACT-Mib1 fusion protein in RPE1 cells, as this will constitutively target Mib1 to centrosomes, and examined Talpid3 levels on centrioles decorated with the PACT-Mib1 protein. As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>, there was a significant diminution in Talpid3 levels on centrioles in these cells, whereas the catalytically inactive Mib1 C985S mutant showed slightly elevated Talpid3 levels. Furthermore, PACT-Mib1 expression also led to strong inhibition of ciliogenesis. These results are discussed in subsection \u201cPCM1 sequestration of Mib1 regulates Talpid3 abundance and ciliogenesis\u201d of the manuscript.

This manuscript presents a solid set of data that demonstrate the importance of the pericentriolar satellite protein PCM1 in formation of cilia in RPE1 cells. Previous knockdown experiments had shown a mild effect of PCM1 deletion on ciliogenesis. Here, the investigators make null mutant cells using CRISPR/Cas and document the complete absence of cilia in mutant cells. They also show that PCM1 is required for the focal localization in satellites of all tested PCM proteins, demonstrating the central role of PCM1 in these structures. The investigators show that the phenotypes can be rescued by expression of full-length PCM1 and then use standard structure-function experiments to identify regions of PCM1 that are required to rescue the ciliogenesis defect and that bind to other satellite proteins. The authors then focus on Mib1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which was recently shown by another group to be enriched in centriolar satellites and suggested that Mib1 can suppress cilia formation. The authors show Mib1 and some other satellite proteins relocalize from satellites to centrioles in the PCM1 KO cells. They go on to show that siRNA knockdown of Mib1 in the PCM1 KO cells restores some ciliogenesis (to about half the level in control cells); this is an important and interesting result that shows that PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis, at least in part, by removing Mib1 from the centriole. It would be helpful to show some images of these cilia to demonstrate whether these cilia are normal in structure and length. In a supporting experiment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), the authors show that overexpression of wild-type Mib1, but not a catalytically inactive form of Mib1, inhibits cilia formation; the text describing this experiment is confusing and should be rewritten.</i>"

These results can be explained by the ability of Mib1 to interact with over-expressed Talpid3. It is possible that the impact on Talpid3 levels could be mediated indirectly by other Mib1 targets, and we have now included this possibility in our Discussion. However, several pieces of evidence support our model. First, ablation of PCM1 leads to the translocation of Mib1 from centriolar satellites to centrioles and decreased Talpid3 protein levels on centrioles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, and 7 and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, Mib1 interacts with Talpid3 and promotes poly-ubiquitylation of Talpid3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Third, over-expression of catalytically active Mib1 (with or without an attached PACT domain) results in decreased Talpid3 on centrioles, whereas knock-down of Mib1 rescues Talpid3 levels on centrioles in PCM1-/- cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). We present the most straightforward model to account for all of these data, although other models are certainly possible, including the likely possibility that other yet-to-be-defined substrates at the centriole are important for the regulation of ciliogenesis, in addition to Talpid3."

Indeed, as correctly stated by the reviewer, the dominant phenotype in Mib1 knockout mouse reflects defects in Notch signaling. It is also possible that the Mib1 knock-out could exhibit compensation, since there is a second Mib gene, Mib2. It would be interesting to examine ciliation in Mib1-/- mice, but since this has not been examined, these earlier studies do not have a direct bearing on our work. Further, as mentioned by the reviewer, Rab8 knock-out animals are indeed viable, but the likely explanation is that there is compensation by another Rab family member, in particular, Rab10, suggesting functional redundancy of these proteins during ciliogenesis. We agree with the reviewer that these observations merit discussion, and they have incorporated into the text."
