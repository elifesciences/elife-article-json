Our knowledge of these components and pathways is far from exhaustive. In recent decades, the nuclear envelope has emerged as a global gene regulatory machine, although its role in circadian regulation has not been explored. We report that transcription of the core clock component <i>BMAL1</i> is positively modulated by the inner nuclear membrane protein MAN1, which directly binds the <i>BMAL1</i> promoter and enhances its transcription. Our results establish a novel connection between the nuclear periphery and circadian rhythmicity, therefore bridging two global regulatory systems that modulate all aspects of bodily functions."

Our knowledge of these components and pathways is far from exhaustive. In recent decades, the nuclear envelope has emerged as a global gene regulatory machine, although its role in circadian regulation has not been explored. We report that transcription of the core clock component <i>BMAL1</i> is positively modulated by the inner nuclear membrane protein MAN1, which directly binds the <i>BMAL1</i> promoter and enhances its transcription. Our results establish a novel connection between the nuclear periphery and circadian rhythmicity, therefore bridging two global regulatory systems that modulate all aspects of bodily functions."

This protein in turn triggers the expression of a gene called <i>BMAL1</i>, which is one of the small number of \u2018clock genes\u2019 that are responsible for generating the internal circadian rhythm."

                        "text": "Most organisms, ranging from cyanobacteria to humans, are governed by their circadian rhythms: endogenous and self-sustained oscillations with a period of roughly 24 hr, which manifest in diverse metabolic, physiological, and behavioral processes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ueda et al., 2005</a>). This internal pacemaker is charged with two important roles: to perpetuate its own rhythms and to regulate the expression of genes that are under circadian control. In mammals, this internal pacemaker consists of a complex network of transcriptional regulations, at the core of which is transcription activators BMAL1 (also known as ARNTL1 or MOP3) and CLOCK, which form heterodimers and regulate gene expression. Up to 15% of the organism's genome is regulated in a circadian manner (<a href=\"#bib30\">Panda et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Emery and Reppert, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang and Kay, 2010</a>). Well-studied examples include the transcription repressors (PERIODs and CRYPTOCRHOMEs) that bind to CLOCK/BMAL1 and suppress their own transcription, thereby forming a feedback loop. Since the identification and cloning of the first mammalian clock gene, <i>CLOCK</i>, two decades ago (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vitaterna et al., 1994</a>), the field of chronobiology has uncovered many additional players that regulate circadian rhythms on a transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level, and many more such candidates are currently being evaluated."

                        "text": "Recently, mutations in nuclear envelope (NE) proteins have been shown to cause a surprisingly broad range of inherited diseases, thus shedding light on roles played by the NE in global regulations at cellular and organismal levels (<a href=\"#bib28\">Padiath et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dauer and Worman, 2009</a>). These diseases (often referred to as nuclear envelopathies or laminopathies) can impact muscle, nerve, fat metabolism, bone formation, and others. NE consists of outer and inner nuclear membranes (connected by nuclear pore complexes) and nuclear lamina. The inner nuclear membrane proteins (such as MAN1, LBR, LAP2, etc) include approximately 60 putative transmembrane proteins specifically retained in the inner nuclear membrane and most of them are poorly characterized (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schirmer et al., 2005</a>). In metazoan, nuclear lamina is a protein mesh-like structure composed of type V intermediate filament proteins lamins (including A, C, B1, B2, and B3 types) and sits primarily underneath the inner nuclear membrane (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zwerger and Medalia, 2013</a>). The idea of nuclear envelope components as transcription regulators in mammals is relatively new, conceived from the observation that gene-rich chromosomes are generally located in more internal nuclear regions, whereas gene-poor chromosomes are relegated to the periphery (<a href=\"#bib38\">Spector, 2003</a>). Many NE components such as inner nuclear membrane proteins, nuclear lamina, and the nuclear pore complex, harbor DNA-binding domains that are involved in anchoring chromatin to the periphery (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ulbert et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mekhail and Moazed, 2010</a>). Functional relevance of these positional distinctions became apparent as studies with yeast and flies revealed that the NE can sequester factors that affect gene transcription in both repressive and, surprisingly, activating manners (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akhtar and Gasser, 2007</a>). Although recent findings highlight the important functions of the nuclear periphery, its relationship with the circadian clock has not been probed. Given the increasing awareness of the global roles that these two systems play in myriad pathways, we set out to investigate the possibility that these seemingly separate pathways are connected and can work synergistically in regulating diverse functions."

                                "text": "In order to investigate whether NE proteins are involved in circadian regulation, we began by focusing on lamin B1 since it has been shown to play a role in transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hutchison, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shevelyov et al., 2009</a>). In vivo oscillation of lamin B1 (<i>Lmnb1</i>) expression patterns (both RNA and protein levels) were confirmed using mouse tissues from suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), kidney, and liver (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To test whether the level of lamin B1 affects the molecular clock, we examined the protein expression patterns for the core clock gene PERIOD2 (PER2) using <i>Lmnb1</i> heterozygous knock out (homozygosity is lethal) and <i>LMNB1</i> wild-type BAC transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vergnes et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Heng et al., 2013</a>). Oscillating PER2 expression patterns were phase delayed in <i>Lmnb1</i> heterozygous knock out mice and phase advanced in <i>LMNB1</i> BAC transgenic mice (overexpression) when compared to wild-type control mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting that the level of lamin B1 can modulate circadian clock. However, neither <i>Lmnb1</i> heterozygous knock out mice nor <i>LMNB1</i> BAC transgenic mice demonstrated significant output behavioral change (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To expand the investigation, we chose to include two additional NE proteins that are known to associate with lamin B1, LBR, and MAN1. We found that LBR and MAN1 expression also oscillate, albeit mildly for MAN1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Both <i>LBR</i> and <i>LMNB1</i> knockdown significantly decreased the transcript level of <i>MAN1</i> (by 15% and 40%, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The effects of <i>LBR</i> or <i>LMNB1</i> knockdown on MAN1 expression are even more dramatic at the protein level, with 54% and 44% reductions, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Moreover, knockdown of <i>LBR</i> expression reduces the amount of LMNB1 protein by 32%, which is consistent with the observation that reduction of <i>LBR</i> expression in the fibroblasts of patients harboring a heterozygous <i>LBR</i> mutation results in the abolition of LMNB1 protein (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaudy-Marqueste et al., 2010</a>), whereas a decrease in <i>LMNB1</i> does not significantly affect <i>LBR</i> expression. <i>MAN1</i> knockdown also does not change the expression of <i>LBR</i> and <i>LMNB1</i>, either at the mRNA or protein level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These results suggest that <i>MAN1</i> is modulated by LBR and LMNB1, and thus the effects of LBR and LMNB1 on the clock are at least partially through MAN1. Therefore, we further investigated the effects of MAN1 on the molecular clock."

                                "text": "A lengthened period due to decreased MAN1 may arise from altered regulation of core clock proteins and/or altered transcription of core clock genes. Either of these effects would result in disruptions of the stoichiometry and temporal control of the dynamics of the core circadian feedback loops. Given what is known regarding the role of NE proteins in transcriptional regulation, we tested whether reductions in MAN1 expression would affect the transcription of clock genes. We examined the circadian oscillation of core clock genes at the mRNA level and found that only <i>BMAL1</i> showed a clear difference wherein overall mRNA levels were down-regulated to half the levels of controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Western blots also showed lower expression of BMAL1 when MAN1 was knocked down (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The non-oscillatory <i>CLOCK</i> showed no significant change of either transcript or protein levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The conserved mRNA levels of <i>REV-ERB\u03b1 and ROR\u03b1</i> in MAN1 knockdown cells suggest that the reduced <i>BMAL1</i> expression is not caused by altered transcriptional activation of <i>REV-ERB\u03b1</i>, a <i>BMAL1</i> repressor, or transcriptional repression of <i>ROR\u03b1</i>, a <i>BMAL1</i> activator."

The enhancing action of SMAD2 was then examined together with MAN1 to determine whether there is interplay between MAN1 and SMAD2 on <i>BMAL1</i> promoter activity.

An increasing number of human diseases are recognized to be caused by mutations in genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins and hence, termed \u2018envelopathies\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dauer and Worman, 2009</a>). Several inner nuclear membrane proteins are known to regulate critical signaling pathways and act as intranuclear regulators of signaling pathways that receive and transduce signals from extracellular cues. The nuclear lamina provides structural support for the nucleus and the nuclear envelope; however, lamins and their associated proteins are also involved in most of the nuclear processes. Lamin B1 is essential for brain development and is required for the integrity of the nuclear lamina (<a href=\"#bib28\">Padiath et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Coffinier et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, no abnormality has been reported for the heterozygous <i>Lmnb1</i> knock out mice (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stewart et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Coffinier et al., 2011</a>), and it is estimated that these heterozygous mice still express 70% of lamin b1 (SG Young, personal communication). Consistent with these reports, we did not find significant phenotype including circadian behavior change in these mice despite the clear phase shift on PER2 oscillation in the liver. It is possible that the oscillation of one or more additional core clock components are also altered by reduced lamin b1 level and these additional alterations can compensate the effect of PER2 phase shift on output behavior. Alternatively, it is also possible that the SCN clock is resilient to perturbations caused by reduced lamin b1 level, hence we can only observe alterations in peripheral clocks. Further investigation is necessary to reveal the mechanism leading to the findings we report here."

LEM domains mediate the interaction with a chromatin-binding protein, barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), which has the ability to bind dsDNA, chromatin, histones, lamin binding proteins, and various transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Liu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Worman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bengtsson, 2007</a>). Therefore, LEM proteins have roles in gene regulation, chromatin organization, regulation of transcription factor activity at the nuclear periphery, and regulation of specific signal pathways. Both amino and carboxyl termini of MAN1 are nucleoplasmic domains. The amino-terminal nucleoplasmic region of MAN1 (including LEM) binds to the nuclear lamins and emerin in addition to BAF. It is also necessary for efficient localization of MAN1 to the inner nuclear membrane (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mansharamani and Wilson, 2005</a>). The carboxyl-terminal nucleoplasmic region (residues 655\u2013911) exhibits two globular domains (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Caputo et al., 2006</a>). The first globular domain contains a winged helix (including the sequence RKKMKKVWDR) which is mainly used for DNA binding and recognition. The second domain (amino acids 782\u2013911) is an RRM-like protein interaction domain where it can interact with R-SMADs. The entire carboxy-terminal region of MAN1 was shown to participate in DNA binding, and this interaction is synergistic to the binding of MAN1 to different transcriptional regulators, including R-SMADs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Osada et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Raju et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pan et al., 2005</a>). Consistently, we found that both RRM and DNA binding domains are required for the activation of the <i>BMAL1</i> promoter by MAN1. Also congruent with previous findings, we found that mutating three of the highly positively charged and conserved amino acids within the winged helix region is sufficient to dampen the activation efficiency of MAN1. In contrast to previous reports, we found that MAN1 further augments (but not antagonizes) the positive effect of SMAD2 on <i>BMAL1.</i> Consistent with this result, we also found that the substitution mutation YV-DD of MAN1 does not influence its effect on <i>BMAL1</i> (though RRM domain is required). Collectively, these results suggest that the effects of MAN1 and SMAD2 on <i>BMAL1</i> might not be completely independent to each other and that MAN1 might interact with SMAD2 in more than one way (presumably through other protein partners) to modulate transcription of target genes."

However, cells must be flexible enough to allow for responses to exogenous and endogenous stimuli. This regulation is likely to be mediated not solely by the molecular clock, but also by many additional global and local mechanisms including at the level of chromatin and genome organization (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilar-Arnal et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hubner et al., 2013</a>). Genetic loci associated with the nuclear lamina through large regions of chromatin (lamin associated domains\u2013LADs) are associated with changes in transcriptional status (<a href=\"#bib31\">Peric-Hupkes et al., 2010</a>). Circadian genes or genes involved in rhythmic processes display robust rhythmic expression patterns at the level of nascent mRNA and mRNA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Menet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rodriguez et al., 2012</a>), suggesting prominent contribution of transcriptional regulation to clock gene expression. Interestingly, genes harboring this expression pattern are dramatically enriched for specific function in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization (<a href=\"#bib26\">Menet et al., 2012</a>). These unbiased genome-wide transcriptome reports raised the possibility that components of nuclear envelope may modulate oscillation of clock genes at transcriptional levels. A recent study has also demonstrated that the molecular clock drives circadian changes in spatial and temporal chromosomal organization (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilar-Arnal et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, our study links the nuclear periphery with circadian regulation via the regulatory effects of MAN1 on <i>BMAL1</i> through transcription."

MAN1 over-expression also increased <i>tim</i> mRNA levels, which may be at least partially due to increased <i>cyc</i>. Knocking down <i>MAN1</i> did not alter <i>cyc</i> levels, possibly because the residual MAN1 is still sufficient to maintain normal <i>cyc</i> levels. However, this manipulation lengthened behavioral period, suggesting that MAN1 may target other clock components in addition to <i>cyc</i>. Over-expressing <i>MAN1</i> and <i>LBR</i> in flies led to a lengthened behavioral period, while in U2OS cells, these manipulations resulted in moderate shortening of the period. On the other hand, over-expressing and knocking down <i>Lam</i> in flies shortened and lengthened the period, respectively, which is consistent with the mammalian data. These discrepancies reflect the differences between mammalian and insect clock, which has been implied in previous work as well (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lowrey et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Preuss et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2005</a>).

We were not able to demonstrate that knocking down MAN1 reduces cyc in vivo as we showed for Bmal1 in vitro, but we believe this is probably because in vivo knockdown is not as efficient as in vitro, and/or that the in vivo system is more resilient to perturbations compared to in vitro. Thus we do believe that Bmal1/cyc is a target of MAN1 in the clock, although it may not be the only target. When MAN1 is over-expressed in flies, the period is lengthened and cyc appears to be the clock gene that exhibits the largest changes, leading us to suspect that under the condition of MAN1 over-expression, cyc is the primary target of MAN1 in the clock. However, it is certainly possible that MAN1 is also targeting other clock genes. When MAN1 is knocked down in flies, cyc is not affected while period is still lengthened, suggesting that under MAN1 deficient condition, some other clock genes are altered which contribute to the period phenotype. Therefore, we can only draw the conclusion that in MAN1 knock-down flies, the period phenotype is not going through cyc, but we cannot draw the same conclusion for MAN1 over-expressing flies."

For these reasons, MAN1 and SMAD2 may not be acting completely independently."
