Here, we uncover a novel mechanism licensing transcription in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) adipogenically primed by confluence. Prior to adipogenesis, confluency promotes heterodimer recruitment of the bZip transcription factors C/EBP\u03b2 and ATF4 to a non-canonical C/EBP DNA sequence. ATF4 depletion decreases both cell-density-dependent transcription and adipocyte differentiation. Global profiling in hMSCs and a novel cell-free assay reveals that ATF4 requires C/EBP\u03b2  for genomic binding at a motif distinct from that bound by the C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer. Our observations demonstrate that C/EBP\u03b2 bridges the transcriptional programs in na\u00efve, confluent cells and early differentiating pre-adipocytes. Moreover, they suggest that homo- and heterodimer formation poise C/EBP\u03b2 to execute diverse and stage-specific transcriptional programs by exploiting an expanded motif repertoire."
