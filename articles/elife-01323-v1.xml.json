Most mammalian genomes contain two copies of miR-1, and in mice, deletion of a single locus, <i>miR-1-2</i>, causes incompletely penetrant lethality and subtle cardiac defects. Here, we report that deletion of <i>miR-1-1</i> resulted in a phenotype similar to that of the <i>miR-1-2</i> mutant. Compound <i>miR-1</i> knockout mice died uniformly before weaning due to severe cardiac dysfunction. <i>miR-1</i>-null cardiomyocytes had abnormal sarcomere organization and decreased phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain-2 (MLC2), a critical cytoskeletal regulator. The smooth muscle-restricted inhibitor of MLC2 phosphorylation, Telokin, was ectopically expressed in the myocardium, along with other smooth muscle genes. <i>miR-1</i> repressed Telokin expression through direct targeting and by repressing its transcriptional regulator, Myocardin. Our results reveal that <i>miR-1</i> is required for postnatal cardiac function and reinforces the striated muscle phenotype by regulating both transcriptional and effector nodes of the smooth muscle gene expression network."

Most mammalian genomes contain two copies of miR-1, and in mice, deletion of a single locus, <i>miR-1-2</i>, causes incompletely penetrant lethality and subtle cardiac defects. Here, we report that deletion of <i>miR-1-1</i> resulted in a phenotype similar to that of the <i>miR-1-2</i> mutant. Compound <i>miR-1</i> knockout mice died uniformly before weaning due to severe cardiac dysfunction. <i>miR-1</i>-null cardiomyocytes had abnormal sarcomere organization and decreased phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain-2 (MLC2), a critical cytoskeletal regulator. The smooth muscle-restricted inhibitor of MLC2 phosphorylation, Telokin, was ectopically expressed in the myocardium, along with other smooth muscle genes. <i>miR-1</i> repressed Telokin expression through direct targeting and by repressing its transcriptional regulator, Myocardin. Our results reveal that <i>miR-1</i> is required for postnatal cardiac function and reinforces the striated muscle phenotype by regulating both transcriptional and effector nodes of the smooth muscle gene expression network."

Roughly a quarter of the double-knockout animals died very soon after birth. In a subset of these animals, we observed ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and misalignment of the aorta over the ventricular septum (overriding aorta), likely accounting for their lethality (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Surviving <i>miR-1</i> double-knockouts failed to thrive post-natally, with no double-knockout animals surviving beyond P10 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Examination of surviving <i>miR-1</i> double-knockouts revealed expansion of the superior portion of the right ventricle (conus) and enlargement of the atria, when compared to wild-type mice beginning at P0 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, asterisk). By P4, and more extensively by P10, the dilation of all cardiac chambers was observed, with a particularly notable enlargement of the right atria. Echocardiography revealed severely impaired fractional shortening by P2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>) with poor systolic function. Frequent ventricular thrombi were observed by P4, consistent with impaired cardiac function in these animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Functional analysis of the conduction system by electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a spectrum of abnormalities, including a prolonged QRS complex, and prolonged PR and QT intervals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). The presence of frequent sinus pauses was observed in all knockout animals analyzed (<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). These morphological, functional, and electrophysiological data indicate that the postnatal lethality in <i>miR-1</i> knockout animals is due to cardiac dysfunction."

Notably, <i>miR-133a</i> expression was decreased in <i>miR-1</i> double-knockout animals with the dysregulation of <i>miR-133a</i> becoming more pronounced with age as the locus normally becomes more actively transcribed (<a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 9</a>). As <i>miR-1</i> lies transcriptionally upstream of <i>miR-133a</i>, we cannot exclude the possibility that the decrease in <i>miR-133a</i> expression is in part due to impaired transcriptional read-through downstream of the <i>miR-1</i> targeting event. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed reduced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy at the <i>miR-1-1/miR-133a-2,</i> and <i>miR-1-2/miR-133a-1</i> promoters in P2 <i>miR-1</i> double-knockout mouse hearts, suggesting that transcriptional initiation of these loci is reduced secondary to loss of <i>miR-1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2s10\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). This suggests a feedback mechanism whereby <i>miR-1</i> maintains appropriate expression of the <i>miR</i>-<i>1/133a</i> loci."

Given that many direct miRNA targets are upregulated at the protein, but not transcript level, we expected that sequencing analysis of this stage would identify pathways that are dysregulated in the <i>miR-1</i> knockout, some of which may involve direct <i>miR-1</i> targets. We utilized the GREAT interface (<a href=\"#bib28\">McLean et al., 2010</a>) to evaluate the enrichment of miRNA targets within the set of genes that were upregulated in the <i>miR-1</i> null hearts, compared to wild-type controls (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Interestingly, a disproportionate number of the genes upregulated in <i>miR-1</i> double-knockout hearts contained CArG boxes (CC/ATn/GG), a motif bound by SRF (<a href=\"#bib41\">Treisman, 1986</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This splicing event results in a truncated protein, lacking the N-terminal\u2013MEF2 interaction domain of the full-length cMYOCD. Although the functional significance of these two isoforms is not well understood, the promoters of some smooth muscle-restricted genes, such as <i>Tagln</i> (<i>Sm22),</i> are more sensitive to smMYOCD than cMYOCD, while some cardiac promoters, such as <i>Myh6</i> (<i>\u03b1-Mhc),</i> are more responsive to cMYOCD (<a href=\"#bib16\">Imamura et al., 2010</a>). Normally, <i>smMyocd</i> expression is relatively low in the neonatal heart; however, we discovered using qPCR that in <i>miR-1</i> double-knockout hearts the expression of <i>smMyocd</i> was fivefold higher than control hearts, while c<i>Myocd</i> was upregulated roughly 1.8-fold (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). More specific upregulation of <i>smMyocd</i> was not evident with statistical confidence in our RNA-seq data likely due to insufficient sequencing depth to detect the small 44 bp exon 2a inclusion within the relatively low overall abundance of <i>smMyocd</i> transcript."

The uniform lethality of <i>miR-1</i> double-knockout animals, associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and abnormal heart rhythm, indicates that <i>miR-1</i> is required for normal cardiac contractility. At a cellular level, we found that sarcomere disruption is one feature that underlies the impaired cardiac function, and reintroduction of <i>miR-1</i> into ex vivo cardiomyocytes was sufficient to partially rescue this phenotype. <i>miR-1</i> functions to negatively regulate the smooth muscle-specific inhibitor of MLC phosphorylation, Telokin. Aberrant upregulation of Telokin and the resulting decrease in phosphorylated MLC in <i>miR-1</i> null hearts may contribute, in part, to the sarcomeric contractility defect. <i>miR-1</i> regulation of <i>Telokin</i> is accomplished by direct targeting of its 3\u2032 UTR, as well as through targeting of its transcriptional regulator, <i>Myocd</i>. In particular, <i>miR-1</i> preferentially regulates <i>smMyocd</i>, thereby complementing the effects of <i>miR-133</i> to suppress the smooth muscle gene program (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

In this and previous studies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mishima et al., 2009</a>), genes related to the actin cytoskeleton are highly responsive to alterations in <i>miR-1</i> expression. MLC phosphorylation is critical for sarcomere assembly and regulating the speed and force of contraction in the heart (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aoki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2001</a>). In mammals, there are multiple MLC2 isoforms, but deletion of the single cardiac zebrafish isoform results in a lack of thick filament assembly (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rottbauer et al., 2006</a>). At a molecular level, phosphorylation of MLC2 results in a conformational shift in the associated MHC, bringing it into closer proximity to the thin filament and increasing the probability of cross-bridge formation. Not surprisingly, in humans, <i>MLC2</i> mutations are associated with myopathies (<a href=\"#bib32\">Poetter et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2001</a>). Thus, decreased phosphorylation of MLC in the absence of <i>miR-1</i> likely plays a role in the sarcomeric disruption and cardiac dysfunction in <i>miR-1</i> double-knockouts."

Although it is not possible to distinguish the contribution of transcriptional regulation of Telokin vs direct <i>miR-1</i> targeting of the <i>Telokin</i> 3\u2032 UTR, the dramatic degree of Telokin protein upregulation compared to the more moderate <i>Telokin</i> mRNA increase is consistent with some degree of translational control by <i>miR-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). How Telokin misexpression affects cardiac function has not been directly evaluated; however, ectopic expression in the myocardium has been reported in a doxorubicin induced rat model of cardiomyopathy, although the precise mechanism by which Telokin contributes to this pathology is unknown (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dudnakova et al., 2003</a>)."

While targeted disruption of <i>miR-1</i> might adversely affect transcriptional read-through of the <i>miR-1-1/miR-133a-2</i> locus, secondary downregulation of <i>miR-133a</i> expression from regulatory feedback mechanisms also appears to occur (<a href=\"#fig2s10\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). <i>miR-1</i> and <i>miR-133a</i> are dramatically upregulated during the differentiation of cardiac and skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ivey et al., 2008</a>). While the current study shows definitively that <i>miR-1</i> is not required for initial cardiomyocyte differentiation in vivo<i>,</i> the loss of <i>miR-1</i> expression may impair further cardiomyocyte differentiation and/or maturation<i>.</i> This would predictably result in decreased developmental upregulation of the <i>miR-1/133</i> loci. Consistent with this model, the loosely organized sarcomeric morphology and the abnormal mitochondrial morphology we observed by TEM are similar to those of more immature cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hom et al., 2011</a>). The upregulation of members of the cardiac fetal gene expression program, such as <i>Nppa</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and even the upregulation of smooth muscle genes, which are normally expressed in embryonic cardiomyocytes, supports this paradigm. As such, the expression of <i>miR-133a</i>, a key developmentally regulated miRNA, may be secondarily downregulated in <i>miR-1</i> double-knockout mice as a result of a subtle cardiac differentiation or maturation defect, although the exact mechanism is unknown."

Therefore, a potential mechanism by which <i>miR-1</i> may regulate <i>Myocd</i> splicing is through the direct repression of a splice factor that normally mediates alternate inclusion of the 2a exon in smooth muscle.

The authors had previously published on the phenotype of <i>miR-1-2</i> deletion and they now show the phenotype of <i>miR-1-1</i> and double <i>miR-1-1/2</i> mutants. Complete deletion of <i>miR-1</i> results in death and cardiac dysfunction. The authors have uncovered an interesting mechanism to explain the phenotype. They show that <i>miR-1</i>-null cardiomyocytes have abnormal sarcomere organization and decreased phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain-2 (MLC2). The smooth muscle restricted inhibitor of MLC2 phosphorylation, Telokin, is ectopically expressed in the myocardium, along with other smooth-muscle genes. The authors determine that the mechanism underlying <i>miR-1</i> repression of Telokin expression is both by direct targeting via seed sites in the 3' UTR and also by repressing the transcriptional regulator, Myocardin. These data therefore imply that <i>miR-1</i> functions to regulate the maintenance of the striated muscle phenotype in cardiomyocytes. This is an interesting study. However the following points need to be addressed before publication."
