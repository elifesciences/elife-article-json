On their path to the egg cell, mammalian sperm encounter varied physiological environments and are exposed to a variety of chemical gradients and must overcome counterflows. Whilst chemotactic sensing (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaupp et al., 2008</a>) is assumed to provide important guidance in the immediate vicinity of the ovum (<a href=\"#bib31\">Spehr et al., 2003</a>), it is not known which biochemical (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>) or physical mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib36\">Winet et al., 1984</a>) keep the sperm cells on track as they pass through the rugged landscapes of cervix, uterus, and oviduct (<a href=\"#bib17\">Katz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Suarez and Pacey, 2006</a>). The complexity of the mammalian reproduction process and not least the lack of quantitative data make it very difficult to assess the relative importance of the various proposed long-distance navigation mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fauci and Dillon, 2006</a>), ranging from cervix contractions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fauci and Dillon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Suarez and Pacey, 2006</a>) and chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaupp et al., 2008</a>) to thermotaxis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bahat et al., 2003</a>) and rheotaxis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>). Aiming to understand not only qualitatively but also quantitatively how fluid-mechanical effects may help steer mammalian spermatozoa over large distances, we report here a combined experimental and theoretical study of sperm swimming in microfluidic channels, probing a wide range of physiologically relevant conditions of shear and viscosity. For both human and bull spermatozoa, we find that their physical response to shear flow, combined with an effective shape-regulated surface attraction (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kantsler et al., 2013</a>) and head\u2013tail counter-precession, favours an upstream spiralling motion along channel walls. The robustness of this fluid-mechanical rectification mechanism suggests that it is likely to play a key role in the long-distance navigation of mammalian sperm cells. Thus, the detailed analysis reported below not only yields new quantitative insights into the role of biophysical processes during mammalian reproduction but could also lead to new diagnostic tools and improved artificial insemination techniques (<a href=\"#bib22\">Merviel et al., 2010</a>)."

In higher organisms, which typically fertilise internally, sperm transport is much more complex and the importance of shear flows relative to chemotaxis, peristaltic pumping, or thermotaxis still poses an open problem as it is difficult to perform well-controlled in vivo studies. The complex uterine and oviduct topography (<a href=\"#bib33\">Suarez and Pacey, 2006</a>) and large travelling distances render it unlikely that local chemotactic gradients steer sperm cells during the initial and intermediate stages of the sexual reproduction process. Experimental evidence (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kunz et al., 1996</a>) suggests that rapid sperm transport right after insemination is supported by peristaltic pumping driven by muscular contractions of the uterus, but it is not known how sperm navigate in the oviduct. Thermotaxis, the directed response of sperm to local temperature differences, was proposed as a possible long-range rectification mechanism of sperm swimming in rabbits (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bahat et al., 2003</a>), but recently questioned (<a href=\"#bib23\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>) as it is likely to be inhibited by convective currents that form in the presence of temperature gradients. On the other hand, it has long been known that, similar to bacteria (<a href=\"#bib21\">Marcos et al., 2012</a>) and algae (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chengala et al., 2013</a>), mammalian sperm (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adolphi, 1905</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Roberts, 1970</a>) are capable of performing rheotaxis, by aligning against a surrounding flow (<a href=\"#bib21\">Marcos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>), but this effect has yet to be systematically quantified in experiments (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fauci and Dillon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Suarez and Pacey, 2006</a>). Specifically, it is not known at present how sperm cells respond to variations in shear rate and viscosity, and how long they need to adapt to temporal changes in the flow direction. Answering these questions is essential for understanding which physical effects may be important at different stages of the mammalian fertilisation process."

These measurements revealed the interesting result that both human and bull spermatozoa do not simply align against the flow, but instead swim upstream on spiral-shaped trajectories along the walls of a cylindrical channel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The previously unrecognised transversal velocity component can be attributed to the chirality of the flagellar beat. The resulting helical swimming patterns enable the spermatozoa to explore collectively the full surface of a cylindrical channel, suggesting that rheotaxis can help sperm to navigate their way through the oviduct and find the egg cell (<a href=\"#bib23\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>). Using high-speed imaging, we also determined the dynamical response of human and bull spermatozoa to flow reversal at different viscosities, which is essential for understanding how active swimming, rheotaxis, and uterine peristalsis can combine to facilitate optimal sperm transport. To rationalise the experimental observations, we identify below a simple mathematical model that reproduces the main results of our measurements."

The cells were then exposed to well-defined Poiseuille shear flows, corresponding to parabolic flow profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Even in the absence of flow, sperm cells tend to accummulate at surfaces (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rothschild, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Denissenko et al., 2012</a>) due to a combination of steric repulsion (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kantsler et al., 2013</a>) and hydrodynamic forces (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fauci and McDonald, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Elgeti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Friedrich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gaffney et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2012</a>). This can be explained by the fact that, in essence, the flagellar beat traces out a cone which, upon collision, aligns with a solid surface, so that the sperm's propulsion vector points into the boundary and the cells become effectively trapped at the surface (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kantsler et al., 2013</a>). In the presence of a Poiseuille shear flow, cells close to the channel boundaries experience an approximately linear vertical flow profile, whose slope is given by the shear rate <math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To quantify the effects of shear rate and viscosity on sperm swimming, we tracked a large number of individual cells (typically <i>N</i> &gt;10,000) in planar microfluidic channels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) at different shear rates <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover></mrow></math>, ranging from 0.2 s<sup>\u22121</sup> to 9 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, and different dynamic viscosities <i>\u03bc</i>, ranging from 1 mPa\u00b7s (that of water) to 20 mPa\u00b7s (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The cell tracks were then used to reconstruct the velocities of sperm swimming close to the boundary. Mean values and histograms of the upstream and transverse velocity components from those measurements are summarised in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>.

The results for the upstream velocity reveal that both human and bull sperm exhibit optimal upstream swimming at rescaled flow speeds <i>u</i><sub>20</sub> \u223c 1, implying that there is an optimal shear regime for the rectification of sperm swimming. Remarkably, however, we also find that, at low viscosities (<i>\u03bc</i> \u226a10 mPa\u00b7s), human spermatozoa exhibit a substantial shear-induced transverse velocity component that becomes suppressed at very high viscosities. By contrast, for bull spermatozoa, the mean transverse component is generally weaker and less sensitive to viscosity variations. These statements are also corroborated by the corresponding velocity histograms in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>."

                                "text": "Qualitatively, the above observations for stationary shear flows can be explained as follows. Once a sperm cell has become trapped at a surface, its tail explores, on average, regions of higher flow velocity than the head, resulting in a net torque that turns the head against the flow (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This shear-induced rectification is counter-acted by variability in the cells swimming direction. If the shear velocity is too low the orientational \u2018noise\u2019, which is caused by a combination of intrinsic fluctuations in the cells' swimming apparatus, thermal fluctuations, and elastohydrodynamic effects, inhibits upstream swimming, whereas if the shear velocity becomes too large the sperm will simply be advected downstream by the flow, implying that there exists an optimal intermediate shear rate for upstream swimming. Interestingly, we find that the maximum of the upstream velocity decreases more strongly with viscosity for bull sperm than for human sperm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This could be due to differences in cell morphology, as previous numerical studies (<a href=\"#bib30\">Smith et al., 2011</a>) for bacterial cells suggest that differences in head shape can substantially alter swimming behavior. Bull sperm have a flatter head than human sperm, which likely suppresses the rotational motion of the cell at high viscosities thus leading to an effectively smaller vertical beat amplitude <i>A</i>. This could explain why, at high values of <i>\u03bc</i>, the tail beat of bull sperm becomes essentially two-dimensional and constricted to the vicinity of the surface, so that alignment against the flow becomes less efficient."

Human sperm exhibit a strong helical beat component at low-to-moderate values of <i>\u03bc</i> (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), but this chirality becomes suppressed at high viscosities (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) resulting in more planar wave forms (<a href=\"#bib29\">Smith et al., 2009</a>). For comparison, the beat of a bull sperm flagellum is more similar to a rigidly rotating planar wave even at low viscosities (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), thus exhibiting a weaker chirality and leading to smaller transverse velocities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Since the flagellar beating pattern can be controlled not only by viscosity but also by changes in calcium concentration (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ishijima and Hamaguchi, 1993</a>), higher organisms appear to possess several means for tuning transverse and upstream swimming of sperm."

To probe the dynamical response of sperm to changes in the flow direction, we performed additional experiments, where we tracked the motion of bull and human spermatozoa after a sudden flow reversal at two different viscosities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#media5 media6\">Videos 5, 6</a>). In those experiment, sperm were first given time to align against a stationary shear flow, then the flow direction was reversed, <i>u</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>\u2192\u2212<i>u</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>, with a switching time &lt;1 s. Upon flow reversal, a sperm cell typically performs a U-turn (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The characteristic radius of curvature of the trajectory and the typical turning time <i>\u03c4</i> were found to increase strongly with viscosity. At low viscosity, <i>\u03bc</i> \u223c 1 mPa\u00b7s, sperm realign rapidly against the new flow direction with a typical response time of <i>\u03c4</i> \u223c 5 s to 10 s, and the curvature radius is of the order of one or two sperm lengths <i>\u2113</i> \u223c 60 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). By contrast, at a larger viscosity of <i>\u03bc</i> \u223c 12 mPa\u00b7s, which is roughly 4\u00d7 higher than the natural viscosity of the ejaculate, both curvature radius and response time increase by approximately a factor of 5 (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Interestingly, these response times are of the order of typical cervical contractions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kunz et al., 1996</a>), suggesting a possible fine-tuning between muscular activity of the uterus and turning behavior of sperm cells. In particular, immediately after the flow reversal, sperm orientation and flow direction point for a short period of time in approximately the same direction, leading to a momentarily increased transport velocity (see velocity peaks in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, by switching flow directions back and forth at an optimal rate, the transport efficiency of an initially rectified sperm population can be enhanced."

The simplifying assumptions underlying <a href=\"#equ1\">Equations 1</a> and <a href=\"#equ2\">2</a> imply that this minimal model does not accurately capture the dynamics of individual cells at zero shear, as the deterministic terms in <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a> neglect the intrinsic curvature of cell trajectories. However, when analyzing the in-plane curvature for a large number of human sperm trajectories (&gt;100,000 sample points from more than 1200 cells) at zero shear, we found a broad distribution of curvatures with a small positive mean curvature of (5.6 \u00b1 1.3)\u00b710<sup>\u22124</sup> \u03bcm at low viscosity (1 mPa\u00b7s) and a small negative mean curvature (\u22121.9 \u00b1 0.1)\u00b710<sup>\u22123</sup> \u03bcm at high viscosity (12 mPa\u00b7s), where the different signs are consistent with the observed change in the transverse velocity for human sperm at high viscosity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To account at least partially for these curvature variations, we include in <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a> the Gaussian white noise term. Compared with more accurate models that resolve the details of the flagellar dynamics (<a href=\"#bib7\">Elgeti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gaffney et al., 2011</a>), <a href=\"#equ1\">Equations 1</a> and <a href=\"#equ2\">2</a> provide a strongly reduced description which, however, turns out be sufficient for rationalising our experimental observations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Values for <i>V</i> and <math id=\"inf19\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>U</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow></math> can be directly estimated from experiments, and sign conventions in <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a> have been chosen such that <i>\u03c7</i> = +1 for human sperm at low viscosity (for weakly chiral bull sperm one can use <i>\u03c7</i> = 0 in a first approximation). The model parameters (<i>\u03b1</i>, <i>\u03b2</i>, <i>D</i>) can be inferred from the experimental data (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). By performing systematic parameter scans, we found that values <i>\u03b1</i>\u2208[0.2, 0.4], <i>\u03b2</i>\u2208[0.05, 0.1] and <i>D</i>\u2208[0.2, 0.3] rad/s yield good quantitative agreement with the experimental results for both stationary flow (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and flow reversal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that the coupling between shear flow and beat chirality dominates the transverse velocity dynamics. We may therefore conclude that, despite some strong simplifications, the effects included in the model capture indeed the main physical mechanisms relevant for understanding sperm motion in shear flow near a surface."

Our experimental results show that upstream swimming of mammalian sperm due to rheotaxis is more complex than previously thought. Human sperm cells were found to exhibit a significant transverse velocity component that could be of relevance in the fertilisation process, as the ensuing spiralling motion enables spermatozoa to explore collectively a larger surface area of the oviducts, thereby increasing the probability of locating egg cells. Our theoretical analysis implies that the transverse velocity component arises from a preferred handedness in the flagella beat in the presence of shear flow, in contrast to recent findings for male microgametes of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>). Due to the large sample size, our data provide substantial statistical evidence for the hypothesis that mammalian sperm have evolved to achieve optimal upstream swimming near surfaces, possibly exploiting the enhanced fluid production in the female reproductive system during the fertile phase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eschenbach et al., 2000</a>) and after intercourse (<a href=\"#bib23\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>). The improved quantitative knowledge derived from this data may help to design more efficient artificial insemination strategies, for example, by optimising the viscosity and chemical composition of fertilisation media and adjusting injection techniques to maximise upstream swimming of sperm cells. Combined with recent measurements (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kantsler et al., 2013</a>), which clarified the importance of flagella-mediated contact interactions for the accumulation of sperm cells at surfaces, the results presented here yield a cohesive picture of the mechanistic and fluid-mechanical (<a href=\"#bib11\">Friedrich et al., 2010</a>) aspects of long-distance sperm navigation. Future work should focus on merging these insights with quantitative studies of chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Spehr et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kaupp et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zimmer and Riffell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>) to obtain a differentiated understanding of the interplay between physical and chemical factors during various stages of the mammalian reproduction process."

The flagella dynamics was captured with a Fastcam SA-3 Photron camera (San Diego, CA; 125 fps, 40x/NA 0.6 objective). Calibration of the velocity profile in the channel was performed by measuring trajectories of fluorescent beads for different distances from the coverslip via PTV. The measured velocity profile is found identical to the calculated values from solving the Stokes equations for the given geometry.

The field of view (normally 800 \u00d7 800 \u03bcm) was chosen at the middle of the channel (in <i>x</i>-direction), where the in-plane velocity gradient is negligible due to the high aspect ratio of the channel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The <i>v</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>-velocity profiles, measured along the <i>z</i>-coordinate, were found to be in perfect agreement with the theoretically expected parabolic flow profile for this geometry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The shear rate <math id=\"inf21\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover></mrow></math> at a given flow rate was determined from the flow velocity at distance 20 \u03bcm from the wall. The depth of field of the objective was &lt;5 \u03bcm to ensure that we only observed cells that swam close to the surface. Trajectories of individual sperm cells were analysed in MATLAB. The sample size in a single experiment exceeds 100,000 velocity vectors, each measurement for a given viscosity and a shear rate was repeated a few times with different sperm samples.

A recent paper by Miki et al. in Curr. Biol. (2013) showed that there are fluid flows in the oviduct of mammals for some time after coitus that guide sperm swimming upstream towards the egg. Your paper adds to our knowledge by providing the first quantitative analysis of how mammal spermatozoa swimming is guided by surrounding fluid flows and provides a substantial contribution to the understanding of how sperm are transported to the egg before fertilization. The theory is elegant and the arguments presented are quite clear."

At low viscosity (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), the projection of the rotating flagellum never appears as a straight line, implying that the beat pattern has a strong chiral component. By contrast, at high viscosity (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), one can observe instances where the projected flagellum appears as an almost straight line, suggesting that the beat pattern approaches the shape of a rotating planar wave. For comparison, the new <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a> shows bull sperm at low (3 mPa\u00b7s) viscosity. Here the projected beat patterns are qualitatively similar to those of human sperm at high viscosity.

The difference in the sign of the mean value is consistent with the observed change of the transverse velocity in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>. This is evident from the derivation in the Supplementary file 1, our simple model cannot account for this effect because it is based on the analytically tractable approximation of a rigid conical helix.
