However, the computations underlying this context sensitivity remain unknown. To address this question, we introduce a normative (Bayesian) account of how rewards map to incentive values. This assumes that the brain inverts a model of how rewards are generated. Key features of our account include (i) an influence of prior beliefs about the context in which rewards are delivered (weighted by their reliability in a Bayes-optimal fashion), (ii) the notion that incentive values correspond to precision-weighted prediction errors, (iii) and contextual information unfolding at different hierarchical levels. This formulation implies that incentive value is intrinsically context-dependent. We provide empirical support for this model by showing that incentive value is influenced by context variability and by hierarchically nested contexts. The perspective we introduce generates new empirical predictions that might help explaining psychopathologies, such as addiction."

However, the computations underlying this context sensitivity remain unknown. To address this question, we introduce a normative (Bayesian) account of how rewards map to incentive values. This assumes that the brain inverts a model of how rewards are generated. Key features of our account include (i) an influence of prior beliefs about the context in which rewards are delivered (weighted by their reliability in a Bayes-optimal fashion), (ii) the notion that incentive values correspond to precision-weighted prediction errors, (iii) and contextual information unfolding at different hierarchical levels. This formulation implies that incentive value is intrinsically context-dependent. We provide empirical support for this model by showing that incentive value is influenced by context variability and by hierarchically nested contexts. The perspective we introduce generates new empirical predictions that might help explaining psychopathologies, such as addiction."

A promising explanatory framework builds on the notion that the brain\u2019s computations correspond to Bayesian inference and learning. Several empirical and theoretical arguments support a\u00a0Bayesian inference as a general account of brain function (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chater et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clark, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dayan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ernst, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Friston, 2010</a>). The application of similar principles to value learning and planning has inspired the notions of planning as inference and active inference (<a href=\"#bib6\">Botvinick and Toussaint, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Friston et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pezzulo and Rigoli, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pezzulo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Solway and Botvinick, 2012</a>). Here, we consider the possibility that the\u00a0context-sensitive value is a product of Bayesian inference. This implies that incentive value will depend on expectation and uncertainty about rewards, conditioned upon contextual factors. If this is the case, we would expect to see choice behaviour change with any contextual variable that is an <i>ancestor</i> of rewards in the subject\u2019s generative model of these rewards."

This approach considers the brain to possess a generative model of the sensorium, comprising a set of random variables (i.e., hidden states or causes of sensory outcomes) and their causal links (i.e., probabilistic contingencies). The variables can be separated into hidden and observable variables; the former representing the latent causes of observations, and the latter representing sensory evidence or cues. Sensory evidence is conveyed by observable variables, and this evidence is combined with prior beliefs to produce a posterior belief about the (hidden) causes of observations. The application of this logic to perception is straightforward and has proved effective in explaining several empirical phenomena in perception (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chater et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clark, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dayan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ernst, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Friston, 2010</a>).

BCV focuses on scenarios (i) where incentive value depends on contextual information (either represented by cues or by previous rewards) provided before options or rewards are presented, and (ii) where reward is defined by a single attribute (e.g., reward amount). To describe the basic principles of BCV, we adopt the formalism of Bayesian graphs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bishop, 2006</a>) where a generative model is described by nodes or circles, representing random variables (shaded and white circles refer to observed and non-observed variables respectively), and arrows, representing causal relationships among variables. A simple generative model hypothesized by BCV is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, where C represents prior beliefs about the average reward expected in a given context.

This example highlights the fact that some (high-level) contexts are more generic, while other (low-level) contexts are more specific.

Finally, if both contextual levels are in play, one would predict that different incentive values would be attributed to the same dish as a function of both the restaurant and neighbourhood.

This approach conceives incentive value as precision-weighted prediction error and implies two forms of contextual adaptation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). First, as in some previous theories (<a href=\"#bib33\">K\u0151szegi and Rabin, 2006</a>), subtractive normalization emerges as the expected reward is subtracted from the actual reward. Second, the gain term implements divisive normalization, an aspect similar to a recent model in which the range of the reward distribution (which is analogous \u2013 though not identical - to the gain term) divides the reward (Bushong et al., unpublished). These predictions are specific and distinguish BCV from other models. For instance, BCV predicts that divisive normalization derives from the gain term (i.e., reward variance) and not from the expected reward (<a href=\"#bib38\">Louie et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2015</a>), and that the reward variance divides \u2013 and not multiplies (<a href=\"#bib34\">K\u0151szegi and Szeidl, 2013</a>) \u2013 the prediction error. Importantly, these predictions are not <i>ad hoc</i> but derive necessarily from Bayesian assumptions."

Though we observed no overall difference in gambling across participants for \u00a34 and \u00a33 EV (see above), participants could be differentiated based on those who gambled more with \u00a34 or \u00a33 EV. In line with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rigoli et al., 2016a</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2016b</a>), we predicted that the impact of context on gambling depended on a subject-specific propensity to gamble more with large or small choice EVs; in other words on whether a participant prefers to gamble for \u00a33 compared to \u00a34 EV or vice versa. Combining this prediction with BCV predictions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>), participants who risked more with increasing EVs would be expected to gamble more for \u00a34 and less for \u00a33 in the low-variance context (when \u00a34 and \u00a33 would be attributed larger and smaller incentive value respectively) compared to the high-variance context. On the contrary, participants who risked more with decreasing EVs would be expected to gamble less for \u00a34 and more for \u00a33 in the low-variance context compared to the high-variance context. To examine these predictions we tested for an interaction, corresponding to the differential gambling percentage across contexts (low-variance minus high-variance context) for \u00a34 choices minus the differential gambling percentage across contexts (low-variance minus high-variance context) for \u00a33 choices. Across participants, the interaction term did not differ from zero (t(35) = -0.43, p\u00a0=0.67) but, consistent with our hypothesis, it showed a significant correlation with the gambling probability for \u00a34 minus \u00a33 choices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,E,F;</a>\u00a0r(36) = 0.45, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005).

A prediction error is determined by the difference between the observed and expected reward which, in BCV, derives from integrating different expectations under contextual uncertainty. Gain depends on (relative) precision or confidence\u2013 and ensures that the prediction error is normalised and (Bayes) optimally weighted in relation to uncertainty about both context and reward. In brief, only precise prediction errors have an effect on expectations higher in the hierarchy during Bayesian belief updating. BCV predicts that precision exerts an influence in two ways. First, at the\u00a0highest hierarchical levels, precision determines the optimal integration of multiple contextual representations\u2013as it mandates that contexts characterized by a high precision (greater reliability) exert more influence on reward expectancy. For instance, if we assume that subjects have very precise beliefs about the low-level context (e.g., the deck), then the effect of the high-level (e.g., the deck set) will disappear. Formally, this is because in the hierarchical model the low-level context constitutes a Markov blanket for the posterior expectation about the reward option (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bishop, 2006</a>). In other words, the effect of the high-level context tells us that if subjects are using a hierarchical model, there must be posterior uncertainty about the low-level context. Heuristically, even though they can see which deck they are currently playing with, they still nuance their expectations about this deck based upon the deck-set from which it came. Second, at the lowest hierarchical level, the\u00a0precision determines the gain assigned to the prediction error and hence is a direct determinant of incentive value. In our first experiment, we show evidence consistent with the latter expression of precision."

In fact, one central idea of many influential Bayesian proposals is that, when sensory inputs are presented, predictions are explained away and the resulting perception corresponds to (precision-weighted) prediction errors. For instance, predictive coding models are based on evidence that activity in certain brain regions responsible for perception reflects prediction errors and not raw sensory inputs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Friston, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rao and Ballard, 1999</a>). Moreover, it has been proposed that our sense of agency depends on explaining away somatosensory predictions associated with motor commands, with unexplained sensations alone (i.e., residuals) attributed to external forces (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2013</a>). A similar view characterizes active inference schemes, which assume that action is not steered by stimuli per se but by the (precision-weighted) prediction error elicited by those stimuli, expressing the extent to which they depart from expectation in a meaningful way (<a href=\"#bib22\">Friston et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2015</a>)."

Specifically, BCV can integrate\u2013in a Bayes optimal way\u2013context-independent beliefs about the reward distribution with context-sensitive beliefs unfolding at multiple hierarchical levels. The possibility that subjects use hierarchical generative models is in fact supported by our empirical findings. Our results are consistent with the idea that rewards have larger incentive values when both high and low-level contexts are characterized by reward distributions with a smaller average. This indicates that information about more specific (e.g., the deck) and more general (e.g., the deck-set) contexts are integrated to determine incentive values and choice behaviour."

In addition, BCV also has implications for the other levels and there are now several biologically-plausible accounts of how Bayesian inference might be implemented in the brain (e.g., <a href=\"#bib18\">Doya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Friston, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hennequin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Knill and Pouget, 2004</a>), where some accounts consider neuronal circuits (and generative models) characterized by a hierarchical organization (e.g., <a href=\"#bib23\">Friston, 2005</a>). BCV fits comfortably within these biologically-plausible accounts. Consistent with BCV are findings that several brain regions show a response to reward that adapts to both expected reward (e.g., in signalling reward prediction error) and reward range (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cox and Kable, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Louie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rigoli et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tobler et al., 2005</a> <a href=\"#bib32\">Kobayashi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</a>). Recent evidence for an association between neural and choice adaptation is also in line with BCV (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rigoli et al., 2016a</a>).

In addressing this, BCV (similar to other Bayesian inference schemes for continuous variables) implements adaptive coding, because precision-weighted prediction error postulated to be signalled by value-processing neurons is a normalized quantity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doya et al., 2007</a>). Also in line with previous accounts (<a href=\"#bib35\">Louie et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rangel and Clithero, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Summerfield and Tsetsos, 2015</a>), BCV proposes that this normalized signal corresponds to incentive value, and that adaptive coding in the brain should be reflected in a behavioural choice adaptation.

First, our focus is on scenarios where the\u00a0incentive value depends on contextual information (either represented by cues or by previous rewards) provided before reward delivery. Another form of context effect on incentive value is induced by options that are simultaneously available (<a href=\"#bib37\">Louie et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2015</a>). Further theoretical work is needed to link BCV and this form of influence, though a sequential inferential process (e.g. Bayesian belief updating), similar to the process described here (possibly linked to attention) might be involved in simultaneous contextual effects. Second, our focus has been on conditions where reward is defined by a single attribute (e.g., reward amount). Contextual influences (e.g., the decoy effect) can emerge when multiple dimensions need to be evaluated and integrated, as investigated by multi-attribute theories (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huber et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson and Busemeyer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Roe et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Simonson and Tversky, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Soltani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Tsetsos et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tversky, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Usher and McClelland, 2004</a>). BCV can in principle be extended to these scenarios, for instance connecting to a body of work on multisensory integration using Bayesian principles (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ernst, 2006</a>). This would provide an opportunity to model attentional processes determining an optimal weighting of different attributes based on their importance and reliability. Third, our current formulation assumes that the\u00a0model parameters are given, while these parameters need to be learned in the first place. Questions about the mechanisms that might underpin learning of generative models adopted for Bayesian inference are still largely open, though substantial contributions exist particularly in the context of structure learning (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acuna and Schrater, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Collins and Frank, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Courville et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">FitzGerald et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gershman and Niv, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mathys et al., 2011</a>)."

Though Gaussian assumptions are probably an over-simplification, with appropriate adjustments BCV can be extended to generative models with non-Gaussian variables (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010</a>). Indeed, the arguments behind BCV can be applied to any variables with an exponential distribution. However, the key idea (tested in our experiments \u2013 and here derived from Gaussian assumptions) that reward average and variance elicit subtractive and divisive normalization, respectively, is quite general and can also be applied, for instance, to uniform (and, in general, non-skewed) distributions."

Consider the consequences of drug misuse, including the development of tolerance (i.e., the need of increased dosages to obtain the same effects as those obtained previously) and the lack of satisfaction when engaging in activities that were pleasurable before the development of addiction. BCV interprets these effects in terms of increases in expected reward (following drug misuse) that decreases the incentive value of rewards, including the drug itself and other motivational stimuli. A similar explanation has been proposed by classical homeostatic theories, where ingestion of the drug is conceived in terms of a means to re-establish a biological set point (e.g., expressed in baseline activity of dopamine neurons), coupled with the fact that the\u00a0repeated drug misuse raises this set point. BCV formalise and extend the set-point model. First, it relaxes the homeostatic assumption because incentive value depends on a reference point (i.e., the reward average), but does not correspond to distance from a set point as in homeostatic schemes. Indeed, set-point models predict that drug consumption always reduces a negative affect state by re-establishing a set point. Conversely, BCV suggests that drug consumption can decrease a negative state (when the drug-associated outcome is worse than expected) but also induce a positive affect (when the drug-associated outcome is better than expected), a prediction more consistent with empirical evidence (<a href=\"#bib55\">Robinson and Berridge, 2000</a>). Second, leveraging a Bayesian framework, BCV assigns a crucial role to reward uncertainty, above and beyond a role assigned to expected reward. For instance, increased uncertainty over prior reward beliefs may boost the magnitude of the (positive) prediction error elicited by drug consumption, hence enhancing individual predisposition to drug addiction."

This formulation implies that incentive value is intrinsically context-dependent. We tested key predictions of the model in two human experiments and show choice behaviour consistent with an adapting incentive value based on reward variance and on an average reward expected after integrating contexts at two hierarchical levels, one more general and the other more specific. An important consideration is that expression of context effect, though apparently irrational, can derive from Bayes (optimal) inference. Indeed, if incentive values are (precision-weighted) prediction errors, they are necessarily context-dependent, and this dependency can be described under a Bayes optimal scheme. We argue that this approach could be useful in generating new empirical predictions and in explaining phenomena in psychopathologies characterized by dysfunctional value attribution, such as addiction."

Parameters were constrained within the following ranges: \u22125 and 5 for \u03b1 (in both experiments), \u221210 and 10 for \u03c1 (in both experiments), 0.1 and 10 for \u03c4 (in experiment one), \u22121 and 1 for \u03c4<sub><i>LC</i></sub> and \u03c4<sub><i>HC</i></sub> (in experiment two). In addition, to minimize the effect of biased outlier estimates, Gaussian priors with mean zero (<a href=\"#bib16\">Daw, 2011</a>) were used for estimation of log(\u03c4) (in experiment one) and estimation of \u03c4<sub><i>LC</i></sub> and \u03c4<sub><i>HC</i></sub> (in experiment two). Starting values for parameter estimation was zero for all parameters, except for the context parameter \u03c4 in experiment one for which it was one.

We compared the full model with nested models, namely where one or more parameters were fixed to zero. To do this, we used the standard approach of the likelihood-ratio test (<a href=\"#bib9\">Casella and Berger, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Daw, 2011</a>), which allows for a comparison of nested models. This is based on the fact that the difference in negative log-likelihood times two (2<i>d</i>) between a nested and a more complex model follows a chi-square distribution, where the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of additional parameters of the more complex model. A chi-square test can be performed to estimate the probability that the observed <i>2d</i> is due to chance under the null hypothesis that data are generated by the nested model, allowing acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis."

However, the effects of precision \u2013 which are a key element of Bayesian approaches \u2013 are untested in the analysis of the experimental data. As the authors state in the paper, reward variance is not manipulated and the divisive term (K) cannot be examined. In addition, the subtractive terms should also be precision-weighted by terms relating posterior and prior variances (denoted by tau_LO and tau_HO). However, the results only speak to overall context effects, essentially asking whether there is an overall effect of low and high context on gambling (population regression effects in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, and the chi-square tests showing positive tau_LO and tau_HO parameters)."

To properly test whether the precision of reward prediction errors established by the different contexts really plays an important role, the authors should fit the full model to datasets with contexts that differ substantially in their reward variance and that disentangle reward magnitude from reward variance.

To test these predictions we correlated \u03b1 (i.e., the slope of the logistic regression) with the difference in gambling for common EVs.

In contrast, the modelling solution is based on continuous (Gaussian) distributions that are not restricted by the bounds imposed by each context. There are two problems with this: (1) If we assume that the subjects indeed optimally integrate all information, then a flat prior belief bounded by the context's minimum and maximum reward would be accurate. This cannot be modelled by the presented specification. (2) Even if subjects employed continuous Gaussian priors to model reward expectations, such distributions would probably not be narrow enough with respect to the context bounds (i.e., the priors would wrongly lead to expectations of rewards that are outside of the bounded scale). These problems will probably be evident if the authors report the values of the latent variables after fitting the model to the empirical data.

It is true that real agents may build non-Gaussian representations, especially in conditions where the true distributions are non-Gaussian. However, the advantage of using Gaussian assumptions is that posterior probability can be estimated analytically with equations which are simple and clear, and resemble common formulations widely used in decision-making and motivation research (e.g., Rescorla-Wagner update rule). Therefore, we would like to stick with Gaussian variables when presenting the model, which we believe is a better approach in making the model clear and transparent. Also on the question of fitting the model to choice data, we believe that Gaussian assumptions should not be problematic, as the equations used are more general. In other words, these equations can be derived from Gaussian assumptions but are valid also for other distributions such as uniform distributions (in general, non-skewed distributions)."

This is potentially problematic because this method may lead to outlier estimates which are biased, and is a potential problem for our findings in relation with model-comparison and in relation with within-subjects t-tests over the context parameters. To address this possibility, we now adopt a Gaussian prior with mean zero (Daw, 2011) during estimation of the context parameters. This allows extreme parameter estimates only if they improve substantially the negative log-likelihood, hence avoiding possible biased extreme outliers. Note in addition that a prior mean of zero does not bias the t-tests since we tested the parameters against zero. For a sanity-check, in supplemental materials we now report frequencies of the parameter estimates (for experiment one: <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; for experiment two: <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).
