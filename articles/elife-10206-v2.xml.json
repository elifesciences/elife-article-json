The learning process is regulated by receptors on the surface of brain cells called N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (or NMDA receptors for short). These receptors help to strengthen signals between brain cells, which allows a new concept or action to be learned. However, it has been difficult to pin down how the role of NMDA receptors selectively in specific types of brain cells. While drugs can be used to quickly block NMDA receptors throughout the brain, it is hard to target drugs to a specific cell type. Also, genetic engineering can be used to selectively knock out NMDA receptors in certain types of brain cells, but these techniques are too slow, and can take weeks or even a lifetime to work."

Next, living mouse brain cells, including some that were engineered to express the pig enzyme, were exposed to the drug in the laboratory. The drug blocked the NMDA receptors on brain cells that expressed the enzyme, but not the receptors on nearby brain cells that lacked the enzyme.

Small molecule antagonists allow rapid blockade of NMDA-Rs, which has been critical for analyzing synaptic plasticity processes that operate over short timescales.

Alternatively, genetic methods can be used, typically involving Cre-recombinase (Cre)-mediated excision of a loxP flanked exon in <i>Grin1</i>, which encodes a critical NMDA-R subunit that is required for channel function. This allows cell type-specific ablation of NMDA-R function by crossing to a mouse line with cell type-selective expression of Cre or by spatially targeted injection of Cre-expressing viral vectors. A major limitation is that genetic methods are not fast; they typically disrupt NMDA-Rs over timescales ranging from a week to the lifetime of an animal, during which time substantial compensatory effects in circuit function are observed (<a href=\"#bib9\">Engblom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Zweifel et al., 2008</a>).

To examine the cell type selectivity of this reagent, we measured NMDA-R excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in brain slices from the mouse cerebral cortex. In utero electroporation (IUE) of the bicistronic plasmid <i>pCAG::PLE-IRES-mCherry</i> into the developing mouse brain allowed PLE and mCherry co-expression in only a subset of cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Consistent with previous work, PLE expression was well tolerated in cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Tian et al., 2012</a>). We isolated NMDA-R EPSC responses for cortical layer 4\u2192layer 2/3 (L4\u2192L2/3) projections by recording neurons in L2/3 while electrically stimulating presynaptic neurons in L4 during constitutive pharmacological block of other ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA and kainate receptors) and GABA receptors. Brain slices were incubated with CM-MK801 (5 \u00b5M), and L4\u2192L2/3 NMDA-R EPSCs were recorded using the perforated patch configuration (necessary to avoid dilution of enzyme-liberated MK801 by diffusion into the patch pipette that was observed with whole cell recordings) in mCherry-expressing (PLE<sup>+</sup>) and adjacent non-expressing (PLE<sup>\u2212</sup>) neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The NMDA-R EPSC amplitude (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and mean NMDA-R charge transfer (Q<sub>NMDA</sub>: mean integrated current, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) decreased in a use-dependent manner in PLE<sup>+</sup> neurons to a level similar to treatment with the competitive NMDA-R antagonist D-(\u2212)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 100 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>; Q<sub>NMDA</sub> inhibition: CM-MK801, 82% \u00b1 4; AP5, 84% \u00b1 4; n = 11; unpaired t test, p = 0.75). This shows that CM-MK801 can completely block NMDA-R currents in neurons expressing the PLE transgene. In contrast, in the presence of CM-MK801, PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons that were adjacent to PLE<sup>+</sup> neurons showed scant reduction of Q<sub>NMDA</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>). The slight Q<sub>NMDA</sub> reduction in PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons exposed to CM-MK801 was not significantly different than Q<sub>NMDA</sub> in neurons in the absence of CM-MK801 (Q<sub>NMDA</sub> inhibition: PLE<sup>\u2212</sup>/CM-MK801: 16% \u00b1 8.9, n = 6; PLE<sup>+</sup>: 33% \u00b1 8.6, n = 4; PLE<sup>\u2212</sup>: 21% \u00b1 6.3; ANOVA, <i>F</i><sub>2,13</sub> = 2.3, p = 0.15), thus Q<sub>NMDA</sub> reduction in PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons was due to modest NMDA-R synaptic rundown (<a href=\"#bib16\">Rosenmund and Westbrook, 1993</a>) and not an effect of MK801 in PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons. These results show that CM-MK801 can be targeted specifically to neurons expressing a transgenic esterase and that CM-MK801 is selective, where MK801, once liberated, is confined to the PLE-expressing cell population."

One problem that has been difficult to address with existing tools is the role of NMDA-Rs in cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity. Cocaine blocks dopamine reuptake, which elevates extracellular concentrations. Earlier work demonstrated that cocaine and elevated dopamine leads to long-term synaptic potentiation of AMPA receptor-type (AMPA-R) synaptic currents in dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Argilli et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), a key neuronal cell type associated with reward and addiction. Further analysis demonstrated that synaptic potentiation involved signaling through dopamine receptor 5, new protein synthesis, and insertion of AMPA-R subunits (<a href=\"#bib1\">Argilli et al., 2008</a>). These experiments also showed that NMDA-R blockade, by systemic application of MK801, prevented synaptic potentiation in DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, it has been challenging to establish the functional importance of NMDA-Rs specifically in DA neurons for cocaine-induced synaptic AMPA-R potentiation, as opposed to a possible indirect process involving NMDA-Rs on other cell types. To disrupt this process specifically in DA neurons, studies using dopamine neuron-specific knockout of <i>Grin1</i> were performed but, in several instances, these were confounded by compensatory effects in which synaptic AMPA-Rs were constitutively potentiated in DA neurons in the absence of cocaine (<a href=\"#bib9\">Engblom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Zweifel et al., 2008</a>). Even virally mediated deletion of <i>Grin1</i> showed these compensatory effects within 1 week (<a href=\"#bib26\">Zweifel et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, another study found that use of tamoxifen-activiated Cre-ER for selective <i>Grin1</i> ablation in DA neurons prevented a cocaine-induced shift in the rectification of AMPA-Rs after 1 week (<a href=\"#bib9\">Engblom et al., 2008</a>), which indicated that dopamine neuron NMDA-Rs were required for cocaine-induced plasticity."

Cocaine increases extracellular dopamine which leads to NMDA-R dependent upregulation of synaptic AMPA (\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors.

For this, we co-expressed PLE and the fluorescent protein mCherry in DA neurons using a Cre-dependent recombinant adeno-associated viral vector, <i>rAAV2/1-Synapsin::FLEX-rev-PLE-2a-mCherry</i> (2a: ribosomal skip sequence [<a href=\"#bib8\">Donnelly et al., 2001</a>]) that was targeted unilaterally into the VTA of <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> mice, a mouse line that selectively expresses Cre-recombinase in DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Zhuang et al., 2005</a>). In the same mice, control (PLE<sup>\u2212</sup>) DA neurons were labeled using a Cre-dependent virus expressing EGFP that was targeted to DA neurons in the VTA on the other side of the brain. To investigate the involvement of dopamine neuron NMDA receptors, we adopted a previously described brain slice model that was sufficient to recapitulate the processes underlying cocaine-mediated synaptic AMPA-R potentiation in DA neurons ex vivo (<a href=\"#bib1\">Argilli et al., 2008</a>). VTA brain slices containing DA neurons expressing PLE/mCherry and EGFP on opposite sides of the brain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) were incubated with CM-MK801 (5 \u00b5M) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) followed by a short exposure to cocaine (5 \u00b5M in ACSF, 10 min) or vehicle and afterwards the brain slices were transferred to ACSF with CM-MK801 for 3\u20135 more hours. After this induction period, miniature excitatory postsynaptic AMPA-R currents (mEPSCs) were recorded from DA neurons, which could be isolated by blocking inhibitory GABA-Rs and voltage gated sodium channels. As shown previously in VTA-containing brain slices exposed to cocaine (<a href=\"#bib1\">Argilli et al., 2008</a>), DA neurons showed significantly elevated potentiation of mEPSC amplitudes in PLE<sup>\u2212</sup>/GFP<sup>+</sup> DA neurons in the presence of CM-MK801, which further demonstrates the lack of activity for CM-MK801 in PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons. Strikingly though, for PLE<sup>+</sup>/mCherry<sup>+</sup> DA neurons in CM-MK801 and cocaine, mEPSC amplitudes were not elevated and were similar to PLE<sup>+</sup> or PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> DA neurons in CM-MK801 that had not been exposed to cocaine. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; Coc<sup>+</sup>/PLE<sup>\u2212</sup>, 19.9 \u00b1 0.9 pA, n = 17; Coc<sup>+</sup>/PLE<sup>+</sup>, 12.7 \u00b1 0.8 pA, n = 14; Coc<sup>\u2212</sup>/PLE<sup>\u2212</sup>, 13.9 \u00b1 0.6 pA, n = 12; Coc<sup>\u2212</sup>/PLE<sup>+</sup>, 12.8 \u00b1 0.7 pA, n = 15; ANOVA <i>F</i><sub>3,57</sub> = 19.0, p &lt; 0.001). The frequency of mEPSCs in DA neurons was not affected by CM-MK801 or cocaine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, ANOVA <i>F</i><sub>3,57</sub> = 0.30, p = 0.82). In addition, the membrane properties of DA neurons after CM-MK801 exposure were indistinguishable in PLE<sup>+</sup> or PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> cells treated or untreated with cocaine, further indicating that CM-MK801 is not perturbative to resting neuronal properties. Therefore, using cell type-specific pharmacology in an ex vivo preparation, these experiments demonstrate that NMDA-Rs in DA neurons are necessary for cocaine-induced potentiation of synaptic AMPA-R currents in this cell type ex vivo, which is consistent with a prior report that examined this problem using Cre-ER in vivo (<a href=\"#bib9\">Engblom et al., 2008</a>)."

Cell type-specific pharmacology for activating genetically engineered ion channels has been described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Slimko et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Magnus et al., 2011</a>), and here we demonstrate rapid cell type-specific blockade of a native ion channel with a small molecule. Our data indicates that MK801 was liberated only in PLE<sup>+</sup> but not in neighboring PLE<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons, showing that this approach can be used to block NMDARs with cellular specificity. The absence of a neighbor effect with CM-MK801/PLE is consistent with experiments targeting MK801 to individual neurons in a patch pipette (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bender et al., 2006</a>). We applied this to DA neurons to further examine the role for NMDA-Rs in cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation, which has been investigated in several pharmacological (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Argilli et al., 2008</a>) and genetic studies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Engblom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Zweifel et al., 2008</a>). Our experiments using cell type-specific pharmacology provide additional evidence for the necessity of NMDA-Rs in cocaine-induced long-term synaptic potentiation in DA neurons ex vivo. One limitation of the approach presented here is that the aqueous solubility of CM-MK801 (5\u201310 \u03bcM) make it less suitable for direct injection into the brain because of the requirement for elevated levels of co-solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (&gt;0.1%), which resulted in VTA-containing brain slices that were unsuitable for recordings. Because of this, it was not possible for us to determine if AMPA-R potentiation occurs after inactivation of NMDA-R in vivo using the chemogenetic method described here. Therefore, additional improvements to cell type-specific pharmacological techniques are needed to facilitate manipulations in mammalian brains in vivo."

                        "text": "However, because functional NMDA receptors are widely expressed throughout the mammalian nervous system, ex vivo approaches to rapidly disrupt NMDA-R signaling with cell type specificity have broad utility. NMDA-Rs are expressed in both neurons and glia (<a href=\"#bib6\">Conti et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff, 2007</a>), and selective genetic access to these cell classes in the brain could allow for dissection of their relative role in synaptic function. Moreover, neurons have been classified into many different molecularly defined cell types, which are accessible through a growing resource of Cre-expressing mouse lines (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gong et al., 2007</a>). In combination with Cre-dependent viral approaches (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atasoy et al., 2008</a>), this will allow the role of NMDA-Rs to be selectively evaluated in any molecularly defined neuron population in manner similar to what we demonstrated for DA neurons. In addition, the relative roles of presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDA-Rs has been extensively analyzed in brain slices (<a href=\"#bib7\">Corlew et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Rodriguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</a>), which PLE/CM-MK801 may facilitate because it offers a new method for selectively blocking NMDA-Rs in defined subpopulations of neurons. Finally, the strategy applied here for selective delivery of MK801 can be extended to other small molecules for use in brain tissue (<a href=\"#bib19\">Tian et al., 2012</a>), allowing for an approach that combines chemistry, molecular genetics, and neurobiology to dissect cell signaling pathways in specific cell types in the central nervous system."

The authors developed a new synthetic inert masked MK801 derivative that can be \u201cunmasked\u201d and activated inside the cells that have been previously successfully transfected with a virus that allowed the expression of the fundamental catalytic enzyme porcine liver esterase (PLE). Additionally, the authors tested for cellular specificity by using as a convenient experimental framework in utero electroporation of a plasmid that allowed co-expression of the PLE enzyme and of a fluorescent tag (mCherry). Subsequently, using brain slice electrophysiology from transfected mouse cerebral cortex the authors described convincing evidence of cellular specificity by showing a decreased in NMDA-R mediated excitatory postsynaptic current in a use-dependent manner in PLE<sup>+</sup> cells and almost no effect in adjacent PLE<sup>-</sup> cortical neurons. Moreover, the authors provided an additional experimental application of this new methodology. In fact, they used a brain slice model that is capable of recapitulating the cocaine mediated AMPA receptors potentiation in dopamine neurons, a phenomenon that is NMDA dependent. Elegantly, VTA brain slices from DATcre animals that have been infected with PLE and subsequently treated with CM-MK801 right before being incubated with cocaine are resistant to cocaine-induce plasticity. The study is thorough, very well done, and the data are both consistent and compelling."

These investigators use a clever pharmacogenetic approach, combining cell-specific expression of the porcine liver esterase (PLE) with delivery of MK801 linked to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzyl carbamate through a carboxymethylpropyl ester group. Using a cortical slice physiology preparation the authors demonstrate PLE/CM-MK801 blocks NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents. They also use this approach to show that NMDAR blockade in dopamine neurons prevents cocaine-evoked synaptic increases in AMPA receptors without causing the synaptic scaling previously shown to occur following genetic NMDAR inactivation. Overall the study is well written and logical. I believe this work is appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>, but would greatly benefit from the addition of a minor experiment to establish reversibility, or lack thereof."

What the 2008 study by Engblom shows is that the ablation of GluN1 after completion of the postnatal development leads to a complete and selective loss of the NMDA currents in DA neurons. It also shows that when these animals were exposed to cocaine, no drug-evoked plasticity was observed (the IV curve of the AMPAR-EPSC remained linear and the amplitude of the spontaneous EPSCs remained unaffected. The conclusion of the paper thus was that the NMDA on DA neurons were required for the induction of the plasticity. This needs to be acknowledged in the Introduction. The present study is an important confirmation of the 2008 finding."

The choice to examine NMDA-R-mediated synaptic potentiation after cocaine administration was based on a desire to examine the utility of the system in a biological system. A nice example of the challenge with ion channel manipulations with genetic methods was the considerable difficulty that was reported by the Palmiter and L\u00fcscher groups in 2008 for DA neuron <i>Grin1</i> ablation. L\u00fcscher ultimately managed to avoid compensatory increases in AMPA-R rectification using Cre-ER in vivo. We thought that confirmation of this in vivo result, even with an ex vivo application of our tools would be a nice demonstration of the strengths of our method, and it also led to us discover an in vivo limitation of the current implementation of the method due to limited aqueous solubility. In our last revision, we made a number of changes to reflect this point. Now, we have made further modifications to emphasize the ex vivo aspects of our study and the confirmatory nature of it, relative to the Engblom study."
