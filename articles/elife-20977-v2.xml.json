ACD is also critical for generating diverse cell types during embryonic development. During ACD, many cellular components have been reported to segregate asymmetrically, including fate determinants, certain organelles, sister chromatids/histones and damaged proteins (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tajbakhsh and Gonzalez, 2009</a>). Although cellular asymmetries are critical aspects of ACD, the essence of successful cell division is the precise replication and segregation of cellular contents, such as chromosomes and essential organelles. It has been underexplored how cells may achieve productive ACD without interfering with the basic requirement of cell divisions."

As the major microtubule-organizing centers in the cell, the centrosomes have the ability to influence the segregation of many cellular components during cell division: most critically, the centrosomes play a fundamental role as spindle poles during mitosis to achieve faithful, equal segregation of sister chromatids (<a href=\"#bib23\">Meraldi, 2016</a>). On the other hand, it is reported that aggresomes (damaged protein aggregates) are segregated asymmetrically to only one cells during cell division, by being associated with a centrosome (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rujano et al., 2006</a>). It is also reported that proteins destined for degradation are targeted to the centrosomes and segregated asymmetrically during human embryonic stem cell divisions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fuentealba et al., 2008</a>). We have shown that biased segregation of sister chromatids (<a href=\"#bib43\">Yadlapalli and Yamashita, 2013</a>) and asymmetric inheritance of the midbody ring (<a href=\"#bib36\">Salzmann et al., 2014</a>) depend on the centrosomes in <i>Drosophila</i> male germline stem cells (GSCs). In these examples, it is plausible that a slight difference in MTOC activities between the mother and the daughter centrosomes is utilized to achieve asymmetric segregation of cellular components (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tajbakhsh and Gonzalez, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yamashita et al., 2007</a>). This raises two critical questions: (1) how might the mother and daughter centrosomes be distinctly regulated within the stem cells to achieve asymmetric segregation of certain cellular components? And (2) how do the mother and daughter centrosomes achieve the critical balance of segregating certain cellular components asymmetrically, while achieving equal segregation of other components such as sister chromatids?"

ACD of GSCs is influenced by their stem cell niche, which secretes self-renewal ligands and specifies GSC identity. GSCs attach to the hub cells, which function as a major niche component (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The mother centrosomes in the GSCs are positioned near the hub cells throughout the cell cycle, whereas the daughter centrosomes migrate toward the distal side of the GSCs, and are inherited by the gonialblasts (GBs), the differentiating daughters of GSCs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yamashita et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2007</a>)(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Such stereotypical positioning of centrosomes helps orient the mitotic spindle perpendicular to the hub cells, leading to retention of GSCs within the niche and displacement of GBs away from the niche and ensuring the asymmetric outcome of the stem cell divisions. Although it is clear that this stereotypical centrosome positioning would help orient the mitotic spindle to achieve ACD, many intriguing questions surrounding the phenomenon of asymmetric centrosome inheritance remain to be answered: Do the mother and/or daughter centrosomes carry fate determinants or any characteristics that contribute to fate determination? Are stem cell centrosomes regulated differently than the centrosomes in non-stem cells?"

We show that depletion of <i>klp10A</i> results in elongation of the mother centrosomes in stem cells, but not the daughter centrosomes in the stem cells or any centrosomes in SGs, differentiating progeny of stem cells. Elongated mother centrosomes in GSCs result in multiple undesirable asymmetries, such as sister chromatid missegregation of small fourth chromosomes and asymmetric daughter cell size, suggesting that <i>klp10A</i> is required to balance asymmetries during ACD. Based on our findings, we propose that the mechanisms of ACD have the potential to generate undesirable asymmetries, which must be counterbalanced to achieve functional/productive ACD."

To our knowledge, this is the first protein reported to date to be enriched on the stem cell centrosomes compared to the centrosomes of non-stem cells. These data indicate that Klp10A might play a role in the stem cell-specific function of centrosomes, prompting us to further study the role of Klp10A in GSC divisions."

In wild-type GSCs, the mother and daughter centrosomes are equal in size with the mother centrosome located near the hub throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yamashita et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2007</a>). However, in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i>or <i>klp10A<sup>ThbA</sup></i> testes, the centrosomes proximal to the hub cells (presumably the mother centrosomes) in the GSCs elongated dramatically, reaching up to\u00a0~7 \u00b5m (average of 1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 \u00b5m, compared to an average of 0.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u00b5m in control GSCs, N\u00a0=\u00a050 GSCs for each genotype), whereas the distal centrosomes (presumably the daughter centrosomes) in the GSCs were slightly shorter than the control centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). 46.6% of GSCs examined contained a visibly elongated centrosome (n\u00a0=\u00a0277, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that it was indeed an elongated centrosome, not a primary cilium, because it lacked the surrounding membrane found on primary cilia (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,C\u2019</a>). Elongated centrosomes were positive for three centrosomal markers examined along their entire length (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), further confirming their identity as centrosomes. Centrosomes in SGs were not elongated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that Klp10A\u2019s role in preventing centrosome elongation is unique to GSCs. The centrosomes in spermatocytes in <i>klp10A<sup>ThbA</sup></i> hypomorphic mutant were slightly elongated, as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib7\">Delgehyr et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, in spermatocytes, both mother and daughter centrosomes showed the same extent of elongation, in stark contrast to GSCs where only one centrosome is elongated. The centrosome elongation in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup>\u00a0</i>was rescued by the introduction of an RNAi-insensitive <i>UAS</i>-<i>GFP-klp10A</i> transgene (<i>nos</i>-<i>gal4&gt;UAS</i>-<i>GFP-klp10A</i>), excluding the possibility of an off-target effect (not shown)."

This notion was further supported by using a mother-centrosome\u2013labeling method reported previously (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yamashita et al., 2007</a>). In this method, flies express PACT-GFP under control of the <i>NGT40-gal4</i> driver, which preferentially labels the mother centrosome. We found that the elongated centrosomes were preferentially labeled by PACT-GFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>): 73% of elongated centrosomes in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup>\u00a0</i>GSCs were labeled by PACT-GFP (n\u00a0=\u00a040/55), whereas the shorter centrosome was labeled by PACT-GFP in 0% of GSCs. In the remaining 27% of cases (n\u00a0=\u00a015/55), both centrosomes were similar in size and the correlation between the centrosome age (mother/daughter) and length could not be determined. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that PACT is preferentially incorporated into the larger centrosome (irrespective of age) in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup>\u00a0</i>GSCs, the above data indicate that it is likely the mother centrosome that elongates upon loss of <i>klp10A</i> function."

This result suggests that the centrosome that stays in the GSC (i.e. the mother centrosomes) continuously and gradually elongates. In contrast, the GSC daughter centrosomes do not elongate even after they mature to become the mother centrosome once in differentiating germ cells (GBs/SGs). These results reveal that the GSC mother centrosomes have an inherent tendency to elongate, which is counteracted by the function of Klp10A. This might be because of the need of the GSC mother centrosomes to be constantly anchored to the hub-GSC junction (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yamashita et al., 2007</a>), necessitating stronger microtubule nucleating activity throughout the cell cycle. Despite the striking effect of <i>klp10A</i> loss of function on centrosome length, overexpression of Klp10A did not result in any effect on the centrosome length (0.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26 \u00b5m in control GSCs, 0.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22 \u00b5m in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> GSCs (N\u00a0=\u00a067 GSCs for each genotype, p=0.70))."

It has been documented that the sister chromatids of chromosome 4, easily identified by its small size, segregate to the spindle poles before the onset of anaphase and are visualized as phosphor-histone H3 (PH3)-positive dots near the spindle poles during metaphase (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dej et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Orr-Weaver, 1995</a>). In control metaphase cells, PH3-positive chromosome 4 s were always observed at both spindle poles, and missegregation was never observed (0%, n\u00a0=\u00a014 mitotic GSCs, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, in 90% of <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> metaphase GSCs with asymmetric centrosome size, PH3 signal was observed only near the elongated centrosomes, whereas the shorter centrosomes were not associated with any PH3 signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a021 mitotic GSCs). Although it remains possible that missegregation of chromosome 4 is due to Klp10A\u2019s function on the kinetochore, the following observation favors the possibility that asymmetric spindle force is the major cause of chromosome 4 missegregation: we observed that the frequency of chromosome 4 missegregation was considerably lower in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> metaphase GSCs, when the two centrosomes appear to be similar in size (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, 22%, n\u00a0=\u00a09 mitotic GSCs). Chromosome 4 missegregation does not likely have immediate effects on GSC viability, because chromosome 4 is essential only for development, not cell viability (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gelbart, 1974</a>). These results indicate that abnormally elongated mother centrosomes in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> GSCs cause asymmetric force generation during GSC mitoses. Consistent with the fact that we did not observe any centrosome elongation in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> SGs, SG spindles did not show asymmetry during mitosis (not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that Klp10A is required to prevent abnormal asymmetry in MTOC activity during GSC division."

By time-lapse live observation of GSCs expressing GFP-\u03b1-tubulin, we followed mitosis in control and <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> GSCs. In control GSCs, GSCs established a spindle that is symmetric in shape (the two half spindles are equal in size) and oriented toward the hub cells, as reported previously (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yamashita et al., 2003</a>). Mitosis in control GSCs resulted in a GSC and a GB of equal size. In contrast, in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> GSCs, abnormally elongated mother centrosomes and the normal-sized daughter centrosomes organized an asymmetric spindle, with the proximal half being much larger than the distal half (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Such asymmetry persisted to the end of mitosis, resulting in asymmetric cell size with GSCs being significantly larger than their sister GBs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

                                "text": "Concomitantly with GSC division yielding two daughter cells of different cell size, we observed a striking increase in GB death. Previously, we have shown that there is a basal level of germ cell death under normal conditions (i.e. with optimal nutrient conditions in young flies) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</a>). Germ cell death is characterized by acidification of dying cells that is detectable by Lysotracker (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</a>). In control testes, most cell death was observed at the 16-cell stage of SGs, whereas GBs were rarely observed to die (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</a>). In contrast, in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> testis, there was a marked increase in the death of GBs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). This might be because GBs that are too small cannot maintain their viability, and undergo cell death. Although it is difficult to establish a causative relationship between small GB size and increased GB death, the fact that <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> increases cell death and decreases cell size specifically in GBs (but not GSCs or SGs) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,F</a>) implies such a relationship. In support of this idea, time-lapse live observation captured an example of GB death following GSC division, where a small GB eventually lost nuclear integrity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As described above, sister chromatids of fourth chromosomes were missegregated during mitoses of <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> GSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). However, we did not detect missegregation of major chromosomes (X, Y, second and third chromosomes). By employing FISH method using chromosome specific probes, we found no evidence for chromosome missegregation for major chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, it is unlikely that the chromosome missegregation is the cause of GB death. Next we examined the segregation patterns of cellular organelles. Mitochondria segregated equally during GSC division in control/wild type, whereas more mitochondria were inherited by GB in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup>\u00a0</i>testes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Because GBs inherited more mitochondria than GSCs, it is unlikely that missegregation of mitochondria explains the higher frequency of GB death. It is of note that the GBs, which have less MTOC activity, inherit more mitochondria. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is currently unclear. Golgi was observed to be inherited predominantly by GBs during control/wild type GSC divisions, whereas GSCs inherited more Golgi upon knockdown of <i>klp10A</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). If the amount of Golgi is essential for GB viability, this might explain why GBs die more frequently. In summary, although it remains unclear whether the perturbed segregation patterns of any single organelle can explain the frequent GB death, these data suggest that asymmetric spindle in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup>\u00a0</i>GSCs results in altered patterns of organelle segregation, which might collectively compromise the viability of GBs. Alternatively, a cell size checkpoint may be in operation, possibly eliminating cells that are too small (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kellogg, 2003</a>). It is also possible that a cell competition mechanism might lead to elimination of unfit cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Johnston, 2009</a>)."

Its localization and mutant phenotype provide important insights into centrosome biology of stem cells. Klp10A\u2019s enrichment on the stem cell centrosomes but not on the centrosomes of differentiating SGs suggests the presence of cellular mechanisms unique to stem cell centrosomes. Moreover, <i>klp10A</i> knockdown/mutation led to elongation of the mother centrosome specifically within stem cells; neither the daughter centrosome in GSCs nor any centrosomes in SGs were elongated. This phenotype demonstrates that the stem cell mother centrosome has unique characteristics and modes of regulation and indicates that the GSC mother centrosome has an inherent tendency to elongate, which must be counteracted by Klp10A. The mother centrosome in GSCs may have distinct microtubule dynamics, partly because of the necessity for the mother centrosome to be anchored to the hub-GSC interface throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yamashita et al., 2007</a>). It is worth noting that the centrosome size itself might not be the cause of asymmetric force generation. It was recently reported that loss of function of <i>asterless (asl),</i> the gene that encodes a core centriolar component, results in mother centrosome-specific elongation in <i>Drosophila</i> male GSCs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Galletta et al., 2016</a>).

This results in asymmetry in cell sizes as well. For example, <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblasts divide asymmetrically to produce another neuroblast and a differentiating cell (either ganglion mother cell in type I neuroblast lineage, or intermediate neural progenitor cell in type II neuroblast lineage) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Doe and Bowerman, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Prehoda, 2009</a>). In neuroblast divisions, the self-renewing neuroblast is considerably larger than its differentiating daughter cell. Similarly, the first mitosis of <i>C. elegans</i> zygote is also characterized by asymmetric daughter cell sizes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rose and Gonczy, 2014</a>). Asymmetric spindle morphology contributes to cell size asymmetry together with a myosin-dependent pathway that controls cleavage furrow positioning (<a href=\"#bib1\">Cabernard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Knoblich, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pacquelet et al., 2015</a>). These examples highlight that the asymmetry in daughter cell sizes can be a programmed process and does not inherently lead to cell death, as observed in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> GSC divisions. More interestingly, in <i>C. elegans</i> Q lineage neuroblasts, which divide asymmetrically by spindle pulling and asymmetric Myosin localization, the smaller daughter undergoes apoptosis reminiscent of GBs in <i>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></i> testes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ou et al., 2010</a>). This implies that death of daughter cells that are born too small might be utilized in the context of normal development. Our observations described in this study suggest that multiple aspects of ACDs (e.g. asymmetric segregation of fate determinants, spindle orientation, daughter cell size asymmetry) are carefully calibrated processes to achieve successful ACD unique to individual systems."

Whereas asymmetry-generating mechanisms are critical for proper spindle orientation and thus ACD of GSCs, the lack of a counteracting force by Klp10A results in excessive asymmetries, leading to frequent death of GBs. We propose that ACD is achieved by fine-tuned symmetries and asymmetries, failure of which can lead to unsuccessful cell divisions."

Recent observations have shown that centrosomes are intrinsically asymmetric and can also segregate asymmetrically. For instance, in male germline stem cells, centrosomes containing the old mother centriole remain in the stem cell whereas the daughter-centriole containing centrosome segregates into the differentiating gonialblasts. It was proposed that centrosomes contain stem cell specific factors, contributing to cell fate decisions. However, no such factors have currently been identified."

The authors claim that Klp10A is predominantly localized to mother centrosomes in interphase GSCs. Loss of function experiments further revealed that mother centrosomes elongate, specifically in GSCs. This elongation induces asymmetric spindles in mitotic GSCs, causing physical asymmetric divisions. The authors further observe an increase in cell death and propose that physical asymmetric GSC divisions produce smaller than normal differentiating cells which die more frequently."

Thus, following cell division and subsequent GB fate in the time frame of live observation (up to 20 hours) is somewhat challenging. However, out of 10 such movies, we captured one example, where GB lost nuclear integrity and apparently started dying. Now we incorporate this data as supplementary figure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."
