This functional partition depends upon the balance between proliferation and differentiation mostly accomplished in the hematopoietic organs. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells that are not released until pupariation. Yet, throughout larval development, both hemocyte types increase in numbers. Mature plasmatocytes can proliferate but it is not known if crystal cell numbers increase by self-renewal or by de novo differentiation. We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in <i>Drosophila</i> hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems."

Similarly to what happens in vertebrates, the different functions performed by insect hemocytes are, to some degree, compartmentalized into different cell types (<a href=\"#bib19\">Honti et al., 2014</a>). Some mature blood cells retain the ability to divide when in circulation, but the majority of blood cell proliferation and differentiation occurs in the hematopoietic organs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grigorian and Hartenstein, 2013</a>). These organs provide the correct cellular and molecular environment for the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, namely in the so-called stem cell niches (<a href=\"#bib23\">Koch and Radtke, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Martinez-Agosto et al., 2007</a>). Thus, the study of hematopoietic organs structure and function is essential to understand how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled."

                        "text": "In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, embryonic hematopoiesis produces two different types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells often functionally compared to vertebrate macrophages (<a href=\"#bib11\">Evans et al., 2003</a>). Crystal cells are non-phagocytic cells known to produce prophenoloxidase, an essential component of the melanization cascade (<a href=\"#bib4\">Binggeli et al., 2014</a>). Both plasmatocytes and crystal cells generated during embryogenesis persist into larval stages. Hemocytes in the larva can be found in circulation but the majority of them are attached to the cuticular epidermis as sessile cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kurucz et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). Hemocytes attached to the epidermis are not randomly dispersed but form stereotypical clusters of cells in every segment of the larva (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zettervall et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>) indicating that some signal must direct hemocytes to these locations. In fact, it has been recently shown that peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons attract hemocytes and provide unknown trophic molecules for their survival (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). The larva also possesses a hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, where plasmatocytes and crystal cells differentiate from prohemocytes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Crozatier and Meister, 2007</a>). Prohemocytes residing in the medullary zone of the lymph gland are instructed by cells from the posterior signaling center (PSC) to maintain their quiescent state or to differentiate into mature plasmatocytes or crystal cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crozatier et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mandal et al., 2007</a>). During the differentiation process, it has been suggested that cells migrate and occupy the most cortical zone of the lymph gland (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jung et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Krzemien et al., 2010b</a>). An essential aspect of the <i>Drosophila</i> larval hematopoiesis is that hemocytes produced in the lymph gland do not disperse from the organ until pupariation or upon injury such as parasitoid wasp egg infection (<a href=\"#bib17\">Holz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Honti et al., 2010</a>). Hence, in homeostatic conditions, differentiated hemocytes in the lymph gland do not contribute to the circulating and sessile hemocyte population. Nonetheless, the hemocyte population found in circulation and in sessile patches expands throughout larval development. Plasmatocytes are mitotically active cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rizki, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>) expanding during larval development by self renewal (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, all reports thus far concur in that mature crystal cells do not divide during larval stages (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krzemien et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rizki, 1957</a>), although they have been shown to proliferate during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). Further characterization of a yet unknown source and undetermined mechanism of crystal cell differentiation is required to understand how its number increases during larval development."

In the lymph gland, the role of Notch signaling in crystal cell formation is cell autonomous (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mukherjee et al., 2011</a>). Notch activation is sufficient in hemocytes to induce the expression of <i>lozenge</i>, the first known transcription factor in crystal cell development (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). One particularity of Notch signaling is that it requires cell contact since the two known <i>Drosophila</i> Notch ligands, Serrate and Delta, are membrane bound proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fi\u00faza and Arias, 2007</a>). In the lymph gland, Serrate-positive hemocytes induce neighboring cells to adopt crystal cell fates (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lebestky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mukherjee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferguson &amp; Martinez-agosto 2014</a>). Outside the lymph gland, only in sessile clusters may we observe hemocytes establishing stable cell\u2013cell contacts between them (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>). In fact, hemocytes in clusters are densely packed and linked through interdigitations (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>), particularly in the last two abdominal larval segments, the putative posterior hematopoietic tissue (PHT) (Kurucz et al., 2007)."

Firstly, in a descriptive endeavor by Kurucz et al. (2007) where an operational posterior hematopoietic tissue (PHT) consisting of the sessile hemocyte clusters in the last two abdominal segments is postulated; and later in a set of experiments showing that hemocytes taken from these clusters have the ability to differentiate into lamellocytes upon transfer to a different larva (<a href=\"#bib33\">M\u00e1rkus et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Honti et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, sessile hemocytes in clusters constitute the biggest compartment of hemocytes in the larva (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>), contained within epidermal and muscle tissue in a structure that has been called hematopoietic pockets (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, the sessile plasmatocytes in such clusters have a higher division rate than those in circulation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). However, to consider the hemocyte clusters as a <i>bona fide</i> hematopoietic tissue, evidence is needed that their structure is necessary to control cell proliferation and/or cell fate decisions."

It is possible to distinguish these two cell types with several combinations of cell markers (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>) such as the two live genetic drivers: Hemolectin\u0394-nuclearDsRed (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clark et al., 2011</a>) and Lozenge-GAL4 in combination with UAS-EGFP/mCD8GFP (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). With this combination of markers we can distinguish across the larval cuticle, Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> from Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> sessile hemocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,A\u2032</a>). Lozenge is the first marker known in the genetic cascade that leads to crystal cell differentiation and its expression is maintained as the cell matures (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). Hemolectin promoter has been used in different <i>Drosophila</i> transgenic lines to mark the majority of hemocytes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sinenko and Mathey-Prevot, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Clark et al., 2011</a>). Hence, Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are fully mature crystal cells or differentiating crystal cells while Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cells are plasmatocytes. During maturation, crystal cells loose Hml\u0394-GAL4 expression (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mukherjee et al., 2011</a>). The same is observed with Hml\u0394-nuclearDsRed but only in rare cells. This difference may be explained by the different degradation times of nuclearDsRed and cytoplasmatic GFP. In fact, it is possible to detect a higher proportion of Hml<sup>\u2212</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells with Hml\u0394-cytoplasmaticDsRed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Another characteristic that distinguishes plasmatocytes from crystal cells is that the former tend to increase in size as they mature (<a href=\"#bib43\">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</a>). Measuring hemocytes cell areas in the three different populations of cells, we can observe a clear difference in size distributions between Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup>, Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>, and Hml<sup>\u2212</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "When quantifying total hemocyte counts throughout larva development, it is undisputed that both plasmatocytes and crystal cell numbers increase (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rizki, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). Here, we focus on third instar larvae because this is the developmental window in which the majority of larval hemocytes are originated (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, at this stage we could develop reliable in vivo imaging procedures that render our analysis and interpretations more pertinent (see below). It has been suggested repeatedly that during larval stages mature crystal cells are post-mitotic (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rizki, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>) making it reasonable to assume that new crystal cells differentiate as development proceeds. This can be achieved by inducing new crystal cell precursors, proliferation of crystal cell precursors or simply by maturation of precursor cells already present in the larval body cavity. The earliest known marker predictive of crystal cell differentiation is Lozenge and it has been reported that during embryogenesis Lz<sup>+</sup> cells can proliferate (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). We checked whether Lz<sup>+</sup> cells increase in number throughout third instar larval development or if their number is fixed and crystal cells mature from these precursors. We counted the total number of sessile hemocytes in the Hml\u0394-nuclearDsRed LzGAL4&gt;GFP/mCD8GFP larvae (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We could confirm that Hml<sup>+</sup> cells increase as third instar larval development proceeds, both in males and females (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The number of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells also increases in the same time period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In females there is no difference in the number of Lz<sup>+</sup> in the last 16 hr of development. With this, late third stage larva females have less crystal cells than males which is not common in the majority of fly stocks where females tend to have a higher number of crystal cells than males (see \u2018Results\u2019 below). Nevertheless, the results clearly show that committed crystal cells (Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>) are increasing in number during third instar larval development, in parallel with an expansion of the plasmatocyte (Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup>) population."

A way to achieve this is to directly visualize hemocyte clusters with live time-lapse imaging and calculate the proliferation and differentiation rates for each cell type. To that purpose, we developed a method for imaging epidermal hemocyte clusters in live larvae for periods of 3 hr. Hml\u0394-nuclearDsRed; Lz-GAL4&gt;EGFP/mCD8GFP early L3 male larvae (&lt;12 hr after L3 ecdysis) were selected and prepared for imaging (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As expected, it was possible to see the division of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cell nuclei (Arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Throughout this 3-hr period, we estimate that \u223c7% of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cells divide (n = 13 videos with mean 50 Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> and 6 Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells per video). No case of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cell division was seen in any video. Since the number of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells per video is small, we analyzed an extra set of videos to check only for Lz<sup>+</sup> cell divisions (7 videos, 118 Lz<sup>+</sup> cells analyzed through a 3-hr period). Still, no Lz<sup>+</sup> cell division was observed. This suggests that Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> sessile cells in dorsal clusters divide at an extremely low frequency or are post mitotic cells. In contrast, we confirm that plasmatocytes (Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup>) proliferate within sessile clusters as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib20\">Honti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). Notably, it was possible to see induction of GFP in GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> cells, demonstrating that an Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cell is turning into an Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cell (Arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). During our analysis cells that start with low expression tend to increase it with time (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). When we bleed larvae and analyze Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells, we also see a tendency for larger cells to have more GFP, measured by mean grey value of the picture (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). If larger cells had the same GFP signal they would have a lower mean grey value because the signal would be diluted. In conjugation, these results indicate that <i>lozenge</i> expression starts in Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cells morphologically indistinct from plasmatocytes and increases together with cell size as crystal cell maturation progresses."

An important element to clarify is whether all Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cells have the capacity to become Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells or whether this property is exclusive of a subpopulation of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cells. In the time window of interest, hemocytes can be divided into two sub-populations, NimrodC1<sup>+</sup> and NimrodC1<sup>\u2212</sup> (Kurucz et al., 2007; <a href=\"#bib9\">Csord\u00e1s et al., 2014</a>).

Thus, in the lymph gland Lz<sup>+</sup> cells differentiate from Hml<sup>+</sup>Nimrod<sup>\u2212</sup> cells. To test if Nimrod<sup>\u2212</sup> hemocytes in sessile clusters are the precursors of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells, we checked for Nimrod protein (P1 antibody, see details in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) in Lz<sup>+</sup> sessile cells. It is worth noticing that, because crystal cells burst after bleeding (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bidla et al., 2007</a>), there is a bias in immunofluorescence stainings in favor of more immature crystal cells. Contrarily to the lymph gland, the majority of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are also Nimrod<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013A\u2033</a>).

In this case, cells that are phagocytically active become non-phagocytic and start to express lamellocyte markers (<a href=\"#bib20\">Honti et al., 2010</a>). Given this, we proceeded to test if the observed transition between Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> and Lz<sup>+</sup> corresponds to a change of fate from plasmatocyte (phagocytic) to crystal cell (non-phagocytic). From our results, it is evident that phagocytosis index is higher in Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> hemocytes but it is still non-negligible in Lz<sup>+</sup> hemocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). When we characterize cell area and GFP intensity in Lz<sup>+</sup> cells, it is possible to observe that the smaller and GFP<sup>low</sup> expressing cells are able to phagocyte bacteria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2032</a>). Large cells that have GFP<sup>high</sup> expression are virtually non-phagocytic cells. This indicates that induced Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are plasmatocytes with phagocytic activity, which is lost as they mature into crystal cells. Altogether, these results support the transdifferentiation of mature phagocytically active plasmatocytes into non-phagocytic crystal cells."

This reduction is visible in sessile hemocytes and in the lymph gland (<a href=\"#bib10\">Duvic et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lebestky et al., 2003</a>). In the lymph gland Notch signaling has a cell autonomous role on Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mukherjee et al., 2011</a>). To test for the role of the Notch pathway in the differentiation of crystal cells in the clusters, we used RNAi exclusively in hemocytes by way of the Hml\u0394GAL4 driver. Firstly, we establish that Notch downregulation reduces the number of sessile crystal cells both in females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and males (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As mentioned above, in this experiment it is possible to observe that sessile crystal cell numbers are higher in females (compare controls in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Notch is activated by two different ligands: Serrate and Delta (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fi\u00faza and Arias, 2007</a>). Only <i>Serrate</i> mutants have reduced numbers of embryonically derived crystal cell (<a href=\"#bib10\">Duvic et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lebestky et al., 2003</a>). Similarly, knocking down <i>Serrate</i> in hemocytes (Hml\u0394-GAL4&gt;UAS-<i>Serrate</i> RNAi) reduces the number of crystal cells to a similar level than found using <i>Notch</i> RNAi, as opposed to disrupting Delta function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This indicates that Serrate, the ligand necessary to induce Notch signaling in hemocytes, interestingly, it is expressed in the hemocytes themselves."

However, we did not use these lines to test for crystal cell/plasmatocyte ratio alterations because it would be difficult to discern between the effect of not having the clusters and the effect of gene up-regulation in hemocytes. We opted to disrupt the hemocyte clusters by manipulating physically the larvae (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). By rolling groups of larvae between two cover slides, it is possible to force the hemocytes to detach from the epidermis and enter hemolymph circulation. After cluster disruption, hemocytes start to aggregate again, gradually (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This phenomenon is lined with an apparent paradox: no mature crystal cell has been seen dividing during larval stages (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rizki, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lanot et al., 2001</a>; Krzemien et al., 2010) and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Holz et al., 2003</a>). Crystal cell number increase may rely upon a population of pro-crystal cells that proliferates in the larva before cell maturation or that that exists in sufficient numbers at the beginning of development to mature into crystal cells throughout development. The first known upregulated gene diagnostic of crystal cell development is the transcription factor <i>lozenge</i> (Lz) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). That is, a cell will be Lz<sup>+</sup> before it matures into crystal cell and maintains this expression upon differentiation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). We have shown that throughout third instar development, the number of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells in the sessile population increases. This observation excludes the possibility that a population of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells exists in fixed number and matures into crystal cell. Lz<sup>+</sup> cells have been reported to proliferate during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). Surprisingly, we do not see Lz<sup>+</sup> cell division in our video analysis. Although, with our results, we cannot exclude that a small proportion of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells proliferate during larval stages, we can show that <i>lozenge</i> induction in Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> is sufficient to explain the increase in Hml<sup>+</sup> Lz<sup>+</sup> cells during third instar larva."

When we ablate <i>serrate</i> expression only in hemocytes using the Hml\u0394-GAL4 driver coupled to a UAS-Ser<sup>RNAi</sup>, the number of differentiated crystal cells is severely reduced within the sessile population. This indicates that hemocytes are the cells responsible for crystal cell induction in sessile clusters. Moreover, the hemocytes inducing crystal cell development are themselves Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> because <i>Serrate</i><sup>RNAi</sup> driven by Lz-GAL4 driver does not decrease the number of crystal cells. For Notch to be activated it requires that a <i>Serrate</i> expressing cell is in contact for a certain period of time (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guruharsha et al., 2012</a>). We show that this contact is a property of the clusters where Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are induced from Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> cells. This observation establishes an important parallel between sessile and lymph gland crystal cell development. In both cases, the precursor to a crystal cell is an Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>\u2212</sup> hemocyte (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mukherjee et al., 2011</a>). However, there is a fundamental difference between these two hematopoietic events regarding the cells where <i>lozenge</i> is first expressed. Although hemocytes only activate <i>lozenge</i> expression in the cortical zone of the lymph gland (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>), the work of Krzemien et al. suggest that in the medullary zone of the lymph gland cells are already committed to become crystal cells at late second instar (Krzemien et al., 2010). This suggests that medullary zone cells migrating to the cortical zone can be considered pro-crystal cells. In line with this observation, in the lymph gland, no co-localization between plasmatocyte marker P1 and crystal cell marker Lz is ever observed (<a href=\"#bib43\">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferguson &amp; Martinez-agosto 2014</a>). In contrast, our analyses in hemocyte clusters suggest that <i>lozenge</i> induction occurs in mature plasmatocytes. Firstly, they derive from P1 cells. Secondly, Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>low</sup> cells can phagocyte as opposed to Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>high</sup> cells, which loose this capacity. Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>low</sup> cells are, according to our video analysis, the initial stages of crystal cell differentiation as virtually all Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>low</sup> become Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>high</sup>. Throughout time cells increase their GFP expression and become larger. Altogether our results suggest that mature plasmatocytes can differentiate into crystal cells."

Secondly, Lebestky et al. consider that a small fraction of the Lz-GAL4 positive cells gives rise to plasmatocytes defined by morphology and <i>croquemort</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebestky et al., 2000</a>). In light of our results, we propose that the plasmatocyte-like cells expressing <i>lozenge</i> are plasmatocytes in route to become crystal cells. To our knowledge, the hypothesis that plasmatocytes give rise to crystal cells was put forward by Rizky in 1957, with the purpose of explaining how crystal cells increase in number without proliferation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rizki, 1957</a>).

Interestingly, the hemocytes in clusters are in dynamic relation with circulating hemocytes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babcock et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Welman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). This is confirmed in our videos where cells can be observed entering circulation from the patches and leaving circulation to become sessile. This dynamics opens the possibility of a more complex number and cell type regulation mechanism operating at the whole-organism level. Secondly, another interesting property of sessile plasmatocytes consists of their higher division rate with respect to their circulating counterparts (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>). This could happen because there is a different molecular \u2018environment\u2019 in hemocyte clusters (<a href=\"#bib31\">Makhijani et al., 2011</a>) and/or because a sessile cell has an increased probability of entering cell division. We argue that the existence of these two characteristics, cell proliferation control and cell differentiation, is sufficient to consider the hemocyte clusters as hematopoietic tissues. In brief, hemocyte clusters enhance hemocyte proliferation and provide structure as to guarantee the necessary cell contacts that engage the signaling events behind cell fate decisions. Noticeably, hemocytes in clusters can be mobilized to circulation upon immune challenge (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zettervall et al., 2004</a>), a process that is in part dependent on the small GTPase <i>Rac1</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xavier and Williams, 2011</a>). The role of hemocyte clusters is most likely restricted to larval stages because, once pupariation starts, a peak of ecdysone promotes the dispersion of hemocytes throughout the epidermis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Regan et al., 2013</a>)."

Macrophages are the most plastic cells in the vertebrate's hematopoietic tissue and their specialization in vivo depends on the local microenvironment provided by the tissue they colonize (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ostuni and Natoli, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wynm et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, here we show that in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes, namely through a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate."

In support of this notion, misexpression of some genes in hemocytes can disrupt hemocyte clusters without affecting lymph gland morphology (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stofanko et al., 2008</a>). Tightly linked to this question is one other fundamental aspect that remains unaddressed: the control of proportions between different cell types. Throughout homeostatic development, it is commonly observed, both in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almeida et al., 2005</a>) and invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rizki, 1957</a>), that blood cell types respect fixed relative numbers. Also, it is now evident that plasmatocytes are very plastic cells and may represent a rare case of functionally mature cells transdifferentiating into other cell types: lamellocytes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Honti et al., 2010</a>) and crystal cells. Transdifferentiation, the process where a cell changes its cell fate without passing through a less differentiated state, is used recurrently in cell culture assays but rarely seen in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jopling et al., 2011</a>). How recurrent this mechanism may be in animal development presents itself as one important question for the future. We consider that acknowledging this novel hematopoietic organ, dynamically attached to the circulating hemocyte population and relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, brings us a step closer to addressing these outstanding fundamental questions of <i>Drosophila</i> hematopoiesis."
