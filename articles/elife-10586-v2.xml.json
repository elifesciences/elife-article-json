Consistently, centriole formation is thought to strictly rely on self-assembly, involving self-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS-6. Here, through reconstitution of de novo synthesis in human cells, we surprisingly found that normal looking centrioles capable of duplication and ciliation can arise in the absence of SAS-6 self-oligomerization. Moreover, whereas canonically duplicated centrioles always form correctly, de novo centrioles are prone to structural errors, even in the presence of SAS-6 self-oligomerization. These results indicate that centriole biogenesis does not strictly depend on SAS-6 self-assembly, and may require preexisting centrioles to ensure structural accuracy, fundamentally deviating from the current paradigm."

Consistently, centriole formation is thought to strictly rely on self-assembly, involving self-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS-6. Here, through reconstitution of de novo synthesis in human cells, we surprisingly found that normal looking centrioles capable of duplication and ciliation can arise in the absence of SAS-6 self-oligomerization. Moreover, whereas canonically duplicated centrioles always form correctly, de novo centrioles are prone to structural errors, even in the presence of SAS-6 self-oligomerization. These results indicate that centriole biogenesis does not strictly depend on SAS-6 self-assembly, and may require preexisting centrioles to ensure structural accuracy, fundamentally deviating from the current paradigm."

The experiments used human eye cells that were missing the gene that encodes SAS-6. These cells could not make centrioles, but when SAS-6 was re-introduced into these cells, new centrioles formed. Unexpectedly, re-introducing a mutant form of SAS-6 that cannot form oligomers into the cells still allowed new centrioles to form, which shows that self-oligomerization of SAS-6 is not essential for the assembly of centrioles."

In cycling cells, centrioles are maintained in fixed numbers, and formed through canonical duplication depending on pre-existing (or mother) centrioles. In the absence of pre-existing centrioles, however, de novo synthesis can occur (<a href=\"#bib14\">Khodjakov et al., 2002</a>). The number of centrioles formed through the de novo pathway is highly variable (<a href=\"#bib14\">Khodjakov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">La Terra et al., 2005</a>), providing an explanation for why canonical duplication dominates in dividing cells. In contrast to cycling cells, in post-mitotic cells such as multi-ciliated epithelia, the genes required for centriole assembly are highly up-regulated (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hoh et al., 2012</a>) to produce large, variable numbers of centrioles prior to ciliogenesis, a process thought to primarily depend on de novo assembly (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dirksen, 1991</a>). Interestingly, a recent study showed that the production of high quantities of centrioles in mouse multi-ciliated epithelia is in fact driven by the pre-existing centriole rather than through de novo assembly (<a href=\"#bib2\">Al Jord et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that the presence of pre-existing centrioles may have additional roles other than the number control for centriole biogenesis."

SAS-6 exists as dimers, which can self-oligomerize in vitro via an N-terminal head domain, forming a ring resembling the central hub, and C-terminal tails pointing outwards as spokes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">van Breugel et al., 2014</a>), albeit not always ninefold symmetric in vitro<i></i>(<a href=\"#bib6\">Cottee et al., 2011</a>).

During S phase, SAS-6 molecules are first recruited to the proximal lumen of the mother centriole prior to centriole duplication, adopting a cartwheel-like organization through interactions with the luminal wall, rather than via their self-oligomerization activity. This leads to a proposal that mother centrioles may function as the template to shape SAS-6 assembly, thereby preserving the geometric shape of the centriole that otherwise cannot be ensured by SAS-6 self-assembly alone. Notably, the template-based model appears incompatible with de novo centriole synthesis in which no pre-existing centrioles are required. However, as the nature of de novo synthesis, for example, whether it is indeed based on SAS-6 self-assembly, has not been determined, it is premature to accept or reject any of these ideas."

Pure acentriolar cell lines were established through clonal propagation from single cells, a process taking 4\u20135 weeks, before these cells were used for experiments. In two independent <i>SAS-6<sup>-/-</sup>; p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell lines we generated (clone #1 and #2), frameshift mutations present in the beginning of the coding region were found in each SAS-6 allele (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), predicting to produce severely truncated products consisting of 19 or 23 amino acids in clone #1 or #2, respectively. Consistently, Western blot analyses using antibodies against either the N- or C-terminal region of SAS-6 failed to detect any SAS-6 signal in these cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Similar frameshift mutations were also seen in TP53 alleles (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), leading to loss of p53 function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Izquierdo et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, both SAS-6 knockout cell lines completely lack centrioles or centrosomes as expected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> for clone #1; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> for clone #2), but can continue to proliferate in the absence of p53 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> for clone #1; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> for clone #2) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Izquierdo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lambrus et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wong et al., 2015</a>), although their M phase is significantly lengthened (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Intriguingly, when exogenous wild-type, full length SAS-6 (SAS-6<sup>FL</sup>) was inducibly expressed in SAS-6<sup>-/-</sup> cells (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details), either in clone #1 or #2, variable numbers of centrosomes formed robustly in the absence of pre-existing centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G</a> for clone #1; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a> for clone #2), a result consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lambrus et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wong et al., 2015</a>). As clone #1 and clone #2 cell lines behave similarly, we used clone #1 to establish a stable, cell-based system in which the role of SAS-6 in de novo centrosome synthesis can be analyzed (see below)."

Isogenic, acentriolar <i>SAS-6<sup>-/-</sup>; p53<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>cell lines stably carrying specific SAS-6 expression constructs were isolated in the absence of doxycycline (see Methods). Upon induction by doxycycline treatments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), the ability of each SAS-6 mutant in driving de novo centrosome formation was examined (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Note that similar results were also seen in reconstitution experiments done in non-isogenic condition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All SAS-6 fragments lacking the C-terminal domain (DM1, DM3, and DM5) failed to induce any centrosome formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G</a>), although expressed at similar or higher levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The C-terminal tail alone (DM6) was also insufficient. However, when the full-length coiled-coil domain (DM2) or a small portion of it (DM4) was present together with the C-terminal tail, it effectively drove de novo centrosome formation in all cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G</a>;\u00a0100). Consistently, SAS-6 harboring the F131E mutation (F131E) that has been previously shown to disrupt the oligomerization property of SAS-6 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>) also efficiently drove de novo centrosome formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G,</a>100%), with an expression level slightly higher than the endogenous level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). A recent report showed that the fly SAS6 mutant equivalent to human SAS-6<sup>F131E</sup> could support the formation of some centriole-like structures in vivo (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cottee et al., 2015</a>). Our result thus suggests that in contrary to the SAS-6 self-assembly model, the main activity of SAS-6 in promoting centriole assembly is possessed by its C-terminal portion, rather than the N-terminal domain mediating SAS-6 self-oligomerization."

This result, however, appears inconsistent with previous reports, where neither F131E nor DM4 could fully support centriole duplication (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>), although both were able to initiate SAS-6/cartwheel assembly in the presence of pre-existing centrioles (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fong et al., 2014</a>). We do not understand the reason behind this discrepancy, but the result that F131E or DM4 can support the duplication of F131E- or DM4-derived centrioles, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>), but not pre-existing, wild-type SAS-6-derived centrioles (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>) raises an idea that perhaps pre-existing centrioles have an active, dominant role in guiding canonical duplication."

To determine the structural integrity of de novo centrioles, serial sectioning transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze SAS-6<sup>-/-</sup> cells inducibly expressing FL, F131E or DM4. To our surprise, normal looking centrioles, which are characterized as 200 nm x 500 nm in size, made of nine microtubule triplets, and equipped with distal and sub-distal appendages, could be easily found in cells expressing either F131E or DM4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). In particular, EM tomography reconstruction of a centriole from DM4 expressing cells revealed a perfect ninefold symmetric shape (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Moreover, EM analyses also confirmed that at least some DM4-derived centrioles could ciliate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and duplicate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), firmly demonstrating that neither structural assembly nor shape determination of centrioles strictly depends on the self-oligomerization activity of SAS-6.

We thus asked if the defect-free rate of de novo centriole production is comparable to that of canonical duplication. EM analyses revealed that canonically duplicated centrioles are essentially free of error in their size, structural integrity, and geometric shape (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, 100%,\u00a0n = 70). In striking contrast, we consistently observed a small but significant portion of de novo centrioles that are abnormal, including centrioles missing variable numbers of MT triplets, or varying in size or shape (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Importantly, similar types of abnormalities were seen regardless of whether centrioles were derived from SAS-6<sup>FL</sup>, SAS-6<sup>F131E</sup>, or SAS-6<sup>DM4</sup>. Nevertheless, these abnormally looking centrioles appeared to have normal activities, suggesting that they are not simply unstable structures in the process of non-specific disintegration. For example, we observed SAS-6<sup>FL</sup>-derived centrioles that had only six MT triplets, but able to duplicate, producing daughter centrioles also made of an incomplete set of MT triplets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-#1</a>). SAS-6<sup>FL</sup>-derived centrioles that appeared larger than normal centrioles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-#2</a>), but able to mature and acquire appendages were also found.

Consequently, the width (outer diameter) of SAS-6<sup>FL</sup>-derived centrioles is more variable than that of canonically duplicated centrioles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). De novo centrioles made of disorganized, or abnormal numbers of, MT triplets have also been seen to form in cells depleted of the endogenous centrioles by laser ablation (<a href=\"#bib17\">La Terra et al., 2005</a>)."

Using this system, we found that self-oligomerization of SAS-6, an activity proposed to drive cartwheel/centriole formation, is in fact not essential for the structural assembly or shape determination of centrioles. Instead, de novo centriole formation can be sufficiently driven by the C-terminal half of SAS-6 lacking the self-oligomerization activity, fundamentally deviating from the current paradigm for centriole biogenesis. Moreover, our results show that in human cells, de novo centriole assembly is an error-prone process that generates abnormal centrioles in a significantly higher frequency comparing to canonical duplication. The error rate of de novo assembly, which was estimated from later stages of centrioles, could potentially be underestimated, as it is plausible that the de novo centrioles formed initially are actually much more error-prone, and that over time ninefold symmetric centrioles persist because they are more stable or more efficient to duplicate. In any case, our results suggest that if de novo assembly must be used for centriole production, the structural accuracy may need to be insured or reinforced by other mechanisms."

However, as de novo centriole assembly is normally blocked under physiological conditions (for number control), it is unclear what the \u2018right\u2019 level of SAS-6 should be, or if the level really matters that much, when the number control is not a relevant issue for de novo assembly. Consistently, it has been reported that de novo centrioles made of disorganized, or abnormal numbers of MT blades are formed with the endogenous level of SAS-6 (<a href=\"#bib17\">La Terra et al., 2005</a>). Conversely, during multiciliogenesis where SAS-6 level is highly up-regulated (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hoh et al., 2012</a>), almost every new centriole forms correctly. These results suggest that when cells carry pre-existing centrioles, they could perhaps tolerate a wider range of SAS-6 level for proper structural assembly of centrioles. Numerical control of centriole biogenesis, however, is a different issue, as it is highly sensitive to the sas-6 level (<a href=\"#bib22\">Strnad et al., 2007</a>), even in the presence of pre-existing centrioles."

Large quantities of centrioles naturally arising from the acentriolar pathway has been reported in planarians (<a href=\"#bib4\">Azimzadeh et al., 2012</a>), but whether the same process occurs in vertebrates under normal physiological conditions is unclear. It will be very interesting to see if planarians carefully specify the structural integrity of de novo centrioles, and if so, how the accuracy is achieved in the absence of pre-existing centrioles. In vertebrate somatic cycling cells, the birth of a new centriole is normally given by the pre-existing centriole (canonical duplication), a process known to regulate the number at which newborn centrioles can form. It has led to a belief that de novo assembly would take over the canonical duplication, when large, variable numbers of centrioles are needed, such as in the post-mitotic, multi-ciliated epithelium. Strikingly, a recent report showed that in multi-ciliated epithelia, de novo assembly is not responsible for the production of hundreds of centrioles (<a href=\"#bib2\">Al Jord et al., 2014</a>); instead, all new centrioles that later form cilia are initiated, directly or indirectly, from the pre-existing centriole, supporting the idea that the presence of pre-existing centrioles has additional roles other than the number control for centriole reproduction. Our results that canonically duplicated centrioles are predominantly free of error, while de novo centriole assembly is error-prone, suggest that perhaps pre-existing centrioles can specify some steps of the assembly process that define the structural integrity of the centriole (e.g. cartwheel assembly), an idea consistent with the template-based model of centriole formation proposed recently (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fong et al., 2014</a>)."

The targeting sequence for TP53 and SAS-6 is 5\u2019-GGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GTGAAATGCAAAGACTGTG-3\u2019, respectively, which were cloned into the gRNA cloning vector (Addgene plasmid #41824) via the Gibson assembly method (New England Biolabs,\u00a0Ipswich, MA) as described previously (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mali et al., 2013</a>). To obtain stable acentriolar cells lacking SAS-6, the TP53 gene in RPE1 cells was targeted by the CRISPR method prior to inactivation of SAS-6. Six days after SAS-6 inactivation, we observed that about 10\u201315% of cells were devoid of centrioles or centrosomes. Pure acentriolar cell lines were subsequently established through clonal propagation from single cells, a process taking additional 4\u20135 weeks (before these cells were used for experiments), generating a number of independent <i>SAS-6<sup>-/-</sup>; p53<sup>-/-</sup> </i>cell lines all behaving similarly (with clone #1 and #2 being characterized here). <i>SAS-6<sup>-/-</sup>; p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells actively proliferate or divide, but take longer periods of time to go through mitosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). For genotyping, the following PCR primers were used: 5\u2019-ATCGGAATTCGGCCAAGTCTCTTACGCCTT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- CTAGTCTAGAATGTGAGCCGGCTTCCTAAC-3\u2019 for SASS6 alleles, and 5\u2019- ACGCGGATCCACCCATCTACAGTCCCCCTTG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-CTAGTCTAGAGCATCCCCAGGAGAGATGCT-3\u2019 for TP53 alleles. PCR products were cloned and sequenced."

To examine the function of de novo centrioles to form centrosomes, to duplicate, or ciliate, infected cells were incubated with doxycycline for 3 days, followed by serum starvation if ciliogenesis was to be examined. Isogenic, acentriolar cell lines stably carrying specific SAS-6 expression constructs (SAS-6-expression-ready cells) were isolated and propagated from single cells in the absence of doxycycline, which allow us to directly induce de novo centriole/centrosome formation with doxycycline addition. Our reconstitution of de novo centriole/centrosome formation was successfully done in acentriolar cells infected with viruses and then treated with doxycycline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>), or in isogenic, SAS-6-expression-ready cells treated with doxycycline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1G,2</a>)."

In cycling cells, centrioles duplicate exactly once in each cell cycle, through the formation of a single new daughter centriole on the wall of each existing mother centriole. The first morphological event in the assembly process is the emergence of a cartwheel structure adjacent to the wall of the mother centriole. SAS-6 proteins are a key structural component of the cartwheel. SAS-6 forms a parallel homodimer that associates laterally through a globular N-terminal domain. Models have shown that the association of the SAS-6 N-terminal domain can generate a ring of nine homodimers and this has been proposed to explain the ninefold symmetrical architecture of the cartwheel."

The authors produce a p53/SAS6 knockout cell line that lacks centrioles, and subsequently introduce wild type or mutant SAS6 constructs to test which domains of SAS6 are required for de novo centriole assembly. Surprisingly, the authors find that mutants of SAS6 that are unable to undergo self-oligomerization are sufficient for assembling functional centrioles. Interestingly, centrioles that form de novo even in the presence of wild type SAS6 are frequently found to have structural defects. Most surprisingly, de novo centrioles assembled with SAS6 fragments that are unable to self-associate were capable of undergoing canonical duplication. Since the same SAS6 fragments are not capable of supporting the duplication of existing centrioles, the authors suggest that existing centrioles may play a role in shaping the structural integrity of procentrioles."

In the text, for example, the authors state that \"all these de novo centrioles\" could mature properly by acquiring distal appendages, and support ciliogenesis upon G1 arrest.

This is particularly important because it seems plausible that during the early stages of de novo assembly the process is actually very error-prone and that over time 9-fold symmetric centrioles persist because they are more stable (and perhaps cells with 9-fold symmetric centrioles are more viable).

It would be very informative to know whether this happens for the constructs tested here.

Moreover, they should mention the recent observation that a form of fly SAS6 carrying the equivalent to the F131E mutation could also support the formation of some centriole-like structures in vivo (although these were not examined at the EM level \u2013 Cottee et al., 2015)."

Purified proteins may be self-assembly deficient in vitro, but be assisted by other proteins (restoring some oligomerization) in vivo. The templating model is attractive, but it does not readily explain the importance of the C-terminal end domains revealed in the de novo assembly system used here, where there is no mother centriole lumen with which to interact. The authors should adopt a more conciliatory tone with regard to the two previously proposed models. Once again, these are not mutually exclusive, and the present data, although very interesting and worthy of publication, do not allow us to identify a \"winner.\""

This is particularly important because it seems plausible that during the early stages of de novo assembly the process is actually very error-prone and that over time 9-fold symmetric centrioles persist because they are more stable (and perhaps cells with 9-fold symmetric centrioles are more viable). The authors should at least consider this possibility, especially in light of the Lambrus et al. (2015) paper, which would support this idea.</i>"

From the single blot shown, it seems that the proteins are expressed at close to normal levels, but this should be quantified, and some estimate of the experimental variability should be given. This should also be assessed for all the experimental conditions tested (e.g. the authors don't assess SAS6 protein levels in the experiments where the cells are extensively arrested in S-phase or G1).

The western blot was done with SAS-6<sup>-/-</sup> cells inducibly expressing various SAS-6 mutants for 3 days, during which cells were allowed to proliferate. This is the condition and time point where we analyzed centrioles with EM. The expression levels of FL and F131E are similar to each other, but both slightly higher than the endogenous SAS-6 seen in normal RPE1 cells. The potential caveat of SAS-6 over-expression has been included in the Discussion. However, as de novo centriole assembly is normally blocked under physiological conditions (for number control), we really do not known what the \u201cright\u201d level of SAS-6 should be for this pathway, and not sure whether the level matters that much, especially when the number control is not a relevant issue for de novo assembly. Consistently, it has been reported that de novo centrioles made of abnormal numbers of MT blades are formed with endogenous levels of SAS-6 (La Terra et al., 2005). Moreover, during multiciliogenesis where the SAS-6 level is highly up-regulated, almost every new centriole still forms correctly, suggesting that when cells carry preexisting centrioles, they could perhaps tolerate a wider range of SAS-6 level for proper structural assembly of centrioles. Numerical control of centriole biogenesis, however, is a different story, as it is highly sensitive to the sas-6 level (Strnad et al., 2007), even in the presence of preexisting centrioles. This is also included in the Discussion."

Unlike cycling cells, unfertilized eggs naturally do not support centriole assembly, and are unique in many other ways; we are reluctant to compare these two systems as it is not the subject of this study, but we clearly show that normal looking centrioles capable of duplication and ciliation can form in our reconstitution assay."

It would be very informative to know whether this happens for the constructs tested here. If the WT constructs can support the return to canonical duplication, while the F131E and DM4 constructs cannot, this would suggest that the mutant constructs can support some level of error-prone de novo assembly, but cannot support canonical duplication.

Similar results were also seen by EM. We do notice that centriole numbers drop significantly after a long-term culture, but we are not sure whether this is due to an efficiency issue (i.e. less centrioles are easier to maintain), or alternatively, due to a fitness issue (i.e. a selection against the survival of cells carrying higher numbers of centrioles). This question is very interesting but complicated, requires additional careful investigations, and thus should be answered in a different paper. Our goal is to address whether FL, F131E or DM4 derived centrioles can duplicate, and the answer is clearly yes for at least a significant fraction of centrioles at day 3 (based on IF and EM)."

Moreover, they should mention the recent observation that a form of fly SAS6 carrying the equivalent to the F131E mutation could also support the formation of some centriole-like structures in vivo (although these were not examined at the EM level \u2013 Cottee et al., 2015).</i>"

The templating model is attractive, but it does not readily explain the importance of the C-terminal end domains revealed in the de novo assembly system used here, where there is no mother centriole lumen with which to interact. The authors should adopt a more conciliatory tone with regard to the two previously proposed models. Once again, these are not mutually exclusive, and the present data, although very interesting and worthy of publication, do not allow us to identify a \"winner.\"</i>"
