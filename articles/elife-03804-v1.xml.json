Alternative sources of synchronisation control\u2014including mechanical, chemical, or electrical signals\u2014have been suggested, but the roles of each are still unknown. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Raymond Goldstein and colleagues at the University of Cambridge\u2014including Douglas Brumley as first author\u2014report an elegant experiment that elucidates a physical mechanism that keeps cilia and flagella beating in time with each other (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brumley et al., 2014</a>)."

The relationship between force and frequency has also been measured in green algal cells that were free to swim around normally (<a href=\"#bib3\">Geyer et al., 2013</a>). Measuring how flagella respond to loads can provide insight on how the thousands of dynein motors inside the flagellum\u2014each sensitive to external forces\u2014work together to shape the beat."

Each cell was attached onto a separate micropipette. This prevented the cells from communicating with each other in any way other than through the fluid flows created by the beating flagella. It also allowed the researchers to experimentally vary the relative distance and orientation of both flagella. Provided this distance was small, the two beating flagella settled into a common rhythm. When the distance between the cells was increased, the synchronisation became imperfect\u2014for example, one flagellum would sometimes add an extra beat\u2014and eventually synchronisation broke down completely."

As each flagellum beats, it disturbs the liquid around it, generating a periodically varying fluid flow that exerts friction forces on other nearby flagella. This mechanically couples the flagella to each other. If this hydrodynamic coupling is strong enough to overcome both noise and the mismatch in the natural beating frequencies, then the flagella synchronise in a purely self-organised fashion."

The hydrodynamic phenomena experienced by beating flagella inside water are rather different to those experienced by a human swimming through water: indeed, they are akin to what a human would experience if they tried to swim through honey (<a href=\"#bib9\">Purcell, 1977</a>). Theory predicts that the strength of the flow field around a beating flagellum is inversely proportional to the distance from the flagellum (<a href=\"#bib6\">Lauga and Powers, 2009</a>). This is exactly what Brumley et al. measured, both when looking at an isolated flagellum, and also when examining how two flagella synchronise. Hence, the further apart two flagella are, the less force they apply on each other, eventually leading to a breakdown of synchrony. (Note, for freely moving cells, like swimming sperm cells, the flow field is instead inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the flagella, which can make quite a difference when trying to achieve synchronisation.)"

For example, the noise level is such that an isolated flagellum \u2018forgets\u2019 its initial phase after 30 beat cycles. This is consistent with recent direct measurements by ourselves and co-workers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ma et al., 2014</a>) and shows that fluctuations in the rate at which dynein motors work are perceivable at the scale of the flagellar beat."

For example, how does the flagellum work internally? Brumley et al. show a force of 25 pN is produced in a stroke that is 10 \u00b5m long; therefore the hydrodynamic work done by a single flagellum can be estimated to be 25 pN*10 \u00b5m = 2.5*10<sup>\u221216</sup> J per beat cycle. Interestingly, this value is of the same order of magnitude as the consumption of chemical energy by the 10,000 dynein motor heads inside the flagellum if each motor takes one step, burning one ATP molecule (each worth 10<sup>\u221219</sup> J)."

Each cell effectively has a single flagellum on its surface, and the flagella on different cells are able to beat in synchrony. Middle: pairs of cilia or flagella exert hydrodynamic forces on each other as they beat. Brumley et al. isolated two such flagella and varied the distance between them, L, to study the role of hydrodynamics in synchronisation. This revealed that the strength of the flow field, and hence the strength of synchronisation, is inversely proportional to L. Right: inside each flagellum, motor proteins called dyneins (dark blue) slide adjacent microtubules to drive the regular beat of the flagellum. The sensitivity of these motors to external forces may help cilia and flagella to synchronise."

Brumley et al. observe that synchrony breaks down at a distance of 10 \u00b5m, which is approximately the spacing between flagella on the surface of <i>Volvox</i>. Hence the coupling appears to be of the right strength to facilitate just nearest neighbour coupling. This is biologically advantageous because it is strong enough to enable synchrony, but not so strong as to generate large-scale phase locking. This, in turn, makes it possible for cilia and flagella to display more complex large-scale synchronisation phenomena, such as the metachronal waves that are essential for Volvox to propel itself along, or for ciliated airway epithelia to pump mucus away efficiently (<a href=\"#bib2\">Fliegauf et al., 2007</a>)."
