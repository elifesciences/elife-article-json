Neuroendocrine regulation of diverse behaviors of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is under the control of the DAF-7/TGF-\u03b2 ligand that is secreted from sensory neurons.

Molecular genetic analysis of the switch-like regulation of <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neuron pair reveals a hierarchy of regulation among multiple inputs\u2014sex, age, nutritional status, and microbial environment\u2014which function in the modulation of behavior. Our results suggest that regulation of gene expression in sensory neurons can function in the integration of a wide array of sensory information and facilitate decision-making behaviors in <i>C. elegans</i>."

It has been hypothesized that decision making in animals is controlled primarily at the level of command interneurons or decision centers in the central nervous system, which receive input from an array of sensory neurons and integrate the information conveyed to inform behavioral decisions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kristan, 2008</a>). However, recent work in a number of animal species has demonstrated that modulation of gene expression and neuronal activity by both environmental cues and internal state can occur at the level of sensory neurons, suggesting that aspects of behavioral decision making may also occur in the peripheral nervous system (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Farhadian et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ryan et al., 2014</a>)."

Feeding status and satiety levels have long been known to have dramatic effects on the behaviors and decisions of species across the animal kingdom (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pool and Scott, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sengupta, 2013</a>). In many cases, the nutritional state of the animal will serve as a source of regulation directly on feeding and other food-related behaviors. For instance, in the medicinal leech, periods of food deprivation can lead to a\u00a0heightened response to appetitive stimuli in its environment, a response that has been shown to be carried out via a correlation between serotonin production and time of last meal (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaudry and Kristan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Groome et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lent et al., 1991</a>). Starvation or nutritional deprivation can also have less direct effects on feeding behaviors as in <i>Drosophila</i>, where periods of starvation have been demonstrated to both enhance odor sensitivity and attraction as well as abrogate avoidance responses to normally aversive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib6\">Br\u00e4cker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ko et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Root et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, the biological sex of an animal is a potent modifier of decision-making. Not only does the sex of the animal lead to differences in mating behaviors and pheromone attraction, but studies in several systems have suggested that biological sex can also alter olfactory and gustatory preferences, perhaps to guide decision-making in the context of mating and reproduction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kimchi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kurtovic et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lebreton et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee and Portman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Meunier et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakagawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ryan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Stowers and Logan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stowers et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Vargas et al., 2010</a>)."

Hermaphrodites produce a limited amount of sperm during larval development making them capable of self-fertilization in addition to cross-fertilization. In contrast, males are only cross-fertile and must find mating partners for reproduction. As such, the male displays a large behavioral repertoire primarily aimed at facilitating mate finding and successful mating encounters. These behaviors include complex mating rituals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</a>), differential sensitivity to hermaphrodite pheromone (<a href=\"#bib50\">Srinivasan et al., 2008</a>), and a mate-searching behavior in adult male animals that is driven by the prioritization of mating over feeding (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>). Mate-searching behavior of <i>C. elegans</i> has thus emerged as an interesting case study of decision making in a simple animal, which is subject to regulation by multiple features of internal state\u2014sex, age, and nutritional status\u2014as well as by external sensory experiences such as the presence of food or hermaphrodites in the environment (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrios et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ryan et al., 2014</a>)."

The expression pattern of <i>daf-7</i> was originally identified as being restricted to a single bilaterally symmetric pair of neurons in the head of the worm, the ASI chemosensory neurons, but it is also expressed in the ADE and OLQ neurons under normal laboratory growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Meisel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ren et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schackwitz et al., 1996</a>). We recently defined an altered expression pattern for <i>daf-7</i> in hermaphrodites in response to exposure to bacterial metabolites produced by the pathogenic bacteria <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Meisel et al., 2014</a>).\u00a0Within minutes of being exposed to <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, <i>daf-7</i> expression is induced in an additional pair of chemosensory neurons, the ASJ neurons, which in turn promotes behavioral avoidance of the pathogenic bacterial lawn (<a href=\"#bib29\">Meisel et al., 2014</a>). Here, we show that in male <i>C. elegans</i>, <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neuron pair is not only induced in response to environmental cues such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, but can be switched \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 depending on multiple internal states such as sex, age, and experience. The differential effects of internal states and environmental experience on the DAF-7 transcriptional switch in the two ASJ sensory neurons reveal a hierarchy among different inputs that can function to modulate behavior."

This predicts that a number of additional unidentified changes may occur in the anatomy, connectivity and gene expression profiles of the male nervous system as the animal transitions from larva to adult. Given this, we asked if <i>daf-7</i> expression in males was correlated with the developmental stage of the animal. We observed that in populations of early larval animals carrying the <i>pdaf-7::gfp</i> transcriptional reporter, males and hermaphrodites were indistinguishable, with fluorescence observed only in the ASI neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). To determine the onset of <i>daf-7</i> expression in males, we imaged animals carrying the fluorescent reporter at multiple time points during development beginning in the L4 larval stage and extending into reproductive maturity. We found that <i>daf-7</i> expression remains off in the ASJ of males through the end of the last (L4) larval stage, but is switched on during young adulthood as the animals reach reproductive maturity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In addition, we examined expression of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASI neuron pair at several matched timepoints during development and observed a significant drop in the expression of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASI neurons from L4 to young adulthood (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1E\u00a0and F</a>, 52\u00a0hr and 64.5\u00a0hr timepoints). At subsequent timepoints during adulthood, however, expression levels in the ASI neurons remained constant as expression in the ASJ neurons increased (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1E</a>,3F 64.5\u00a0hr and 71.5\u00a0hr timepoints)."

TRA-1 activity functions to promote hermaphrodite cell fates and inhibit male development. We first looked at <i>tra-1(e1099)</i> mutants which are karyotypically XX, but develop as fertile pseudomales due to the lack of active TRA-1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hodgkin and Brenner, 1977</a>). In these mutant XX males, <i>daf-7</i> expression could be seen in both the ASI and ASJ neurons, suggesting that <i>daf-7</i> is regulated by the genetic sex determination pathway either directly or indirectly (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

TRA-1 is negatively regulated by the FEM proteins\u2014FEM-1, FEM-2, and FEM-3\u2014and it has been demonstrated by many groups that overexpression of FEM-3 cDNA is sufficient to lead to \u2018masculinization\u2019 in otherwise hermaphrodite animals (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mehra et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pereira et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sammut et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">White et al., 2007</a>). We expressed the FEM-3 cDNA under the control of the pan-neural promoter, <i>rab-3,</i> and found that <i>daf-7</i> expression was up-regulated in the ASJ neurons of adult hermaphrodites, suggesting that a genetically \u2018male\u2019 nervous system is sufficient for <i>daf-7</i> expression in ASJ (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, C and E</a>). Although we observed an increase in <i>daf-7</i> expression in these genetically masculinized animals, the overall expression of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASJ of masculinized hermaphrodites was still notably lower than what we observe in wild-type males (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This could possibly be explained by the lack of male-specific neurons in these transgenic animals. While genetic masculinization is effective in sexualizing neurons of the sex-shared nervous system, this technique fails to reliably retain the male-specific CEM neurons and produces hermaphrodites which also lack other male-specific neurons found in the tail (<a href=\"#bib55\">White et al., 2007</a>). To assess the importance of these male-specific neurons for <i>daf-7</i> expression in ASJ, we examined <i>pdaf-7::gfp</i> fluorescence in <i>ceh-30(n4289)</i>, <i>mab-3(e1240),</i> and <i>pkd-2(sy606);lov-1(sy582)</i> mutant males. While <i>ceh-30(n4289)</i> males lack the male-specific CEM neurons in the head (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schwartz and Horvitz, 2007</a>), <i>mab-3(e1240)</i> mutants display marked defects in male-tail formation including ray differentiation as well as in male specific circuitry in the head of the animal (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yi et al., 2000</a>). Similarly, PKD-2 and LOV-1 constitute a TRP channel necessary for the function of the B-type ray neurons\u2014another set of male-specific neurons in the tail of the animal (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barr et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Barr and Sternberg, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barrios et al., 2008</a>). Males of all mutant strains retained wild-type expression levels of <i>daf-7</i> in ASJ, suggesting that the male-specific neural circuitry is not required for <i>daf-7</i> expression and is unlikely to underlie the lower <i>daf-7</i> expression we see in genetically masculinized hermaphrodites (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Mate-searching behavior is a behavioral program specific to adult male <i>C. elegans,</i> which features the prioritization of mating over feeding in these animals. While hermaphrodite animals prefer to remain in a patch of bacterial food indefinitely and exhibit limited exploratory behavior, males will wander away from a food source at a predictable and constant rate (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>). This can be examined in an assay in which the movement of the animal is tracked over time to determine the leaving probability of any given genotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>). We observed that mutants in both the DAF-7/TGF-\u03b2 ligand and its Type I receptor, DAF-1, showed defects in the mate-searching assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This behavioral defect in the <i>daf-7</i> mutant can be fully suppressed by mutation of the downstream antagonistic co-SMAD, DAF-3, suggesting that DAF-7 functions through its canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway to regulate mate-searching behavior (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Given the change in expression of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASJ neurons of males at the transition to adulthood when this behavior is first displayed, we used genetic ablations of the ASJ neuron pair to ask what their contribution to this behavior might be. We observed that the ASJ-ablated animals were defective in mate-searching behavior, establishing a role for the ASJ neuron pair in promoting this behavior (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Importantly, the defects that we see in <i>daf-7</i> mutant and ASJ-ablated male behavior are not accounted for by global defects in locomotion. When mutant animals are tested on leaving assay plates on which the bacterial food has been fully spread, these males reach the scoring distance at equivalent rates to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barrios et al., 2012</a>).

We first looked at <i>daf-7</i> expression in animals that had experienced starvation during the L4-to-adulthood period before being returned to an <i>E. coli</i> food source as adults. In these animals, <i>daf-7</i> expression could be detected both by the GFP reporter as well as by FISH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, condition iii, and 4B). We asked whether fully mature adult animals would turn off <i>daf-7</i> expression in response to starvation after having already induced expression of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASJ neuron pair. For these experiments, we utilized FISH of the endogenous <i>daf-7</i> mRNA because perdurance of the GFP reporter might complicate analysis. When males were allowed to develop into adulthood unperturbed and then subjected to a period of food deprivation, we observed a complete loss of <i>daf-7</i> mRNA in the ASJ neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, condition iv).

First, <i>daf-7</i> transcription could be regulated by the internal nutritional state of the animal (starved or fed). Alternatively, <i>daf-7</i> transcription could be activated by the chemosensation (smell or taste) of bacterial food. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured the kinetics of <i>daf-7</i> expression in response to re-feeding in starved animals. We observed that <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neuron pair is not significantly increased compared to starved controls until 9 hr after the re-introduction of an <i>E. coli</i> food source (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Although some animals could be observed expressing <i>daf-7</i> weakly in the ASJ neuron pair at 4 hr of re-feeding, the majority of animals still exhibited no <i>pdaf-7::gfp</i> expression in the ASJ neuron pair until later time points. The extended period of time required to restore <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neuron pair suggests that internal nutritional state, not the chemosensation of bacterial food, exerts control over <i>daf-7</i> transcription in the ASJ neuron pair. Moreover, we observed that the onset of <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neurons of males following the re-introduction of food are consistent with the previously noted kinetics of resumption of mate-searching behavior after males have been starved (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>)."

Looking at animals carrying the <i>pdaf-7::gfp</i> reporter during post-starvation re-feeding, we observed a rapid up-regulation of <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neurons of starved males returned to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> as a food source (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This increase in <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neuron pair could be seen as early as 2 hr after first exposure to the pathogenic bacteria (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In contrast, starved males that were returned to the non-pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> showed little to no <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neurons until much later time points (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 5A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">4B</a>). The kinetics of the increase in fluorescence of the <i>pdaf-7::gfp</i> reporter in response to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> secondary metabolites, which lags behind the immediate response observed by FISH is consistent with what we observed previously for hermaphrodite animals (<a href=\"#bib29\">Meisel et al., 2014</a>), and notably faster than the slower increase in <i>pdaf-7::gfp</i> reporter fluorescence in response to repletion of the non-pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> bacterial food."

Normally, following a period of starvation, a male prefers feeding over leaving a lawn of bacteria in search of a mate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>), but we reasoned that these priorities might be re-set if the only available food is pathogenic to the starved animal. Indeed, whereas starved males will remain on the <i>E. coli</i> lawn for several hours, starved males who are instead returned to a lawn of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> will readily leave the bacterial lawn at a rate similar to non-starved animals on the normal <i>E. coli</i> food source (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5C</a>). This lawn-leaving behavior is not male-specific, as both fed and starved hermaphrodites will also readily leave a lawn of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and starved hermaphrodites are also capable of responding to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> through an upregulation of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASJ neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u20131D</a>). In this regard, one might consider that lawn-leaving under these conditions is driven by the presence of pathogenic <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and not mate-searching. Our data suggest that <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neurons is one way through which animals are both able to interpret internal and external cues and prioritize their behaviors accordingly."

Our data suggest that <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ neuron pair is utilized to promote exploratory behaviors in different physiological and ecological contexts. In hermaphrodites, expression of <i>daf-7</i> is induced by the detection of secondary metabolites and functions to allow animals to discriminate between microbial species and promote avoidance of pathogenic bacteria (<a href=\"#bib29\">Meisel et al., 2014</a>). In essence, pathogen avoidance represents the behavioral choice an animal makes when confronted with two competing needs\u2014the need to eat and remain well fed and the need to avoid danger and infection. Mate searching presents a paralagous but sex-specific behavior, where the decision instead is between food and mating. Our data suggest that modulation of <i>daf-7</i> expression provides a striking example of how a neuroendocrine signaling pathway may be coopted to guide behavioral decisions in entirely different contexts."

The work presented here suggests that the transcriptional regulation of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASJ neurons functions as an ON/OFF switch, where each input holds the switch\u2014and thus, <i>daf-7</i> expression\u2014in one of two states. However, the various regulatory inputs into this switch exert differential control, with environmental cues being prioritized over all others. This differential control of the transcriptional switch, in turn allows for re-adjustments of behavioral priorities in the worm based on its current and past experience."

Given the similarities in the regulation of these two genes by both sex and satiety, it is possible that DAF-7 and ODR-10 function in a single pathway to regulate decision-making behaviors in the male. Previous studies of <i>daf-7</i> have suggested that it is involved in regulating the expression of numerous chemoreceptors in many different neuron types (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nolan et al., 2002</a>). While no interaction has been identified between <i>daf-7</i> and <i>odr-10</i> in the hermaphrodite nervous system, there has been no examination as yet of the effects of <i>daf-7</i> mutation on <i>odr-10</i> in the relevant cell types, sex, or under different food conditions, which may be an interesting line of future research."

Similarly, DAF-7 signaling has also been implicated in promoting food-leaving (or foraging) in the context of a rapidly depleting food source, further underscoring the importance of this pathway for communicating nutritional availability (<a href=\"#bib31\">Milward et al., 2011</a>). While DAF-7 from the ASI neurons, and not the ASJ neurons, contributes to these other possibly related phenotypes, similar mechanisms may\u00a0be involved in regulating <i>daf-7</i> expression and release in these three distinct food/satiety-dependent assay contexts. Taken together with our data, the important role of <i>daf-7</i> in these different behavioral paradigms suggests that the <i>daf-7</i> pathway may act as a more global food signal that is critical for allowing the animal to sense food and satiety and modulate its behaviors accordingly."

For cell specific manipulations, the ciliated neuron <i>bbs-1</i> promoter (1.9 kb) and ASJ specific <i>trx-1</i> promoter (1.1 kb; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fierro-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2011</a>) were amplified from genomic DNA and inserted in the place of the <i>rab-3</i> promoter by Gibson assembly. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm identity and injected into <i>ksIs2;him-5(e1490)</i> animals at a concentration of 50 ng/\u00b5L, along with a plasmid carrying <i>ofm-1::gfp</i> (50 ng/\u00b5L). At least three independent transgenic lines were obtained and analyzed for each construct and one representative line is shown.

Briefly, animals were placed individually onto a 1 cm lawn (~20 \u00b5L of culture) of <i>E. coli</i> OP50 in the center of a 10 cm plate. Movement of each animal was tracked at hourly time points. When an animal\u2019s tracks extended a distance of 3 cm away from the starting lawn, the animal was scored as a \u2018leaver\u2019. It has been previously demonstrated that male leaving behavior can be modeled by the single exponential decay function N(t)/N(0)=exp(-\u03bbt), where N(t) refers to the number of non-leavers at a given time and the hazard value (\u03bb) gives an estimate for the probability of leaving, which remains constant over the course of an assay (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>). Hazard values were calculated by fitting data using the R survival package with an exponential parametric survival model using maximum likelihood (R Project for Statistical Computing, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905\">SCR_001905</a>). These values were pooled across replicates. At least two independent experiments were performed for each genotype (~40 animals per genotype). For leaving assays with <i>P. aeruginosa,</i> plates were supplemented with additional peptone and were seeded with 15 \u00b5L of bacterial culture. In addition, all plates for PA14 assays were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C after being seeded with bacteria and then for an additional 2 days at room temperature before being used for the assay."

Males were placed individually on these plates and their movement tracked over time as in the standard mate-searching assay.

All data were analyzed in FIJI. For quantifications of FISH data, fluorescence values were calculated within the ASJ (or ASI) neurons for the indicated conditions. All samples were hybridized using <i>daf-</i>7-Cy5 probes and imaged at an exposure time of 1500 ms.

You demonstrate that <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASJ sensory neurons is also regulated by genetic sex, and that this sexually dimorphic expression contributes to male mate-searching behavior. Further regulation of expression by nutritional state allows reprioritization of feeding over mate-searching, a behavioral change previously reported by others. Overall, the experiments are nicely done, and the observation is novel. However, a number of concerns need to be addressed before this manuscript becomes acceptable for publication in <i>eLife</i>:"

Several experiments are possible to integrate previous results on the roles of DAF-7 and ODR-10 in exploratory vs feeding behaviors. We suggest some specific ones here although other approaches may also be appropriate: (a) Compare time course of changes in <i>daf-7</i> vs <i>odr-10</i> expression upon starvation; (b) test if the changes in <i>daf-7</i> and <i>odr-10</i> are interdependent or independent of each other (i.e. analyze reporters in respective mutant backgrounds); (c) test if NPR-5 is involved in regulation of <i>daf-7</i> expression in ASJ in males as a function of satiety; (d) Do males raised on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> also exhibit increased food leaving?"

However, the leaving assay does not discriminate mate-searching behavior from what could be pathogen avoidance in this context. Either this assay needs to be performed on hermaphrodites to distinguish it as a male-specific behavior, or an additional assay (i.e. retention assay, as in Barrios et al. 2008) performed to distinguish between these two possibilities."

One way by which this could be addressed is by measuring and comparing the rate at which wild-type and experimental males reach the scoring distance in a leaving-assay plate when the area is completely covered with food (as in Barrios et al. 2012, Nat.

Our studies in the development of the revised manuscript suggest that there is not a straightforward correlation that can be applied in the genetic analysis of the three distinct DAF-7-involved behavioral phenotypes of quiescence, foraging, and male mate-searching behavior."

We observe that males that have been starved maintain expression of <i>daf-7</i> in the ASJ neuron pair on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and correspondingly exhibit food-leaving behavior\u2014indeed, as the reviewer suggests, we interpret this as primarily driven by pathogen avoidance. We provide several additional panels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A-D</a>), which show that this <i>P. aeruginosa</i> leaving behavior is executed by both males and hermaphrodites, fed and starved. Additionally, we did perform a retention assay, and saw that while hermaphrodites suppressed the leaving behavior of starved males on <i>E. coli</i>, their presence was not sufficient to suppress <i>P. aeruginosa</i> leaving behaviors. We have provided further clarification and discussion in the text to clarify the rationale and interpretation of this important experiment."

One way by which this could be addressed is by measuring and comparing the rate at which wild-type and experimental males reach the scoring distance in a leaving-assay plate when the area is completely covered with food (as in Barrios et al. 2012, Nat.
