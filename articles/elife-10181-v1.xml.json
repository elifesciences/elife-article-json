Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we map a novel sensory neuron circuit motif that encodes odor concentration. Primary neurons, AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA, directly detect the food odor benzaldehyde (BZ) and release insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine, respectively, which are required for odor-evoked responses in secondary neurons, ASEL and AWB. Consistently, both primary and secondary neurons are required for BZ attraction. Unexpectedly, this combinatorial code is altered in aged animals: odor-evoked activity in secondary, but not primary, olfactory neurons is reduced. Moreover, experimental manipulations increasing neurotransmission from primary neurons rescues aging-associated neuronal deficits. Finally, we correlate the odor responsiveness of aged animals with their lifespan. Together, these results show how odors are encoded by primary and secondary neurons and suggest reduced neurotransmission as a novel mechanism driving aging-associated sensory neural activity and behavioral declines."

Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we map a novel sensory neuron circuit motif that encodes odor concentration. Primary neurons, AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA, directly detect the food odor benzaldehyde (BZ) and release insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine, respectively, which are required for odor-evoked responses in secondary neurons, ASEL and AWB. Consistently, both primary and secondary neurons are required for BZ attraction. Unexpectedly, this combinatorial code is altered in aged animals: odor-evoked activity in secondary, but not primary, olfactory neurons is reduced. Moreover, experimental manipulations increasing neurotransmission from primary neurons rescues aging-associated neuronal deficits. Finally, we correlate the odor responsiveness of aged animals with their lifespan. Together, these results show how odors are encoded by primary and secondary neurons and suggest reduced neurotransmission as a novel mechanism driving aging-associated sensory neural activity and behavioral declines."

This communication between primary and secondary olfactory neurons was essential for worms to respond to the food odor. Further experiments revealed that the primary olfactory neurons send chemical signals, called neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, to communicate with the secondary neurons. Importantly, mutations that blocked this chemical signaling prevented the worms from responding appropriately to the smell of food."

Leinwand et al. found that aged worms were no different. Further experiments suggested that aging worms' responses to odor decline because the communication between the primary and secondary olfactory neurons may be impaired with age. When Leinwand et al. strengthened this communication it reversed the effects of aging on the worms' sense of smell. Moreover, the experiments also showed that an animal's performance on the odor task was correlated with its longevity, such that the better performers also lived longer. A challenge for the future is to understand the precise changes that occur at early stages of aging to impair the sense of smell. Future studies could also test if similar combinations of olfactory neurons are needed to trigger certain behavioral responses to odors in young and old mammals."

This sensory information is relayed to downstream neural circuitry, generating appropriate food-seeking and toxin-avoiding behaviors, which enhance animal fitness. In particular, olfactory sensory neurons have an additional challenge in detecting a large set of volatile cues (<a href=\"#bib15\">Buck, 2005</a>). In mammals, odors are detected by G-protein coupled odorant receptors that are expressed on olfactory sensory neurons. Moreover, while the mammalian genome encodes approximately 1000 receptors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Buck and Axel, 1991</a>), each olfactory sensory neuron is known to express only one type of receptor (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vassar et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chess et al., 1994</a>). Since mammals can detect far more than 1000 odors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Duchamp-Viret et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rubin and Katz, 1999</a>), this suggests that olfactory information at this level is encoded by a combinatorial code (<a href=\"#bib42\">Malnic et al., 1999</a>). Calcium imaging and electrophysiological studies have confirmed that individual odorants bind multiple odorant receptors and activate the corresponding olfactory sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Malnic et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abaffy et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, activity in an individual olfactory sensory neuron represents not only the molecular receptive field of its odor receptors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Araneda et al., 2000</a>), but also gating by feedback circuits (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gomez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wachowiak et al., 2009</a>) and modulation by sniffing behavior in mammals (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wesson et al., 2009</a>). Information from these sensory neurons is then further processed and relayed to other brain regions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ghosh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Miyamichi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sosulski et al., 2011</a>). Despite this understanding, little is known about how specific activity patterns in the olfactory sensory neurons are correlated with behavioral outputs. One solution to this problem is to analyze numerically simpler invertebrate olfactory circuits where information flow can be traced at the resolution of individual neurons and correlated with animal behavior."

Chemosensory stimuli are detected by twelve sensory neuron pairs located in the amphid ganglia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib75\">White et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bargmann, 2006</a>). All 24 of these neurons send their dendrites to the nose of the animal where they detect environmental changes and relay that information through their axons to the downstream circuitry (<a href=\"#bib75\">White et al., 1986</a>). <i>C. elegans</i> uses small numbers of sensory neurons to drive locomotion towards or away from particular sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bargmann, 2006</a>). For example, single cell ablation experiments showed that the bilaterally asymmetric pair of AWC sensory neurons is necessary for attraction to benzaldehyde (BZ) odor, while the AWA sensory neuron pair is required for diacetyl odor attraction (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bargmann, 2006</a>). Functional imaging experiments revealed that AWC neurons are activated by the removal of odor stimuli (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>), while AWA neurons respond to the addition of odors (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zaslaver et al., 2015</a>). However, these sensory neuron activity patterns are not sufficient to explain how animals behave when they encounter diverse olfactory stimuli in the environment. We hypothesized that multiple amphid ganglia neurons could encode odor information and drive plastic olfactory behaviors; therefore, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of odor-evoked neural activity in all amphid neurons. We identified a novel circuit motif consisting of primary and secondary olfactory neurons that collectively encode odor and drive behavioral plasticity. We then analyzed the reliability of this combinatorial code and found that it degrades during aging. Our experiments suggest that a selective vulnerability of neurotransmitter release pathways in aged animals is the underlying mechanism that leads to a specific decay in secondary olfactory neuron activity and associated behavioral decline. Furthermore, we find that olfactory circuit function is correlated with an animal's longevity."

We trapped young adult animals expressing GCaMP family of genetically encoded calcium indicators (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tian et al., 2009</a>), under cell selective promoters, in individual amphid sensory neurons in our custom-designed microfluidic device (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>) and recorded their responses to BZ. Consistent with previous studies, we observed a large calcium transient indicating increased AWC activity upon removal of a medium concentration BZ stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). Unexpectedly, we found additional BZ responsive neurons: the diacetyl sensing AWA neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bargmann et al., 1993</a>) were activated by the addition of BZ, while ASE and AWB neurons (that were previously shown to sense salts [<a href=\"#bib9\">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</a>] and volatile repellents [<a href=\"#bib66\">Troemel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bargmann, 2006</a>], respectively) also responded to the removal of this stimulus in young adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Furthermore, none of the other amphid neurons responded to this medium concentration BZ stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). While the two AWC and ASE neurons can be genetically and functionally separated (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wes and Bargmann, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Suzuki et al., 2008</a>), each one in the pair showed similar responses to the removal of the BZ stimulus; therefore, we chose to focus our subsequent analysis on the AWC<sup>ON</sup> and ASEL (left) neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). We also noted that the ASEL responses to BZ were slower to reach the maximum response (average of 5.46 s after stimulus change) than the other odor responsive neurons (average 1\u20132 s after stimulus change), indicating that the kinetics of odor-evoked activity are different in different cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, different neural activity patterns distributed across AWC, ASE, AWA, AWB and ASH sensory neurons defined active neural circuits for different concentrations (medium as well as high or low) of BZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013I</a>). We focused on responses to the attractive medium concentration of BZ for the remainder of this study. Our data suggests that four pairs of sensory neurons (AWC, AWA, ASE and AWB) signal the presence of this BZ stimulus."

We used a chemotaxis assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and analyzed the behavior of animals with non-functional sensory neurons. We found that genetic ablation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Beverly et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yoshida et al., 2012</a>) or blocking synaptic transmission (with tetanus toxin [<a href=\"#bib58\">Schiavo et al., 1992</a>]) in any of the four AWC, ASE, AWA or AWB neurons impaired animals' chemotaxis to a point source of medium BZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This data is consistent with our imaging experiments and confirms a role for multiple sensory neurons in driving attraction to the BZ odor. In particular, our results showing important roles for ASE, AWA and AWB neurons in BZ attraction are novel. Together, these results show that a combinatorial code of activity across multiple neurons is essential to drive plasticity in an animal's behavior to BZ odor."

To classify the BZ-responsive neurons, we combined laser cell ablation with functional imaging. We predicted that BZ responses in primary neurons would be preserved when other odor responsive sensory neurons were ablated, while secondary neuron responses would require functional signaling from intact primary neurons. We found that AWC<sup>ON</sup> responses to BZ were not affected in animals with any of the other BZ responsive neuron pairs (AWA, ASE or AWB neurons) ablated, suggesting that AWC<sup>ON</sup> neurons directly detect the odor stimulus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, AWA responses to BZ were not affected in animals with ablated AWC, ASE or AWB neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These experiments suggest that AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA neurons directly detect BZ and function as primary sensory neurons. In contrast, ASEL responses to BZ were greatly reduced in animals with ablated AWC neurons, but unaffected by AWA or AWB neuron ablation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This suggests that ASEL neurons may respond to signals from AWC<sup>ON</sup> primary sensory neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Similarly, AWB responses to BZ required signaling from AWA neurons as these responses were significantly reduced specifically in the AWA ablation condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Interestingly, while AWA neurons responded to the addition of odor stimulus with an increase in the calcium signal, the AWB neuron calcium signal increased upon odor removal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). We suggest that AWB neurons may be inhibited by AWA and, when odor is removed, AWA is no longer active, leading to a release from inhibition and an increase in AWB activity. Additionally, direct olfactory sensory inputs or signaling from other neurons may also contribute to AWB activity, accounting for the residual AWB responses to odor in the AWA neuron ablated animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Collectively, these data show a novel sensory circuit configuration in which the odor responsive neurons are not equal: the olfactory circuit for BZ odor is composed of two primary sensory neurons (AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA) and two secondary neurons (ASEL and AWB) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

To identify the relevant primary neuron released neurotransmitters that activate the secondary neurons, we analyzed the neural activity patterns in various mutants. We first examined genetic mutants that primarily block the release of (1) small, clear synaptic vesicles containing classical neurotransmitters such as glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine [Munc13 or <i>unc-13</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib56\">Richmond et al., 1999</a>)] or (2) neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles [CAPS, calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion, or <i>unc-31</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Speese et al., 2007</a>)]. We found that AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA neurons retained their odor responsiveness in the absence of classical or peptidergic neurotransmission (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This data confirms our cell ablation results, indicating that these neurons directly detect BZ and are primary olfactory sensory neurons. Interestingly, we found that AWC<sup>OFF</sup> responses to BZ were significantly reduced in <i>unc-13</i> mutants, suggesting that classical neurotransmission might be required to potentiate odor-evoked activity in this neuron (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We suggest that AWC<sup>OFF</sup> responses to BZ might be potentiated by classical neurotransmission from AWC<sup>ON</sup> neuron. Together, these results confirm that AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA are primary sensory neurons and can directly detect BZ in the environment."

                                "text": "In contrast, we found that mutations impairing neurotransmission affected the odor responses of the ASEL and AWB secondary neurons, which we identified by cell ablation experiments. Specifically, odor-evoked ASEL activity required <i>unc-31-</i>dependent neuropeptide signaling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Restoring neuropeptide release function specifically to the AWC neurons rescued ASEL BZ responses in <i>unc-31</i> mutants, suggesting that AWC neurons release peptides to recruit ASEL neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This gene mutant analysis suggests that the longer time required for ASEL neurons to reach their maximum response to odor may reflect the additional requirement of AWC-dependent peptidergic transmission (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, ASER responses to BZ also require neuropeptide signaling (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While we have not identified the source of these neuropeptides, we suggest that AWC released peptides may also activate ASER neurons. Moreover, <i>unc-13-</i>dependent classical neurotransmission was not required for either ASEL or ASER responses to BZ (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). We then examined AWB responses to BZ in neurotransmission mutants. AWB responses were significantly and specifically reduced in <i>unc-13</i> mutants, suggesting that these neurons are recruited to this olfactory circuit by classical neurotransmitter(s) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). To confirm that AWA was the source of these classical neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), we used tetanus toxin to manipulate the neurotransmitter pathways. Tetanus toxin has been previously shown to cleave synaptobrevin and block neurotransmission (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schiavo et al., 1992</a>). We found that expressing tetanus toxin specifically in the AWA, but not AWC, sensory neurons significantly reduced AWB responses to BZ removal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This confirms that AWA signals to AWB and recruits it into the odor circuit. Nevertheless, the residual odor-evoked AWB responses observed in <i>unc-13</i> mutants and transgenic animals with reduced AWA neurotransmission (AWA::tetanus toxin) confirm that direct sensory inputs or signaling from other neurons may also contribute to AWB activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These data show that ASE and AWB neurons can function as secondary neurons because their responses to BZ require neuropeptide and classical neurotransmitter signaling respectively. Collectively, this defines a BZ odor-encoding circuit motif consisting predominantly of two primary and two secondary neurons wired as two parallel channels of olfactory information."

The <i>C. elegans</i> genome includes at least 122 neuropeptide genes and pathways to generate several classical neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA and acetylcholine (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hobert, 2013</a>). To identify the cognate neuropeptide(s) activating ASEL neurons, we used ASEL activity as readout to screen a number of neuropeptide gene mutants. We found that the insulin-like peptide <i>ins-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pierce et al., 2001</a>) was required for BZ-evoked ASEL responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Moreover, restoring INS-1 function specifically to AWC neurons, but not to AWA neurons, rescued mutant ASEL activity deficits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This suggests that AWC neurons release INS-1 peptides to recruit ASEL neurons into the odor circuit. To confirm AWC as the source of the INS-1 peptides, we used an AWC neuron-specific RNAi approach to knockdown the <i>ins-1</i> gene. Previous studies have shown that expressing the sense and anti-sense transcript under a cell-specific promoter can efficiently knockdown the gene of the interest in that cell (<a href=\"#bib25\">Esposito et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</a>). We found that knocking down <i>ins-1</i> in AWC neurons significantly reduced the ASEL responses to BZ, confirming that AWC-released INS-1 is required for ASEL activity in the odor circuit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We suggest that the same insulin neuropeptide may be multifunctional. For example, INS-1 released from AIA interneurons inhibits AWC and ASER activity (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tomioka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chalasani et al., 2010</a>), while we show that INS-1 released from AWC recruits ASEL into the BZ circuit. Ultimately, this signaling can regulate odor circuit dynamics, salt chemotaxis plasticity and integrative thermotactic behavior (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kodama et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tomioka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chalasani et al., 2010</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that the site of release and likely also signaling in the downstream neurons play key roles in determining the functionality of INS-1 peptides."

We found that odor-evoked ASEL activity required the canonical insulin receptor (<i>daf-2</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> [<a href=\"#bib51\">Pierce et al., 2001</a>]) and PI3-Kinase (<i>age-1</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> [<a href=\"#bib45\">Morris et al., 1996</a>]) signaling in ASEL neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). We suggest that the increase in calcium in ASEL may result from rapid signaling downstream of PI3-Kinase acting directly on calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib12\">Blair and Marshall, 1997</a>), and that this may represent an alternate pathway to the canonical, long term effects of DAF-2 signaling to regulate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib47\">Murphy et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, we found that the insulin receptor mutant (<i>daf-2</i>) had a stronger reduction in ASEL activity compared to the insulin ligand mutant (<i>ins-1</i>) or the insulin ligand knockdown animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). These results suggest that AWC neurons may co-release additional insulin peptides along with INS-1 to bind the insulin receptor on ASEL neurons. Importantly, we also confirmed that AWC<sup>ON</sup> primary olfactory neuron dynamics were normal in all of the insulin pathway mutants analyzed, indicating that insulin signaling functions downstream of primary olfactory sensory transduction (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Furthermore, we have previously shown that ASEL responses to a different, directly detected stimulus, salt, are not affected in the <i>daf-2</i> or <i>age-1</i> mutants, suggesting that these primary ASEL responses do not depend on insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</a>). Together, these results indicate that AWC-released insulin peptides signal to ASEL secondary neurons via the insulin receptor and PI3-Kinase to encode the BZ stimulus."

                                "text": "We also mapped the classical neurotransmitter pathway recruiting AWB neurons into the circuit. We found that mutations in the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), <i>unc-17</i>, which packs acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alfonso et al., 1994</a>), reduced AWB odor responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Restoring cholinergic function specifically in AWA primary neurons was sufficient to elicit wild-type-like activity in AWB secondary neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We also examined additional components of the cholinergic synthesis and release pathway through a cell-specific RNAi knockdown approach. We found that knocking down the <i>C. elegans</i> choline acetyltransferase (ChaT), <i>cha-1,</i> which is required for the biosynthesis of acetylcholine (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rand and Russell, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alfonso et al., 1994</a>), specifically in the AWA neurons significantly reduced AWB neuron responses to BZ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Together, these results suggest an essential role for cholinergic signaling from the AWA neurons to recruit AWB neurons to the olfactory circuit. Interestingly, AWA neuron-specific knockdown of the choline transporter <i>cho-1,</i> which is required for high affinity choline reuptake at presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib50\">Okuda et al., 2000</a>), had no effect on AWB responses to BZ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Therefore, we suggest that AWA requires the choline acetyltransferase, but may not require the high affinity choline transporter to release acetylcholine. While we cannot rule out the possibility that our attempts to knockdown the choline transporter were ineffective, our results are consistent with prior observations that loss of <i>cho-1</i> has only mild effects on cholinergic neurotransmission and suggest that de novo choline synthesis and low affinity choline uptake may be sufficient for cholinergic signaling in the olfactory circuit (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mullen et al., 2007</a>). We considered whether acetylcholine modulates AWB activity by acting on muscarinic receptors. We found that odor-evoked AWB activity was not affected in mutants of any of the three identified <i>C. elegans</i> muscarinic receptors (<i>gar-1</i>, <i>gar-2</i> and <i>gar-3</i>) (data not shown), suggesting that acetylcholine might bind other receptors on AWB neurons. The <i>C. elegans</i> genome encodes 8 acetylcholine-gated chloride channels (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hobert, 2013</a>) and we suggest that AWA-released acetylcholine binds one of these receptors to inhibit AWB neuronal activity when odor is added, leading to a rebound from this inhibition when odor is removed. Moreover, we found that AWB responses to the directly detected repulsive odorant 2-nonanone (<a href=\"#bib66\">Troemel et al., 1997</a>) were normal in <i>unc-17</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We suggest that AWB secondary (to BZ), but not primary (to 2-nonanone) responses require cholinergic signaling. Importantly, we also confirmed that AWA primary olfactory neuron dynamics were normal in the genetic mutants and knockdown animals analyzed (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). These experiments support the conclusion that changes in the secondary neuron activity observed in these mutants and knockdown transgenic animals are downstream of sensory transduction in the primary neurons and related to transmitter release from primary neurons."

In addition, animals with the choline acetyltransferase <i>cha-1</i> knocked down specifically in AWA neurons also displayed significantly reduced BZ chemotaxis behavior (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Together, these data show that BZ stimulus is encoded by AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA primary sensory neurons, which use insulin peptidergic and cholinergic neurotransmission to elicit activity in ASEL and AWB secondary neurons and to shape chemotaxis behavior (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Thus, multiple neuropeptide and neurotransmitter pathways are integrated to shape odor encoding and behavior."

While young adults were strongly attracted to BZ odor, we found that older animals (day 4\u20136) showed a significant impairment in their attraction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The behavioral deficit was largest for day 6 adults; however, we found that these animals had more variability in their size (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) making it difficult to design an effective trap to image animals beyond day 5 of adulthood and analyze their odor-evoked neuronal activity. Therefore, for the remainder, we compared young adults (day 1, the age characterized above) and animals at a post-reproductive, early stage of aging (day 5), which we refer to as \u2018aged\u2019 adults. Importantly, we found that the aging-associated chemotaxis behavioral deficit is unlikely to be caused by changes in locomotory ability since the speed of chemotaxing aged animals did not differ from that of young adults (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

                                "text": "To determine the mechanism underlying this aging-associated decline in BZ-directed behavior, we probed neuronal activity in the combinatorial, BZ-encoding sensory neural circuit described above. We analyzed the responses of the primary (AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA) and secondary (ASEL and AWB) neurons to BZ in both young (day 1) and aged (day 5) adult animals. Overall, aging did not affect the reliability, duration or magnitude of odor-evoked activity in AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA primary neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D,G\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast, odor-evoked ASEL and AWB secondary neuron activity was highly variable with aging, with many neurons failing to show any responses to odor, revealing a possible mechanism for behavioral decline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, the AWB neurons that did respond to odor in aged animals had calcium transients that were indistinguishable from responses in younger animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Additionally, considering only the animals with odor responsive ASEL neurons, the BZ responses of the aged animals were in fact significantly larger than that of the young animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G,H</a>). These results suggest that odor-evoked activity in ASEL and AWB secondary neurons selectively decays in some animals. Consistent with these results, we found that the weak chemotaxis performance of aged animals towards BZ only required the primary AWC and AWA neurons, and not the unreliable secondary ASE and AWB neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). To further examine this, we tested whether performance in the chemotaxis assay is correlated with the odor responsiveness of the ASEL and AWB secondary neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We found that aged animals that failed to chemotax towards BZ were significantly more likely to have odor non-responsive ASEL and AWB neurons than aged animals that successfully found the odor source (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). Taken together, these data reveal a distributed neural circuit that detects attractive odors and suggest that BZ behavioral declines arise from unreliable activity of aged secondary ASEL and AWB neurons in this circuit."

We showed that a distinct, but overlapping set of sensory neurons encodes high concentration BZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H,I</a>). Behaviorally, we found that high BZ was similarly repulsive in young and aged animals (through day 5) (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Consistently, high BZ-evoked neural activity did not significantly decline between day 1 and day 5 adults (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013D</a>). These data suggest that the aging-associated decline in neuronal function is dependent on odor concentration; consistent with previous studies showing relatively preserved behavioral detection of strong sensory stimuli with age (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hummel et al., 2007</a>)."

These data indicate that functionality of both ASEL and AWB neurons in aged animals is sensory context dependent. Specifically, their primary responses to salt (ASEL) and 2-nonanone (AWB) are preserved, while their function as secondary neurons in encoding attractive BZ stimuli is impaired during aging."

This suggests that the neurotransmission that recruits these neurons to the odor circuit may break down with age. In particular, impaired ASEL neuronal activity may indicate a breakdown in the peptidergic neurotransmission that recruits this neuron into the BZ circuit. In order to identify the mechanisms for this aging-associated decline, we manipulated the primary to secondary neurotransmission pathway. First, we hypothesized that aging might downregulate the levels of the peptide receptors on ASEL neurons, thus reducing signaling in aged ASEL neurons. We tested this hypothesis by overexpressing the DAF-2 insulin receptor specifically in the ASEL neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left panel). However, we found no change in the reliability of these aged animals' odor-evoked ASEL activity compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This result suggests that receptor expression is not limiting in these aged animals. We confirmed that our ASEL-specific DAF-2 overexpression (OE) was functional by analyzing ASEL responses in young day 1 adults. We found that the ASEL BZ responses were significantly larger in young adult animals overexpressing DAF-2 in ASEL (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) confirming the efficacy of the transgene. Taken together, these results suggest that DAF-2 receptors in ASEL are not reduced during the aging process and signaling via these receptors does not limit olfactory circuit activity in aged animals."

We over-expressed the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, UNC-17, specifically in AWA neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

We found that aged animals overexpressing the UNC-17 vesicular acetylcholine transporter in AWA neurons were significantly more attracted to BZ compared to aged wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Moreover, this increased attraction required the secondary AWB neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). These data confirm a role for AWA-AWB neurotransmission in rescuing aging-associated decline in BZ attraction. We note that while arecoline pharmacology rescued aged AWB neuronal activity, this treatment impaired BZ chemotaxis in both young and aged animals (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We suggest that the known effect of arecoline to increase spontaneous locomotion may be counterproductive to the directed locomotion required to chemotax up an odor gradient (<a href=\"#bib27\">Glenn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2013</a>)."

We performed chemotaxis assays and separated the animals into two populations that did or did not navigate up an attractive BZ gradient (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We then assayed the lifespan of these two populations of animals. Notably, we observed a significant extension (average of 16.2% in three separate trials, p &lt; 0.001, Mantel\u2013Cox test) in the lifespan of animals that successfully chemotaxed to the odor as aged adults, compared to animals that failed to do so (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, we found no difference in the lifespan of animals that were sorted on the basis of their chemotaxis performance as young adults (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that the olfactory abilities of aged, but not young, animals may be correlated with their overall health, leading to lifespan differences. In contrast, we found that sorting aged animals based on their attraction to salt did not result in any significant differences in lifespan (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplements 1,2A</a>). These data show that the increase in lifespan is likely to be specific to BZ and not the salt associated neural circuit, consistent with the specific declines in BZ, not salt, evoked activity and behavior. Furthermore, these results indicate that the functionality of some, but not all, sensory neuronal circuits in early stage aged animals may predict animals' longevity. These data are also consistent with cell ablation experiments where loss of some chemosensory neurons affects <i>C. elegans</i> lifespan, while loss of other chemosensory neurons has no effect (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004</a>). Together, these results suggest that the olfactory prowess of aged animals is indicative of whole animal physiology, health and lifespan."

We tested whether more reliable olfactory circuit functioning resulting from increased neurotransmission from the primary AWA or AWC<sup>ON</sup> neurons affected animal lifespan. We found that animals overexpressing the UNC-17 vesicular acetylcholine transporter in AWA neurons lived an average of 26.6% longer than their wild-type counterparts (over three separate trials, p &lt; 0.001, Mantel\u2013Cox test) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Moreover, increasing neurotransmission from AWC either by overexpressing the INS-1 peptide or by knocking down <i>tom-1,</i> the <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of Tomosyn, resulted in a trend towards a small extension in lifespan (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These data suggest that both classical neurotransmission (from AWA neurons) and neuropeptide signaling (from AWC neurons), which are key components of the combinatorial code for BZ, may have a longevity promoting effect. These data are in contrast with previously published results showing that animals with AWC or AWA neurons ablated live longer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004</a>); therefore, we probed the role of these neurons in lifespan further. We analyzed the lifespan of animals in which AWA or AWC neurons were silenced rather than ablated. Animals expressing tetanus toxin in either AWA or AWC neurons to block their neurotransmission lived significantly longer than wild-type (average of 36.0% and 27.6% longer, respectively, over two independent trials, p &lt; 0.01, Mantel\u2013Cox test, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B,3</a>). Together, these results suggest that a balance in neurotransmission from the primary olfactory neurons is crucial to an animal's longevity; both higher than normal and lower than normal levels of neurotransmission extend lifespan. We suggest that signaling from these primary olfactory neurons is integrated by the downstream circuitry to mediate effects on the animal's lifespan."

A distinct, but similarly distributed neural circuit (which does not include the ASE neurons) encodes a different attractive odorant, isoamyl alcohol (data not shown, [<a href=\"#bib78\">Yoshida et al., 2012</a>]). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the <i>C. elegans</i> salt neural circuit is composed of a primary salt sensory neuron, ASEL, which releases INS-6 insulin neuropeptides to recruit a secondary sensory neuron, AWC<sup>ON</sup>, into the circuit in particular sensory contexts (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</a>). This combined primary and secondary neuron coding strategy is likely to increase the signal-to-noise ratios, thus preventing failures in encoding sensory information. Combinatorial coding of this sort may also be broadly useful for distinguishing different concentrations of the same stimulus, as they will be encoded by overlapping but distinct subsets of neurons. This approach may also enhance the ability of young adults to successfully find food, perhaps to enhance reproductive success, while the aging-associated declines occur in post-reproductive animals that may have reduced nutritional demands. Furthermore, the insulin peptidergic and cholinergic signaling from primary to secondary olfactory neurons could add salience to volatile food signals in a complex, multisensory environment. Previous studies have shown that insulin (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lacroix et al., 2008</a>) and cholinergic receptors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ogura et al., 2011</a>) are expressed in mammalian olfactory processing centers, suggesting that these signaling pathways might also be used to encode odors in mammals. Detailed analyses of the architecture of sensory circuits, including the neurotransmission between sensory neurons, in other species are needed to determine whether the circuit motif described here is broadly conserved."

However, the combinatorial code for attractive volatile cues degrades with age because the activity of cells functioning as secondary neurons decays with age. Our results show that aging-induced decline in neuronal function is dependent on the interplay between sensory context and neuronal identity. For example, we find that primary ASEL responses to salt and AWB responses to 2-nonanone are preserved while their secondary responses to BZ are reduced in aged animals. This is in contrast with studies showing an early stage age-induced decline in the primary ASH neuron responses to hyperosmotic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib20\">Chokshi et al., 2010</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that aging differentially affects sensory circuits, perhaps reflecting differences in physiological demand and the importance of diverse sensory contexts as the animal ages. Furthermore, these aging-associated sensory declines occur independently of many known longevity pathways. Insulin signaling has been shown to promote longevity in a number of model systems including <i>C. elegans</i>, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>Mus musculus</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Broughton and Partridge, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kenyon, 2010</a>). We find that insulin signaling is required for the primary AWC<sup>ON</sup> to secondary ASEL neurotransmission and so are unable to separate its longevity promoting effect from its role in encoding sensory information. We speculate that the insulin signaling pathway might affect both the quality of an animal's life by encoding odors based on sensory context and also its lifespan."

Several different mechanisms could underlie the impairments observed in aged animals and overcome by our manipulations. A decline in peptidergic and cholinergic gene expression with age could contribute; however, quantitative RT-PCR experiments suggest that there is no aging-associated reduction in the expression of these genes at the whole animal level [data not shown and (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jin et al., 2011</a>)]. Changes in gene expression specifically in the primary olfactory neurons cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, we speculate that the early aging-associated sensory impairments are driven at least in part by reduced neurotransmitter release from primary neurons, a mechanism likely applicable across species. We find that both increasing neurotransmitter production and release capacity rescue the aging-associated deficits. Therefore, it is likely that aging affects multiple steps in the neurotransmitter release pathway, emphasizing the key role played by this machinery in regulating animal behavior and physiology. These results are consistent with reports of reduced synapse number in the aged mammalian olfactory bulb, which should disrupt olfactory circuits (<a href=\"#bib55\">Richard et al., 2010</a>). We speculate that these differences in synaptic transmission also explain some of the inter-individual variability in aging phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pinto et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vijg, 2014</a>). Subsequently, these circuit-level changes could produce hyposmia or anosmia, which may be among the earliest predictors of lifespan and mortality across species (<a href=\"#bib65\">Toth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pinto et al., 2014</a>). More generally, we suggest that alterations in transmitter release, which disrupt neuronal communication throughout the brain (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dickstein et al., 2007</a>) are likely to underlie variability in individual animal behavior and age-related cognitive and behavioral decline."

Specifically, to analyze on responses to the addition of stimulus, the average fluorescence and standard error were calculated in the 10 s period following the addition of odor or salt (t = 10\u201320 s). For AWA neurons, the response duration was very brief; therefore, a 4 s time period was used instead (t = 10\u201314 s) so that small, fast responses could be appropriately quantified.

Traces in which an averaged \u0394F/F of greater than 600% was recorded were excluded as they are likely to be artifacts of the neurons moving out of the focal plane and these usually account for less than 1% of the traces collected.

The maximum \u0394F/F in these time periods following odor addition or removal and the time to reach this maximum \u0394F/F (from the stimulus change, in seconds) were also quantified (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

For aging assays, worms were synchronized by hatch offs in which 8 young adult worms were given 150 min to lay eggs on a large plate before being picked off. These eggs were grown at 20\u00b0 until the appropriate day of adulthood, except for <i>glp-1</i> mutants, which were raised at the restrictive temperature, 25\u00b0. Aging animals were transferred to new bacteria plates every other day to track the aging animals and to avoid contamination by their progeny. Chemotaxis assays were performed on 2% agar plates (10 cm diameter) containing 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Animals were washed once in M9 and three times in chemotaxis buffer (5 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>). For arecoline chemotaxis experiments, 0.15 mM arecoline was added to the M9 and chemotaxis buffer washes, yielding a 16\u201320 min drug treatment immediately prior to the behavioral experiment. Odor concentration gradients were established by spotting diluted BZ (0.2% vol/vol, in ethanol) near the edge of the plate, with a Ctrl 1 \u03bcl of ethanol spotted at the opposite end of the plate. Where noted, 1 \u03bcl of neat BZ was used for high concentration point source assays. For 2-nonanone experiments, a 50% vol/vol dilution of 2-nonanone in ethanol was used. For salt chemotaxis experiments, salt gradients were established by placing a Ctrl or a high salt (500 mM NaCl) agar plug on the assay plate and allowing 16\u201320 hr for the salt to diffuse and form a gradient (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</a>). 1 \u03bcl of sodium azide was added to the odor (or salt) and the Ctrl spots to anesthetize animals reaching the end points. Washed worms were placed on the plate and allowed to move freely for one hour. The chemotaxis index was computed as the number of worms in the region near the odor (or salt) minus the worms in the region near the Ctrl divided by the total number of worms that moved beyond the origin. Nine or more assays were performed, over at least three different days. Two-tailed unpaired <i>t-</i>tests were used to compare the responses of different genotypes or ages, and the Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons."

Animals were tested in a (0.2% vol/vol) BZ odor chemotaxis assay as above, with two modifications. First, no sodium azide was used to paralyze the animals. Second, animals were given only 30 min to move freely on the chemotaxis plate.

The chemotaxis assay plate was then cut into a BZ odor (or salt), middle, and Ctrl region and worms were washed off each section separately. 100 adults from the odor (or salt) region or the Ctrl region were transferred onto 10 small OP50 plates (10 adults per plate) and grown at 20\u00b0. For experiments with transgenic animals, day 1 animals bearing the appropriate transgene were picked from the hatch off plate directly onto 10 small OP50 plates (10 adults per plate) and grown at 20\u00b0. In all experiments, aging animals were transferred to new bacteria plates every other day to track the aging animals and to avoid contamination by their progeny. Survival was analyzed every other day and worms were scored alive or dead based on their response to a gentle head touch (or lack thereof) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kenyon et al., 1993</a>). Worms were censored if they bagged, exploded or desiccated on the side of the plate. The chemotaxis assay followed by lifespan analysis or lifespan assays with transgenic animals were repeated two or three times per condition as indicated, beginning on separate days. The percent change in mean survival was calculated as the mean survival of animals from the odor side minus the mean survival of animals from the Ctrl side divided by the mean odor side survival or the mean transgenic animal survival minus the mean wild-type survival divided by the mean wild-type survival. Statistical analysis of lifespan was performed by the Mantel\u2013Cox Log\u2013Rank test, using GraphPad Prism and OASIS (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yang et al., 2011</a>)."

The source of this sensory stimulus is not known, one possibility being redundant inputs from AWA and AWC. Small but significant AWB response is also observed in the <i>unc-13</i> mutant, <i>unc-17</i> mutant and other manipulations. Given the status of the analysis and the characteristics of AWB as olfactory neurons, direct sensory input to AWB is not excluded and is in fact likely.

On the contrary, upon odor addition, AWA is largely activated but AWB is not activated, or a bit inhibited. Therefore a simple excitatory or inhibitory synapse from AWA to AWB does not explain the behavior of AWB neurons. This simple consideration leads to the question whether AWBs dependence on AWA is based on fast synaptic transmission. You show that the <i>unc-17</i> mutant shows reduced response of AWB and this defect is rescued by <i>unc-17</i> expression in AWA. <i>cho-1</i> RNAi shows similar results. However, this does not necessarily mean AWB is activated upon odor removal by cholinergic neurotransmission from AWA. Equally possible explanations \u2013 which you should discuss in the text \u2013 are the modulatory effects of AWA-released acetylcholine (as muscarinic receptors function in other systems), by which AWB becomes more responsive to direct odor sensation. In the Abstract, you state: \u201cPrimary neurons, AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWA, directly detect the food odor benzaldehyde and release insulin-like peptides and acetylcholine, respectively, to activate secondary neurons, ASEL and AWB\u201d. This clearly implicates that insulin and acetylcholine are released upon odor detection to activate ASEL and AWB. This is not supported because there is no release timing data presented for neither insulin nor acetylcholine (these data are generally difficult to obtain in <i>C. elegans</i>). You need to carefully rephrase these statements to something like \u201cinsulin-like peptide and acetylcholine released from AWC and AWA respectively are required for activity of secondary neurons\u201d."

According to the authors, AWC and AWA are primary sensory neurons (their response to the odor does not rely on synaptic transmission), and ASE and AWB are secondary sensory neurons. They claim that AWC-to-ASEL communication depends on the insulin signaling genes <i>ins-1</i>, <i>daf-2</i> and <i>age-1</i>, while AWA-to-AWB communication depends on the cholinergic signaling gene <i>unc-17</i>. Based on this characterization of the basic circuit, they look at the age-dependent decline of chemosensation. Chemotaxis to bz declines with age, through 1 to 6 days in adulthood. The calcium response of AWC and AWA neurons did not significantly change by age, while response of ASEL and AWB becomes variable in aged animals, whereby fraction of non-responsive neurons increases with age. Increasing the expression of <i>ins-1</i> in AWC or AWC-specific RNAi of <i>tom-1</i> tomosin rescues the ASEL response, while increasing the expression of <i>unc-17</i> or addition of cholinergic agonist arecoline rescues the AWB response. Chemotaxis performance of individual aged animal was found correlated with lifespan. Together, the authors suggest that synaptic transmission is the primary site of age-dependent decline."

As a reference, INS-1 has been reported to act on ASER neuron to modulate this neuron, and DAF-2 receptor in ASER was shown to down-regulate synaptic transmission that occurs in response to chemosensory inputs to this neuron (Ohno et al. Science 2014). It is well established that DAF-16 FOXO acts downstream of DAF-2 to regulate expression of many genes including longevity-related gene. It would therefore be also possible that INS-1 acts hormonally on other nearby neurons to change the expression level of proteins that regulate the activities of this neuron (neurotransmitter receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels etc.).

Additionally, we agree with the reviewer that the canonical effects of the DAF-2/AGE-1 pathway regulate transcription and gene expression (described by Murphy CT et al. and others) and we cannot rule out that this leads to a chronic action of INS-1 to modulate the molecular machinery of the ASEL neuron. However, we speculate that alternate pathways downstream of INS-1/DAF-2 could also exist to rapidly modulate neuronal activity. These alternate pathways may be homologous to the rapid effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to increase calcium channel currents within seconds to alter neuronal activity (dependent on receptor tyrosine kinase and PI3-Kinase signaling) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Blair and Marshall 1997</a>, Selinfreund and Blair 1994). In this way, the increase in calcium in ASEL might result from rapid signaling downstream of INS-1, DAF-2 and PI3-Kinase acting directly on calcium channels. Because this is speculative, we have edited our manuscript to say that simply \u201cAWC released INS-1 recruits ASE into the benzaldehyde circuit\u201d. We have also changed our cartoons throughout the paper."
