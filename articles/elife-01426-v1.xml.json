To this end, we resequenced the four products of 13 meiotic tetrads along with 10 doubled haploids derived from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> hybrids. GC detection through short reads has previously been confounded by genomic rearrangements. Rigid filtering for misaligned reads allowed GC identification at high accuracy and revealed an \u223c80-kb transposition, which undergoes copy-number changes mediated by meiotic recombination. Non-crossover associated GCs were extremely rare most likely due to their short average length of \u223c25\u201350 bp, which is significantly shorter than the length of CO-associated GCs. Overall, recombination preferentially targeted non-methylated nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters, which showed significant enrichment of two sequence motifs."

Vertical lines indicate sequence differences between the parental genotypes and have the respective genotype indicated next to them. Within the CO sites (between the outer borders of both grey areas) the polymorphism data are based on hand curated short read alignments and local assemblies.

To this end, we resequenced the four products of 13 meiotic tetrads along with 10 doubled haploids derived from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> hybrids. GC detection through short reads has previously been confounded by genomic rearrangements. Rigid filtering for misaligned reads allowed GC identification at high accuracy and revealed an \u223c80-kb transposition, which undergoes copy-number changes mediated by meiotic recombination. Non-crossover associated GCs were extremely rare most likely due to their short average length of \u223c25\u201350 bp, which is significantly shorter than the length of CO-associated GCs. Overall, recombination preferentially targeted non-methylated nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters, which showed significant enrichment of two sequence motifs."

However, before they are separated, the pairs swap lengths of DNA via recombination events. These can involve exchanging large chunks of the chromosomes: this is called a \u2018crossover\u2019. Alternatively, short stretches of one chromosome can be replaced by the corresponding region from the other in the pair. When these \u2018non-crossovers\u2019 cause a change in the DNA sequence they are known as gene conversions."

However, meticulous examination of these short DNA reads allowed Wijnker et al. to reliably identify gene conversions on a genome-wide scale. In Arabidopsis, gene conversion appears to be unexpectedly rare\u2014with approximately one gene conversion detected per 140\u2013240 non-crossovers. Recombination tends to occur in regions of the chromosomes where the DNA is only loosely packaged, is not heavily modified by the process of \u2018DNA methylation\u2019, and also near the start of genes. Furthermore, two specific sequences of DNA bases were identified that marked \u2018hot spots\u2019 in the chromosomes, where recombination happens more frequently."

Besides randomly passing on one of the homologous chromosomes to the next generation, meiosis introduces intra-chromosomal recombination. In addition to potentially generating superior allele combinations, this shuffling of alleles avoids Muller\u2019s ratchet, in which asexual individuals accumulate deleterious mutations over time (<a href=\"#bib37\">Muller, 1932</a>). The impact of meiotic recombination on the allele distribution among offspring, and consequently on the haplotype structure of whole populations, depends on the rate and positioning of recombination events, which are initiated by the induction of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs)."

The broken strand invades a homologous chromosome and is repaired through HR repair intermediates like the D-loop and double Holliday junction. These intermediates are resolved either as crossovers (COs), leading to the reciprocal exchange of complete chromosome arms, or non-crossovers (NCOs). In both cases, heteroduplexes may arise from sequence divergence at the site of the strand invasion. When these are resolved, they can give rise to gene conversions (GCs), the non-reciprocal exchange of alleles between homologous non-sister chromatids. Such events typically lead to a 3:1 segregation of alleles among the four gametes of a single meiosis. GCs can be associated with COs (CO\u2013GCs) or with NCOs (NCO\u2013GCs) where they can introduce new alleles into an otherwise unchanged genetic background, depending on how the HR intermediate was resolved."

In total, we identified over 200 recombination events to the nucleotide level.

Aided by simulations we provide estimates on gene conversion rates and associated tract lengths. CO-associated GCs are at \u223c300\u2013400 bp between 6\u201316 times longer than GCs resulting from NCOs (25\u201350 bp).

Because Col and L<i>er</i> alleles segregate in an equal (2:2) ratio among the four tetrad offspring, both types of NCO\u2013GCs are expected to occur at similar numbers. However, we identified a striking overrepresentation of type-1 NCO\u2013GCs (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). As mentioned, type-1 NCO\u2013GCs introduce heterozygous genotype calls at markers where homozygous genotype calls would be expected. Such patterns of putative heterozygous alleles can also be introduced by erroneously aligned reads. By manually screening short read alignments, we found a large fraction of putative NCO\u2013GCs residing in regions in which the parental lines had been assigned heterozygous genotypes. Since all three parental lines are highly inbred, and hence homozygous throughout their genomes, the presence of heterozygous marker calls can only be explained by misaligned reads that result from unknown rearrangements or repeats. This is especially critical for L<i>er</i> and Cvi, where genome information is more limited than for the reference accession Col. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows an example where three haplotypes appear to be present at a single locus when the short read data of L<i>er</i> are aligned against the Col reference genome. This specific marker was used to assign NCO\u2013GCs in two earlier studies (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lu et al., 2012</a>). To prevent such erroneous calls, we redefined the initial set of markers by excluding all markers near regions with evidence of putative duplications (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

Most remarkable was an \u223c80 kb region on chromosome three, in three out of five independent tetrads, which harbored multiple closely linked putative type-2 NCO\u2013GCs, but not a single type-1 NCO\u2013GC. Thus, all these putative NCO\u2013GCs were homozygous genotypes, which suggested another source of error. Intriguingly, for each of these tetrads, one other offspring was found with a similar pattern in the same region, but in contrast these offspring featured only putative type-1 NCO\u2013GCs (heterozygous genotypes). Manual inspection of short read alignments and de novo assemblies of L<i>er</i> revealed a so-far undescribed large-scale rearrangement between Col and L<i>er</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This rearrangement encompasses two closely linked transpositions, which together relocated \u223c40 kb (including six genes) from \u223c22.53\u201322.57 Mb of the reference genome to 17.36 Mb on chromosome 3 in the genome of L<i>er</i>. Additionally, the region adjacent to the transposed sequences (between 22.51 Mb and 22.59 Mb on chromosome 3) appeared to be mostly absent in L<i>er</i>. The segregation of this complex region in combination with a CO in between the two insertion sites of the transpositions resulted in either a duplication or a deletion of the transposed sequence within individual offspring genomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). As a consequence, this unexpected copy number variation introduced false NCO\u2013GC calls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Among all 13 tetrads (including the eight shallow sequenced tetrads), there are seven that show a recombination event between the transposed regions, suggesting that an \u223c80 kb duplication/deletion is present in about half of all Col-L<i>er</i> gametes."

Like for the spontaneous mutation rates, we observed an enrichment of transitions (n = 6) over transversions (n = 2). An increased mutation rate in haploids could result from the absence of a homologous repair template in haploid (G1) cells that might lead to increased repair through the presumably more error-prone pathway of non-homologous end-joining (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gorbunova and Levy, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mao et al., 2008</a>). Alternatively, the process of uni-parental genome elimination (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sanei et al., 2011</a>) could potentially cause mutagenic stress.

In contrast to simulations for COCTs, simulating NCOCT placement is hampered by the lack of knowledge of how many NCOs were present.

We therefore simulated different NCO rates within the range of reported DSBs per meiosis (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vignard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chelysheva et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</a>).

To study interference, we calculated distances between adjacent COs and between NCOs and neighboring COs in our tetrad data set (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These were compared to expected distances between recombination events after randomizing the composition of tetrads by random sampling from all tetrad offspring. This preserved the non-uniform distribution of recombination events along the chromosome axis, while removing dependency between them as previously proposed by <a href=\"#bib31\">Mancera et al.

Observed inter-CO distances (average distance of 11.9 Mb) were significantly longer than expected based on randomized tetrads (average distance of 8.3 Mb; p value &lt;0.01 [permutation test]), confirming CO\u2013CO interference. Observed CO\u2013NCO distances fell within the expected range (average distance of NCOs: 3.2 Mb, average distance in randomization: 4.5 Mb, p value 0.91 [permutation test]), evidencing no significant difference from random placement.

Our simulation-based estimates of conversion tract lengths suggested short NCO tract lengths as a possible factor for this discrepancy. Small NCO tracts most often will not lead to conversions, as they do not overlap with polymorphisms. Minimal observed COCT lengths range from 1 to 1,229 bp (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>), whereas the lengths of NCOCTs range from 1 to 282 bp (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>). The recovery of two fairly long NCO events of 275 and 282 bp could be attributed to variation in NCO size, and is likely a detection bias, as NCOCT detection is strongly biased towards recovery of longer tracts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Curtis et al., 1989</a>). A previous estimate of 558 bp for COCT length and less than 150 bp for NCOCT length (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lu et al., 2012</a>) as based on six and four observations respectively, are close to our estimations. As suggested by <a href=\"#bib30\">Lu et al.

Together with the random inheritance of homologous chromosomes, COs are the major factors generating new allele combinations by redistributing allelic variation through exchanging complete chromosome arms.

We established a coverage-dependent frequency cutoff that allows identifying homozygous and heterozygous genotypes at identical error rates. To this end, we fitted beta distributions to the observed distribution of allele frequencies as measured by the short read alignments at type-1 and type-2 markers respectively (an example for a minimal coverage of 50 is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

For the identification of a minimal coverage threshold, NCO\u2013GC frequencies were calculated at multiple minimal coverage values. Calculations with lower coverage thresholds revealed higher NCO\u2013GC rates compared to calculations with more stringent coverage thresholds (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Errors result from technical artifacts and thus affect NCO\u2013GCs and non-NCO\u2013GCs equally, and thus the absolute number of false negatives is negligible."

(2008)</a>. For each permutation test we generated 10,000 iterations. Instead of randomizing recombination locations we randomized the labels of the tetrads of each CO, and thereby preserved the inhomogeneity of CO placement across the genome. Chromatid interference, the non-random association of the chromatids involved in two adjacent CO, would violate the validity of this background distribution of our permutation tests. However, we could not identify any evidence for chromatid interference in our data."

This allowed the identification (and removal) of markers that are most likely featuring alignments from different loci in the genome. Calculating the probability of NCO\u2013GCs per marker at a series of minimum coverage thresholds revealed that beyond a minimal coverage of 10, the frequency of NCO\u2013GC remained stable.

By comparing the resequencing data of all 10 samples, we identified mutations, which are specific for one of the DH samples. These encompass mutations that happened in the haploid life cycle before meiotic cell divisions. Only homozygous positions with a SHORE score of greater than or equal to 32 were probed for spontaneous mutations. Like the identification of NCO\u2013GCs, the identification of spontaneous mutations required a minimal coverage of 10, an allele frequency higher than the cutoff to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous positions (as defined for the tetrad analysis), and equivalent evidence for the non-mutant allele in the other samples."

Performing motif searches on conversion tracts ensures that the sequences were subjected to DSB repair. However, as conversion tracts are not necessarily centered on the location of the respective DSB, we included flanking sequences of 500 bp to increase the probability to encompass the complete region targeted by DSB repair. Candidate motifs were identified with MEME (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bailey et al., 2006</a>), which was run with the \u2018zoops\u2019 model, while correcting for the genomic background. Motifs with a minimum of five and maximum of 15 bp were identified. Only two motifs featured an e value of less than 1e-05. Due to the repetitive nature of the recovered motifs, we performed an additional permutation to test for random occurrence in the genome. Rescreening was performed within the observed conversion tracts as well as in 1,000 random genomic region of the same length using a positional weight matrix. The positional weight matrix was mapped against each sequence using MOODS and matches with p value &lt;0.001 were considered (<a href=\"#bib26\">Korhonen et al., 2009</a>)."

Several previous papers have studied rates and patterns of NCO-GC in Arabidopsis. This paper adds to the literature by sequencing both meiotic tetrads (13 total, 5 in great detail) and doubled haploids (DH; 10 total). The authors take great care to reduce the false positive rate for gene-conversion events, which results in a fairly limited number of events (7 validated NCO-GC events meeting all filters from the tetrads, 9 from the DH lines). They analyse the rate of GC (both CO and NCO), tract lengths, interference, relationship to genomic feature and possible motifs. Although the findings largely replicate those seen in other organisms, the demonstration in Arabidopsis is important and the experimental is carried out and analysed at a very high level."

The absence of a homologous repair template in haploid cells in G1 might lead to more (presumably error-prone) repair through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). However, it is also conceivable that the process of uni-parental genome elimination causes mutagenic stress (i.e., see <a href=\"#bib51\">Sanei et al., 2011</a>, PNAS). We have now added a sentence that clarifies this.\u2028In the original version of the manuscript we included 1-bp deletions in the calculation of the mutation rates. Excluding those (as it was done in the estimation of the wild-type mutation rate (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ossowski et al, 2010</a>, Science)) decreased our estimation slightly, but it is still more than 1.5 times higher as compared to published rates. Like for the original calculations this observation does not reveal a statistically significant difference."

However among these eight mutations were 6 transitions and 2 transversions. This fits to the enrichment of transitions among spontaneous mutations, which was reported earlier (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ossowski et al, 2010</a>, Science). We mention this in the updated version of the manuscript."
