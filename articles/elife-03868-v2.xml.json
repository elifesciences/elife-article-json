Sleep deprivation following an associative learning task impairs consolidated memory in <i>Drosophila</i>, rodents, and humans whereas sleep immediately after a learning task actually improves consolidated memory across the same broad range of organisms (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Donlea et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Diekelmann, 2014</a>). It is not, however, clear exactly how sleep promotes memory consolidation: it may simply be a permissive state generated by other brain regions that prevents sensory interference with memory circuits, or alternatively the memory circuitry itself may actively participate in sleep promotion as an integral aspect of the consolidation process. To begin to probe these issues, we have investigated the role of the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, which are critical to memory consolidation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, in the regulation of sleep."

The mushroom bodies (MBs) are a set of ca. 5000 neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, organized into five distinct lobular neuropils, which are required for odor memory acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval. Although the anatomy involved in memory consolidation in mammals is highly complex and distributed, in the fly it is quite compact: the DPM neurons, a single pair of neurons innervating all of the MB lobes, are the mediators of consolidation for odor memories (<a href=\"#bib99\">Waddell et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Keene et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Yu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</a>).

Loss of MB 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#bib110\">Yuan et al., 2006</a>) as well as alterations in MB PKA activity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Joiner et al., 2006</a>) and neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib75\">Pitman et al., 2006</a>) have been shown to affect sleep in <i>Drosophila</i> in a lobe-specific manner. Mutation of the <i>amnesiac (amn)</i> gene, which encodes a putative neuropeptide expressed in DPM neurons (<a href=\"#bib99\">Waddell et al., 2000</a>), results in fragmented sleep and impaired sleep rebound following deprivation, suggesting a role for these cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Liu et al., 2008</a>). While the molecular and cellular requirements for sleep and memory clearly overlap, whether the circuit that regulates sleep is identical to that required for memory is not clear and this is a question that bears directly on the functional interrelationship between sleep and memory consolidation."

The DPM contribution to memory consolidation had been suggested to occur due to the release of acetylcholine (ACh) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Keene et al., 2004</a>) and the product of the <i>amn</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib99\">Waddell et al., 2000</a>) enhancing MB potentiation via an excitatory feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib109\">Yu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Keene and Waddell, 2007</a>) similar to what has been proposed to occur in the mammalian hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hebb, 1949</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hopfield, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amit, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Treves and Rolls, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Battaglia and Treves, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Lisman, 1999</a>). Recently, however, DPM release of serotonin (5HT) has been shown to promote anesthesia resistant memory, a form of consolidated memory, by acting on G\u03b1<sub>i</sub>-coupled 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes of the MBs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lee et al., 2011</a>). The involvement of a potentially inhibitory receptor, 5HT<sub>1A</sub>, in consolidation suggests that a simple positive feedback model for consolidation is unlikely to be completely correct, and it highlights the fact that there is currently no information on the functional nature of the synapses between DPM neurons and MBs. An understanding of this synapse is critical for elucidating DPM's role in sleep. To address this aspect of DPM function, we have investigated the nature of their connection to the MBs."

We suggest a model in which post-synaptic MB \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons are wake-promoting, and inhibition by DPM neuron GABA and 5HT release during memory consolidation results in increased sleep. These findings provide new insight into the functional relationship between sleep and memory consolidation, and suggest an important role for inhibitory neurotransmission in regulating these processes."

A temperature shift at ZT0 from 22\u00b0C, a temperature at which dTrpA1 is inactive, to 31\u00b0C, where it is open and can depolarize DPMs, produced an immediate and dramatic increase in sleep (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). dTrpA1 activation with a weaker, but even more specific DPM driver line, <i>VT64246-GAL4</i>, also resulted in immediate and significant increases in sleep (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,C</a>) indicating the effect is due to activation of DPM neurons and not other neurons in the <i>NP2721-GAL4</i> expression pattern. Activating DPMs with dTrpA1 did not alter the level of locomotor activity during waking periods (light period of first day: P<sub>GAL4</sub> = 0.57, P<sub>UAS</sub>&lt;0.0001 and for the dark period of first day: P<sub>GAL4</sub> = 0.5, P<sub>UAS</sub> = 0.13), suggesting that this treatment does not cause locomotor impairment. Additionally, video recordings at 0-2 min and &gt;2 hr after DPM activation at 31\u201332\u00b0C show that flies are immediately arousable by gentle tapping and have normal geotaxis and locomotion, consistent with DPM activation inducing a sleep state rather than paralysis or locomotor dysfunction (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

The negative sleep rebound after release is consistent with the presence of strong compensatory homeostatic mechanisms counteracting excessive sleep (<a href=\"#bib82\">Shang et al., 2013</a>) and/or excessive DPM activity. Since DPM neurons are normally activated in the first 0\u20133 hr following training (<a href=\"#bib109\">Yu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cervantes-Sandoval and Davis, 2012</a>), it is unlikely that these neurons would ever naturally exhibit such high levels of activity for the length of time we have imposed artificially. The immediate increase in sleep upon dTrpA1 activation is most likely to be indicative of normal DPM function. The idea that DPMs can act acutely is in agreement with the literature that shows there is a temporally circumscribed window during which they are required for consolidation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Keene et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Yu et al., 2005</a>) and with the finding that a short period (45 min) of TrpM8 activation of DPM neurons following a learning task rescues age-induced memory impairment (<a href=\"#bib93\">Tonoki and Davis, 2012</a>)."

In order to assess this, we used the <i>NP2721-GAL4</i> line to drive expression of a temperature-sensitive, dominant negative Dynamin, Shibire<sup>ts</sup> (Shi<sup>ts</sup>) to block vesicle recycling in DPMs. Following a shift at ZT0 from the permissive temperature of 18\u00b0C, to the restrictive temperature of 31\u00b0C, flies showed a small but significant decrease in levels of nighttime sleep relative to the baseline sleep of each genotype at 18\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B1</a>). Because the temperature shift protocol induced changes in the baseline nighttime sleep of control flies (compare \u2018baseline\u2019 and \u2018recovery\u2019 days in panel B1) we asked if the ability of DPM inhibition to decrease nighttime sleep was independent of baseline by doing a second round of temperature shift (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B2</a>). We found that DPM inhibition decreased sleep regardless of the starting baseline. We obtained a similar result using another DPM line, <i>C316-GAL4</i> to drive Shi<sup>ts</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Additionally, when the weaker, but cleaner, <i>VT64246-GAL4</i> driver line was used with the temperature-sensitive repressor, <i>Tubulin-GAL80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup>, to produce acute expression of the hyperpolarizing potassium channel Kir2.1 in DPM neurons nighttime sleep was also reduced (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,D</a>)."

The limitation of the DPM loss-of-function phenotype to nighttime sleep implies there is a baseline function of DPM activity that occurs even in isolated animals in a relatively stimulus-poor environment, but the small magnitude of these changes suggests that DPMs are not the major driver of baseline sleep. The DPM-dependent gain-of-function experiments with dTrpA1, however, indicate that significant changes in both nighttime and daytime sleep can be produced with acute activation of DPM neurons, as might perhaps naturally occur secondary to some type of experience."

It was possible that sleep gains resulting from dTrpA1-mediated activation of DPMs were not due to neurotransmitter release from DPMs themselves, but instead were a secondary result of gap\u2013junction coupled APL activation and neurotransmitter release. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we coexpressed dTrpA1 and the temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutant, Shi<sup>ts</sup>, in DPM neurons. Since Shi<sup>ts</sup> protein and mRNA are unlikely to pass through gap junctions, DPM-Shi<sup>ts</sup> expression should prevent neurotransmitter release in a cell-autonomous manner from DPM, but not affect APL neurons. Thus, if dTrpA1-mediated sleep gains are the result of DPM, but not APL neurotransmitter release, they should be blocked by the coexpression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPMs at high temperature. Conversely, if APL neurotransmitter release is responsible for sleep gains resulting from DPM activation, DPM expression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> should have no effect on dTrpA1-evoked sleep. We found that coexpression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> completely blocked activity-induced sleep gains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This was not due to dilution of GAL4-mediated expression since the coexpression of a neutral second UAS transgene (UAS-GCaMP6) did not block dTrpA1-stimulated sleep (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This suggests that sleep from dTrpA1-mediated DPM activation is the result of release of neurotransmitter from DPMs, not APLs."

Both DPM and \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 activity are required during the memory consolidation period 0\u20133 hr after training for the storage of subsequent 24 hr long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib50\">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</a>). Recently, multiple groups have posited that <i>Drosophila</i> experiences a form of systems consolidation, similar to that of mammals, in which memories are transferred from a set of neurons serving as a short-term storage site (e.g., the hippocampus in mammals, and \u03b3 and \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 lobes in flies) to a different set of neurons which store the memory in a more stable long-term state (e.g., the cortex in mammals, \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes and MB output neurons in flies) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dubnau and Chiang, 2013</a>). Since systems consolidation in <i>Drosophila</i> requires DPM and \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 activity and is known to be promoted by sleep in other organisms, we reasoned that \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 activity may also play a role in promoting sleep. While it has been shown previously that the <i>Drosophila</i> MB can promote sleep (<a href=\"#bib44\">Joiner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Pitman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Yi et al., 2013</a>), a specific role for the \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 lobes has not been reported."

If DPM neurons act to excite \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019, as postulated by models of consolidation, we would expect this manipulation to increase sleep. Instead, we see a strong decrease in nighttime sleep. This \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019\u2013dependent nighttime sleep loss remained stable throughout 48 hr of dTrpA1 activation and was accompanied by increasing daytime sleep loss which continued even after release from dTrpA1 activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). This unusual pattern exactly matches the phenotype seen in flies expressing Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPM neurons. Thus, DPM and \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 activity have opposing roles in the regulation of sleep: DPM activity promotes sleep whereas \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 activity is wake-promoting.

To test whether 5HT could be stimulatory in the MBs, we used <i>5HT7-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Becnel et al., 2011</a>) to drive expression of Epac1-camps (EPAC) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Nikolaev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Shafer et al., 2008</a>), a FRET-based cyclic nucleotide sensor. There was no expression evident in the MBs, although there was strong fluorescence in the central complex as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Becnel et al., 2011</a>). We bath-applied 5HT and saw increased cAMP in the labeled cells of the ellipsoid body, confirming the efficacy of the drug as well as the positive coupling to cyclase in 5HT7-GAL4+ cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Because the lack of <i>5HT7-GAL4</i> expression in MB does not necessarily mean there is not a stimulatory 5HT receptor expressed there, we also bath-applied 5HT to brains with EPAC driven by <i>MB247-lexA</i> to determine if there was an excitatory response from this structure. We saw no increase in cAMP (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement, 2</a>). Because EPAC may not be not effective at reporting inhibition (e.g., if there is no basal activation of cyclase), we cannot rule out inhibitory effects of 5HT via 5HT<sub>1A</sub>, which is known to be expressed in MBs (<a href=\"#bib110\">Yuan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lee et al., 2011</a>)."

This is consistent with a role of DPM neurons in inhibiting \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons in order to promote sleep and opens up the interesting possibility that there may be branch-specific neurotransmission from DPM neurons (<a href=\"#bib109\">Yu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cervantes-Sandoval and Davis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Samano et al., 2012</a>).

To test the sign of the connection, we first used functional imaging techniques to determine if DPM activation could stimulate postsynaptic MB neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We expressed the mammalian ATP-gated P2X2 receptor (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lima and Miesenbock, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Yao et al., 2012</a>) in DPMs using <i>NP2721-GAL4</i> or <i>c316-GAL4</i>, and activated these cells by applying ATP to dissected adult <i>Drosophila</i> brains. We first confirmed that bath-applied ATP was sufficient to activate the P2X2 receptors in DPMs by co-expressing genetically-encoded fluorescent sensors and using functional imaging to observe changes in fluorescence indicating a response. Using <i>c316-GAL4</i> to drive <i>UAS-GCaMP3.0</i> (<a href=\"#bib92\">Tian et al., 2009</a>), <i>UAS-Arclight</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2013</a>), and <i>UAS-Synapto-pHlorin</i> (SpH) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Meisenbock et al., 1998</a>), we found that P2X2-mediated stimulation effectively activated DPM neurons, evoking increases in intracellular calcium, membrane voltage, and vesicle fusion, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). It should be noted that these responses were observed in the DPM projections to the MBs, not the DPM cell bodies, demonstrating that this technique successfully activates the DPMs and causes them to release neurotransmitter from their projections onto downstream targets in the MB neuropil. We also co-expressed P2X2 receptors and <i>UAS-GCaMP3.0</i> in the DPMs using <i>NP2721-GAL4</i> to confirm that this technique was effective with the weaker driver (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Small molecules including neurotransmitters can pass through gap junctions (<a href=\"#bib97\">Vaney et al., 1998</a>) and, for some subtypes of mammalian connexins, even RNAi fragments can pass (<a href=\"#bib95\">Valiunas et al., 2005</a>). This raised the possibility that DPM sleep phenotypes could be dependent on APL-synthesized GABA and that manipulation of VGAT in DPMs might be indirectly acting by inhibition of APL GABA packaging. In order to assess this, we expressed <i>VGAT-RNAi</i> using three different APL <i>GAL4</i> lines: <i>GH146, NP5288, NP2631</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We never saw sleep loss with <i>NP2631-GAL4</i>. With <i>GH146</i>- and <i>NP5288-GAL4</i>, we saw weak nighttime sleep loss. When it was observed, nighttime sleep loss due to APL-driven expression of VGAT-RNAi was generally accompanied by an increase in activity while awake indicating an effect on locomotion; this is never seen with VGAT-RNAi in DPMs. Thus while APL GABA may be weakly sleep-promoting, its effects are qualitatively and quantitatively distinct from GABA released from DPMs. This also implies that the contribution of APLs to phenotypes seen after DPM activation or hyperpolarization is likely to be minimal. Along these lines it is also important to note that driving Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPMs reduces baseline sleep and completely blocks dTrpA1-induced sleep gains. These manipulations, using DPM-expressed Shi<sup>ts</sup>, would not be expected to influence APL activity in any way, again supporting the idea that DPMs promote sleep in a distinct and cell-autonomous manner."

Knockdown of 5HT synthesis in DPM neurons with RNAi targeted against tryptophan hydroxylase (Trh) using the most strongly expressing DPM line, <i>c316-GAL4</i>, results in a significant loss of nighttime sleep (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

The wake-promoting phenotype of MB \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons as well as a shared temporal role in memory consolidation suggest these neurons could be the targets of sleep-promoting DPM GABA release. In order to test this possibility, we expressed RNAi against <i>Drosophila</i> GABA receptors in MB \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons. It has previously been shown that the <i>Drosophila</i> ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, Rdl, is highly expressed in all lobes of the MBs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Liu et al., 2007</a>). Consistent with the phenotype of DPM VGAT knockdown, we observe decreased nighttime sleep with knockdown of either Rdl (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), or GABA<sub>B</sub>-R3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) in MB \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons. In both cases sleep loss is the result of a decrease in the duration of nighttime sleep episodes. Knockdown of Rdl results in less total sleep loss since an increase in the total number of nighttime sleep episodes partially compensates for the decrease in mean sleep episode duration. Importantly, concurrent expression of the <i>MB-GAL80</i> transgene, which blocks GAL4-mediated expression of receptor RNAis, greatly suppresses sleep loss and fragmentation phenotypes showing that the effects are specific to the MB \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 lobes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, experiments to determine the lobe-specific role of 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors suggest that 5HT acts generally in the MB, not just on the \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 lobes (data not shown), suggesting that these two transmitters may play somewhat different roles at the circuit level in sleep and memory consolidation."

APL GABA has been shown to inhibit acquisition (<a href=\"#bib61\">Liu and Davis, 2009</a>), perhaps by acting at the level of olfactory coding (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2014</a>). APLs have also been shown to be critical for a labile component of anesthesia-sensitive intermediate-term memory but not for consolidation to long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib74\">Pitman et al., 2011</a>). Because of the gap junction coupling, it was formally possible that GABA found in DPMs could be coming from APLs and that sleep loss due to DPM VGAT-RNAi expression was the result of reductions in APL VGAT levels (<a href=\"#bib97\">Vaney et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Valiunas et al., 2005</a>). It was also possible that phenotypes seen after manipulation of DPM electrical activity were secondary to changes in APL activity. However, a number of lines of evidence suggest that DPM neurons are intrinsically GABAergic and sleep-promoting independent of APLs. First, we find that DPMs stain positively for the GABAergic markers Gad1 and VGAT, meaning that DPMs intrinsically possess the ability to synthesize and release GABA. Second, we find that direct expression of <i>VGAT-RNAi</i> in APL neurons has a relatively minor effect on sleep as compared to phenotypes seen with expression in DPMs, indicating that GABA endogenous to DPMs is a more significant regulator of sleep than GABA from APLs. Third, we find that sleep loss due to VGAT-RNAi expression in APLs, when it is seen, is accompanied by increases in nighttime activity while awake, which is never seen with DPM-driven VGAT-RNAi expression. This indicates that although APL GABA may promote sleep in its own right, the APL VGAT-RNAi sleep loss phenotype is distinct from that of DPMs. Fourth, expression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPMs, a manipulation that should have no effect on APL activity since it does not alter the electrical properties of DPMs, results in the same nighttime sleep loss as DPM-driven <i>VGAT-RNAi</i> and Kir2.1. Fifth, coexpression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> along with dTrpA1 in DPMs, a manipulation that should not affect APL neurotransmitter release, results in a complete blockade of activation-induced sleep gains. The most parsimonious explanation for all of these data is that the relevant effect of these manipulations is a change in transmitter release specifically from DPMs and that this bidirectionally modulates sleep. Thus, while it remains possible that APL neurons are modestly sleep-promoting in their own right, we find strong evidence for an independent and significant role in regulation of sleep by DPM neurons."

Our observations using SuperClomeleon demonstrate that DPMs evoke a chloride increase in MB neurons, but we did not see decreases in calcium, membrane voltage or cAMP after DPM activation using fluorescent sensors specific for those cellular parameters. This failure is not surprising for two reasons. First, in order to see an inhibitory response it is likely that there has to be some activity or tone in the system. In cases where MB inhibition has been seen with GCaMP it is always in context of a temporally controlled acute activation of the system (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lei et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2014</a>). Second, the nature of our DPM activation (bath application of ATP) would make it difficult to see small inhibitory changes over noise in averaged data since our activation of cells is not cleanly time-locked due to differences in diffusion of ATP into the brain between experiments. This is particularly critical with a sensor like Arclight where the expected hyperpolarization induced by inhibition might only be a few millivolts as opposed to 10\u201340 mV for depolarization by an action potential."

Thus, suppression of DPM synaptic release (Shi<sup>ts</sup>), DPM electrical activity (Kir2.1) and DPM GABA release (<i>VGAT-RNAi</i>) all result in nighttime sleep loss phenotypes nearly identical to dTrpA1 activation of \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 or loss of \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 GABA receptors.

First, are DPMs the only sleep-inducing regulators of MB activity? This seems unlikely, since memory consolidation is but one function of the MBs and there are other behavioral situations in which an animal might want to modulate MB-regulated arousal such as during courtship/aggressive behaviors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Sakai and Kitamoto, 2006</a>), or more generally during the integration of internal and external cues and decision making (<a href=\"#bib112\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Neckameyer and Matsuo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Donlea et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bracker et al., 2013</a>).

Our data suggest a role for DPMs in maintaining basal levels of nighttime sleep indicating that they may be responsive to other types of input. An understanding of the regulation of DPMs and their in vivo activity patterns will be required to gain insight into these issues."

Long-term memory storage in mammals is believed to involve a transfer of information from one brain region to another. In <i>Drosophila</i>, it is associated with sequential potentiation of activity in specific MB neuropils. Elegant studies using conditional inhibition of transmitter release have provided a temporal ordering of transfer (<a href=\"#bib47\">Keene and Waddell, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dubnau and Chiang, 2013</a>) leading to the idea that the role of DPM neurons is to facilitate the movement of memory from \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 lobes, one initial site of memory storage, to a more permanent home in \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes and perhaps other neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Given the clear requirements for molecular pathways associated with synaptic potentiation, and the need for synaptic transmission from both DPMs and \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons after acquisition, the view that information transfer involves a positive feedback loop between these cell types makes sense."

It is clear that potentiated output from \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons is required for consolidation, so how could their inhibition facilitate this process? Our findings suggest DPMs are unlikely to participate directly in the excitatory arm of a recurrent feedback loop. However, both models and physiological data related to mammalian cortical/hippocampal recurrent feedback circuits involved in the maintenance of stable memory states also require the presence of inhibition (<a href=\"#bib12\">Buzsaki and Chrobak, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hasselmo et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Battaglia and Treves, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chance and Abbott, 2000</a>). Interestingly, the coordination of excitatory activity amongst diverse functional sub-circuits in the mammalian hippocampus and neocortex is regulated by the activity of broadly-projecting, gap-junction coupled inhibitory neurons/networks (<a href=\"#bib32\">Freund and Antal, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Gibson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tamas et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baude et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Jinno et al., 2007</a>) which have been proposed to potentially control the timing of memory replay events during sleep/memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib98\">Viney et al., 2013</a>). The DPM-APL network may represent an analogous set of neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> which function to coordinate the temporal stabilization, gating and transfer of different memory stages between different sub-circuits within the MBs. While APL neurons have been shown to broadly inhibit recurrent feedback from all MB Kenyon cells to all MB Kenyon cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2014</a>), it has been proposed that DPMs may impose a directionality on internal MB feedback which would allow for memory transfer and consolidation (<a href=\"#bib109\">Yu et al., 2005</a>). Although, inhibition was not previously considered for such a role, it may be capable of coordinating the timing of prime lobe output in a way that is not possible via excitation. Thus, our data are not inconsistent with the presence of an excitatory recurrent feedback loop within the MB \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 lobes, but rather provide information that constrains future models in a new way and suggests new possibilities for the role of DPMs that may not have been considered previously."

One idea is that temporally-regulated inhibition of potentiated \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 output could serve as a way of sharpening the transition of memory from one neuropil to another by suppressing activity in the brain area from which information has already been transferred. A second possibility is that a period of inhibition during consolidation is a way of preventing new, potentially interfering, information from being encoded in \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 before the first memory is transferred to \u03b1/\u03b2. A third possibility is that the function of inhibition is actually to provide precisely timed rebound excitation to \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019. This would not have been seen in our imaging experiments due to the slow kinetics of ATP washout, but could actually result in feedback excitation of MB neurons."

It is important to note that none of these ideas is inconsistent with the demonstrated requirement for \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 activity during the post-training consolidation period.

Inhibition is often modulatory rather than switch-like and can even be compartment-specific\u2014for example, it could serve to alter the ratio of activity in \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 to that in \u03b1/\u03b2. More precise mapping of the connectivity and branch-specific activity in the MB neuropil will be required to develop a more detailed model."

This study is the first demonstration of a cellular- and circuit-level mechanism for the coupling of sleep and consolidation. The fact that memory and sleep are behaviorally linked even in the insect (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Donlea et al., 2011</a>) is evidence of the evolutionary importance of coupling these two processes. The simplicity of the cellular mechanism in <i>Drosophila</i>, using a single pair of neurons to carry out both functions, provides an example of how coupling can occur in a small nervous system and suggests a template for understanding it in larger brains."

The effect of heat on sleep is highly sensitive to genotype. In order to assess heat-induced changes in sleep, first, the baseline sleep of each fly at either 18\u00b0C or 22\u00b0C was subtracted from sleep of the same fly at 31\u00b0C and this difference was averaged together across flies of the same genotype.

Background was subtracted from all confocal stacks prior to further processing. All images are sums or maximum intensity Z-projections of the relevant confocal slices. Quantification of cells with positive/negative staining was done by visually comparing colocalization of GFP and antibody staining in multiple individual Z-slices. Cell bodies/MB lobe sets where high background prevented interpretation of staining were excluded. For the images presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, Intensity Correlation Analysis (ICA) was also performed to assess spatial colocalization of staining between channels (<a href=\"#bib54\">Li et al., 2004</a>). Rather than only comparing visible overlap of the absolute fluorescence intensity in each channel (red plus green equals yellow), which is subject to viewer bias and differences in staining intensity between channels, this method determines whether changes in staining intensity covary or are correlated between channels. This provides an objective and spatially specific representation of colocalization. ICA analysis generates a correlation/colocalization value for each pixel defined by the Product of the Differences from the Mean (PDM) that is, PDM= (red intensity- mean red intensity) \u00d7 (green intensity \u2013 mean green intensity). PDM values for each pixel can then be visualized as an image showing positive intensity correlation (PDM&gt;0) and negative intensity correlation (PDM&lt;0). Relative PDM value scales are shown on each figure generated from ICA analysis."

Dissected brains were then pinned to a layer of Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) silicone under a small bath of AHL contained within a recording/perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Brains expressing GCaMP3.0, Arclight, and SpH were allowed to settle for 5 min after dissection to reduce movement. These brains were then exposed to fluorescent light for approximately 30 s before imaging to allow for baseline fluorescence stabilization, while brains expressing the FRET sensors Epac1-camps or SuperClomeleon were exposed an extra 5 min to minimize differences in photobleaching rates between the CFP and YFP fluorophores, as YFP has been described to photobleach more slowly than CFP (<a href=\"#bib81\">Shafer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Pirez et al., 2013</a>). Perfusion flow was established over the brain with a gravity-fed ValveLink perfusion system (Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA). ATP, CCh, GABA, or 5HT were delivered by switching perfusion flow from the main AHL line to another channel containing diluted compound after 30 s of baseline recording for desired durations followed by a return to AHL flow. To control for the effects of switching channels, a vehicle control trial was performed by switching to another line containing AHL for the same duration as the experimental trial."

For GCaMP3.0, Arclight, and SpH imaging, we used the following filter set (Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT): excitation, HQ470/x40; dichroic, Q495LP; emission, HQ525/50m. For EPAC and SuperClomeleon, a 86002v1 JP4 (436; Chroma Technology) excitation filter was used, and emitted light from the CFP and YFP flurophores was separated using a splitter (Photometrics DV<sup>2</sup> column) with the emissions filters D480/30m and D535/40m (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), which allowed for simultaneous collection from both fluorescence channels. Frames were captured at 2 Hz with 4\u00d7 binning for either 2 min or 4 min using <i>\u00b5</i>Manager acquisition software (<a href=\"#bib28\">Edelstein et al., 2010</a>).

Activation wavelengths for ChR2 overlap with those of many fluorescent sensors such as GCaMP and EPAC, so ChR2 could not be used in this circuit due to the close proximity of the cells and processes. Applying heat to activate dTrpA1 causes changes in refractive index, which disrupt focus, necessitating manual focus correction in the cases where we used this technique."

Figures depict responses in horizontal lobes or projections; however, similar results were observed in the vertical lobes when noted in the figure captions. For recordings using GCaMP3.0, Arclight, and SpH, ROIs were analyzed using custom software developed in ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a> and National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Briefly, the percent change in fluorescence over time was calculated using the following formula: \u0394F/F = (F<sub>n</sub> \u2013 F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> \u00d7 100%, where F<sub>n</sub> is the fluorescence at time point n, and F<sub>0</sub> is the fluorescence at time 0. For GCaMP3.0 and SpH, maximum fluorescence change values were determined as the maximum percentage change observed for each trace over the entire duration of each imaging experiment. For Arclight, because increases in voltage are represented as decreases in fluorescence, maximum fluorescence change values were determined as the minimum percentage change. Maximum values for each group were then averaged to calculate the mean maximum change from baseline."

Our method avoids this pitfall, and we believe it is a more accurate representation of the changes that occur after a temperature shift. This method is not all that unusual. In fact, our analysis method is identical to what has been published by others (including <a href=\"#bib44\">Joiner et al., 2006</a>) except that in our case, sleep changes are expressed as minutes of sleep gained or lost vs. controls rather than as a percent change from controls. The final step of dividing the sleep of the experimental group by that of each control group used by other groups does not change the control or experimental data distributions or relative differences between them since both the experimental and control groups are divided by the control group values. It is simply an additional scaling step that converts minutes of sleep lost or gained into a net percentage.

Importantly however, if you apply a second heat treatment, you still get a relative sleep loss in the experimental line if you now use that first recovery day (Day 3) as the baseline for the second heating period (Day 4/5). We find that this particular double heating treatment also appears to result in daytime sleep gains, but this is likely due to the sleep loss occurring during the daytime on the day used as a baseline (Day 3). This sleep loss likely reflects an ongoing suppression of the DPMs (note it is also seen in new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

The effect on day/night 2 should be quantified and shown in the main figure in the body of the manuscript. Further, the data for day/night 4 and 5 suggest a very small effect. All these data need to be shown in the main body of</i> <a href=\"#fig1\"><i>Figure 1</i></a> <i>(instead of the current version of</i> <a href=\"#fig1\"><i>Figure 1B</i></a><i>), and the magnitude of this effect should be noted and discussed in the text. Further, it is very important that the statistical significance of the proposed effect in these new data can be evaluated and reported</i>."

It turns out that both the first and second temperature shifts caused small but statistically significant sleep loss, indicating that the aberrant behaviour of the GAL4 control\u2019s baseline was immaterial to the original finding."

In the end, we decided that, for the sake of clarity, we would deviate from your request in one respect: we left the original <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> data in as <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>1 with the control experiment as <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B2</a>. This allowed us to explain in text the rationale for the two heat cycles and make a stronger point that while the night-time sleep changes with DPM inactivation are very small, they are independent of pre-inactivation baseline (first vs. second heat cycle with <i>NP2721</i>), GAL4 driver (<i>NP2721-GAL4</i> in original <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and new c316 data), and activity manipulation (Shi<sup>ts</sup> and Kir, which was in the previous version of the paper as a <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>)."

I believe it would be clearer for the reader. But given the insistence of the reviewers, the new version conforms (mostly!) to the instructions."
