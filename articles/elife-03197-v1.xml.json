No similar structure has been identified in prokaryotes. The bacteriophage-encoded tubulin PhuZ is required to position DNA at mid-cell, without which infectivity is compromised. Here, we show that PhuZ filaments, like microtubules, stochastically switch from growing in a distinctly polar manner to catastrophic depolymerization (dynamic instability) both in vitro and in vivo. One end of each PhuZ filament is stably anchored near the cell pole to form a spindle-like array that orients the growing ends toward the phage nucleoid so as to position it near mid-cell. Our results demonstrate how a bacteriophage can harness the properties of a tubulin-like cytoskeleton for efficient propagation. This represents the first identification of a prokaryotic tubulin with the dynamic instability of microtubules and the ability to form a simplified bipolar spindle."

No similar structure has been identified in prokaryotes. The bacteriophage-encoded tubulin PhuZ is required to position DNA at mid-cell, without which infectivity is compromised. Here, we show that PhuZ filaments, like microtubules, stochastically switch from growing in a distinctly polar manner to catastrophic depolymerization (dynamic instability) both in vitro and in vivo. One end of each PhuZ filament is stably anchored near the cell pole to form a spindle-like array that orients the growing ends toward the phage nucleoid so as to position it near mid-cell. Our results demonstrate how a bacteriophage can harness the properties of a tubulin-like cytoskeleton for efficient propagation. This represents the first identification of a prokaryotic tubulin with the dynamic instability of microtubules and the ability to form a simplified bipolar spindle."

At this point, the viral DNA moves towards the middle of the bacterial cell with fibers on either side of the DNA, suggesting that the fibers play a role in moving the DNA.

The polarity of the filament becomes key in its ability to specifically interact with binding partners, such as the kinetochore, and for the regulation of the filaments by microtubule accessory proteins (MAPs) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Euteneuer and McIntosh, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kitamura et al., 2010</a>).

First, we used total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy to visualize dynamics of purified PhuZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In the presence of GTP and a crowding agent to minimize filament diffusion, 2.5 \u00b5M PhuZ (20% Cy3-labeled, 80% unlabeled) that was otherwise unattached to PEG-coated coverslips, formed short dynamic filaments that translocated across the coverslip (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Many of these filaments displayed non-uniform intensity, and annealing and severing events were also observed (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), implying that many of these structures consist of at least two PhuZ filaments. The apparent motion could be the result of either diffusion near the surface or treadmilling, that is, growth at one end and depolymerization at the other. This ambiguity could be resolved by using the naturally occurring intensity variations along each filament to allow growth and shrinkage rates at each end to be quantified (n = 40) independent of any overall filament motion. This revealed that the filaments treadmill in a coordinated manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), with new filament growth at one end and depolymerization at the other. Depolymerization from these minus-ends occurred at a rate of 15 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m/min (n = 40). The large amount of heterogeneity could be due to the presence of bundles and some events being catastrophic depolymerization events from a plus-end. Thus, like MTs and actin, PhuZ filaments must be polar, with one end growing faster than the other. In a manner reminiscent of MT catastrophe, filaments were also observed to occasionally fully depolymerize (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>)."

                                "text": "To better assess the dynamics and polarity of individual growing filaments, we performed two-color TIRF microscopy of Cy3-labeled PhuZ (green) growing new polymer off of Cy5-labeled and biotinylated seeds (red) in the absence of crowding agent. To make stable seeds, 2 \u00b5M PhuZ (20% Cy5, 5% biotin, 75% unlabeled) was polymerized with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPCPP for 5 min and attached to PEG-biotin-coated coverslips via streptavidin. After 2 min, the flow chamber was subsequently washed with TIRF buffer (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) to remove unattached filaments, free monomers, and GMPCPP. Cy3-labelled PhuZ (20% Cy3, 80% unlabeled) and GTP were then added to the chamber to initiate dynamic filament formation, and dynamics were monitored at 0.25-s intervals for 100 s (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). To ensure that Cy3-PhuZ filaments would only grow from the preformed Cy5-PhuZ seeds, Cy3-PhuZ was added to the flow chamber at a concentration (1.5 \u00b5M) below the critical concentration (2.5 \u00b5M). The movies indicate that PhuZ filaments possess a distinct kinetic polarity, with growth only seen from one end, highlighted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. This is similar to, but more asymmetric than MTs(<a href=\"#bib4\">Bergen and Borisy, 1980</a>). The Cy3-PhuZ filaments elongated at a rate of 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m/min at 1.5 \u00b5M, (n = 40). This rate, when normalized for concentration, is equivalent to the growth rate of ParM filaments(<a href=\"#bib16\">Garner et al., 2004</a>), and about 6-fold faster than growing MTs(<a href=\"#bib20\">Hyman et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gupta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bode et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). After a random period of time, growing PhuZ filaments were observed to switch to rapid disassembly (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) and completely depolymerize. The remaining stabilized GMPCPP Cy5-PhuZ seed could then nucleate another round of polymerization. As shown in the kymographs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), filament depolymerization always (n = 40) went to completion and proceeded at an average rate of 108 \u00b1 20 \u00b5m/min. This rate of catastrophic depolymerization is comparable to rates observed for yeast tubulin (103 \u00b5m/min)(<a href=\"#bib18\">Gupta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bode et al., 2003</a>), but is an order of magnitude faster than that of either mammalian tubulin or ParM (13, 9.4 \u00b5m/min, respectively)(<a href=\"#bib20\">Hyman et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Garner et al., 2004</a>). The GMPCPP Cy5-seeds formed stable filaments that never disassembled (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), showing that, as with MTs, dynamic instability of PhuZ filaments requires the energy of GTP hydrolysis. PhuZ is the first prokaryotic tubulin known to display dynamic instability."

Examination of the polymerization kinetics of a catalytically inactive mutant (D190A-PhuZ) by right-angle light scattering (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) revealed that the critical concentration (320 \u00b1 20 nM) was about 10-fold lower than the 2.5 \u00b5M previously measured for wild-type PhuZ (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kraemer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zehr et al., 2014</a>). This difference is likely due to the competition between the rate of hydrolysis during transient association of longitudinal dimers (proportional to [PhuZ] (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen and Borisy, 1974</a>)) with the rate of assembly of hexameric nuclei (proportional to [PhuZ] (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984a</a>)) as well as contributions from filament turnover at steady-state due to nucleotide hydrolysis by wild-type PhuZ. Unlike wild-type PhuZ, D190A-PhuZ polymerization curves show a linear phase after the initial growth phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), likely due to increased bundling of these non-dynamic filaments. Compared with tubulin, whose GDP critical concentration is about 10x higher than with GTP (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Caplow et al., 1994</a>), PhuZ is even more discriminating, with no polymerization detectable with GDP at PhuZ concentrations as high as 200 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

To test the stability of the GDP-PhuZ lattice, excess GDP was spiked into wild type or D190A-PhuZ polymerization reactions having 100 \u00b5M GTP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Upon addition of GDP, wild-type PhuZ rapidly depolymerized, with no observable polymer detected \u223c1 min post GDP addition, while no appreciable depolymerization was observed with D190A-PhuZ (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Due to the rapid GTP hydrolysis within the lattice, only the most recently added monomers at the plus-end of the filament contain GTP. Thus, the observed rapid depolymerization after adding GDP implies the existence of a stabilizing GTP-cap that is lost upon GDP addition. The stability observed with D190A-PhuZ demonstrates that the nucleotide state of the penultimate PhuZs must be determining filament stability and not the state of the exchangeable most plus-end monomer. These observations help explain the catastrophic depolymerizations observed in our movies as the result of stochastic loss of the cap due to nucleotide hydrolysis in one or more plus end monomers."

To permit fluorescent labeling and visualization, <i>P. chlororaphis</i> cells were grown on agarose pads containing arabinose to induce production of GFP tagged PhuZ expressed from a plasmid. When GFP-PhuZ was expressed in the absence of phage infection, but at concentrations comparable to that occurring during an infection, short filaments were formed (average length of 0.9 \u00b5m, n = 1260) throughout the cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,D</a>). In time-lapse microscopy, these filaments displayed dynamic instability, undergoing periods of polymerization and depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>).

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, PhuZ formed a spindle-like structure in which a pair of bundled filaments emanated from a single location at each cell pole and extended toward the infection nucleoid at midcell. Filaments of the phage spindle were highly dynamic and could be observed to polymerize and depolymerize (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B, 5A, 5C, 5E</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Dynamics (both polymerization and depolymerization) always occurred on the nucleoid side, with the ends nearest the cell poles appearing relatively static (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and 5A</a>). While filaments in uninfected cells were located at positions throughout the cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, n = 108), the spindle vertex was almost always (83%, n = 61) stably associated with the extreme pole of the cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Kymographs of filament position over time in infected cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) suggest that the spindle vertex continuously occupies the cell poles and that the spindle arms reach toward but do not cross the central cavity of the cell occupied by the infection nucleoid. Comparisons of filament length over time in kymographs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C and 4B</a>) and the average length change per unit time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) between uninfected and infected cells suggest a stabilization of the PhuZ filament in the presence of the phage. Although our resolution does not allow us to rule out filament or bundle growth at the vertex of the spindle, one interpretation of these results is that the stabilized minus ends of the filaments are located at the cell pole during phage infection while the dynamically unstable plus ends extend toward the infection nucleoid."

Over time, the small circular mass of phage DNA increases in size and migrates toward the cell midpoint (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). After arrival at midcell, the phage nucleoid oscillates slightly about the central axis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), suggesting that the nucleoid continues to experience positioning forces. This oscillatory movement is reminiscent of eukaryotic chromosomes lined up at midcell by the mitotic spindle. In contrast to eukaryotes, where DNA replication is temporally separated from segregation, the phage nucleoid continued to increase in mass as it moved toward midcell, suggesting that DNA replication and positioning occur simultaneously."

We therefore sought to test whether replication was required, directly or indirectly, for phage DNA movement. At various points during infection we added a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor (ciprofloxacin) that blocks replication of DNA in a broad spectrum of bacteria, plasmids and phage (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alonso et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Constantinou et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fisher et al., 1989</a>). While ciprofloxacin reduced phage nucleoid size as expected, indicating a reduced accumulation of DNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), it had no effect on its positioning at midcell, suggesting that DNA replication was not required for the centering function of the PhuZ spindle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). By contrast, interfering with PhuZ filament dynamics has a marked affect on phage DNA positioning (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kraemer et al., 2012</a>)."

However, the prokaryotic cell also utilizes cytoskeletal proteins to organize internal space and efficiently execute essential life processes.

Furthermore, it assembles into a bipolar spindle that more than superficially resembles its eukaryotic counterpart. The PhuZ spindle appears to play a key role in organizing viral reproduction by positioning the phage nucleoid at midcell (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Since polar localization is phage infection-dependent, we hypothesize that a phage protein (depicted as purple triangles in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) is necessary for the organization of the spindle. Based on our long time lapse movies of complete infection cycles, a transition must occur between early un-localized pre-existing filaments to the localized polar structures seen in late infection, suggesting a clear role for anchoring. Whether the putative phage polar protein also acts to nucleate de novo filament formation or facilitate bundling is unclear. We propose that early during infection, the dynamically unstable ends of PhuZ polymers (plus ends, by analogy with tubulin) specifically interact with and move the replicating phage DNA, presumably by applying pushing forces, although this movement is independent of replication."

The first function of the eukaryotic spindle is to line up replicated chromatids at the midline of the dividing cell. Our discovery of a bacteriophage that assembles a similar structure raises the possibility that bipolar spindles arose more than once by convergent evolution taking advantage of the unique properties of tubulin polymers. Alternatively, it is also possible that phage hijacked the mitotic spindle from an ancient eukaryotic cell. However, since bacteria and phage are thought to predate eukaryotic life, an intriguing possibility is that the mitotic spindle first evolved in a bacteriophage for the purpose of positioning viral DNA during lytic growth and was later co-opted for positioning chromosomal DNA in the progenitor of the first eukaryotic cell. One can imagine that a primordial tubulin evolved to form filaments of increasing biochemical, structural, and functional complexity, beginning with single stranded protofilaments (FtsZ) required for cell division (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erickson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Meier and Goley, 2014</a>). These then evolved into multi-stranded filaments capable of segregating plasmid DNA (TubZ) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Larsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Erickson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aylett et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Oliva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Montabana and Agard, 2014</a>) and centering viral DNA (PhuZ). The increased structural and biochemical complexity, including an increase in the number of protofilaments, would allow the lattice to become more cooperative and provide a greater difference between growth and nucleation rates. This in turn would allow the lattice to become more metastable, thereby storing the greater energy necessary for more complex functions within the lattice."

Specifically, conclusions regarding dynamic instability and organization of filaments in spindle-like structures of infected cells made on the basis filament tracking data require substantiation.

The authors report that filaments of PhuZ, like eukaryotic MTs, display dynamic instability <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, and that within the bacterial cell during lytic infection, they assemble into a spindle-like structure capable of using free energy released by PhuZ polymerization to generate polar-ejection forces that push the replicating phage DNA to the center of the bacterial cell. I think this is a well-written, succinct, scientifically sound and interesting study. My only minor concern is the extent to which it advances what was published in their Cell paper, but on balance I think it does represent a sufficiently significant advance, and accordingly I recommend publication in <i>eLife</i>.

Filaments in infected cells appear tightly bundled near the poles, which would make is difficult to detect fluctuations in length of individual filaments there.

This is very nice data. However, in interpreting the <i>in vivo</i> imaging, the authors seem to ignore the possibility of minus ends shrinking. In uninfected cells, shouldn't we see some minus end shrinkage? In infected cells, their cartoon model puts in some kind of nucleating site/cap at poles that orients filaments and caps minus ends. But there is no strong support for this nucleating site from the <i>in vivo</i> imaging data. The text states that filaments are randomly oriented in uninfected cells, and bipolar in infected, but this large difference in organization is not well supported by the data provided."

For example, a spatial map of temporal variance might demonstrate in a convincing manner that fluctuations are located at random positions in uninfected cells, and concentrated at the center in infected cells. Difference imaging; subtracting frame n- from frame n- might also be beneficial in analyzing where in the cell polymerization dynamics occur. Difference imaging sometimes allows detection of fluctuations even in densely packed regions like the poles. A spatial map of average signal in difference images, which is related to an analysis of temporal variance, could be useful to map the positions in a cell where length change is occurring. More critical interpretation of imaging data is also essential. The authors must distinguish much more precisely between experimental observation and model. It's fine to propose a model that is not completely proven, but is consistent with the data. It is not ok to make statements about what has been observed when the data do not support those statements. It may be the case that the authors will have to argue their model without use of single filament tracking <i>in vivo</i>, if such tracking is simply unconvincing or impossible, as suggested by the current Movies and Figures."

For example, a spatial map of temporal variance might demonstrate in a convincing manner that fluctuations are located at random positions in uninfected cells, and concentrated at the center in infected cells. Difference imaging; subtracting frame n- from frame n- might also be beneficial in analyzing where in the cell polymerization dynamics occur. Difference imaging sometimes allows detection of fluctuations even in densely packed regions like the poles. A spatial map of average signal in difference images, which is related to an analysis of temporal variance, could be useful to map the positions in a cell where length change is occurring. More critical interpretation of imaging data is also essential. The authors must distinguish much more precisely between experimental observation and model. It's fine to propose a model that is not completely proven, but is consistent with the data. It is not ok to make statements about what has been observed when the data do not support those statements. It may be the case that the authors will have to argue their model without use of single filament tracking in vivo, if such tracking is simply unconvincing or impossible, as suggested by the current Movies and Figures</i>."

We have reworded some of our conclusions about the data to avoid confusion and convey a better sense of the unresolved issues. We agree with the reviewer that difference mapping is a powerful tool that can often eliminate some of the perils of tracking individual filaments, but the limitations of our host/phage system have complicated its use in this case. Filaments of PhuZ in infected cells are always a mixed population of labeled (from a plasmid) and unlabeled (from the phage) monomers; movement and/or exchange of the two populations of monomers within a polymer, as well as movement of the polymer itself in all three axes, leads to variations in intensity of the pixels and leads to a \u201cmaxed out\u201d standard deviation for the entire filament. We believe that traditional kymographs and tracking individual filament ends as shown in the revised figures allow for a better evaluation of the change over time for each of the filament ends."
