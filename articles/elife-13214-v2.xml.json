                    "text": "The basal forebrain (BF) plays key roles in multiple brain functions, including sleep-wake regulation, attention, and learning/memory, but the long-range connections mediating these functions remain poorly characterized. Here we performed whole-brain mapping of both inputs and outputs of four BF cell types \u2013 cholinergic, glutamatergic, and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) GABAergic neurons \u2013 in the mouse brain. Using rabies virus -mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing to label the inputs and adeno-associated virus to trace axonal projections, we identified numerous brain areas connected to the BF. The inputs to different cell types were qualitatively similar, but the output projections showed marked differences. The connections to glutamatergic and SOM+ neurons were strongly reciprocal, while those to cholinergic and PV+ neurons were more unidirectional. These results reveal the long-range wiring diagram of the BF circuit with highly convergent inputs and divergent outputs and point to both functional commonality and specialization of different BF cell types."

Here we performed whole-brain mapping of both inputs and outputs of four BF cell types \u2013 cholinergic, glutamatergic, and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) GABAergic neurons \u2013 in the mouse brain. Using rabies virus -mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing to label the inputs and adeno-associated virus to trace axonal projections, we identified numerous brain areas connected to the BF. The inputs to different cell types were qualitatively similar, but the output projections showed marked differences. The connections to glutamatergic and SOM+ neurons were strongly reciprocal, while those to cholinergic and PV+ neurons were more unidirectional. These results reveal the long-range wiring diagram of the BF circuit with highly convergent inputs and divergent outputs and point to both functional commonality and specialization of different BF cell types."

There are three major cell types spatially intermingled in the BF: cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic (<a href=\"#bib45\">Semba, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zaborszky et al., 2012</a>). Selective lesion or pharmacological manipulation of the cholinergic system is well known to affect multiple brain functions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wenk, 1997</a>). For example, 192-IgG-saporin-mediated lesion of cholinergic neurons impaired the ability of rats to discriminate between signal and non-signal visual events in an attention task (<a href=\"#bib27\">McGaughy et al., 1996</a>) and disrupted training-induced cortical map reorganization associated with motor learning (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conner et al., 2003</a>). Glutamatergic and GABAergic BF neurons are also likely to serve important functions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lin et al., 2015</a>). For example, in recent studies the activity of non-cholinergic BF neurons was found to correlate with sustained attention (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hangya et al., 2015</a>) or to encode reward and motivational salience information (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avila and Lin, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nguyen and Lin, 2014</a>), and optogenetic activation of PV+ GABAergic neurons was shown to regulate cortical gamma oscillations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). In a study on sleep-wake control, cholinergic, glutamatergic, and PV+ neuron activity was found to promote wakefulness, while SOM+ neurons promoted sleep; these four cell types form extensive but highly specific local connections with each other for brain-state regulation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). Thus, to understand the BF circuit function, it is crucial to map its inputs and outputs with cell-type specificity."

Recent advances in virus-assisted circuit tracing (<a href=\"#bib6\">Callaway and Luo, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huang and Zeng, 2013</a>) and high-throughput imaging have greatly facilitated whole-brain mapping of long-range connectivity in a cell-type-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Osten and Margrie, 2013</a>). In this study, we traced the long-range inputs and outputs of four genetically defined BF cell types. While the input distributions were similar across cell types, their output patterns showed striking differences. Our quantitative analysis of the whole-brain distributions of inputs and outputs for each BF cell type can serve as an anatomical blueprint for future studies of inter-regional pathways mediating BF functions."

First, we expressed avian-specific retroviral receptor (TVA), enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), and rabies glycoprotein (RG) specifically in each cell type by injecting two Cre-inducible AAV vectors (AAV2-EF1\u03b1-FLEX-eGFP-2a-TVA and AAV2-EF1\u03b1-FLEX-RG) into the BF of ChAT-, VGLUT2-, PV-, or SOM-Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The expression of RG was highly cell type specific and not detected in wild-type mice not expressing Cre recombinase (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Two to three weeks later, we injected a modified RV (rabies\u0394G-tdTomato+EnvA) that only infects cells expressing TVA, requires RG to spread retrogradely to presynaptic cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and contains the tdTomato transgene. After histological sectioning and fluorescence imaging, each sample was aligned to a reference atlas (Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, see Materials and methods) to facilitate 3D whole-brain visualization and quantitative comparison across brain samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The starter cells (expressing both tdTomato and eGFP) and the transsynaptically labeled presynaptic neurons (expressing tdTomato only) were identified manually, and their locations were registered in the reference atlas (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

After the injection site (identified by the existence of labeled cell bodies) and locations with known major fiber tracks were excluded, the projection to each brain area was quantified by the number of pixels occupied by the detected axons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oh et al., 2014</a>) (see Materials and methods)."

                        "text": "Parallel to the broad distribution of inputs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we found that each BF cell type also projected to a large number of brain areas (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"http://sleepcircuits.org/bf/\">http://sleepcircuits.org/bf/</a>, &gt;95% ipsilateral). Among the 12 major brain subdivisions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), the hypothalamus, pallidum, and striatum received the heaviest BF projections (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grove, 1988a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Henny and Jones, 2006</a>), while very few axons were detected in the medulla or cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Analysis at finer scales revealed high spatial specificity of the projections. For example, while several cell types projected strongly to the lateral habenula (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), few axons were detected in the immediately adjacent but anatomically distinct medial habenula (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hikosaka, 2010</a>). In addition to providing extensive inputs to the BF (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), the lateral hypothalamus was also a major recipient of BF projections (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), indicating a strong BF-hypothalamus loop that may be important for brain-state regulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brown et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jones, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Saper et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, whereas the input distributions were generally similar across BF cell types (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the output patterns showed striking differences. For example, compared to the other cell types, the projection from cholinergic neurons was much stronger in the basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and visual cortex but much weaker in the lateral hypothalamus, lateral habenula, and the ventral tegmental area (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The different projection patterns among cell types are also apparent in the 3D whole-brain view (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Our experiments confirmed many previously demonstrated connections, but with cell-type specificity and quantitative analyses at multiple spatial scales. For example, we found that cortical inputs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mesulam and Mufson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Steriade and McCarley, 2005</a>) to all four BF cell types originate primarily from the agranular insular and orbital areas of the prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). While a previous ultrastructural study failed to detect convincing synaptic contact between prefrontal axons and BF cholinergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zaborszky et al., 1997</a>), our RV-mediated transsynaptic tracing demonstrated extensive monosynaptic innervation, which was also validated by electrophysiological recordings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). These findings have important implications on how the prefrontal cortex may exert top-down control of neural processing through its projection to the BF (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sarter et al., 2001</a>). A recent study showed that cholinergic neurons in the BF are strongly activated by reinforcement signals during an auditory detection task (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hangya et al., 2015</a>). Our whole-brain mapping of their inputs provides a list of candidate neurons through which the reinforcement signals are conveyed to the BF cholinergic neurons."

A recent study has shown that cholinergic, glutamatergic, and PV+ neurons all promote wakefulness, while SOM+ neurons promote sleep (<a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). The distinct projection patterns between cholinergic and glutamatergic/PV+ neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) suggest that they preferentially regulate different brain functions during wakeful states. In a recent study, optogenetic activation of BF PV+ neurons was shown to enhance cortical gamma band oscillations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). In addition to direct projections to the cortex, our study showed extensive subcortical projections of PV neurons, which may also contribute to the regulation of cortical gamma oscillations. The output distribution of SOM+ neurons, on the other hand, was highly correlated with the input distributions of all BF cell types (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, bottom row); the broad GABAergic inhibition of these input areas by SOM+ neurons may be important for the sleep-promoting effect. Thus, while the highly convergent inputs from multiple brain areas allow a variety of sensory, motor, cognitive, and emotional signals to be integrated within the BF, the distinct projections by different cell types may enhance the versatility of the BF in coordinating diverse functions of multiple brain networks."

In the resulting binary \u2018ridge image\u2019, the number of pixels occupied by each detected axon depends on the length but not the thickness of the axon. In addition to valid axons, the ridge image also contains many noise pixels. (2) To remove the noise pixels due to the general background in the fluorescence image, we set a threshold based on the intensity distribution of the original image, and use this as a mask to remove the noise pixels in the ridge image obtained from step (1). (3) To remove the discrete noise pixels with fluorescence intensities higher than the general background (thus not removed by step 2), we first identified pixels that are spatially contiguous in the ridge image, computed the size of each contiguous region, and removed the regions below a threshold size. Steps 2 and 3 were repeated until satisfactory detection results were achieved. (4) The results were then visually inspected and the remaining noise pixels, which were mostly artifacts introduced during brain tissue processing, were rejected manually."

Therefore, it is unclear how much of the mapping is specific. Besides quantification and better discussion of the extent of the leakage, the reviewers suggest that the study may be more suitable for publication if the mapping could be done with a more specific virus. Alternatively, or in addition, each proposed projection could be validated by expressing ChR2 in the presynaptic cell, and recording from the genetically defined postsynaptic cell. Either of these experiments would require a substantial amount of work in our opinion, and therefore, as per <i>eLife</i>'s policy, the study cannot be accepted."

For example, in the graphic showing inputs to ChAT cells, the \"Basic cell groups and regions\" lists 98.55% total inputs (it is understood from the legend of Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 that some inputs come from unnamed sub-regions, though this could be mentioned in the main text). However, The 2nd level of the sunburst plot only includes \"Brain stem\" at 28.97% and \"Cerebrum\" at 64.80% \u2013 which sum to only 93.77%, not 98.44. As result, subsequent rings represent much more of the sunburst plot than the percentage would indicate \u2013 e.g. Inputs to ChAT neurons from Cerebral nuclei make up only 42.03% of the inputs, but well more than half of the sunburst plot. At a minimum this discrepancy needs to be better explained. Ideally, the sunburst plot would include an \"un-named region\" category, so that the graphic matches the percentage."

The authors state that the use of GAD2-Cre mice \"is likely to cause an overestimate of the exclusion zone\"; this is plausible in the case of the PV-Cre and SOM-Cre lines, but not necessarily in the case of the Vglut2-Cre ones. It is known that EnvA-enveloped rabies virus can directly (non-transsynaptically) retrogradely infect TVA-expressing neurons projecting to an injection site (Huang &amp; Hantman 2013). In the worst case in the present study, direct retrograde infection of neurons projecting to the injection site by the TVA AAV could allow direct retrograde infection of them by the RV, in the absence of G expression. The authors should redo these controls (e.g., omitting only the RV G AAV) in the four Cre lines used for the rest of the paper.

The major concern is whether our input mapping was specific to each targeted cell type, given rabies infection of cells without Cre at the injection site (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In fact, this issue is common to most of the published studies using rabies (RVdG)-based input tracing (Beier et al., 2015; Menegas et al., 2015; Miyamichi et al., 2013; Ogawa et al., 2014; Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014; Wall et al., 2013; Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012; Weissbourd et al., 2014), but the potential contamination of traced input neurons can be minimized as long as the results are interpreted based on proper control experiments, which are shown in our <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. As demonstrated in previous studies, specificity of the starter cells (which must express both TVA and RG to allow rabies virus infection and transsynaptic spread) is ensured by the highly specific Cre/loxP recombination system (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012). However, due to the extremely efficient interaction between TVA and EnvA-pseudotyped rabies virus, the very low-level expression of TVA in non-Cre-expressing cell types (not detectable based on fluorescent protein markers) allows rabies virus to infect these cells and label them with tdTomato at the injection site. Importantly, this issue does not compromise the mapping of long-range inputs because, due to the highly specific Cre/loxP recombination system, RG (required for transsynaptic spread of RV) is not expressed in any non-Cre-expressing cells at sufficient levels for trans-complementation of RVdG to allow transsynaptic spread of RV(Callaway and Luo, 2015; Miyamichi et al., 2013). Thus, while this rabies-based method should not be used for tracing local inputs near the injection site (excluded in our study), the standard practice for tracing long-range inputs is to determine the spatial extent of the local contamination using the control experiment without RG and exclude this region when analyzing the long-range inputs. This is exactly the purpose of the control experiments shown in our <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, which are similar to or more rigorous than those performed by previous studies using the same approach (Beier et al., 2015; Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014; Wall et al., 2013; Weissbourd et al., 2014).

For example, in the graphic showing inputs to ChAT cells, the \"Basic cell groups and regions\" lists 98.55% total inputs (it is understood from the legend of Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 that some inputs come from unnamed sub-regions, though this could be mentioned in the main text). However, The 2nd level of the sunburst plot only includes \"Brain stem\" at 28.97% and \"Cerebrum\" at 64.80% \u2013 which sum to only 93.77%, not 98.44. As result, subsequent rings represent much more of the sunburst plot than the percentage would indicate \u2013 e.g. Inputs to ChAT neurons from Cerebral nuclei make up only 42.03% of the inputs, but well more than half of the sunburst plot.

The original visualization code calculated the sector size by summing the signals only from the named children structures and ignoring the un-named regions, which causes a mismatch in the actual percentage and the sector size. Since this representation is likely to cause confusion and apparent discrepancy as the reviewer pointed out, we have modified the code such that a white sector was included in each level of the sunburst to represent signals from un-named regions, and the sector size matches the percentage of each structure in the new version."
