Thus, spread of potential pathogens among hospitalized infants is of great concern. Here, we reconstructed hundreds of high-quality genomes of microorganisms that colonized co-hospitalized premature infants, assessed their metabolic potential, and tracked them over time to evaluate bacterial strain dispersal among infants. We compared microbial communities in infants who did and did not develop necrotizing enterocolitis. Surprisingly, while potentially pathogenic bacteria of the same species colonized many infants, our genome-resolved analysis revealed that strains colonizing each baby were typically distinct. In particular, no strain was common to all infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The paucity of shared gut colonizers suggests the existence of significant barriers to the spread of bacteria among infants. Importantly, we demonstrate that strain-resolved comprehensive community analysis can be accomplished on potentially medically relevant time scales."

Thus, spread of potential pathogens among hospitalized infants is of great concern. Here, we reconstructed hundreds of high-quality genomes of microorganisms that colonized co-hospitalized premature infants, assessed their metabolic potential, and tracked them over time to evaluate bacterial strain dispersal among infants. We compared microbial communities in infants who did and did not develop necrotizing enterocolitis. Surprisingly, while potentially pathogenic bacteria of the same species colonized many infants, our genome-resolved analysis revealed that strains colonizing each baby were typically distinct. In particular, no strain was common to all infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The paucity of shared gut colonizers suggests the existence of significant barriers to the spread of bacteria among infants. Importantly, we demonstrate that strain-resolved comprehensive community analysis can be accomplished on potentially medically relevant time scales."

Recent data indicate that \u223c7% of infants born weighing &lt;1.5 kg develop NEC (<a href=\"#bib44\">Neu and Walker, 2011</a>). Various observations support a microbial role in NEC, including the high incidence of pneumatosis intestinalis (gas in the bowel wall) in affected infants and resolution of symptoms in a majority of patients after antibiotic therapy and bowel rest (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grave et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Morowitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Carlisle and Morowitz, 2013</a>). NEC is characterized by intestinal inflammation and commonly progresses to necrosis, sepsis, and death. Risk factors may include feeding with artificial infant formula, blood transfusion, infant genetics, and overall health status (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mally et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schnabl et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Neu and Walker, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wan-Huen et al., 2013</a>). Such factors might be expected to give rise to a fairly constant disease incidence rate. However, NEC is commonly reported to occur in outbreaks (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boccia et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Meinzen-Derr et al., 2009</a>), suggesting involvement of a contagious microorganism. A review of 17 published outbreaks of NEC did not identify a reproducible pattern of bacterial infection (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boccia et al., 2001</a>)."

Applied to series of samples, the approach can document shifts in community structure and identify responses to medical treatments, increasing age, altered diet, and changing health status. Unlike 16S rRNA gene surveys, metagenomics does not rely on previously established information (e.g. conserved sequences that guide PCR-based rRNA-based detection) and is less likely to miss community members (e.g. organisms with unusual rRNA sequences, phage, and plasmids). Compared to cultivation-based methods, the metagenomic approach provides a relatively unbiased view of community composition and thus may be particularly helpful when an unknown microorganism is the cause of a disease (<a href=\"#bib51\">Relman, 2011</a>). A year ago, the power of such an approach was demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of banked samples from patients affected during a 2011 outbreak of a severe diarrheal illness caused by Shiga-toxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Loman et al., 2013</a>).

Here, we investigated the degree to which specific microbial strains were shared among co-hospitalized infants and whether the disease could be attributed to a single infectious agent. Because the analysis required confirmation that the same strain was present in multiple infants, we deployed a genome-resolved sequencing-based approach. Our analyses included consideration of the fastest evolving features of genomes (e.g. prophage and the CRISPR/Cas loci) to maximize strain resolution. We also investigated strain-level metabolic potential and evaluated population heterogeneity for one abundant and widespread species. Genome-resolved approaches are typically slow and bioinformatics intensive because the data sizes are massive, simultaneous reconstruction of genomes for multiple community members is complex, and comparative and metabolic analyses for hundreds of genomes are challenging. We applied a new analysis system to resolve data into genomes and analyze the metabolic potential. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide comprehensive, genome-resolved analysis of gut bacterial communities in co-hospitalized patients. The core methods are fast enough to make them useful in some clinical settings, and we anticipate that analysis time can be substantially decreased with future developments."

Even if dispersal occurs, the founding population may preclude establishment of later introduced populations. Alternatively, strains could be dispersing freely, and strain dominance could reflect strong selection in the gastrointestinal tract (possibly imposed by microbial community context and/or human genetics) leading to the establishment of a single, most adapted strain. Another model worth considering would involve stochastic acquisition of a strain from a set of populations that is so large that it is improbable that any two infants would initially acquire the same strain. As there is ongoing input of strains over the colonization period, the observation of one (usually) highly dominant population still suggests some barrier to establishment of other populations."

If gut colonization by pathogenic bacteria is a significant factor in the development of NEC, other health and/or environmental attributes may ultimately determine which infants become sick.

For a group of three samples, as might be collected in a clinical setting, the time required for DNA extraction is a couple of hours and for sequencing, about 2 days (the sequencing speed is method dependent). Sequence assembly, annotation, and data import into our metagenomics analysis system required 6\u20138 hr/sample and the time required for a first round binning that largely defined community composition and metabolic potential (generated automatically) was \u223c10 to \u223c60 min/sample. ESOM-based bin confirmation (which may not be needed for some applications) requires 1\u20132 hr/sample. Thus, new bioinformatics approaches tested here enable comprehensive genome-based analyses on a timescale that approaches that required for some clinical applications, for example involving patients with long-term health issues. The analysis time will decrease as sequencing technologies continue to improve and with automation of binning steps. This will make strain-resolved analysis clinically relevant for a wider range of applications, potentially including acute illnesses like NEC."

All microbial communities in all infants sampled prior to onset of NEC harbored organisms with significant pathogenicity potential. However, we found no evidence for one common, abundant (or even minor) genomically distinct infective agent. If bacteria contribute to NEC, the effect more likely is due to exposure to a variety of potentially dangerous hospital-associated bacteria. A major finding is that the dominant population of each bacterium acquired by each infant was generally genotypically distinct. Extremely closely related organisms were only identified in a handful of cases, and occurred in both sick and healthy infants. Yet, the fact that they were identified at all, and the detection of shared minor strains of <i>E. faecalis</i> in a few cases, confirms that dispersal can occur among infants in the NICU. Overall, we suspect the existence of significant barriers that limit establishment of strains during the early stages of colonization of the premature infant gastrointestinal tract."

Stringent post-processing steps were taken to filter out islands that could have resulted from missing or problematic segments in the assembly rather than actual differences in genomic sequence. Islands whose sequence was dominated by Ns (assembly gaps) were removed from further analysis. Islands that were very close (&lt;100 bp) to scaffold edges or islands whose flanking regions mapped to two different scaffolds in the other genome, could have resulted from missing assemblies, and were therefore disregarded. To verify suspected islands, reads from samples of both babies were mapped to the island sequence and manually inspected."

The curation used programs for correcting mis-assemblies and improving assemblies (Sharon et al., in preparation), which were identified through read mapping as follows. First, all reads were mapped to the genomes using bowtie2 (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n4/full/nmeth.1923.html\">http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n4/full/nmeth.1923.html</a>) with the --sensitive option. Next, short deletions (which we found to be common in idba-ud assemblies) in the assembled sequences were identified based on the read mappings. Last, all regions on the genomes with exceptionally low coverage were checked by collecting reads that map to those regions and their mate pairs and re-assembling them. Improvement of assemblies was achieved through read-mapping based identification of scaffolds that could be elongated or connected to other scaffolds. Both elongations and connections were achieved through local assembly of reads that were mapped to the analyzed regions and their mate pairs. For the <i>Candida</i> genome, our pipeline corrected 106 mis-assemblies (about one mis-assembly for every 120 Kbp) and reduced the number of scaffolds from 401 to 348."

Sample gDNA was diluted to 1:1000 and used as template in a PCR reaction consisting of 0.25 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M forward and reverse primer, 12.5 \u00b5l of 2\u00d7 ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad), and 12 \u00b5l of template, totaling 25 \u00b5l. This PCR mix was used to create droplets following the manufacture's instructions. Thermocycling parameters were: (1) 95\u00b0C for 10 min, (2) 95\u00b0C for 30 s, (3) 61\u00b0C for 30 s, (4) 72\u00b0C for 30 s, (5) 40 cycles (go to steps 2\u20134 \u00d739), (6) 98\u00b0C for 10 min, and (7) 12\u00b0C forever. All ramp rates were at 2.5\u00b0C/s. Each reaction was done in triplicate. Analysis of the ddPCR data was conducted with the QuantaSoft software package (Bio-Rad) and negative/positive thresholds set manually (just above the negative population). To calculate cell density, the copies/\u00b5l output from QuantaSoft was normalized by grams of fecal mass used for each gDNA extraction reaction. To broadly correct for copy number, the assumption of four copies per bacteria was used (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hospodsky et al., 2012</a>)."

We have added a new figure and figure supplement (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) that provide a visualization of differences between strains for <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> (a highly prevalent species) and <i>Clostridium paraputrificum</i> (one of the rare species in which one genotype was shared among some of the infants). Differences were visualized by mapping reads from various samples from which different strains were recovered to a specific scaffold from one of these assemblies, and constructing a multiple alignment of the consensus sequences derived from each mapping. In the case of <i>E. faecalis</i> we selected a 1 Mbp scaffold recovered from infant 9 and constituting a third of the genome. This view shows that most differences can be attributed to SNP and small indels, but that those are present throughout the sequence (\u223c90% identity for most strain pairs in the multiple alignment), suggesting that most sequence pairs did not diverge very recently. A few larger indel regions (20-30 Kbp) were detected and contained among other things a sucrose metabolism operon, mobile elements and genes related to Fe-S protein biogenesis. However, some strains (specifically two pairs of strains, the one in infants #3 and early samples of infant #5, and the one in infants #2 and #7) were much more similar to each other, with very few detected differences across the compared sequence. Judging by the small extent of differences and their type (e.g., a prophage insertion in infants #2 and #7), it is possible that differentiation between those closely related strains occurred very recently, perhaps even within the host, though not necessarily due to host genetics."

However, accumulation of similar data may ultimately enable the construction of such models. We are in the process of acquiring additional data, and hope that we will be able to present such models in the future. Presently however, we would like to note that current data does not show any strong correlation between NEC and any of the health statistics collected. We now discuss this issue in the main text."

In the future, as technology and algorithm improvement significantly reduce these timescales, this type of analyses could be made possible also for real-time management of acute illnesses like NEC. We have now clarified this in the text, and we hope that the reviewers will find our re-phrasing of this section satisfactory."
