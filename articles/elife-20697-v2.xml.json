To address this question, we first characterized the replay of SPW sequences during an already learned episodic memory task \u2013 a delayed left-right alternation task \u2013 and then took advantage of the fact that medial septum (MS) inactivation strongly impairs episodic memory (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chrobak et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mizumori et al., 1990</a>) but leaves the local-field potential SPW events intact (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 1984</a>).

Rather, SPW sequences also replayed episode field sequences. Place and episode cell sequences were replayed with comparable frequency and their replay was not biased by the current position of the animal or by the previous or future choice of the maze arm. Next, we show that SPW replay of both place field and episode field sequences was preserved after MS inactivation, suggesting that SPW sequences could not support episodic memory of animals after other internal sequences such as theta and episode field sequences were eliminated. Importantly, this data demonstrates that the replay of episode field sequences during SPWs was preserved even after the episode field sequences themselves were eliminated during wheel running. Thus, we suggest that SPW sequences reflect a preserved synaptic structure of the network rather than the memory of recent events."

We show that replay of place\u00a0field and episode\u00a0field sequences were generated exclusively during SPW events, during the short periods when the excitability of a large population of neurons suddenly increased. Interestingly, one of the effects of the MS inactivation was elimination of such synchronized changes of excitability during running (i.e., elimination of theta oscillations). Thus, we hypothesize that these isolated or repetitive waves of synchronously rising and decreasing excitability among a large population of neurons are necessary to activate internally generated sequences."

We identified episode field sequences generated during wheel running (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>-purple, <a href=\"#bib48\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>) and place field sequences in the arms of the maze (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>-green). We also identified all the SPW events (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> top) generated in the reward and delay areas of the maze (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> \u2013 orange, speed &lt; 3 cm/s; <a href=\"#bib12\">Csicsvari et al., 2000</a>). As shown before, 5\u201320% of SPW sequences were highly correlated with the sensory-cue-guided place field sequences identified in the arms of the maze (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> \u2013 orange/green, median = 9%; z-score= 3.5\u20139; median z-score= 4.5; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>). Interestingly, about 4.3\u201316.7% of SPW sequences were also significantly correlated with the episode field sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> \u2013 orange/purple; median = 10.25%; z-score= 3.1\u20137.8, median z-score= 4.7, p&lt;0.01). SPW sequences correlated with place or episode field sequences did not show any spatial bias, suggesting they were not strongly influenced by recently traveled trajectories in the maze. (44.8 \u00b1 2.9% of all SPW- sequences significantly correlated with the place field sequence in the left maze arm were generated in the left reward area . 51.2 \u00b1 4% of all SPW sequences significantly correlated with the place field sequence in the right maze arm were generated in the left reward area , n = 8 recordings from 3 animals.) The percentage of significant sequences also was not correlated with the performance of animals (Pearson correlation: Pre: r=0.34, p=0.25). This data shows that internal sequences (i.e. episode field sequences) are replayed during SPW events with equal probability as sequences strongly influenced by sensory cues (i.e. place field sequences). This suggests that SPW sequences reveal synaptic structure underlying not only place field sequences but also episode field sequences.

We compared the order of episode field sequences from before the inactivation(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, left - purple) with the order of SPW sequences from after the inactivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right - blue/purple). We found that SPW sequences whose orders were highly similar to the pre-inactivation episode field sequences were not eliminated by the inactivation. In fact, after inactivation, a slightly higher percentage of eligible SPW sequences was significantly correlated with episode field sequences (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B;</a> n = 10 recordings; z-score(Pre) = 4.1 \u00b1 0.4, z-score(Musc) = 6.7 \u00b1 0.9; Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.023). The same held true for the SPW sequences correlated with place field sequences (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E;</a> n = 8 recordings; z-score(Pre) = 5 \u00b1 0.7; z-score(Musc) = 8.5 \u00b1 0.9; Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.016). Both place and episode field sequences were replayed at close to a constant rate during the entire recording following MS inactivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a>), and the mean number of neurons activated during the replay of the place and episode field sequences did not change after the inactivation (Episode cells: Pre: 8.17 neurons, Musc: 8.73 neurons; Place cells: Pre: 5.96 neurons, Musc: 5.28 neurons). This was the case even though the episode field sequences observed during wheel running were eliminated after MS inactivation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Correspondingly, there was no significant correlation between the frequency of replay occurrence and the performance of animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, Pre: r = 0.34 p=0.25, Musc: r = \u22120.19 p=0.53). Also, we did not observe any significant decrease in the sequence replay during error trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, Correct trials: Pre: 0.22 Hz \u00b1 0.014, Musc: 0.32 Hz \u00b1 0.024. Error trials: Pre: 0.5 Hz \u00b1 0.08, Musc: 0.85 Hz \u00b1 0.25). As before the injection, SPW sequences that were correlated with pre-inactivation place and episode field sequences did not show clear spatial bias, suggesting that they were not strongly influenced by recently traveled trajectories in the maze. (56 \u00b1 6.6% of all SPW sequences significantly correlated with the place field sequence in the left maze arm were generated in the left reward area. 63 \u00b1 8.4% of all SPW sequences significantly correlated with the place field sequence in the right maze- arm were generated in the left reward area, n = 8 recordings from 3 animals). Thus, this data further confirms that SPW replay of episode and place field sequences does not support episodic memory in trained animals (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>) and likely reflects the structure of the network rather than the recent activity in the network."

What was the reason one set of these sequences was affected by MS inactivation while the other one remained unchanged? One common feature of the observed internal sequences (i.e., theta and SPW sequences) is that they coincide with synchronized changes in the excitability of a large population of neurons: individual troughs of theta oscillations and SPW events (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> \u2013 red traces, 4B-C; <a href=\"#bib45\">N\u00e1dasdy et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Louie and Wilson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt et al., 2009</a>).

This impairment was observed even though other internal sequences such as theta sequences were preserved (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jadhav et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, SPW sequences are considered key physiological phenomena supporting rodent navigation and memory storage. Can we thus assert that the presence of SPW sequences predicts memory performance of an animal? Based on our data, the answer is no: SPW sequences were fully preserved in animals that could not perform an episodic memory task. It should be noted that the impact of the MS inactivation is rather broad as it affects theta oscillations, theta sequences, hippocampal cholinergic input and spatial selectivity of grid cells. Given our data and the results of others (<a href=\"#bib20\">Girardeau et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dupret et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ego-Stenget and Wilson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jadhav et al., 2012</a>), it is possible that SPW sequences are required only for learning but are not necessary once the environment and the task have become familiar. In contrast, theta oscillations, theta sequences, and episode field sequences seem to be necessary during learning as well as during performance of well-trained episodic memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib35\">Landfield et al., 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berry and Thompson, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Winson, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mitchell et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mizumori et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">M'Harzi and Jarrard, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Robbe et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Since general spatial memory of animals was not impaired after MS inactivation, as evidenced by the fact animals understood the location of the water ports, did not re-explore the maze as if it were a novel environment and remembered the procedure of the task, it is possible that neither theta sequences nor episode field sequences are necessary to make use of already established long-term spatial memory (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hepler et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shen et al., 1996</a>). In contrast, theta and episode field sequences might be necessary for the instantaneous formation and recall of episodic memories such as which arm the animal just visited."

                        "text": "The hippocampal network was able to generate SPW sequences that were highly similar to episode field sequences even after the latter sequences were abolished. We wondered whether there is a mechanism that helped CA1 to 'read out' the network structure during SPWs that was perhaps eliminated by MS inactivation during theta state. Our data shows that SPW sequences were selectively generated when the excitability of a large portion of a network was temporarily increased, likely due to synchronized excitatory inputs from CA3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Csicsvari et al., 2000</a>). Similarly, others have shown that optical stimulation of CA1 region triggers SPW-like events that are accompanied by sequential firing of neurons (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stark et al., 2015</a>). Thus, could such a synchronized excitability increase be required to generate theta sequences? One of the effects of the medial septum inactivation was the elimination of synchronized changes of excitability during running, namely theta oscillations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Green and Arduini, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Petsche et al., 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Stumpf et al., 1962</a>). Therefore, we propose that the loss of theta sequences may be due to the lack of such excitability changes after MS inactivation. Overall, we hypothesize that either intermittent or rhythmic synchronized excitability changes are necessary to activate internally generated sequences and thus support memory (in case of theta sequences) and learning (in case of SPWs and theta sequences)."

The incoming wave of excitation arriving from CA3 and/or EC might synchronously increase the membrane potential among a large number of neurons, bringing all neurons closer to spiking at about the same time. The first neurons that fire during this wave of excitability likely activate local feed-forward inhibition and thus start to silence their 'competitor' principal neurons and dominate the activity of the network (<a href=\"#bib11\">Csicsvari et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Romani and Tsodyks, 2015</a>).

Once we found a time period with at least the minimal number of active neurons and the minimal number of spikes that enabled us to reach a significance level smaller than 0.05, we used the step 1 and 2 described in 'SPW sequence detection' section to detected sequences that were similar to one of the template sequences. Note, in this analysis we skipped over those time periods in which we previously detected SPW events."

This work builds on prior work by the same group (Wang et al., 2015) and it represents new analyses performed on this same data set. The main findings reported by the authors include 1) the observation that episode field sequences are \"replayed\" during sharp wave ripple LFP events at rate that is higher than would be expected by chance and similar to the rate of place field sequence replay. 2) Inactivation of MS using muscimol does not abolish SPW replay of event/place field sequences, in fact it increases the occurrence of these replay events.

The authors first detect episode/place field sequences as described in Wang 2015. They derive from these sequences an ordered sequence of firing peaks across cells. To detect replay events, they then compute a sequence similarity score by comparing each pair of spikes recorded in different cells within a time window, adding 1 to a sequence score if the order of those two spikes is the same as the order of the peak firing rates in the episode/place field sequence, and adding -1 otherwise. To assess significance, the authors shuffle the cell identity of each spike, maintaining spike timing, across the active cells within the epoch. They do this 10,000 times to build a null distribution of sequence scores. If the observed sequence score falls outside of 95% of the shuffle-computed sequence scores, the authors identify the sequence as being significantly similar to the episode/place field sequence."

By shuffling the cell identity of each spike independently, the authors break this feature of spiking statistics, inflating the significance of patterns they identify as sequences. For an extreme example, imagine two cells fire three spikes each in non-overlapping bursts, in the order found in the original episode/place field sequence. Shuffling spikes independently makes the particular observed sequence score unlikely by chance. However, if the autocorrelation function of the cells were to be preserved, that particular sequence score becomes very likely by chance, essentially those bursts of spikes would need to travel together in the reshuffling process. I think this is a huge problem for their data and conclusions."

We reformulated our conclusion to clarify this point. Specifically, as the reviewer pointed out, prior reports suggested that selective elimination of sharp-wave ripples disrupts memory performance and consolidation (Girardeau et al., 2009, Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010, Nokia et al., 2012, Jadhav et al., 2012). Previous studies also showed that the sequences during sharp-wave events can replay the ongoing experience (Pavlides et al., 1989, Eschenko et al., 2008, Karlsson et al., 2009, Singer et al., 2009, Dupret et al., 2010, Girardeau et al., 2014), the past experience (Karlsson and Frank, 2009), or predict animal\u2019s future behavior (Singer at al., 2013, Pfeiffer et al., 2013). Together, the available evidence supports the hypothesis that sharp-wave replay plays an important role in memory performance (Carr et al., 2011, Girardeau and Zugaro, 2011, Sadowski et al., 2011, Csicsvari and Dupret, 2013, Buzsaki, 2015). Here we are able to supply evidence that sheds somewhat different light on the role SPW sequences play in memory. Specifically, our result dissociates the occurrence of the sharp-wave replay from memory performance: it shows that the presence of SPW sequences does not always indicate whether an animal is capable of performing a memory task or not. Despite the wide range of consequences induced by medial septum inactivation, this observation urges us to reassess the role of sharp-wave replay in learning and memory. We included these points in the Discussion (first paragraph)."

The main findings reported by the authors include 1) the observation that episode field sequences are \"replayed\" during sharp wave ripple LFP events at rate that is higher than would be expected by chance and similar to the rate of place field sequence replay. 2) Inactivation of MS using muscimol does not abolish SPW replay of event/place field sequences, in fact it increases the occurrence of these replay events.

To detect replay events, they then compute a sequence similarity score by comparing each pair of spikes recorded in different cells within a time window, adding 1 to a sequence score if the order of those two spikes is the same as the order of the peak firing rates in the episode/place field sequence, and adding -1 otherwise. To assess significance, the authors shuffle the cell identity of each spike, maintaining spike timing, across the active cells within the epoch.

As one might expect, we observed lower percentage of SPW sequences with significant replay when we used more strict methods. However, we were able to reproduce our original findingwith all of these methods, that is, we showed that there was no significant drop in SPW replay between pre-muscimol and muscimol conditions. Overall, all these results support the conclusion in our manuscript. We thank the reviewer again for motivating us to improve our manuscript. We hope these results would help the reviewer to further consider our manuscript."
