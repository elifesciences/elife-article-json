                    "text": "The formation of imprinted memories during a critical period is crucial for vital behaviors, including filial attachment. Yet, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a combination of behavior, pharmacology, in vivo surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) and DiOlistic labeling we found that, translational control by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) bidirectionally regulates auditory but not visual imprinting and related changes in structural plasticity in chickens. Increasing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) reduces translation rates and spine plasticity, and selectively impairs auditory imprinting. By contrast, inhibition of an eIF2\u03b1 kinase or blocking the translational program controlled by p-eIF2\u03b1 enhances auditory imprinting. Importantly, these manipulations are able to reopen the critical period. Thus, we have identified a translational control mechanism that selectively underlies auditory imprinting. Restoring translational control of eIF2\u03b1 holds the promise to rejuvenate adult brain plasticity and restore learning and memory in a variety of cognitive disorders."

                    "text": "The formation of imprinted memories during a critical period is crucial for vital behaviors, including filial attachment. Yet, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a combination of behavior, pharmacology, in vivo surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) and DiOlistic labeling we found that, translational control by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) bidirectionally regulates auditory but not visual imprinting and related changes in structural plasticity in chickens. Increasing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) reduces translation rates and spine plasticity, and selectively impairs auditory imprinting. By contrast, inhibition of an eIF2\u03b1 kinase or blocking the translational program controlled by p-eIF2\u03b1 enhances auditory imprinting. Importantly, these manipulations are able to reopen the critical period. Thus, we have identified a translational control mechanism that selectively underlies auditory imprinting. Restoring translational control of eIF2\u03b1 holds the promise to rejuvenate adult brain plasticity and restore learning and memory in a variety of cognitive disorders."

This requires a type of learning called imprinting, which only occurs during a short period of time in young life known as the \u201ccritical period\u201d. This process has been reported in a variety of birds and other animals where long-term memory formed during a critical period guides vital behaviors. In order to form imprinted memories, neurons must produce new proteins. However, it is not clear how new experiences trigger the production of these proteins during imprinting. Unraveling such mechanisms may help us to develop drugs that can recover plasticity in the adult brain, which could help individuals with brain injuries relearn skills after critical periods are closed."

During the critical period, this factor mediates an increase in \u201cmemory-spines\u201d, which are small bumps on neurons that are thought to be involved in memory storage. On the other hand, elF2\u03b1 was not required to imprint newly hatched chicks to visual stimuli, suggesting that there are different pathways involved in regulating imprinting to different senses. Batista et al. also demonstrate that using drugs to increase the activity of eIF2\u03b1 in older chicks could allow these chicks to be imprinted to new sounds."

A particular feature of imprinting is that it occurs exclusively within a short critical period (CP) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bolhuis, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nevitt et al., 1994</a>), when structural and functional changes take place (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hensch, 2004</a>). Imprinting drives a vigorous following behavior in chickens, key for filial attachment (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Insel and Young, 2001</a>). This rather unique and precocious behavior is advantageous for investigating experience-driven activation of molecular pathways around birth (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bredenk\u00f6tter and Braun, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bock and Braun, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McCabe et al., 1982</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">1981</a>).

The translation of mRNA into protein occurs in three steps: initiation, elongation and termination and can be regulated through several signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>). Translation initiation is believed to be the rate-limiting step and a key target for translational control (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buffington et al., 2014</a>). A major way in which translation initiation is regulated is by modulating the formation of the ternary complex <i>via</i> phosphorylation of the translation-initiation factor eIF2\u03b1. In rodents, protein synthesis controlled by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is critically required for long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>) as well as long-term memory storage in several systems (<a href=\"#bib12\">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stern et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ounallah-Saad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2013</a>).

The\u00a0imprinting was assessed by the preferential approach to the imprinted stimuli, either visual or auditory, compared to the approach to novel stimuli. The preference for imprinted stimuli is commonly used as an index of long-term memory storage (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horn, 2004</a>). Individuals' preference was measured by calculating an index, where positive and negative values indicate preference for the imprinted or novel stimulus, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c and d</a>). This index accounts for fluctuations in baseline locomotion across trials, as described in the Method section. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</a>), chickens showed imprinting to either visual or auditory cues one day after hatching (P1) but not after four days (P4) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c and d</a>), indicating that the CP for imprinting ends before P4."

Briefly, the antibiotic puromycin (PMY) incorporated into newly synthesized proteins can be detected through immunolabeling and used to monitor translation. Because brain tissue incorporates PMY more slowly compared to other tissues (<a href=\"#bib15\">Flexner et al., 1962</a>) pilot experiments were conducted, showing that IP-injected PMY accessed the chicken\u2019s brain within 3\u20134 hr.

To further estimate the time-window during which auditory and visual imprinting are sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, we trained chickens for 1 or 2 hr on P1. Two-hour (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, right panel) training triggered robust auditory imprinting, which was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor clycloheximide (CHX) injected immediately after training (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, left panel). In contrast, one-hour training did not elicit significant auditory imprinting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, right panel). Interestingly, the temporal dynamics of protein synthesis dependency of visual imprinting was different. While one-hour training triggered visual imprinting that was suppressed by CHX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, left panel), visual imprinting after two-hour training was not blocked by post-training administration of CHX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> right panel). Consistent with the effect on behavior, CHX effectively blocked imprinting-triggered protein synthesis in both MNM and IMM areas (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c,d</a>). Taken together, our results show that both auditory and visual imprinting trigger new protein synthesis, which is required for both auditory and visual imprinting."

To this end, we first blocked the activity of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase PKR, with a specific PKR inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>) (PKRi). PKRi-injected chickens showed significantly stronger auditory imprinting compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). However, PKRi failed to affect visual imprinting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). Given that average locomotion towards the computer screen in both treated and control conditions was similar, the changes induced by altering eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation cannot be attributed to changes in overall motor activity. To further demonstrate that auditory imprinting could be enhanced by reducing eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control, chickens were injected with ISRIB, a compound that blocks the translational effects induced by p-eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sidrauski et al., 2013</a>) and increases translation (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with the PKRi-experiments, injection of ISRIB immediately after training enhanced auditory imprinting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>) but not visual imprinting. Hence, a reduction in p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control enhances auditory but not visual imprinting."

Despite having been studied for decades, the mechanism mediating the formation of imprinted memories remains elusive. Here we showed that, although visual and auditory imprinting require newly synthesized proteins, eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control bidirectionally regulates auditory but not visual imprinting and related changes in structural plasticity. Remarkably, targeting this translational control mechanism pharmacologically recovers auditory imprinting after the closing of the critical period."

Yet the mechanisms engaged during the CP for auditory imprinting have not been elucidated. One major limitation has been the design of stringent experimental approaches that control for social experience and innate biases, while achieving robust auditory imprinted memories (<a href=\"#bib56\">Van and Bolhuis, 1991</a>). We aimed to address these concerns by: (1) raising chickens in darkness and constraining social interaction, (2) imprinting chickens to more than one type of object and sound, and (3) increasing the length of training compared to other studies (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wallh\u00e4usser and Scheich, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Van and Bolhuis, 1991</a>) to achieve significant memory retention longer than 24 hr after training. These improvements, in addition to the novel custom-made audiovisual animation used for training, provided a stronger experimental design for assessing auditory and visual imprinting."

                                "text": "Several lines of evidence support the modality-specific role of eIF2\u03b1. First, training decreased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in the auditory-imprinting relevant area MNM, but not in IMM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Second, pharmacologically increasing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation with Sal003 selectively disrupted auditory imprinting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). Third, inhibiting eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation with PKRi or directly blocking p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control with ISRIB, enhanced auditory imprinting after weak training (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013e</a>). Interestingly, although Sal003 and ISRIB altered protein synthesis in IMM, these manipulations had no detectable effect on the formation of visual memories. The reason why eIF2\u03b1 is not involved in visual imprinting is not yet understood. It is possible that expression of eIF2\u03b1 kinase or phosphatase complexes differs between visual and auditory areas, or that upstream signaling pathways fail to engage eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation. It would be interesting to test whether other tasks involving memory formation, such as one-trial avoidance learning (<a href=\"#bib1\">Atkinson et al., 2008</a>), also require translational control by eIF2\u03b1. An appealing idea is that other translational control pathways such those controlled by the mechanistic target of rapamycin mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>) mediate the formation of visual memories."

Furthermore, and consistent with our behavioral results, eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation exclusively regulated spine remodeling in the auditory but not in the visual area. This result is particularly important since structural plasticity is crucial during CPs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roberts et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mataga et al., 2004</a>) but the underlying molecular mechanisms were unknown. Different forms of structural plasticity have been linked to memory, including spine turnover and morphological changes of preexisting spines (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004</a>). In this case, the structural plasticity found in IMM and MNM could be consistent with potentiation and enlargement of specific dendritic spines, favoring the detection of imprinted stimuli. While we did not observe changes in spine density, the increase in mushroom spines and decrease in thin spines may suggest coordinated structural plasticity as previously reported in hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bourne and Harris, 2011</a>). Thus, our results shed light on the biological basis of experience-dependent spine remodeling and uncovered eIF2\u03b1 as a major player in spine remodeling."

Glutamate application induces a transient increase of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in glial cells in vitro (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flores-M\u00e9ndez et al., 2013</a>). This effect has been linked to glutamate removal from the synaptic cleft by glial cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flores-M\u00e9ndez et al., 2013</a>). However, its contribution to memory formation in vivo remains untested. In future studies, it will be important to dissect the role of p-eIF2a in memory formation at the cellular level."

Reactivating such plasticity in the adult brain has the potential to rehabilitate brain function after CPs are closed (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hensch, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nabel and Morishita, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">H\u00fcbener and Bonhoeffer, 2014</a>). This has been successfully achieved in the visual cortex of rodents through direct manipulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission, either pharmacologically\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Hensch et al., 1998</a>) or through transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">Davis et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, in mice and humans, releasing \u2018epigenetic brakes', could reopen auditory CPs (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gervain et al., 2013</a>). Our results uncover a translational control mechanism as a novel target for reopening CPs. Indeed, two different strategies, either blocking p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation or inhibiting the upstream kinase PKR, enabled chickens to imprint to sounds after the end of the CP, suggesting that blocking p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation control enhances CP-mediated plasticity. A recent report shows that reducing p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control in the VTA can convert adult into adolescent mice with respect to their vulnerability to cocaine-induced changes in synaptic strength and behavior (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2016</a>). Based on these results and the evolutionarily conserved nature of this process, we speculate that reopening CPs through blockade of eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control could be used to recover plasticity in the mature brain and treat cognitive dysfunctions."

Each test included 5 presentations of the imprinted stimulus and 5 presentations of the novel stimulus. The duration of each presentation was 1 min. Baseline locomotion was measured during 30 s between trials. Imprinted and novel stimuli were alternated over five consecutive blocks. The first stimulus that started the sequence was picked randomly.

In this study, we normalized differences between locomotion to novel and imprinted stimuli by the average baseline locomotion in the wheel when no stimulus was presented. Therefore, to assess imprinting, we calculated a preference index (PI), <i>PI = \u2211(Imprinted<sub>STL</sub> - Novel<sub>STL</sub>)<sub>/</sub> Baseline<sub>A</sub></i> where <i>STL</i> indicates stimulus-triggered locomotion either during the\u00a0presentation of the imprinted stimulus (<i>Imprinted<sub>STL</sub></i>) or presentation of the novel stimulus (<i>Novel<sub>STL</sub></i>), and baseline<sub>A</sub> refers to the average baseline locomotion across the experiment. An advantage of this quantification over previous methods is that: (1) it takes into account the fluctuations in basal locomotion before each stimulus presentation, and (2) it weights differences in approaching behavior by average locomotion."

Statistics were based on the two-sided Student\u2019s t test, or the two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test for multiple comparisons of normally distributed samples. Otherwise the Mann-Whitney or the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons tests were used. Within-group variation is indicated by standard errors of the mean of each distribution, which are depicted in the graphs as error bars. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant."

Understanding what regulates critical periods and imprinting are indeed important questions that need to be addressed and will be of great interest to a broad community. While the title suggests that eIF2\u03b1 controls translation-dependent auditory imprinting and structural plasticity, the authors do not provide any direct evidence that new proteins are synthesized. At best, the authors can claim that eIF2\u03b1 is involved in auditory imprinting. Thus, the authors need to provide convincing evidence that translation, or increased protein synthesis, is required for auditory imprinting and structural plasticity. In addition, while the literature suggests eIF2\u03b1 is involved in memory formation, so are other protein synthesis pathways such as mTOR, as mentioned in the Discussion. The authors should include Western blot analysis for other protein synthesis pathways, as a control."

The authors argue that the translational control by phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2\u03b1 subunit (eIF2\u03b1) is required for auditory imprinting, and mediates changes in dendritic spines in the MNM region. They present data that the increasing phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 prevents the formation of auditory memories and spine plasticity. In contrast, the inhibition of an eIF2\u03b1 kinase enhances auditory memories. Furthermore, they provide evidence that the blocking p-eIF2\u03b1 mediated translational control enhances auditory memories and reopens the critical period. They propose a modality-specific translational control mechanism underlying the critical period for imprinting."

Compared to the method of Horn et al., this method seems to be affected by the individual difference of animals. I am wondering why the authors used \"baseline\". The authors should clarify the reason why each score is divided by the baseline. The authors may hypothesize that more active chicks in locomotion should show bigger number of preference score than inactive chicks. But the less active chicks show the highest preference in some cases. If the data are analyzed by the method of Horn et al., it will be easier for most of the readers in the field of imprinting research to understand the significance of this paper.</imprinting></imprinting-control>"

It is generally concluded that auditory stimuli play an important role in the formation of filial preferences, but that auditory imprinting is not as prominent when compared to visual imprinting. Although a lot of studies have demonstrated that the addition of an auditory stimulus improves following of a visual stimulus, few studies using only auditory exposure have demonstrated significant auditory learning. As is the case in this paper, the majority of studies of early auditory learning have used a compound of a visual and an auditory stimulus during training. The authors should discuss the physiological significance of auditory imprinting in relation to visual imprinting in the Introduction section."

                    "text": "This manuscript from Batista et al. is beautifully written and addresses the role of translational regulation during critical period plasticity in the chick. The study includes data indicating that auditory imprinting involves translation initiation regulation by eIF2\u03b1, and in particular that eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated and inhibited to allow for plasticity in the auditory cortex during the critical period. This indicates that mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (whose translation is upregulated when eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated and inhibited) are of particular importance to auditory plasticity during the critical period. In contrast, the authors show that phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, and hence eIF2\u03b1 translational regulation, is not involved in visual imprinting. The findings are intriguing and I believe important. However, I also believe that there are some significant flaws in the experimental design and interpretation that weaken the study. My principal concerns have to do with the question of how well the translational inhibition worked, and the question of the kinetics of translational regulation in the MNM (for auditory imprinting) and IMM (for visual imprinting). What were the kinetics of inhibition of protein synthesis following IP injection? Was it equivalent in MNM and IMM? It's not clear from the manuscript whether or not the IP injection was done at the end of the 1 hr and the 2 hr training. The authors write: \"both auditory and visual imprinting rely on protein synthesis but following different temporal dynamics\", and yet the conclusions from the translational inhibition experiments are all based on manipulations that do not appear to consider the differential temporal dynamics of imprinting (because they simply target a single time point, optimized for the effects on auditory imprinting). I also think it's really important to show that there is an effect on translation, and in particular on eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation. This is provided for Sal003 in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1, but only for \"brain samples,\" not for IMM or MNM. Without this, the results are all based on pharmacological interventions, which always have some caveats unless the expected effects are directly measured. For example it looks like there is significant variability in the ratio of peIF2\u03b1 to eIF2\u03b1 in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1, which raises the question of whether this correlates in any way with plasticity during imprinting."

I am a little bit surprised to hear that the first trials of the novel stimulus generated a stronger suppression of locomotion because it never happens when we use the simultaneous choice test as a method to measure the preference for visual imprinting. It seems to me that the novel stimulus causes fear for chicks in the initial trials. Usually, newly-hatched chicks show the preference to novel conspicuous moving objects. Rather in some cases, I even choose the object which attracts the intrinsic preference of chicks as a control in the test. Under the condition, the imprinted chicks still show the strong preference against the controls in the simultaneous choice test. I am worried whether or not the training for imprinting by the authors is sufficient enough to cause the strong preference against the controls. Also, there is a possibility that the increasing number of trials in the test can bring the similar effect as the imprinting training. The authors may improve the methods of the training and the test in future to strengthen their interesting findings by the molecular approach."

As pointed out by one of the reviewers, the classic preference score (PS) was the ratio between locomotion during imprinted trials and total locomotion, PS= locomotion during imprinted trials / total locomotion. This preference index was used previously to assess imprinting strength in a 4-trial testing paradigm with stimuli presented in \u2018fixed\u2019 sequence (either imprinted- novel-novel-imprinted or novel-imprinted-imprinted-novel). Upon preliminary analysis, we noticed that considering only the first 4 trials for computing the classic preference score overestimated the strength of the imprinting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>). This was mainly because the first trials of the novel stimulus generated a stronger suppression of locomotion, compared to subsequent presentations of the same stimulus. For this reason, we decided to test imprinting strength in 10 pseudo-random trials. In addition, total locomotion varied largely from first to last trials mainly because locomotion during the novel trials increased over time (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>). Because baseline locomotion was the most stable parameter, on average, we decided to use it to normalize the difference in locomotion between imprinted and novel trials. We believe our computation of the preference score is advantageous for randomizing the stimulus presentation (thus ruling out biases due to sequence), normalizing by a more stable variable (baseline) and increasing the number of trials to 10 to assess not only novelty detection but also the maintenance of the preference over time."

The authors argue that the translational control by phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 \u03b1 subunit (eIF2 \u03b1) is required for auditory imprinting, and mediates changes in dendritic spines in the MNM region. They present data that the increasing phosphorylated eIF2 \u03b1 prevents the formation of auditory memories and spine plasticity. In contrast, the inhibition of an eIF2 \u03b1 kinase enhances auditory memories. Furthermore, they provide evidence that the blocking p-eIF2 \u03b1 mediated translational control enhances auditory memories and reopens the critical period.

Compared to the method of Horn et al., this method seems to be affected by the individual difference of animals. I am wondering why the authors used \"baseline\". The authors should clarify the reason why each score is divided by the baseline. The authors may hypothesize that more active chicks in locomotion should show bigger number of preference score than inactive chicks. But the less active chicks show the highest preference in some cases.

This index was generated to reflect imprinting across a larger number of trials and obtain a more accurate measure of memory strength. In contrast with previous studies, we did not use fixed presentation sequences and opted to pseudo randomize presentation order. We would like to argue that this paradigm better controls for the possible effect of stimulus presentation order. In addition, a fine trial-by-trial analysis of the locomotor response to novel and imprinted stimuli showed that the preference score captures the influence of both novelty detection and the persistence of increased locomotion towards the imprinted stimulus. Therefore, while classic preference scores are computed over 4 trials, we decided to measure preference across 10 trials. Based on the same analysis, we noticed that baseline (locomotion when only a background image is presented), was the most stable parameter during the experiment. Thus we decided to normalize differences to baseline."

The study includes data indicating that auditory imprinting involves translation initiation regulation by eIF2\u03b1, and in particular that eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated and inhibited to allow for plasticity in the auditory cortex during the critical period. This indicates that mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (whose translation is upregulated when eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated and inhibited) are of particular importance to auditory plasticity during the critical period. In contrast, the authors show that phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, and hence eIF2\u03b1 translational regulation, is not involved in visual imprinting. The findings are intriguing and I believe important. However, I also believe that there are some significant flaws in the experimental design and interpretation that weaken the study. My principal concerns have to do with the question of how well the translational inhibition worked, and the question of the kinetics of translational regulation in the MNM (for auditory imprinting) and IMM (for visual imprinting). What were the kinetics of inhibition of protein synthesis following IP injection? Was it equivalent in MNM and IMM? It's not clear from the manuscript whether or not the IP injection was done at the end of the 1 hr and the 2 hr training. The authors write: \"both auditory and visual imprinting rely on protein synthesis but following different temporal dynamics\", and yet the conclusions from the translational inhibition experiments are all based on manipulations that do not appear to consider the differential temporal dynamics of imprinting (because they simply target a single time point, optimized for the effects on auditory imprinting). I also think it's really important to show that there is an effect on translation, and in particular on eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation.</i>"
