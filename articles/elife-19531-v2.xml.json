Such induced defenses are often mediated by early defense signaling (EDS) rapidly activated by the perception of herbivore associated elicitors (HAE) that includes transient accumulations of jasmonic acid (JA). Analyzing 60 HAE-induced leaf transcriptomes from closely-related <i>Nicotiana</i> species revealed a key gene co-expression network (M4 module) which is co-activated with the HAE-induced JA accumulations but is elicited independently of JA, as revealed in plants silenced in JA signaling. Functional annotations of the M4 module were consistent with roles in EDS and a newly identified hub gene of the M4 module (NaLRRK1) mediates a negative feedback loop with JA signaling. Phylogenomic analysis revealed preferential gene retention after genome-wide duplications shaped the evolution of HAE-induced EDS in <i>Nicotiana</i>. These results highlight the importance of genome-wide duplications in the evolution of adaptive traits in plants."

Such induced defenses are often mediated by early defense signaling (EDS) rapidly activated by the perception of herbivore associated elicitors (HAE) that includes transient accumulations of jasmonic acid (JA). Analyzing 60 HAE-induced leaf transcriptomes from closely-related <i>Nicotiana</i> species revealed a key gene co-expression network (M4 module) which is co-activated with the HAE-induced JA accumulations but is elicited independently of JA, as revealed in plants silenced in JA signaling. Functional annotations of the M4 module were consistent with roles in EDS and a newly identified hub gene of the M4 module (NaLRRK1) mediates a negative feedback loop with JA signaling. Phylogenomic analysis revealed preferential gene retention after genome-wide duplications shaped the evolution of HAE-induced EDS in <i>Nicotiana</i>. These results highlight the importance of genome-wide duplications in the evolution of adaptive traits in plants."

This triggers a sophisticated suite of defenses in the plant that can either deter feeding by the insects, or help the plants endure the attack. The elicitors stimulate the rapid accumulation of a plant hormone called jasmonic acid, which in turn activates the defense responses. However, high levels of jasmonic acid can also reduce the ability of the plants to survive and reproduce by activating plant defenses when they are not needed. Therefore, plants need to regulate the signaling networks that control defense so that jasmonic acid only accumulates when the benefit of fighting the insect outweighs the cost of producing the defenses."

Further analysis shows that a process called genome duplication, in which all the genes in an organism are copied, has shaped the evolution of early defense signaling in <i>Nicotiana.</i> Many of the duplicated genes have adopted new roles and been retained in the plants. This highlights the importance of genome duplications in helping plants to adapt to their environment."

Many plants recognize and distinguish the damage caused by feeding insects from mechanical damage by perceiving herbivore-associated elicitors (HAE) to induce rapid early defense signaling (EDS) that includes the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivatives, phytohormones that play a central role in the activation of induced defenses (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erb et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Howe and Jander, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>). Increases or decreases in leaf JA concentrations can directly activate or impair induced anti-herbivore defenses, respectively (<a href=\"#bib25\">Farmer and Ryan, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kessler et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>), highlighting the importance of JA accumulation for induced defenses. However, increased JA levels can also reduce plant fitness due to the physiological and ecological costs of defense elicitation when defenses are not needed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baldwin and Hamilton, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Glawe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Heil and Baldwin, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">van Dam and Baldwin, 1998</a>). For example, in <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>, an increase in endogenous JA levels by supplying methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA) reduced plant fitness by 26% when plants were protected from herbivore attack (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baldwin, 1998</a>). Thus induced JA accumulations can result in net fitness gains or losses depending on the cost/benefit ratio of induced defenses, which varies among attacking herbivore species and environmental conditions. Therefore, a robust and complex signaling network that regulates and fine-tunes induced JA biosynthesis, metabolism and JA-dependent induced downstream defenses is essential for plants to realize their fitness optima."

The HAE-regulated signaling network includes: protein kinases, such as the wounding induced protein kinase (<i>NaWIPK</i>) (<a href=\"#bib102\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Wu et al., 2007</a>) and calcium-dependent protein kinases (<i>NaCDPK4/5</i>) (<a href=\"#bib106\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), which positively and negatively regulate HAE-induced JA accumulations, respectively; transcription factors, such as <i>NaWRKY3/6</i>, which positively regulate HAE-induced JA accumulations (<a href=\"#bib85\">Skibbe et\u00a0al., 2008</a>); and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and perception genes (<i>NaETR1, NaACO</i> and <i>NaACS</i>) (<a href=\"#bib98\">von Dahl et al., 2007</a>), which crosstalk with JA-regulated downstream defense responses (<a href=\"#bib70\">Onkokesung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Voelckel et al., 2001</a>), such as nicotine biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kahl et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Shoji et al., 2000</a>).

Duplicated genes can either be retained in the same network to increase network complexity and robustness or evolve to function in new networks through subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization processes (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Smet and Van de Peer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Duarte et al., 2006</a>) that can be detected from changes in the spatiotemporal expression or protein interaction patterns of the duplicated genes. Although both gene expression and protein-protein interaction divergences between duplicated genes increase over time (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping, 2011</a>), several factors, such as the type of duplication and the functionality of the genes, affect the rate and extent of those divergences (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hanada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Rizzon et al., 2006</a>). For instance, expression divergences between duplicated genes involved in stress responses tend to be greater than those of duplicated genes involved in developmental processes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ha et\u00a0al., 2007</a>). While studies based on the analysis of gene ontologies and genome-wide duplications suggest that linage-specific duplication (LD) followed by expression divergence are important for the evolution of stress responses in plants (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hanada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Rizzon et al., 2006</a>), whole genome duplications (WGD) events, which are prominent in the plant kingdom, provide a major source of duplicated genes and contribute significantly to the evolution of cellular networks, such as gene regulatory (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blanc and Wolfe, 2004</a>), protein-protein interaction (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping, 2011</a>) and metabolic networks (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gachon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hofberger et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, duplicated copies from WGD events are more likely to be retained in a network than those from LD, especially for genes that are dosage-sensitive, such as transcription factors, and protein kinases (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Birchler and Veitia, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Casneuf et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Edger and Pires, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Freeling, 2009</a>).

Because functionally related genes tend to be transcriptionally coordinated (<a href=\"#bib75\">Persson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Stuart et al., 2003</a>), co-expression network analysis has been widely used to infer the function of genes and uncover biological pathways (<a href=\"#bib56\">Klie et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Usadel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Yonekura-Sakakibara et al., 2008</a>). Distinct from \u2018classical\u2019 gene expression analysis using genome-wide expression profiling of control and treated samples to identify \u2018up\u2019 or \u2018down\u2019 regulated genes, co-expression network analysis uses expression measurements from a large number of samples that vary in their genotype, treatment, tissue or sampling time to enhance the statistical power of the analysis (<a href=\"#bib110\">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</a>). However, due to the high specificity among tissues and treatments and the speed of the HAE-elicited responses (within 30\u2009min) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gulati et al., 2014</a><a href=\"#bib37\">, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Kim et al., 2011</a>), the general co-expression network approach that uses gene expression data from different tissues or time course experiments are not particularly useful. One solution to overcome this specificity issue is to use natural variation, such as occurs amongst closely related species or different genotypes within species, to identify co-expressed gene networks (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ardlie et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Delker et al., 2010</a>). In the identification of HAE-induced EDS networks, the comparison of closely related species has at least two advantages over the use of different genotypes within a species:\u00a0(1) their greater genetic and phenotypic diversity (<a href=\"#bib104\">Xu et al., 2015</a>) which increases the power of detecting co-expressed genes; (2) their divergence times are over several millions of years which allows for the identification of evolutionarily conserved co-expression networks that are likely functionally important."

Our previous study revealed that a single HAE, such as the fatty acid-amino acid conjugate C18:3-Glu (FAC) \u2013 the most active elicitor found in the oral secretions of the Solanaceae specialist herbivore <i>Manduca sexta</i> (OS<i><sub>Ms</sub></i>) larvae \u2013 elicits diverse defense responses among closely related <i>Nicotiana</i> species when added to standardized puncture wounds. In addition, a single <i>Nicotiana</i> species, such as <i>N. pauciflora,</i> showed distinct defense responses to the FAC, OS<i><sub>Ms</sub></i> and oral secretions from the generalist herbivore <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i> (OS<i><sub>Sl</sub></i>) (<a href=\"#bib104\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). Here we sequenced the leaf transcriptomes of six closely-related <i>Nicotiana</i> species from the <i>Petunioides</i> clade (<i>N. obtusifolia, N. linearis, N. acuminata, N. pauciflora, N. miersii</i> and <i>N. attenuata</i>) that had been induced by three different HAEs or simply wounded (induced by wounding plus water) to characterize the HAE-induced EDS networks in <i>Nicotiana</i>. We compared HAE-induced transcriptomic responses among the six species and identified a co-expression gene network that represents the HAE-induced EDS in <i>Nicotiana</i> based on three independent lines of evidence: (1) the induction of the network correlates with variation in JA accumulations both among species treated with the same HAE and within species treated with different HAEs; (2) the induction of genes in this network that are largely not dependent on induced JA accumulations; (3) the consequences of silencing a hub gene in this network for HAE-induced JA metabolism and defenses. Analysis of the evolutionary history of all genes in the EDS network revealed that preferential gene retention after the Solanaceae whole genome triplication (WGT) event shaped the evolution of HAE-induced EDS in <i>Nicotiana</i>."

Two species, <i>N. obtusifolia</i> and <i>N. miersii</i>, which did not respond to FAC-treatments by amplifying their wound-induced accumulations of jasmonic acid (JA) within 2\u2009hr, showed overall little induced transcriptomic responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the other four species, FAC elicitation induced both high levels of JA and significant transcriptomic changes. The variation in FAC-induced transcriptomic responses largely resulted from the up-regulation of genes. Among all the species, FAC elicitation up-regulated more genes (1149.3 \u00b1 667.8; mean \u00b1 standard deviation) than it down-regulated (353.2 \u00b1 278.9). To validate the expression changes observed from the RNA-seq analysis, we quantified the transcript abundance of 12\u2009<i>N. attenuata</i> genes that were found to be up-regulated by FAC using qPCR. Although two genes only showed marginally significant increases in their transcript levels (p=0.08, likely due to their large variation in expression among replicates), all 12 genes showed consistent FAC-induced up-regulation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting an overall high reliability of the RNA-seq results. Interestingly, despite the large variation in FAC-induced transcriptomic responses among the species, 34 genes were induced by FAC in all six species (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) which likely represent the conserved FAC-induced stress response genes. Among them, eight are transcription factors from the WRKY (3), AP2/ERF (2) TT2 (1) and PLATZ (1) families, and two are E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase-like proteins (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Taken together, the data suggest that while the induction of only a few genes are conserved after FAC elicitation, the overall FAC-induced early transcriptomic responses are highly variable among closely related <i>Nicotiana</i> species."

We identified FAC-induced gene co-expression networks using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method (see details in Materials and Methods). In total, five gene modules (M1-M5) were identified using control (wounding + water) and FAC-induced gene expression profiles from all six species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Among these five modules, module M4 showed the highest correlation with HAE-induced JA accumulations, a marker of induced defense signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). In all four species that showed FAC-induced JA accumulations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), the majority of M4 module genes were also significantly induced by FAC (p&lt;0.05 and fold change greater than 1.5, exact negative binomial test). In contrast, in the two species, <i>N. obtusifolia</i> and <i>N. miersii</i>, which did not show FAC-induced JA accumulations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), less than 22% of the M4 module genes were induced. The intra-modular connectivity of the M4 module, a parameter that indicates the degree of co-expression among 3genes in a network, was significantly higher in FAC-induced samples than in control samples (p=0.0002, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test), consistent with the observation that FAC elicits co-expression among genes in the M4 module (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Furthermore, the expression kinetic analysis of the M4 module genes using a previously published microarray dataset (<a href=\"#bib55\">Kim et al., 2011</a>) revealed that most of the M4 module genes were largely transiently expressed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) after HAE-elicitation.

To further test this hypothesis, using the <i>N. attenuata</i> genome-wide microarray, we measured FAC-induced gene expression changes in JA deficient <i>N. attenuata</i> plants (ir<i>AOC</i>), in which a key JA biosynthesis gene was silenced and the induced JA levels were reduced to basal levels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kallenbach et al., 2012</a>). For the comparison, we also performed genome-wide microarray analysis for the same <i>N. attenuata</i> wild type (WT) RNA samples that were used for the RNA-seq analysis. In the WT samples, fewer FAC-induced genes were detected by the microarray (771) than by the RNA-seq analysis (1752); however more than 81.2% of the FAC up-regulated genes identified using the microarray were also found from the RNA-seq analysis, indicating an overall consistency between RNA-seq and microarray data, and the expected higher power and sensitivity of RNA-seq in detecting differentially expressed genes. More than 87% of the M4 module genes that were induced by FAC in WT plants, both from the RNA-seq and microarray experiments, were also up-regulated in the JA-deficient ir<i>AOC</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Likewise, based on the microarray data of samples that were collected at 30\u2009min after FAC-elicitation, the majority (85.1%) of up-regulated genes in WT plants were also up-regulated (FDR adjusted p&lt;0.05, fold change &gt;1.5) in the JA-deficient plants, suggesting that the FAC-induced early expression changes are largely not dependent on FAC-induced JA accumulations. Together, these data suggest that the genes of the M4 module are largely induced by FAC but not by JA, which places their regulation down-stream of HAE perception but upstream or parallel of the activation of JA signaling."

We further identified eight genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>) from the M4 module that showed lower expression in response to OS<i><sub>Ms</sub></i> than to FAC in both <i>N. attenuata</i> and <i>N. pauciflora</i>. Among these eight genes, one gene, <i>NaJAR1.1</i> (NIATv7_g23173, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), is a member of the jasmonic acid-amido synthetase (JAR1) gene family (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>). JAR1 catalyzes the formation of jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a conjugate of JA that activates downstream defense responses (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Staswick et al., 2002</a>). In the <i>N. attenuata</i> genome, there are three JAR1 copies that resulted from duplication events, and two of these (<i>NaJAR4</i> and <i>NaJAR6</i>) are induced by both FAC and OS<i><sub>Ms</sub></i> and are involved in the conjugation of JA to amino acids and anti-herbivore defense responses (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). Although the exact functions of <i>NaJAR1.1</i> remain unknown, it shares more than 85% of protein sequence identity to <i>NaJAR4</i> and <i>NaJAR6</i> and has the conserved amino acid conjugation domain shared by all JAR1 family members, suggesting that <i>NaJAR1.1</i> is also likely involved in the metabolism of JA. We hypothesize that an unknown component in OS<i><sub>Ms</sub></i>, which might be used by the specialist herbivore <i>M. sexta</i> to suppress the expression of <i>NaJAR1.1</i> in order to regulate JA metabolism and thus suppress downstream defense responses in <i>Nicotiana</i>."

The results revealed that the Z-summary scores of the M4 module, which indicate the level of module preservation, are all above 20 (values above 10 indicates that the module is highly conserved) for all pair-wise species comparisons, suggesting the M4 module has been retained among different species (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The statistical significance of the module preservation is further supported by permutation tests (in all comparisons, p&lt;2.2E-16). We further analyzed the sequence divergence of M4 module genes by calculating the \u03c9 (Ka/Ks ratio) of M4 module genes shared between <i>N. attenuata</i> and <i>N. obtusifolia</i>, the two most divergent species in the dataset. The results revealed that the \u03c9 value of most M4 module genes (94.5%) are significantly less than 1 (p&lt;0.05, Fisher\u2019s exact test, median \u03c9=0.19), indicating they were under strong purifying selection. The distribution of \u03c9 from M4 module genes was not different from all leaf expressed genes (median \u03c9=0.20, p=0.18, Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test), suggesting that the M4 module genes were not subject to strong divergent selection between <i>N. attenuata</i> and <i>N. obtusifolia</i>.

                                "text": "Hub genes, which are defined as highly connected genes in the network, are often functionally important. Based on intra-modular connectivity, we identified 64 hub genes (top 5%) in the FAC-induced co-expression network, which include <i>NaWIPK</i>, a key positive regulator of JA biosynthesis and induced defense in <i>N. attenuata</i> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Meldau et al., 2009</a>). To provide further mechanistic understanding of these hub genes in regulating induced defenses, we characterised an additional unknown hub gene encoding a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (<i>NaLRRK1</i>). The plasma membrane and nuclei localized <i>NaLRRK1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>) has an N-terminal extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic region. The expression of <i>NaLRRK1</i> was co-upregulated with induced JA signaling among the six <i>Nicotiana</i> species (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). Measuring <i>NaLRRK1</i> transcripts in leaves treated with different HAEs and one pathogen-associated elicitor, flg22, revealed that <i>NaLRRK1</i> is specifically induced by HAE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). We investigated whether HAE-induced JA signaling regulates the expression of <i>NaLRRK1</i> using two different jasmonate deficient transgenic plants, in which steps in JA signaling and perception were individually silenced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). Consistent with the microarray results, <i>NaLRRK1</i> was still significantly induced by FAC 30\u2009min after elicitation in both of the JA-signaling deficient genotypes, revealing that JA is not required for the up-regulation of <i>NaLRRK1</i>. Interestingly, compared to WT plants at 1\u2009hr, <i>NaLRRK1</i> transcript levels were higher in <i>irAOC</i> plants \u2013 in which JA-Ile levels remain at basal levels - but were lower in <i>irCOI</i> plants, in which JA-Ile levels are constitutively high (<a href=\"#bib72\">Paschold et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e and f</a>). This indicates that JA-Ile levels may suppress the accumulation of <i>NaLRRK1\u00a0</i>transcripts. To test this hypothesis, we compared <i>NaLRRK1</i> transcript accumulations in leaves in which the levels of JA-Ile were elevated by adding different amounts of JA-Ile to wounded leaves together with FAC. The results revealed that increased JA-Ile levels indeed decreased the levels of <i>NaLRRK1</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>). Furthermore, in the transgenic plants 35S-<i>jmt</i>/ir-<i>mje</i>, in which endogenous JA levels are redirected to MeJA resulting in lower levels of induced JA-Ile and abrogated JA-signaling compared to WT plants (<a href=\"#bib88\">Stitz et al., 2011</a>), HAE-induced <i>NaLRRK1</i> transcript accumulation was higher than in WT plants (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that JA-Ile negatively regulates <i>NaLRRK1</i> transcript levels."

Since reduced expression of <i>NaCYP94B3-like1/2</i> results in lower levels of 12OH-JA-Ile and higher levels of JA-Ile (<a href=\"#bib62\">Luo et al., 2016</a>), it is likely that the increased <i>NaCYP94B3-like1/2</i> transcript accumulations enhanced the hydroxylation of JA-Ile. These results suggest that <i>NaLRRK1</i> negatively regulates both JA biosynthesis and the hydroxylation of JA-Ile, and potentially suppress the effects the defense responses elicited by JA-signaling."

For this, we first analyzed the most recent duplication event for each <i>N. attenuata</i> gene using the species reconciliation approach (Materials and Methods). Among all M4 module genes, 79.5% were retained in the genome of <i>Nicotiana</i> and <i>Solanum</i> after at least one round of duplication since the divergence of eudicots from monocots; this percentage retention is significantly higher than the genome-wide average (odd ratio = 1.96, p&lt;2.2E-16, exact binomial test, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This suggests that gene duplications played a significant role in the evolution of the HAE-induced EDS network. Because Solanaceae taxa experienced a whole genome triplication (WGT) event (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sato et al., 2012</a>), we compared the contributions of the Solanaceae WGT event with <i>Nicotiana</i>-specific lineage duplications (LD) to the evolution of the M4 module genes. A majority of the most recent duplication events of the M4 module genes occurred in the Solanaceae branch (51.5%), likely due to the WGT (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sato et al., 2012</a>). This percentage is significantly higher than the genome-wide average (odd ratio = 1.46, p=1.79E-10, exact binomial test, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Because our phylogenomic approach can not specifically distinguish the ancient segmental duplications from the WGT events, we further identified a subset of genes that is located in the syntenic blocks that resulted from the Solanaceae WGT. These genes are consistently significantly enriched in the EDS network (odd ratio = 1.40, p=2.4E-7). In contrast, only ~8.0% of the genes originated from <i>Nicotiana</i> lineage species duplications, which is not different from the genome-wide level (odd ratio=0.84, p=0.12, exact binomial test, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In addition, when considering genes that were significantly induced by FAC in all three species, <i>N. attenuata, N. acuminata</i> and <i>N. linearis</i> ('conserved EDS'), similar patterns were found (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). These results suggest that Solanaceae WGT contributed more than lineage specific duplication events to the evolution of the HAE-induced EDS network."

Because the complete EDS network before the Solanaceae WGT is unknown, it is difficult to directly test the preferential gene retention hypothesis. Instead, we examined a prediction that would result from the preferential gene retention scenario: for a given gene pair, the observed number of gene pairs that are both found in the EDS is higher than the number of two genes found in the EDS by chance. To test this prediction, we identified a subset of gene pairs (4292 pairs including 8584 genes) that resulted from the Solanaceae WGT (duplications on the Solanaceae branch) in which at least two of the three original copies were retained in the <i>N. attenuata</i> genome and expressed in leaves. Because both members of these gene pairs were both retained in the genome, we specifically examined the process of preferential gene recruitment to the M4 module. Among this subset of genes, 428 were found in module M4, and of those, both members of 120 gene pairs were in the M4 module. This is significantly higher than the expected number from the null model which assumes independent recruitment of two duplicated copies in the M4 module (p&lt;2.2E-16, \u03c7<sup>2</sup><sub>-</sub>test), consistent with the prediction that duplicated genes were preferentially retained in the M4 module.

Therefore HAE-induced early defenses signaling that allows a plant to distinguish herbivore attack from wounding plays an important role in this process (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bonaventure et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Howe and Jander, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>). However, identifying herbivore induced EDS is challenging, due to its specificity among different tissues, time points, treatments and overall complexity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Howe and Jander, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>). In this study, we took a novel comparative transcriptomic and co-expression network analysis approach using the leaf transcriptome data from six closely related species that were treated with different HAE, which resulted in the identification of a co-expression network that represents the HAE-induced EDS in <i>Nicotiana</i>. This approach assumes that if two genes are functionally connected (co-expressed), the expression changes of one gene will also affect the other one during evolution, thus increasing the statistical power for detecting co-expressed gene modules. Although this assumption cannot be applied to species specific co-expression modules, it can be used to identify gene co-expression modules that are conserved among the studied species (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which likely are functionally important."

Interestingly, among these 782 genes in the HAE-induced EDS, of which only 28.2% and 11.7% in <i>N. obtusifolia</i> and <i>N. miersii</i> were elicited by FAC, respectively, at least 67.6% were induced by OS<i><sub>Sl</sub></i> in each of these two species (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These results suggest that the signaling network, while not elicited by FAC, remains intact in these two species, likely due to changes in FAC-perception. These results are also consistent with the analysis of module conservation which suggested that the M4 module is highly conserved among different <i>Nicotiana</i> species (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The M4 module is always co-activated and likely upstream or parallel to the activation of JA signaling, indicating that M4 module and JA signaling are likely involved in such circuits. We found <i>NaLRRK1</i>, a FAC-induced hub gene from the M4 module, and jasmonate signaling form negative feedback loops and are co-activated by HAE elicitation among different species that diverged several millions of years ago. The conserved co-activation between jasmonate signaling and <i>NaLRRK1</i> by HAE and its negative effect on insect performance suggests that the identified feedback loops are important for plant fitness in <i>Nicotiana</i>. Although increased expression of <i>NaLRRK1</i> after HAE elicitation may lower anti-herbivore defenses, it may increase the net fitness by reducing fitness costs associated with induced jasmonate signaling, such as the changes in primary metabolites that are important for a plant\u2019s tolerance of tissue removal and regrowth (<a href=\"#bib63\">Machado et al., 2013b</a>). Clearly more components are involved in the <i>NaLRRK1</i> and jasmonate signaling negative feedback loops, such as transcription factors and other protein kinases, which are also likely present in the M4 modules. Future molecular studies that identify direct interacting components with <i>NaLRRK1</i> will shed light on the mechanisms of the <i>NaLRRK1-</i> JA feedback loops. The challenge will be to quantitatively analyze both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of candidate genes at different time points after elicitation, since their interactions might be highly specific."

The Solanaceae WGT event can be dated to 91\u201352 million years ago (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sato et al., 2012</a>), yet many of the duplicated gene pairs remain co-expressed after HAE-elicitation. This suggests that retaining these duplicated copies in the same network has been beneficial to plants, likely as a result of increased network complexity and robustness (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Smet and Van de Peer, 2012</a>). This is consistent with the results of studies on examining the function of <i>NaCDPK4/5</i> and <i>NaJAR4/6</i> by simultaneously silencing either member of both copies in <i>N. attenuata</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Yang et al., 2012</a>).

Therefore, retaining both <i>NaCDPK4</i> and <i>NaCDPK5</i> in the network may increase the robustness against the negative fitness effects resulted from null mutations in the gene itself or its regulatory systems (<a href=\"#bib34\">Gu et al., 2003</a>). Interestingly, the duplicated gene pair, <i>NaJAR4/6</i>, which catalyzes the formation of JA-Ile, showed additive effects on HAE-induced JA-Ile accumulations, since silencing each individual copy both resulted in reduced JA-Ile levels (<a href=\"#bib86\">Staswick et al., 2002</a>) and reductions in the activation of downstream defense responses.

For example, in rice, the <i>mPing</i>, a miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITE) family, rapidly expanded in specific strains and its insertions into the 5\u2019 flanking region rendered adjacent genes inducible by abiotic stresses by introducing <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements and/or epigenetic markers (<a href=\"#bib69\">Naito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Yang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Yasuda et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, we observed that insertions of the DTT-NIC1, a Solanaceae specific MITEs family that contains a stress inducible <i>cis</i>-regulatory element, the W-box, into 5\u2019 regulatory regions of genes are significantly enriched among genes of the HAE-induced EDS network in <i>Nicotiana (</i>p=0.00049, Appendix 1). We speculate that the genome-wide expansions of DTT-NIC1 may have facilitated gene recruitment into the <i>Nicotiana</i> EDS network by introducing <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements into the 5\u2019 flanking regions of <i>Nicotiana</i> genes. However, several other mechanisms could also result in the same observation; for example, biotic stresses may mobilize TEs, which are more likely to insert into genes with open chromatin under stressed conditions. Future studies that measure the contribution of DTT-NIC1 insertions in the inducibility of the identified EDS genes by manipulating the DTT-NIC1 insertions sites are needed to examine these hypotheses."

Our previous work had revealed that several miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITE) families, including DTT-NIC1, a Solanaceae-specific subgroup of the Tc1/Mariner family, expanded in <i>Nicotiana</i> (Xu et al, submitted). Permutation tests showed that insertions sites of annotated MITE families are enriched more than four times at 1kb upstream of genes compared to random chance (p&lt;0.001, permutation test). To examine the role of MITE insertions on the evolution of the HAE-induced EDS, we compared the probability of genes recruited to the EDS that contain MITE insertions within 1\u00a0kb upstream to the genome-wide pattern. The results showed that MITE insertions into the 1\u00a0kb upstream regions significantly increased the probability of genes being recruited into the M4 module (odd ratio = 1.3, p=\u00a0.0E-3, exact binomial test, <a href=\"#A1-tbl1\">Appendix 1\u2014table 1</a>)."

To examine this potential mechanism, we performed de novo identifications of enriched transcription factor binding motifs from regulatory regions among HAE-induced EDS genes. Within the 1kb upstream region sequences, seven significantly enriched motifs (p&lt;1E-10) were found among the M4 module genes in comparison to the genome-wide background (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>). Among them, two W-box motifs (W-box1: AGTCAACG and W-box2: TTGACCWT) were the most statistically significant. These conserved motifs are known to be bound by WRKY transcription factors that are induced by biotic stresses (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gao et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Zou et al., 2011</a>). W-box1 and W-box2 box were found in the 1kb upstream regions of more than 60.5% and 69.0% of M4 module genes, respectively. A similar pattern was also found for the EDS genes that were induced by FAC in all three FAC-responding species."

Further comparisons of insertion sites of DTT-NIC1 and motif locations in the 1kb upstream region of <i>N. attenuata</i> HAE-induced EDS genes revealed that at least 44.4% of the DTT-NIC1 insertions introduced W-box1 to the regulatory region of adjacent genes.

To reduce false positives, we performed additional analysis by identifying enriched motifs from 100 randomly selected subsets of genes from the negative dataset. These were then compared with the enriched motifs in the M4 module. We considered all of the enriched motifs from the M4 module that occurred in more than 5% of motifs identified from the random selected dataset as noise and removed them from downstream analysis.

The enrichment analysis of MITEs in 1kb upstream region of M4 module genes and associations between the MITEs and identified motifs were analyzed using permutation tests. For this, we randomly shuffled the insertion sites of MITEs 1000 times using the \u2018shuffle\u2019 function from the BEDTOOLS package (<a href=\"#bib76\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>). We then calculated the null models of MITEs insertion sites and overlaps between MITEs insertions and motif locations in the <i>N. attenuata</i> genome.

The authors use a comparative approach to identify well-conserved expression networks by examining expression patterns in multiple related Nicotiana species. The advantage of this approach is that it makes it possible to remove a great deal of noise. The authors demonstrate that one module, M4, is both highly conserved and is induced prior to JA induction. They also show that genes recruited to this module are much more likely to be retained following an ancient whole genome triplication in the Solanaceae, and are more likely to be associated with insertions of a particular transposable element in the region upstream of the gene. Overall, the expression analysis, along with associated hypothesis testing is impressive."
