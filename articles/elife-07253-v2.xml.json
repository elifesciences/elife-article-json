We identified a novel, evolutionarily diverse family of ER membrane proteins with StART-like lipid transfer domains and studied them in yeast. StART-like domains from Ysp2p and its paralog Lam4p specifically bind sterols, and Ysp2p, Lam4p and their homologs Ysp1p and Sip3p target punctate ER-PM contact sites distinct from those occupied by known ER-PM tethers. The activity of Ysp2p, reflected in amphotericin-sensitivity assays, requires its second StART-like domain to be positioned so that it can reach across ER-PM contacts. Absence of Ysp2p, Ysp1p or Sip3p reduces the rate at which exogenously supplied sterols traffic from the PM to the ER. Our data suggest that these StART-like proteins act <i>in trans</i> to mediate a step in sterol exchange between the PM and ER."

We identified a novel, evolutionarily diverse family of ER membrane proteins with StART-like lipid transfer domains and studied them in yeast. StART-like domains from Ysp2p and its paralog Lam4p specifically bind sterols, and Ysp2p, Lam4p and their homologs Ysp1p and Sip3p target punctate ER-PM contact sites distinct from those occupied by known ER-PM tethers. The activity of Ysp2p, reflected in amphotericin-sensitivity assays, requires its second StART-like domain to be positioned so that it can reach across ER-PM contacts. Absence of Ysp2p, Ysp1p or Sip3p reduces the rate at which exogenously supplied sterols traffic from the PM to the ER. Our data suggest that these StART-like proteins act <i>in trans</i> to mediate a step in sterol exchange between the PM and ER."

The most important membrane is the external one that surrounds cells and keeps the outside world out and cellular contents in. The single most common fat component in the external membrane is cholesterol, which makes the membrane rigid and better able to withstand the outside world. So even though excess cholesterol contributes to diseases such as heart disease, stroke and Alzheimer's, the external membrane of every cell needs about a billion cholesterol molecules for its normal function. But how do cells manage the traffic of these molecules to their destination?"

What is not known is how cholesterol moves to and fro between this network and the external membrane."

However, one of the missing supports for this theory is that no protein that transfers cholesterol across this gap has been found."

Further experiments showed that these proteins only bind to cholesterol out of all the fats. Next, Gatta, Wong, Sere et al. studied what the proteins do in cells, but instead of looking at the proteins in human cells they studied the related proteins in yeast. This is because the details of both the traffic of cholesterol and contacts between the internal network and the external membrane are in many respects understood better in yeast than in human cells."

Even for organelles linked by the secretory pathway, non-vesicular mechanisms dominate for both phospholipids and sterol (<a href=\"#bib19\">Holthuis and Levine, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Voelker, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</a>). Sterols are critically important lipids that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked mainly to the plasma membrane (PM). Traffic is very fast (t\u00bd &lt; 5 min), bidirectional, and independent of the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pagano, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Simons and Ikonen, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mesmin et al., 2011</a>), so non-vesicular mechanisms must exist to transfer sterol across the cytoplasm between the ER and PM."

Models vary in the envisaged distance across which LTP-sterol complexes must diffuse. When the entire ER is considered to exchange lipid with the entire PM, the presumed diffusion distance is up to 50% of the cell diameter. Other models specify that LTPs only diffuse between ER and PM where they form membrane contact sites (MCSs) with interorganelle gaps \u223c30 nm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Helle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Prinz, 2014</a>). The ER forms MCSs with many organelles, and MCSs have become a significant subject of research as MCS-specific proteins have been identified. The dominant classes of MCS proteins are tethers (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lahiri et al., 2014</a>), regulators of calcium traffic (<a href=\"#bib60\">Takeshima et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wu et al., 2006</a>), lipid biosynthetic enzymes (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vance, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pichler et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tavassoli et al., 2013</a>), and LTPs including ceramide transfer protein (CERT) and oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) homologs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vihtelic et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Levine and Munro, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hanada et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Peretti et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rocha et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Maeda et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mesmin et al., 2013</a>).

Some of the best evidence relates to CERT and OSBP, which bind ceramide and sterol respectively. Both CERT and OSBP have FFAT motifs, and their recruitment causes VAP to redistribute from the whole ER into MCSs, indicating that CERT or OSBP is physically bridging the MCS (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mesmin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kumagai et al., 2014</a>). While CERT mediates non-vesicular ceramide traffic, there is some doubt that OSBP homologs mediate all sterol traffic because deleting Osh4, the major OSBP in yeast has no effect on ER \u2192 PM or PM \u2192 ER sterol transport (<a href=\"#bib48\">Raychaudhuri et al., 2006</a>) (Sullivan and Menon, unpublished).

In addition, its function requires anchoring to these sites in such a way that its StART-like domain can reach out across the contacts.

DHE closely mimics ergosterol, the major yeast sterol (<a href=\"#bib13\">Georgiev et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Maxfield and Wustner, 2012</a>) and acts as FRET acceptor for tryptophan with a F\u00f6rster radius of 1.6 nm (<a href=\"#bib31\">Loura et al., 2010</a>). One of the tryptophans in Lam4S2 and related sequences is in the predicted binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). All four StART-like domains that expressed as soluble proteins (Ysp2S1 and YspS2 from Ysp2p, Lam4S1 and Lam4S2 from Lam4p) were purified to &gt;95% purity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), and these proteins all produced strong FRET signals with DHE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This was not observed with denatured Lam4S2 or with a control protein (soybean trypsin inhibitor) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, and data not shown). The dissociation constant for binding was estimated at 0.5 \u00b5M (\u00b10.1) from a binding curve with DHE added in liposomes, as measured from the FRET signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). All four purified StART-like domains bound both cholesterol (the predominant sterol in mammals) and ergosterol (the predominant sterol in yeast) with similar affinity to DHE, as seen by a reduction in FRET of approximately 50% when DHE was mixed with an equal concentration of non-fluorescent sterol (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The sub-micromolar affinity for sterol is similar to other sterol transfer proteins such as Osh4p and Pry1p (<a href=\"#bib22\">Im et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Choudhary and Schneiter, 2012</a>)."

In contrast, PITP\u03b1 present in the same experiment extracted phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) but not cholesterol (data not shown). Therefore, the lack of recovery of the major phospholipids, including PC, PI, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), by Lam4S2 indicates that if it does bind phospholipids non-specifically (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schrick et al., 2014</a>), such binding can only be weak (Kd &gt;100 \u00b5M)."

Both proteins targeted puncta in the cell periphery in wild-type strains; identical patterns were seen in strains lacking the endogenous proteins (data not shown). Their paralogs Lam4p and Ysp1p showed the same pattern, also at low levels of expression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These peripheral puncta might either be on the PM or on the cortical ER (cER). In contrast to these four peripheral proteins, both Lam5p and Lam6p showed complex intracellular targeting to multiple MCSs, including the NVJ and ER-mitochondrial contacts (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

First we considered the effect of over-expression. For Ysp2p, high expression had little effect on its distribution (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). However, in cells highly expressing Sip3p, protein accumulated in the ER (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This suggests that Sip3p, and by extension Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Lam4p, target a saturable punctate subdomain of the cER. However, additional information is required to make a precise assignment because cER occupies a high proportion of the periphery in yeast, so co-localization with cER could be coincidental. To refine the localization data, we therefore genetically reduced the amount of cER using a strain lacking 90% of cER. In this \u2018\u2206tether\u2019 strain six proteins involved in ER-PM tethering are deleted, and the proportion of PM with cER is reduced from 40% to 4% with ER accumulation in the center of cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Manford et al., 2012</a>). In \u2206tether cells GFP-Ysp2p and GFP-Sip3p were still found in peripheral puncta, although these were less numerous compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). All puncta with GFP-Ysp2p were in close proximity to a strand of ER extending into the periphery, although each ER strand appeared in fewer confocal sections than the associated punctum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, arrows). The same was found for Ysp1p, Sip3p and Lam4p (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), indicating that all four proteins target ER-PM contacts that are distinct from those mediated by the six tether proteins previously identified."

Unexpectedly, this targeting resulted from just the Ysp2 C-terminal region (Ysp2CT), including the predicted luminal domain (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Similarly, for Ysp1, the C-terminus alone produced punctate targeting (data not shown). Also, because localization to ER-PM contacts is consistent with being embedded either in the PM or in the ER, we induced expression of GFP-Ysp2CT from the <i>GAL1</i> promoter after inactivating <i>SEC18</i> (yeast NSF). Despite the block in secretion, newly expressed Ysp2CT still localized to peripheral puncta, while a PM resident protein could only attain its normal distribution if expression was induced before inactivating <i>SEC18</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

Next, we found a much greater colocalization of Ysp2p with Sip3p with 87% of puncta being double positive (18 cells, 17.2 puncta per cell, s.d. 11%) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This was only true in low expressing cells, as overexpression of Sip3p caused delocalization of Ysp2p from puncta into the ER (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). For comparison, we examined other punctate cER markers, including the tricalbin Tcb2p, the most punctate of the known ER-PM tethers. Tcb2-GFP at endogenous levels did not significantly colocalize with Ysp2CT (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6B</a>). Similarly, other punctate cER proteins such as Lnp1p and viral TGBp3 did not colocalize with Ysp2CT (data not shown) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2012</a>).

Firstly, plasmid-borne GFP-tagged Ysp2p expressed from its own promoter restored AmB resistance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), showing that the construct localized to cER puncta is functional. Next, we looked for active domains within Ysp2p. By deleting regions of Ysp2p (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), we found that rescue of AmB-sensitive growth was affected most upon removing either the C-terminal anchor or the second StART-like domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). On the other hand, deletion of Ysp2S1 had no effect. This indicated that both the C-terminus and the second StART-like domain are necessary for Ysp2p function. We next determined which domains are sufficient for rescue. The C-terminus was inactive, even though it is sufficient for punctate cER localization, (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). In contrast, both Ysp2S1 and Ysp2S2 rescued AmB<sup>s</sup> growth, although these required over-expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), possibly because the constructs are diffusely cytoplasmic (data not shown). Therefore Ysp2S2 is the only component that is both necessary and sufficient, but it requires overexpression if it is cytoplasmic rather than membrane anchored."

Significantly, human GramD1a increased resistance to AmB in both mutant and wild-type cells. The conservation of activity from yeast to human strongly indicates that the StART-like domains are the active portions of this protein family.

Replacing G1205 in Ysp2p with alanine, threonine and arginine successively reduced the ability of Ysp2S2 to rescue AmB-sensitive growth (data not shown). Mutating the equivalent residue in Lam4S2 (G1119R) completely inhibited sterol binding in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), showing that this residue is indeed critical. Substitution of this G \u2192 R mutated domain abolished rescue of AmB sensitivity by Ysp2p (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), supporting a correlation between Ysp2p function and sterol binding by Ysp2S2. We next tested if the AmB-sensitive phenotype of <i>\u2206ysp2</i> cells could be rescued by a heterologous StART domain with very little sequence similarity to Ysp2S2, as was previously done for PITP/Sec14 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Skinner et al., 1993</a>). For this we expressed StART domains of human MLN64 (sterol-specific), PCTP (phosphatidylcholine-specific) and CERT (ceramide-specific) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The StART domain of MLN64 produced significant rescue, but the StART domains of PCTP and CERT did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This strongly supports the idea the function of Ysp2p resides in its interaction with sterol, rather than a specific protein\u2013protein interaction."

Ysp2S2 activity was completely inhibited when anchored to either mitochondria or the vacuole. It was slightly activated by anchoring throughout the ER, and greatly activated by anchoring either to ER-PM contacts (with Ysp2CT) or to the PM as a whole.

This distance is large compared to the size of the StART-like domain itself (diameter 2.5 nm). While Ysp2p may act to extract or sense ER sterol, that is, function <i>in cis</i>, we wondered if its function requires it to act <i>in trans</i> by reaching across ER-PM contacts. Since unstructured peptide chains can extend up to 0.38 nm per residue (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pillardy et al., 2001</a>), a linker between Ysp2S2 and a TMD anchor would need to be \u226540 aa to allow Ysp2S2 to cross the minimal 15 nm gap. We expressed constructs with Ysp2S2 linked to the generic ER anchor by unstructured linkers of varying length. Linkers of up to 10 aa (\u22644 nm) completely inhibited Ysp2S2. In contrast, YspS2 was active when the linker was 40 aa (\u226415 nm) or longer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). More stringent testing, achieved using a higher concentration of AmB, showed that the 40 aa linker was only partially active, and that Ysp2S2 with linkers of 71 aa (\u226427 nm) and 103 aa (\u226439 nm) was progressively more active (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

We metabolically labeled cells with [<sup>3</sup>H-methyl]-methionine for 4 min and either stopped the reaction immediately or chased the cells in excess unlabelled methionine for 15 min. At both time points we measured the ratio of radioactive ergosterol to total ergosterol (specific radioactivity, or SR) in purified PM fractions (SR<sub>PM</sub>) and in unfractionated extracts (SR<sub>cell</sub>). The amount of newly synthesized sterol in the PM was expressed as the relative specific ratio (RSR) = SR<sub>PM</sub>: SR<sub>cell</sub>. At long time points (90 min) RSR typically tends to 1, but even by the end of the pulse, RSR was 0.38 (s.d. 0.035, n = 5) in wild-type cells, which is similar to values achieved previously (<a href=\"#bib13\">Georgiev et al., 2011</a>).

DHE was loaded into the PM under hypoxic conditions and transport was initiated by exposing the cells to air. DHE esterification commenced after an initial lag period of 1 hr that was common to all strains tested. The rate of DHE esterification was reduced by \u223c40\u201350% in all of <i>\u2206ysp1</i>, <i>\u2206ysp2</i> and <i>\u2206sip3</i> cells, but not affected by <i>\u2206lam4, \u2206lam5</i> or <i>\u2206lam6</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and data not shown). We next assayed cholesterol import in the <i>upc2-1</i> strain background. The use of this background avoided the lengthy hypoxic induction used for DHE uptake, and because cholesterol is poorly tolerated in the yeast PM its flux through the import pathway leading to esterification is more rapid than for DHE (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Prinz, 2004</a>). Compared with the <i>upc2-1</i> parental strain, the rate of cholesterol esterification was reduced by 30\u201335% in both <i>\u2206ysp2</i> and <i>\u2206sip3</i> single deletes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

We also found that sterol esterification activity was not altered by deletion of Ysp2p and was marginally increased by loss of Ysp1p or Sip3p (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Another issue we investigated was whether loss of StART-like proteins altered overall ergosterol distribution, which could interfere with the kinetics of our assays (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Prinz, 2004</a>). Firstly, we measured the total amount of ergosterol in gradient fractions enriched for PM; this was not significantly changed in the delete strains (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Secondly, we assessed the organization of PM sterol, since changes in other lipids, especially sphingolipids, might lead to increased traffic of endogenous sterol that would compete with exogenous lipid (<a href=\"#bib55\">Simons and Ikonen, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Prinz, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Das et al., 2014</a>). The proportion of sterol that partitions into detergent\u2013insoluble complexes was unaffected by <i>\u2206ysp1</i>, <i>\u2206ysp2</i> or <i>\u2206sip3</i> deletions (54 \u00b1 1%, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Therefore, effects on the distribution and organization of ergosterol do not explain the effect of <i>\u2206ysp1</i>, <i>\u2206ysp2</i> and <i>\u2206sip3</i> on esterification of exogenous sterol. This leaves one major site of action of these proteins: they appear to act on the retrograde transport step itself, although we have not tested if their mechanism of action is direct or indirect."

Among the six yeast family members, the StART-like domains of Ysp2p and Lam4p specifically bind sterols, and the StART-like domains of GramD1a, Lam5p and Lam6p rescue AmB<sup>s</sup> growth, indicating that these too bind sterol. We were not able to test the StART-like domains of Ysp1p and Sip3p as they were poorly expressed, but since the AmB<sup>s</sup> phenotype of <i>\u2206ysp1</i> and <i>\u2206sip3</i> cells could be rescued by sterol-specific StART-like domains (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), it appears that these proteins also bind sterols. Thus, all members of this new protein family in yeast and humans may be specific for sterol."

Ysp1p, Ysp2p, Sip3p and Lam4p reside in puncta in the cER network that may define a novel class of ER-PM contact sites, while Lam5p and Lam6p target internal MCSs. This suggests that the fundamental molecular feature for members of this family is being a <b><span class=\"underline\">l</span></b>ipid transfer protein <b><span class=\"underline\">a</span></b>nchored at a <b><span class=\"underline\">m</span></b>embrane contact site (hence \u2018LAM\u2019). Previous studies of Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Sip3p antedated the prediction of StART-like domains (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lesage et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pozniakovsky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sokolov et al., 2006</a>), and we suggest providing a uniform nomenclature in the future by renaming these Lam1-3p respectively. Little is known about the human proteins, except that variation at the GramD1b locus is linked to lymphoma/leukemia (<a href=\"#bib12\">Di Bernardo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Conde et al., 2010</a>), and we suggest renaming GramD1a-c as hLAMa-c. Intriguingly, the one LAM gene to have previously been linked to lipids is <i>LAM4</i>, which we previously identified in a random transposon screen as one of 20 genes involved in sterol import (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sullivan et al., 2009</a>). Although <i>\u2206lam4</i> has no sterol traffic defect, this might be explained by its lower level of expression compared to Ysp2p, so the previous results suggest that transposon insertion in <i>LAM4</i> can produce a dominant negative effect."

Nevertheless, the co-localization of Sip3p with Ysp2p, and the fact that altered levels of Sip3p cause redistribution of Ysp2p suggest that these proteins interact. It is possible that they target a specific class of ER-PM contact site, similar to the sub-division of ER-mitochondria contacts into regions with different molecular components (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lahiri et al., 2014</a>). However targeting to puncta by Ysp2p does not appear to require stoichiometric interaction with Sip3p, as highly overexpressed Ysp2p remains punctate (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Furthermore, <i>\u2206sip3</i> has a much greater polyene sensitivity than <i>\u2206ysp2</i>, even though the two mutants have similar retrograde sterol defects, which indicates that the these proteins have significant non-overlapping functions."

The activity of the StART-like domain of Ysp2S2 was maximized by anchoring it to either PM or ER with a linker of \u2265100 aa. With a linker of 10 aa (\u22644 nm) it was completely inactive, even though this is long enough for the domain to access lipids <i>in cis</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schulz et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, when anchored in the ER, Ysp2S2 function appears to function <i>in trans</i>. The activity of Ysp2S2 increased as the linker was extended from 40 aa (\u226415 nm) to 103 aa (\u226439 nm). However, linkers in the StART-like proteins are 55\u201375 aa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), similar to TULIPs (45\u201375 aa), which are also membrane anchored (<a href=\"#bib62\">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schauder et al., 2014</a>). Since the natural linkers are shorter than those we needed for maximal activation of artificial Ysp2S2\u2013TMD constructs, other factors, such as the accessory domains found commonly in this family, may contribute to activation in vivo. Hydrophobic loops of C2 domains and of PH-like domains penetrate into membranes to destabilize them (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ramachandran et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Paddock et al., 2011</a>), which may disturb the local bilayer and contribute to function."

Their mode of action might be indirect and regulatory, or they themselves might directly mediate sterol transfer. This lack of certainty arises because our assays of retrograde transport can be affected by sterol partitioning within the PM (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Prinz, 2004</a>). A key experimental question for the future will be to develop a new biophysical approach that shows how many sterol molecules that traffic between PM and ER actually pass into (and out of) the pocket of one of these LTPs. We have also not established how polyene sensitivity arises in cells lacking the StART-like proteins. Studies in pathogenic fungi (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vincent et al., 2013</a>) and in sphingolipid mutants (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>) suggest that AmB sensitivity might be accompanied by gross biophysical change in sterol levels or extractability respectively, but this was not found. Mutations of several different <i>ERG</i>osterol biosynthetic genes in pathogenic fungi induce clinically relevant polyene resistance that is mediated by a range of stress responses to reduced sterol (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vincent et al., 2013</a>). However the situation may be different in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> where deletions of single non-essential <i>ERG</i> genes do not induce polyene resistance, and one deletant is sensitive to both AmB and nystatin (<i>\u2206erg4</i>: 38th out of 4130 deletion strains tested) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</a>). As for altered sphingolipid metabolism, which can affect sterol traffic and AmB sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Prinz, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Das et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>), this has been linked to Pmp3p, a conserved small hydrophobic PM protein of unknown function (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bari et al., 2015</a>). However, Pmp3 only affects sensitivity to AmB not other polyenes, so it seems likely that LTPs anchored at MCSs, mutants of which are sensitive to all polyenes, act in a separate pathway."

Titration of DHE binding to Lam4S2 (WT and G1119R, 1.1 \u00b5M) was carried out by incubation with 100 nm diameter liposomes composed of 40% PC, 20% DOPE, 10% PS and 30% DHE. In all cases protein was incubated with lipids for up to 30 min and fluorescence measured with excitation of 295 nm (slit 5 nm). The FRET response was calculated after deducting DHE alone background, as the ratio between the DHE emission peak (373 nm) and the tryptophan emission peak (340 nm). Curve fitting was carried out using Prism software."

For the major phospholipids (PC, PS, PI and PE) we note that there was no extraction of radiolabelled lipid by Lam4S2 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. Here all of PC, PS, PI and PE were present and labelled to levels equal to (or above) that of cholesterol.
