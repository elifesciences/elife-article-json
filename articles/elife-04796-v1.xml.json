The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012 were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altimetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Biomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasis\u2019 by Goetz and colleagues, published in <i>Cell</i> in 2011 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>). The key experiments being replicated are those reported in Figures 7C (a-d), Supplemental Figure S2A, and Supplemental Figure S7C (a-c) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>). In these experiments, which are a subset of all the experiments reported in the original publication, Goetz and colleagues show in a subcutaneous xenograft model that stromal caveolin-1 remodels the intratumoral microenvironment, which is correlated with increased metastasis formation. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a> and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012 were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altimetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Biomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasis\u2019 by Goetz and colleagues, published in <i>Cell</i> in 2011 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>). The key experiments being replicated are those reported in Figures 7C (a-d), Supplemental Figure S2A, and Supplemental Figure S7C (a-c) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>). In these experiments, which are a subset of all the experiments reported in the original publication, Goetz and colleagues show in a subcutaneous xenograft model that stromal caveolin-1 remodels the intratumoral microenvironment, which is correlated with increased metastasis formation. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a> and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

                        "text": "The importance of the tumor microenvironment in cancer progression is well established. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one subset of cells found in the tumor stroma that help to regulate tumor progression and metastasis through several mechanisms such as remodeling of the extracellular matrix, secretion of growth factors and chemokines, and regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kalluri and Zeisberg, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cirri and Chiarugi, 2011</a>). Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is an essential component of caveolae and regulator of lipid raft formation that plays an important role in tumor progression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Goetz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sotgia et al., 2012</a>). However, the precise role of Cav1 in tumor progression appears to be unclear, with studies showing both increased and decreased expression in various types of cancer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</a>). One possible model is a general trend in which Cav1 appears to act as a tumor suppressor at early stages of cancer progression, but is up-regulated in several multidrug-resistant and metastatic cancer cell lines and human tumor specimens, positively correlating with tumor stage and grade in numerous cancer types (<a href=\"#bib19\">Shatz and Liscovitch, 2008</a>). Part of this variability could stem from Cav1 expression in stromal rather than tumor cells. For instance, loss of Cav1 function in stromal cells of various organs leads to benign stromal lesions responsible for abnormal growth and differentiation of the epithelium and to dramatic reductions in life span (<a href=\"#bib23\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). Goetz and colleagues, reported that Cav1 expression in fibroblasts remodeled the extracellular matrix to regulate cell shape and to stimulate migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro, and promote tumor growth and metastasis in vivo in a p190RhoGAP dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>)."

Figure 7Ca presents a graphical illustration of the experimental procedure. Primary tumor growth and metastatic tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescent imaging in vivo or ex vivo in extracted organs. Further, immunostaining of primary tumors was utilized to analyze the fiber alignment and organization of the tumor stroma in the presence of WT or Cav1 KO pMEFs, as alignment of collagen fibers in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to enhance tumor cell migration and invasion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amatangelo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Provenzano et al., 2006</a>). It is important to note that the authors also performed shRNA knock down of p190RhoGAP in Cav1 KO pMEFs to show that the effects of Cav1 KO on metastasis could be reversed by knock down of p190RhoGAP in Cav1 KO pMEFs. This replication study will only address the effects of Cav1 expression in tumor stroma and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment matrix, and will not replicate the effects of p190RhoGAP in this model."

The loss of Cav1 in the Cav1 KO pMEFs (Figure 7Ca), lead to an increase in smooth muscle actin (SMA) compared to Cav1 WT pMEFs, which is an indicator of increased activation and extra cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling capabilities of the generated pMEFs (Supplemental Figure S2A) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>). These pMEFs were used in a subcutaneous tumorigenicity assay, with representative bioluminescent images of primary tumors in vivo or ex vivo in extracted organs reported in Figure 7Cc. Bioluminescence of the primary tumors or metastatic foci in each organ was quantified and shown in Figure 7Cb or Supplemental Figure S7Ca. Goetz and colleagues evaluated metastatic tumor growth where they reported an increase in metastatic foci when tumor cells were coinjected with WT pMEFs compared to tumor cells alone or tumor cells coinjected with Cav1 KO pMEFs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>). While not the main focus of this experiment they did not observe a difference in primary tumor growth between these conditions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>). This experiment is important to replicate because it tests the central tenet of the paper, namely that Cav1 expression in stromal fibroblasts contributes to increased metastasis of tumors. This experiment is replicated in Protocol 3."

In a related study, subcutaneous injection of B16 melanoma cells in Cav1 KO mice resulted in a reduced tumor growth compared to injection of tumor cells in WT mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chang et al., 2009</a>). Another study, which focused on the size of the primary tumors opposed to metastasis, reported that intradermal coinjection of nude mice with B16F10 melanoma cells and Cav1 KO neonatal dermal fibroblasts increased primary tumor growth when compared to coinjection of tumor cells with WT fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Capozza et al., 2012</a>). While no known direct replications of the original study have been reported, several studies have assessed the role of stromal Cav1 expression in different types of tumors, with some studies reporting high Cav1 expression correlated with poor patient survival (<a href=\"#bib11\">Linke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Righi et al., 2014</a>), and others reporting low Cav1 expression in the stroma negatively correlated with survival (<a href=\"#bib20\">Simpkins et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ma et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ren et al., 2014</a>)."

Supplemental Figure S7Cc shows the results of quantification of fibronectin and SMA fiber alignment as well as cell shape. Goetz and colleagues also show in Figure 7Cd that metastasis correlates with the degree of fibronectin fiber alignment in the tumor stroma. These figures are important to replicate as they show that Cav1 expression in fibroblasts contributes to remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in vivo, and that this remodeling correlates with the amount of metastasis. These experiments are replicated in Protocol 4."

They claim that there is a contradiction between the tested paper (Goetz et al. Cell 2011) and another one by the Lisanti group: \u201cIn contrast to these findings, Capozzo and colleagues showed that intradermal coinjection of nude mice with B16F10 melanoma cells and Cav1 KO neonatal dermal fibroblasts increased primary tumor growth when compared to coinjection of tumor cells with WT fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Capozza et al., 2012</a>).\u201d We disagree that there is conflict here, since the original paper by Goetz et al. was focused on studying changes in stromal remodeling and, as a consequence of them, correlative changes in tumor local invasion and distant metastasis. The growth of the primary tumor was not the main focus of Goetz et al., and hence it was not as critically evaluated as ECM remodeling or metastasis, as it was the case for Capozza et al. Due to the nature of the allograft/xenograft experiments of Figure 7, focused on evaluating ECM remodeling and the appearance of metastasis, it was also possible to measure the size of the primary tumor, but this was not as critically monitored as the metastasis formation. Hence, we believe that it is not correct to claim that one of the main conclusions of the original paper is that the growth of the primary tumor is not affected by the absence of Cav1 expression in fibroblasts. Therefore, we believe is not correct to include primary tumor growth as one of the statistical analysis to be performed in protocol 2. In the experimental approach that Fiering et al. have chosen, the primary tumor growth was not significantly different between any of the studied conditions. However, primary tumor growth was decreased in the absence of Cav1 expression in mammary gland allografts (Figure 7A and S7A) and in mammary gland xenografts (Figure 7B and S7B). It is important to note that in these approaches, the whole mammary gland was deficient for Cav1 expression, not only the fibroblasts, and hence they are not exactly comparable. In the same regard, Capozza et al. used neonatal dermal fibroblasts, which are not exactly the same as MEFs. Further, Fiering et al. fail to cite other papers that apparently contradict Capozza et al. and are in line with results of Figure S7A and S7B. One example comes from the Dvorak group, which showed that subcutaneous injection of B16 melanoma cells in Cav1 KO mice leads to reduced tumor growth compared to injection of tumor cells in WT mice (Chang et al., Am J Path 2009). Fiering et al. should also cite this work, but, even more importantly, these differences highlight the complexity of this biological problem, and the potential difficulty to reproduce observations made in several labs."

No, and this is a critical issue that we have observed in reviewing the manuscript by Fiering et al. We do not agree with the selection of papers made to introduce the subject of Caveolin-1 expression in tumor stroma. The papers chosen belong mostly to the same group, which consistently reports Caveolin-1 as a tumor suppressor. However, caveolin-1 expression in cancer is a very controversial subject of research. There are thousands of papers and one can virtually find papers showing both increased and decreased expression in any particular type of cancer (Parton and del Pozo, Nature Reviews Mol Cell Biol 2013). A review that carefully evaluated caveolin-1 expression in multiple types of cancers from primary to metastatic stages, concluded a general trend in which Caveolin-1 appears to act as a tumor suppressor at early stages of cancer progression, but it is up-regulated in several multidrug-resistant and metastatic cancer cell lines and human tumor specimens, positively correlating with tumor stage and grade in numerous cancer types (Shatz and Liscovitch, Int J Radiat Biol 2008). One of the conclusions of the original article by Goetz et al. was that part of this variability could stem from Cav1 expression in stromal rather than tumor cells. In fact, the papers cited in the introduction plus some others are already confirming this."

Consistently, Goetz et al. showed that Cav1 expressed in fibroblasts can modulate normal cell morphology via force-dependent ECM remodelling. Thus, reports like Yang et al. showing that lack of stromal Cav1 could disturb normal tissue architecture should also be cited by Fiering et al."

These results are in line with the data of the original article on a breast cancer tissue microarray analysis (Figure 5C) showing that increased Cav1 in the stroma correlated with decreased survival. Moreover, Linke et al. have reported that stromal Cav1 (often surrounding \u201cnests\u201d of tumor cells) was a powerful univariate prognostic marker that remained significant in the context of a pre-existing multi-marker Breast Cancer diagnostic commercial profile (Linke SP, Krajewski S, Bremer TM, Man AK, Zeps N, Spalding L. \u201cStromal caveolin-1 is a powerful marker that further enhances a multi-marker prognostic profile\u201d.

They claim that there is a contradiction between the tested paper (Goetz et al.</i> <i>Cell 2011</i><i>) and another one by the Lisanti group:</i> \u201c<i>In contrast to these findings, Capozzo and colleagues showed that intradermal coinjection of nude mice with B16F10 melanoma cells and Cav1 KO neonatal dermal fibroblasts increased primary tumor growth when compared to coinjection of tumor cells with WT fibroblasts (</i><a href=\"#bib2\"><i>Capozza et al., 2012</i></a><i>).</i>\u201d <i>We disagree that there is conflict here, since the original paper by Goetz et al. was focused on studying changes in stromal remodeling and, as a consequence of them, correlative changes in tumor local invasion and distant metastasis. The growth of the primary tumor was not the main focus of Goetz et al., and hence it was not as critically evaluated as ECM remodeling or metastasis, as it was the case for Capozza et al. Due to the nature of the allograft/xenograft experiments of Figure 7, focused on evaluating ECM remodeling and the appearance of metastasis, it was also possible to measure the size of the primary tumor, but this was not as critically monitored as the metastasis formation. Hence, we believe that it is not correct to claim that one of the main conclusions of the original paper is that the growth of the primary tumor is not affected by the absence of Cav1 expression in fibroblasts. Therefore, we believe is not correct to include primary tumor growth as one of the statistical analysis to be performed in protocol 2. In the experimental approach that Fiering et al. have chosen, the primary tumor growth was not significantly different between any of the studied conditions. However, primary tumor growth was decreased in the absence of Cav1 expression in mammary gland allografts (</i><i>Figure 7A and S7A</i><i>) and in mammary gland xenografts (</i><i>Figure 7B and S7B</i><i>). It is important to note that in these approaches, the whole mammary gland was deficient for Cav1 expression, not only the fibroblasts, and hence they are not exactly comparable. In the same regard, Capozza et al. used neonatal dermal fibroblasts, which are not exactly the same as MEFs. Further, Fiering et al. fail to cite other papers that apparently contradict Capozza et al. and are in line with results of</i> <i>Figure S7A and S7B</i><i>. One example comes from the Dvorak group, which showed that subcutaneous injection of B16 melanoma cells in Cav1 KO mice leads to reduced tumor growth compared to injection of tumor cells in WT mice (Chang et al., Am J Path 2009). Fiering et al. should also cite this work, but, even more importantly, these differences highlight the complexity of this biological problem, and the potential difficulty to reproduce observations made in several labs.</i>"
