Cortical oscillations have been proposed as instruments of sensory <i>de-multiplexing</i>, i.e., the parallel processing of different frequency streams in sensory signals. Yet their causal role in such a process has never been demonstrated. Here, we used a neural microcircuit model to address whether coupled theta\u2013gamma oscillations, as observed in human auditory cortex, could underpin the multiscale sensory analysis of speech. We show that, in continuous speech, theta oscillations can flexibly track the syllabic rhythm and temporally organize the phoneme-level response of gamma neurons into a code that enables syllable identification. The tracking of slow speech fluctuations by theta oscillations, and its coupling to gamma-spiking activity both appeared as critical features for accurate speech encoding. These results demonstrate that cortical oscillations can be a key instrument of speech de-multiplexing, parsing, and encoding."

Cortical oscillations have been proposed as instruments of sensory <i>de-multiplexing</i>, i.e., the parallel processing of different frequency streams in sensory signals. Yet their causal role in such a process has never been demonstrated. Here, we used a neural microcircuit model to address whether coupled theta\u2013gamma oscillations, as observed in human auditory cortex, could underpin the multiscale sensory analysis of speech. We show that, in continuous speech, theta oscillations can flexibly track the syllabic rhythm and temporally organize the phoneme-level response of gamma neurons into a code that enables syllable identification. The tracking of slow speech fluctuations by theta oscillations, and its coupling to gamma-spiking activity both appeared as critical features for accurate speech encoding. These results demonstrate that cortical oscillations can be a key instrument of speech de-multiplexing, parsing, and encoding."

Sensory signals are often made of different rhythmic streams organized at multiple timescales, which require to be processed in parallel and recombined to achieve unified perception. Speech constitutes an example of such a physical complexity, in which different rhythms index linguistic representations of different granularities, from phoneme to syllables and words (<a href=\"#bib66\">Rosen, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zion Golumbic et al., 2012</a>). Before meaning can be extracted from continuous speech, two critical pre-processing steps need to be carried out: a de-multiplexing step, i.e., the parallel analysis of each constitutive rhythm, and a parsing step, i.e., the discretization of the acoustic signal into linguistically relevant chunks that can be individually processed (<a href=\"#bib70\">Stevens, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Poeppel, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ghitza, 2011</a>). While parsing is presumably modulated in a top-down way, by knowing a priori through developmental learning (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ngon et al., 2013</a>) where linguistic boundaries should lie, it is likely largely guided by speech acoustic dynamics. It has recently been proposed that speech de-multiplexing and parsing could both be handled in a bottom-up way by the combined action of auditory cortical oscillations in distinct frequency ranges, enabling parallel computations at syllabic and phonemic timescales (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ghitza, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</a>). Intrinsic coupling across cortical oscillations of distinct frequencies, as observed in electrophysiological recordings of auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lakatos et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fontolan et al., 2014</a>), could enable the hierarchical combination of syllabic- and phonemic-scale computations, subsequently restoring the natural arrangement of phonemes within syllables (<a href=\"#bib25\">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</a>)."

Since the syllabic rate coincides with the auditory cortex theta rhythm (3\u20138 Hz), syllable boundaries could be viably signalled by a given <i>phase</i> in the theta cycle. The relevance of speech tracking by the theta neural rhythm (<a href=\"#bib29\">Henry et al., 2014</a>) is highlighted by experimental data showing that speech intelligibility depends on the degree of phase-locking of the theta-range neural activity in auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Peelle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gross et al., 2013</a>).

The control of gamma by theta oscillations could hence both modulate the excitability of gamma neurons to devote more processing power to the informative parts of syllabic sound patterns, and constitute a reference time frame aligned on syllabic contours for interpreting gamma-based phonemic processing (<a href=\"#bib68\">Shamir et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ghitza, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kayser et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Panzeri et al., 2014</a>)."

One way to address a causal role of oscillations in speech processing is computational modelling, as it permits to directly test the efficiency of cross-coupled theta and gamma oscillations as an instrument of speech de-multiplexing, parsing, and encoding. Previous models of speech processing involved only gamma oscillations in the context of isolated speech segments (<a href=\"#bib68\">Shamir et al., 2009</a>) or did not involve neural oscillations at all (<a href=\"#bib28\">G\u00fctig and Sompolinsky, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yildiz et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, previous models of cross-frequency coupled oscillations did not address sensory functions as parsing and de-multiplexing (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jensen and Lisman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tort et al., 2007</a>). Here, we examined how a biophysically inspired model of coupled theta and gamma neural oscillations can process continuous speech (spoken sentences). Specifically, we determined: (i) whether theta oscillations are able to accurately parse speech into syllables, (ii) whether syllable-related theta signal may serve as a reference time frame to improve gamma-based decoding of continuous speech; (iii) whether this decoding requires theta to modulate the activity of the gamma network. To address the last two points, we compared speech decoding performance of the model with two control versions of the network, in which we removed the neural connection entraining the theta neurons by speech fluctuations or the link that couples them to the gamma neurons."

We used the well documented Pyramidal Interneuron Gamma (PING) model for implementing a gamma network: bursts of inhibitory neurons immediately follow bursts of excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jadi and Sejnowski, 2014</a>), creating the overall spiking rhythm. Given that gamma and theta oscillations are both locally present in superficial cortical layers (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lakatos et al., 2005</a>), we assume similar local generation mechanisms for theta and gamma with a direct connection between them. Direct evidence for a local generation of theta oscillations in auditory cortex is still scarce (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ainsworth et al., 2011</a>) and we cannot completely rule out that they might spread from remote generators (e.g., in the hippocampus; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tort et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kopell et al., 2010</a>). Yet, we built the case for local generation from the following facts: (1) neocortical (somatosensory) theta oscillations are observed in vitro (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fanselow et al., 2008</a>), (2) MEG, EEG, and combined EEG/FMRI recordings in humans show that theta activity phase-locks to speech amplitude envelope in A1 and immediate association cortex\u2014but not beyond\u2014(<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cogan and Poeppel, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Morillon et al., 2012</a>), and (3) theta phase-locking to speech is not accompanied by power increase, arguing for a phase restructuring of a local oscillation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</a>). We assumed a similar generation mechanism for theta and gamma oscillations, with slower excitatory and inhibitory synaptic time constants for theta (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kopell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vierling-Claassen et al., 2010</a>). The distinct dynamics for the two modules reflect the diversity of inhibitory synaptic timescales observed experimentally, with Martinotti cells displaying slow synaptic inhibition (<i>Ti</i> neurons), and basket cells showing faster inhibition decay (<i>Gi</i> neurons) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</a>). We refer to the theta network as Pyramidal Interneuron Theta (PINTH), by analogy with PING. The full model is hence composed of a theta-generating module with interconnected spiking excitatory (<i>Te</i>) and inhibitory (<i>Ti</i>) neurons that spontaneously synchronize at theta frequency (6\u20138 Hz) through slow decaying inhibition; and of a gamma-generating module with excitatory (<i>Ge</i>) and inhibitory (<i>Gi</i>) neurons that burst at a faster rate (25\u201345 Hz) synchronized by fast decaying inhibition (PING; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00f6rgers and Kopell, 2005</a>). The firing pattern of our simulated neurons is sparse and weakly synchronous at rest, consistent with the low spiking rate of cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brunel and Wang, 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Unlike the classical 50\u201380 Hz PING seen in in vitro preparations of rat auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ainsworth et al., 2011</a>), our network produced a lower gamma frequency around 30 Hz, as observed in human auditory cortex in response to speech (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nourski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Pasley et al., 2012</a>)."

Both the <i>Te</i> and <i>Ge</i> populations receive projections from a \u2018subcortical\u2019 module that mimics the nonlinear filtering of acoustic input by subcortical structures, which primarily includes a signal decomposition into 32 auditory channels (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chi et al., 2005</a>). Individual excitatory neurons in the theta module received channel-averaged input while those in the gamma module received frequency selective input. Such a differential selectivity was motivated by experimental observations from intracranial recordings (<a href=\"#bib53\">Morillon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fontolan et al., 2014</a>) suggesting that unlike the gamma one, the theta response does not depend on the input spectrum. It also mirrors the dissociation in primate auditory cortex between a population of 'stereotyped' neurons responding very rapidly and non-selectively to any acoustic stimulus (putatively <i>Te</i> neurons) and a population of 'modulated' neurons responding selectively to specific spectro-temporal features (putatively <i>Ge</i> neurons) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brasselet et al., 2012</a>). Each <i>Ge</i> neuron receives input from one specific channel, preserving the auditory tonotopy, so that the whole <i>Ge</i> population represents the rich spectral structure of the stimulus. Each <i>Te</i> neuron receives input from all the channels, i.e., the <i>Te</i> population conveys a widely tuned temporal signal capturing slow stimulus fluctuations. Importantly, the two oscillating modules are connected through all-to-all connections from <i>Te</i> neurons to <i>Ge</i> neurons allowing the theta oscillations to control the activity of the faster gamma oscillations. This structure enables syllable boundary detection (through the theta module) to constrain the decoding of faster phonemic information. The output of the network is taken from the <i>Ge</i> neurons as we assume that the <i>Ge</i> neurons provide the input to higher-level cortical structures performing operations like phoneme categorization and providing access to lexicon. Accordingly, in the model the <i>Ge</i> neurons receive more spectral details about speech than the <i>Te</i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). <i>Ge</i> spiking is then referenced with respect to timing of theta spikes, and submitted to decoding algorithms."

As expected from its architecture and biophysical parameters (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), the neural network produced activity in theta (6\u20138 Hz) and low gamma (25\u201345 Hz) ranges, both at rest and during speech presentation. Consistent with experimental observations (<a href=\"#bib47\">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</a>) there was no notable increase in theta spiking during speech presentation, but sentence onsets induced a phase-locking of theta oscillations as shown by the Post-stimulus time histograms of theta neurons, which was further enhanced by all edges in speech envelope. Consequently, the resulting global evoked activity followed the acoustic envelope of the speech signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrams et al., 2008</a>). Local Field Potential (LFP) indexes the global synaptic activity over the network (excitatory neurons of both networks) and its dynamics closely followed spiking dynamics. Unlike the LFP theta power pattern, the LFP theta phase pattern was robust across repetitions of the same sentence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,C,E</a>), replicating LFP behaviour from the primate auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kayser et al., 2009</a>), and human MEG data (<a href=\"#bib47\">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Luo et al., 2010</a>). In line with other empirical data from human auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nourski et al., 2009</a>) gamma oscillations followed the onset of sentences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Owing to the feed-forward connection from the theta to the gamma sub-circuits, the gamma amplitude was coupled to the theta phase both at rest and during speech (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The coupling was visible both in the spiking (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and LFP signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Critically, this coupling disappeared when the theta/gamma connection was removed, showing that a common input to <i>Te</i> and <i>Ge</i> cells is not sufficient to couple the two oscillations."

This first study was based on a corpus consisting of 4620 phonetically labelled English sentences (TIMIT <a href=\"#bib44\">Linguistic Data Consortium, 1993</a>). The acoustic analysis of these sentences confirmed a correspondence between the dominant peak of the speech modulation spectrum and the mean syllabic rate (3\u20136 Hz) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereby syllabic boundaries correspond to trough in speech slow fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib61\">Peelle et al., 2013</a>). The theta network in the model (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) was explicitly designed to exploit such regularities and infer syllable boundaries. When presenting sentences to the theta module, we observed a consistent theta burst within 50 ms following syllable onset followed by a locking of theta oscillations to theta acoustic fluctuations in the speech signal (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). More importantly, neuronal theta bursts closely aligned to the timing of syllable boundaries in the presented sentences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We compared the performance of the theta network to that of two alternative models also susceptible to predict syllable boundaries: a simple linear-nonlinear acoustic boundary detector (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) and Mermelstein algorithm, a state-of-the-art model which, unlike the model developed here, only permits \u2018off-line\u2019 syllable boundary detection (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mermelstein, 1975</a>). The theta network performed better than both the linear model and the Mermelstein algorithm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, all p-values &lt;10<sup>\u221212</sup>). Similar to results from behavioural studies of human perception (<a href=\"#bib50\">Miller et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nourski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mukamel et al., 2011</a>) the theta network could adapt to different speech rates. The model performed better than other algorithms, with a syllabic alignment accuracy remaining well above chance levels (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221212</sup>) in the twofold and threefold time compression conditions.

Here, sentence onset was defined as the time when speech envelope first reached a given threshold (1000 a.u.). Spikes counts are then averaged in 20 ms bins, showing that this neuron displays a strong activity peak 0\u201360 ms after sentence onset.

We first quantified the model's ability to encode stimuli designed as simple temporal patterns. We used 50 ms sawtooth stimuli whose shape was parametrically varied by changing the peak position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), with interstimulus interval between 50 and 250 ms. This toy set of stimuli was previously used in a gamma-based speech encoding model and argued to represent idealized formant transitions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Shamir et al., 2009</a>). We extracted spike patterns from all the <i>Ge</i> (output) neurons from \u221220 ms before each sawtooth onset to 20 ms after its offset. This procedure is referred to as \u2018stimulus timing\u2019 since it uses the stimulus onset as time reference. Using a clustering method (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we observed that the identity of the presented sawtooth could be decoded from the output spike patterns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) with over 60% accuracy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, light grey bar). We also computed the decoding performance when we used an internal time reference provided by the theta timing rather than by the stimulus timing. When spike patterns were analysed within a window defined by two successive theta bursts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, dark grey bar), sawtooth decoding was still possible and even relatively well preserved (mean decoding rate of 41.7%). Noise in the theta module allows the alignment of theta bursts to stimulus onset and thus improves detection performance by enabling consistent theta chunking of spike patterns."

We therefore set out to classify syllables from natural sentences. To decode <i>Ge</i> spiking, we used similar procedures as for the encoding/decoding of simple temporal patterns. Output <i>Ge</i> spikes were parsed into spike patterns based on the theta chunks, and the decoding analysis was used to recover syllable identity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To evaluate the importance of the precise spike timing of gamma neurons, we compared decoding (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) using spike <i>patterns</i> (i.e., spikes labelled with their precise timing w.r.t. chunk onset) vs those obtained from plain spike <i>counts</i> (i.e., unlabelled spikes). When using spike patterns syllable decoding reached a high level of accuracy in the intact model: 58% of syllables were correctly classified within a set of 10 possible (randomly chosen) syllables (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Syllable decoding dropped when using spike counts instead of spike patterns (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221212</sup>).

We used a similar decoding procedure as above, but here the classifier was trained on different speakers pronouncing the same two sentences. Theta chunks were classified into syllables based on the network response to the two sentences uttered by 99 other speakers. The material included sentences spoken by 462 speakers of various ethnic and geographical origins, showing a marked heterogeneity in phonemic realization and syllable durations (as labelled by phoneticians). The syllable duration distribution was skewed with the median at 200 ms and tail values ranging from a few ms to over 800 ms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Given that theta activity is meant to operate in a 3\u20139 Hz range, i.e., integrate speech chunks of about 100\u2013300 ms (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ghitza, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2014</a>), we did not expect the model to perform equally well along the whole syllable duration range. Accordingly, decoding accuracy was not uniform across the whole syllable duration range. When decoding from spike pattern, the intact model allowed 24% accuracy (chance level at 10%). It showed a peak in performance in the range in which it is expected to operate, i.e., for syllables durations between 100 and 300 ms. Given the cross-speaker phonemic variability such a performance is fairly good. Critically, the intact model outperformed control models both within the 100 to 300 ms range (p &lt; 0.001), and throughout the whole syllable duration span (p &lt; 0.001). These analyses overall show that the model can flexibly track syllables within a physiological operating window, and that syllable decoding relies on the integrity of the model architecture."

Altogether, the decoding of syllables from continuous speech showed that coupled theta and gamma oscillations provide a viable instrument for syllable parsing and decoding, and that its performance relies on the coupling between the two oscillation networks."

We compared the MI between the stimulus and neural activity in individual <i>Ge</i> neurons as a function of the length of stimulus window, using four neural codes: spike count, time-partitioned code, phase-partitioned code combined with spike count and finally combined phase- and time-partitioned codes. These codes are qualitatively equivalent to the decoding strategies used in the previous classifier analysis. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> shows that taking into account the spike phase boosts the MI carried by the <i>Spike count code</i> or the <i>Time-partitioned code</i> alone (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221212</sup> for all 6 window sizes). In other words, spike phase provided additional rather than redundant information to more traditional codes. The gain provided by spike phase increased when enlarging the window and when combined with either spike count or spike pattern (<i>Spike Count</i> vs <i>Time-partitioned</i>; <i>Spike count and Phase-partitioned code</i> vs <i>Time- and Phase-partitioned code</i>).

Using a biophysically inspired model of auditory cortex function, we show that cortical theta\u2013gamma cross-frequency coupling provides a means of using the timing of syllables to orchestrate the readout of speech-induced gamma activity. The current modelling data demonstrate that theta bursts generated by a theta (PINTH) network can predict \u2018on-line\u2019 syllable boundaries at least as accurately as state-of-the-art offline syllable detection algorithms. Syllable boundary detection by a theta network hence provides an endogenous time reference for speech decoding. Our simulated data further show that a gamma biophysical network, receiving a spectral decomposition of speech as input, can take advantage of the theta time reference to encode fast phonemic information. The central result of our work is that the gamma network could efficiently encode temporal patterns (from simple sawtooths to natural speech), as long as it was entrained by the theta rhythm driven by syllable boundaries. The proposed theta/gamma network displayed sophisticated spectral and encoding properties that compared both qualitatively and quantitatively to existing neurophysiological evidence including cross-frequency coupling properties (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</a>) and theta-referenced stimulus encoding (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kayser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2012</a>). The projections from the <i>Te</i> to <i>Ge</i> neurons endowed the network with phase-amplitude and phase-frequency coupling between gamma and theta oscillations, at both the spike and the LFP levels (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jensen and Colgin, 2007</a>). This closely reproduces the theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling observed from intracortical recordings (<a href=\"#bib25\">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lakatos et al., 2005</a>). Importantly, due to the dissociation of excitatory populations we obtained denser gamma spiking immediately after the theta burst evoked by the syllable onset. This validates a critical point of theta/gamma parsing system, namely that a more in-depth encoding is carried-out by the auditory cortex during the early phase of syllables, when more information needs to be extracted (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</a>)."

Importantly, it is relatively insensitive to the speed at which speech is being produced. Speech can double in speed from one speaker to another and yet remain intelligible up to an artificial compression factor of 3 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar et al., 2001</a>). In the current model, theta bursts could still signal syllable boundaries when speech was compressed by a factor 2 and this alignment deteriorated for higher compression factors. Syllable decoding was significantly degraded for compressed speech, yet remained twice as accurate as chance. Our network is purely bottom-up and does not include high level linguistic processes and representations, which in all likelihood plays an important role in speech perception (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Peelle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gagnepain et al., 2012</a>): its relative resilience to speech compression is thus a fairly good performance. A previous model (<a href=\"#bib28\">G\u00fctig and Sompolinsky, 2009</a>) proposed a neural code that was robust to speech warping, based on the notion that individual neurons correct for speech rate by their overall level of activity. While this model achieved very good speech categorization performance, it relied on extremely precise spiking behaviour (neurons spiked only once, when their associated channel reached a certain threshold), for which neurophysiological evidence is scarce. Another model developed by Hopfield proposes that a low gamma external current provides encoding neurons with reliable timing and dynamical memory spanning up to 200 ms, a long enough window to integrate information over a full syllable (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hopfield, 2004</a>). The utility of gamma oscillations for precise spiking is arguably similar in both Hopfield's model and ours, whereas the syllable integration process is irregularly ensured by intermittent traces of recent (\u223c200 ms) neural activity in Hopfield's, and in ours by regularly spaced theta bursts that are locked to the speech signal. The advantage of our model is that integration over long speech segments is <i>permanently</i> enabled by the phase of output spikes with respect to the ongoing theta oscillation. Our approach shows that accurate encoding can be achieved using a system that does not require explicit memory processes, and in which the temporal integration buffer is only emulated by a slow neural oscillator aligned to speech dynamics."

Because syllabic contours are reflected in the slow modulations of speech, the theta oscillator can flexibly entrain to them (3\u20137 Hz, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and signal syllable boundaries. The spiking behaviour of theta neurons parallels experimental observations that a subset of neurons in A1 respond to the onset of naturalistic sounds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fishbach et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Phillips et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2008</a>), providing an endogenous time reference that serves as a landmark to decode from other neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kayser et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brasselet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Panzeri and Diamond, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Panzeri et al., 2014</a>). This parallels the dissociation between <i>Ge</i> and <i>Te</i> units in our model: while <i>Ge</i> units are channel specific, <i>Te</i> units cover the whole acoustic spectrum, which allow them to respond quickly and reliably to the onset of all auditory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brasselet et al., 2012</a>). In the model, however, theta neurons did not only discharge at stimulus onset but at regular landmarks along the speech signal, the syllable boundaries (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zhou and Wang, 2010</a>). These neurons, hence, tie together the fast neural activity of gamma excitatory neurons into strings of linguistically relevant chunks (syllables), acting like punctuation in written language (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lisman and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2008</a>).

As a result, syllables have the ideal temporal format to interface with, e.g., hippocampal memory processes, or with motor routines reflecting other types of rhythmic mechanical constrains, e.g., the natural motion rate of the jaw (4Hz) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lieberman, 1985</a>)."

How these predictions interplay with theta- and gamma-parsing activity remain unclear (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). Experimental findings suggest that theta activity might be at the interface of bottom-up and top-down processes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Peelle et al., 2013</a>). Theta auditory activity is better synchronized to speech modulations when speech is intelligible, irrespective of its temporal or spectral structure (<a href=\"#bib47\">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Peelle et al., 2013</a>). In the present model, theta activity bears an intrinsic temporal predictive function: it is driven by speech modulations, but is also resilient enough to syllable length variations to stay tuned to the global statistics of speech (average syllable duration). The model performed well above chance level when decoding syllables from a new speaker, showing flexibility in syllable tracking within a 3 to 9 Hz range. A natural follow-up of this work will hence be to explore how the intrinsic dynamics of theta and gamma activity interact not only with sensory input but also with linguistic top-down signals, e.g., word, sentence level predictions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gagnepain et al., 2012</a>), and even cross-modal predictions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arnal et al., 2009</a>). The trade-off between the autonomous functioning of theta and gamma oscillatory activity on one hand and their entrainment to sensory input on the other hand are at the core of future experimental and theoretical challenges."

The model demonstrates the computational value of neural oscillations for parsing sensory stimuli based on their temporal properties and offers new perspectives for syllable-based automatic speech recognition (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wu et al., 1997</a>) and brain-machine interfaces using oscillation-based neuromorphic algorithms."

The model decomposes the auditory input into 128 channels of different frequency bands, reproducing the cochlear filterbank (<a href=\"http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/NSL/Software.htm\">http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/NSL/Software.htm</a>). The frequency-decomposed signals undergo a series of nonlinear filters reflecting the computations taking place in the auditory nerve and other subcortical nuclei. We then reduced the number of channels from 128 to 32 by averaging the signal of each group of four consecutive channels, and used these 32 channels as input to the network. Each channel projected onto a distinct <i>Ge</i> cell (i.e., specific connections, <math id=\"inf18\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0.25</mn><mi>\u03b4</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>).

The predicted boundaries are computed according to the following steps. First, extract the power of speech signal in the 500\u20134000 Hz range (grossly corresponding to formants) and low-pass filter at 40 Hz to remove fast fluctuations, defining a so-called <i>loudness function</i>. Second, for each sentence, compute the convex hull of the loudness signal and extract the maximum of the difference between the loudness signal and its convex hull. If that difference exceeds a certain threshold <i>T</i><sub><i>min</i></sub> and if the peak intensity of the interval of no more than <i>P</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> smaller than the peak intensity of the whole sentence, then that time of maximal difference is defined as a predicted boundary and the same procedure is applied recursively to the intervals to the left and right of that boundary. Parameters <i>T</i><sub><i>min</i></sub> and <i>P</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> were optimized to yield minimum prediction distance (see below), yielding <i>T</i><sub><i>min</i></sub> <i>= 0.152 dB</i> and <i>P</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> <i>= 15.85 dB</i>."

The process issues a \u2018spike\u2019 or \u2018syllable boundary signal\u2019 whenever the output reaches a certain threshold (<a href=\"#bib63\">Pillow et al., 2008</a>). This signal is fed back into the nonlinear function (another kernel <i>Ih</i> is used here): such negative feedback loop implements a relative refractory period. This model is a generalization of the Linear\u2013Nonlinear Poisson model, hence we refer to it simply as <i>LN</i> model.

We stimulated the network by presenting 25 sentences from the TIMIT corpus repeated 100 times each. We extracted theta chunks of <i>Ge</i> spike patterns as explained previously. Each chunk was labelled with the identity of the syllable being presented at the time of the first theta burst of the chunk. We randomly selected 10 syllables from the whole set of syllables within the 25 sentences. As in some cases there were several consecutive theta chunks corresponding to the same syllable, we equated the total number of theta chunks per syllable by randomly selecting 100 theta chunks labelled with each of the 10 syllables. Syllable classification of theta-chunked <i>Ge</i> spike patterns was performed using two different neural codes. For the <i>spike pattern code</i>, we applied the same procedure as for sawtooth classification, using a smaller value of spike shift cost corresponding to a timing resolution of 60 ms. For the <i>spike count code</i>, we measured the number of spikes emitted by each <i>Ge</i> neuron within a theta chunk. We then ran a simple nearest-mean classification procedure to decode syllable identity corresponding to each theta chunk from the spike counts of all <i>Ge</i> neurons (see \u2018Classification analysis\u2019 below). Both methods relied on the leave-one-out procedure that consists in identifying a chunk after the decoder was trained on all chunks but the to-be-decoded one. Decoding was repeated 200 times using each time a different set of 10 random syllables, and the analysis was performed over all three variants of the network."

There is a wide variability of pronunciations over speakers as attested by the variability of chain of phonemes labelled of phoneticians, but the two sentences could nonetheless be parsed into 25 syllables overall for each speaker. We simulated the network presenting these 924 sentences and used the theta-chunked output to decode syllable identity. The method used was very similar to the syllable decoding analysis, where we classified theta-chunked neural patterns into one of 10 possible syllables (drawn randomly from the set of 25 syllables), with the only difference that here the classifier was based on theta chunks coming from different speakers. The classification was repeated 100 times for different subsets of syllables."

We simulated the network by presenting 25 different sentences from the TIMIT corpus repeated 50 times each. For a given window size (ranging from 80 to 480 ms in 80 ms intervals), we randomly extracted 10 windows (defined as <i>stimuli</i>) from the overall set of 25 sentences. We then retrieved stimulus identity based on the activity of a neuron that was randomly drawn from the <i>Ge</i> population using three different neural codes. In the <i>neural count code</i>, we counted the number of spikes emitted by that neuron within each window. In the <i>time-partitioned code</i>, we divided each window into <i>N</i> equally size bins, and computed the number of spikes for each of the 8 bins separately. In the <i>phase-partitioned code</i>, we divided the window based on theta-phase- rather time-intervals: each spike was labelled with the phase of the theta oscillation at the corresponding spike time, and we computed the number of spikes falling into each of the <i>N</i> subdivisions of the [\u2212\u03c0;\u03c0] interval."

How do stimuli differ from each other? Since the test of decoding is a comparison of neural activity in response to test stimuli compared to that activity in response to trained stimuli, it is essential to know how different were the test and trained stimuli. In the subsection headed \u201cSyllable decoding\u201d, \"25 sentences\u2026 repeated 100 times each\" suggest identical stimuli were used. Was each sentence spoken by a different speaker? If not, especially if some test stimuli were identical to training stimuli, then trial-to-trial differences could be due to only internal noise in the circuit, which could always be lowered to improve performance in any circuit. Thus, relevant questions include: were different exemplars of syllables spoken by different speakers? Or did they appear in different phrases or words but spoken by the same speaker?"

Human intracortical data obtained in primary auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Morillon et al., 2012</a>) indicate that the cerebro/acoustic coherence in the theta range does not depend on the input frequency. In the gamma range, however, coherence is stronger at specific stimulus frequencies (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response figure 1</a>). This suggests that theta oscillations inside auditory cortex are broadly responsive to the whole hearing spectrum, while local gamma generators are finely tuned to specific frequencies. This claim also makes sense from the point of view of multiplexing to track a broadband and finely tuned signals simultaneously at two distinct frequencies (Panzeri et al. 2010; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gross et al. 2013</a>). This was our main motivation for feeding a broadband signal to individual theta neurons and a more fine-grained, spectrally complex input to individual gamma neurons.

To the best of our knowledge, until now coupled cross-frequency oscillations were only used to model the functions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jensen and Lisman 1996</a>; Tort et al. 2005; etc.). These models were not envisaged to account for the sampling function of sensory areas. In particular, the functional interaction of an intrinsic oscillation with a sensory signal bearing pseudo-rhythmic modulations such as speech has, to the best of our knowledge, never been explored before. While supported by some experimental evidence, the role of coupled oscillations in speech processing has only been formulated from a neurophysiological perspective (<a href=\"#bib25\">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</a>) or in phenomenological terms (Ghitza, Front Psychology 2010)."

Thus, the efficiency of biologically plausible coupled theta and gamma oscillators in speech encoding has never been evaluated before. Also, given the large variability of the syllabic rhythm in natural speech, it was not clear that neural oscillations could accurately track the syllabic rate. Finally, no experimental data has ever proven causality with respect to the hypothesized functions. It is precisely because causality cannot easily be established in human recordings (it would require a specific interference with the theta rhythm with e.g. optogenetics), that we initiated this modelling work."

In the subsection headed \u201cSyllable decoding\u201d, \"25 sentences\u2026repeated 100 times each\" suggest identical stimuli were used. Was each sentence spoken by a different speaker? If not, especially if some test stimuli were identical to training stimuli, then trial-to-trial differences could be due to only internal noise in the circuit, which could always be lowered to improve performance in any circuit.

We believe that the differential results are both valid and important. To address the reviewers\u2019 concern, we now additionally present decoding results when the classifier was trained on 2 sentences uttered by 462 different speakers, where the training material was hence different than the tested material. Despite the fact that the new dataset involved a wide range of phonemic realizations (as labelled by phoneticians) due to accents and pronunciation variants, classification reached 20-24% (depending on model version), which remained well above chance level (10%). Decoding accuracy using the intact model was significantly better than either control model, and importantly the full model performed optimally when the syllable duration was within the 100-300 ms range, i.e. roughly one theta cycle."
