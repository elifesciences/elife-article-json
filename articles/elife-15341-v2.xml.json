The pressure flow hypothesis introduced by Ernst M\u00fcnch in 1930 describes a mechanism of osmotically generated pressure differentials that are supposed to drive the movement of sugars and other solutes in the phloem, but this hypothesis has long faced major challenges. The key issue is whether the conductance of sieve tubes, including sieve plate pores, is sufficient to allow pressure flow. We show that with increasing distance between source and sink, sieve tube conductivity and turgor increases dramatically in <i>Ipomoea nil</i>. Our results provide strong support for the M\u00fcnch hypothesis, while providing new tools for the investigation of one of the least understood plant tissues."

The pressure flow hypothesis introduced by Ernst M\u00fcnch in 1930 describes a mechanism of osmotically generated pressure differentials that are supposed to drive the movement of sugars and other solutes in the phloem, but this hypothesis has long faced major challenges. The key issue is whether the conductance of sieve tubes, including sieve plate pores, is sufficient to allow pressure flow. We show that with increasing distance between source and sink, sieve tube conductivity and turgor increases dramatically in <i>Ipomoea nil</i>. Our results provide strong support for the M\u00fcnch hypothesis, while providing new tools for the investigation of one of the least understood plant tissues."

He proposed that the loading of these molecules into phloem tubes in the leaves or other \u201csource\" tissues makes the fluid inside the vessels more concentrated so that water is drawn into the phloem from neighboring \u201cxylem\u201d vessels. This creates pressure that pushes the fluid along the phloem tube towards the fruit, roots and other \u201csink\u201d tissues. In the sink tissues the sugars are consumed, which reduces their concentration in the phloem and the pressure. Overall, this results in the flow of sugars and other molecules from where they are produced to where they are most needed."

These findings strongly support the M\u00fcnch hypothesis and make other alternative hypotheses seem unlikely. Furthermore, the methods developed by Knoblauch et al. will allow others to further investigate phloem transport. New findings in this area may allow plant biologists to direct the flow of sugars and other molecules towards particular plant tissues to improve the nutritional quality of food crops in the future."

In plants, the evolution of vascular tissues enabled the development of trees and forests and was accompanied by a major increase in the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Plant vascular tissues are of two types: the xylem allows water to be pulled from the soil to maintain the hydration of leaves surrounded by air, while the phloem distributes the products of photosynthesis throughout the plant, allowing non-photosynthetic structures, such as roots, to be formed. The current hypothesis for phloem transport dates to 1930 when Ernst M\u00fcnch proposed that transport through the phloem results from osmotically generated differences between the pressure in sources (e.g. leaves) and sinks (e.g. roots), and occurs without any additional input of energy along the transport path (<a href=\"#bib16\">M\u00fcnch, 1930</a>). The M\u00fcnch hypothesis has gained wide acceptance based to a large extent on its simplicity and plausibility, rather than on experimental evidence."

Increasing distances between sources and sinks would appear to require greater pressure to drive flow, but measurements suggest lower source turgor in trees compared to smaller, herbaceous plants (e.g., crops or weeds; <a href=\"#bib22\">Turgeon, 2010</a>). A number of authors have emphasized the difficulty of accommodating the M\u00fcnch hypothesis in trees, leading to the proposal of re-loading mechanisms via relays (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lang, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aikman, 1980</a>). However, it is important to note that such challenges derive in large part from mathematical models of phloem transport in which the values of one or more of the key variables are unknown or poorly constrained (<a href=\"#bib23\">Tyree et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Pickard and Abraham-Shrauner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Thompson and Holbrook, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">H\u00f6ltt\u00e4 et al., 2009</a>)."

The acquisition of geometrical parameters requires the highest accuracy because minor changes in tube geometry have a large impact on the calculated conductivity. This is the main reason why current models have to cope with large uncertainties. In addition, the natural variation of tube parameters requires the acquisition of large data sets. For this study, more than 1000 SEM and confocal images were taken, &gt;100,000 sieve plate pore numbers were counted (in \u226510 plates per data point), and &gt;15,000 sieve plate pore diameters (n \u2265 380 per data point), &gt;1500 sieve element diameters (n \u2265 10 per data point), and &gt;800 sieve element lengths (n \u2265 10 per data point) were measured.

Recently, a group of dyes has been identified that can be loaded into the phloem (<a href=\"#bib13\">Knoblauch et al., 2015</a>). We tested carboxyfluorscein diacetate (CFDA), 8-Hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid acetate (HPTSA), Esculin, 2-(<i>N</i>-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NDBG), and carboxytetraethylrhodamine glucoside (CTER) for potential molecular rotor properties which allow the measurement of solute viscosity due to viscosity dependent changes in fluorescence decay times determined with fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). FLIM calibrations confirmed that 2-NBDG is a molecular rotor. To determine the phloem sap viscosity <i>in situ</i>, sieve elements were loaded with 2-NBDG and the decay of fluorescence lifetime was measured to generate a color coded viscosity map of the phloem (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The average fluorescence lifetime of 2-NBDG in source phloem in morning glory was 1.366 ns (\u00b1 0.037 ns, n = 8), which corresponds to a viscosity of 1.7 mPas or a sucrose concentration of about 18%. This value is within the range of estimates based on solute concentrations in phloem sap extracts of various plant species (<a href=\"#bib8\">Jensen et al., 2013</a>)."

The preparation was achieved by making cortical hand sections with fresh razor blades as described earlier (<a href=\"#bib12\">Knoblauch and van Bel, 1998</a>). Other methods such as laser ablation or sectioning by micromanipulators appear more elegant, but turned out to cause massive artifacts and flow stoppage. The section has to be as accurate as a twentieth of a millimeter in order to be useful for measurements of sieve tubes. This reduces the success rate to below 30% even for very experienced investigators. If sieve tubes were injured, the leaf was removed and the plant was allowed to recover for at least 24\u2009hr. If a section appeared successful, upstream application of phloem mobile fluorescent dyes was used to verify intactness by monitoring translocation of the dye through the tube (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The preparation required the tissue to be covered with an artificial medium, which could have had an influence on sieve tube turgor. However, the low resistance between sieve elements provided a buffer for local disturbance. If the medium resulted in a local increase in turgor, an artificial source would have been generated and flow would reverse towards the leaf and no fluorochromes would have arrived at the site of observation. If preparation decreased turgor, a local sink would have been induced and flow would have been towards the area of preparation from both sides. The applied fluorochromes would eventually have arrived at the site of observation but would not have passed by. In all cases, turgor measurements were conducted on tubes showing quickly increasing fluorescence downstream of the site of preparation indicating that the applied medium did not disturb turgor pressure inside the sieve tube."

The anatomy of sinks (e.g. roots) does not permit direct measurements in sieve tubes. However, since phloem unloading in root tips follows a symplastic path (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Wright and Oparka, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Patrick, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">2013</a>) the pressure in root cortical cells cannot be (significantly) higher than in sink sieve tubes.

In response to this treatment, the plant must change conductivity, pressure, velocity, or viscosity (or any combination of those) to maintain sink assimilate delivery if a passive pressure flow is the mode of translocation.

Taking into account the much higher conductivity, the estimated maximum transport distance is 20.35\u2009m, which is in good agreement with the actual stem length, especially given that transport distance in the roots is not included. The change in sieve tube conductivity appears to be largely a response to the increased distance between source leaves and the sink (roots) as the average sieve tube conductivity of a 13\u2009m long morning glory plant with source leaves all along its stem was only 2.8 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Tilting of the sieve plate, and formation of compound instead of simple sieve plates increases the sieve plate area to allow larger pores (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Measurement of the total phloem area from confocal micrographs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) indicated a significant increase of the external phloem area compared to plants with leaves along their entire stem, suggesting that the continuous extension of the distance between source and sink induces cambial activity to produce new sieve tubes with higher conductivity. Interestingly, despite a slight increase in tube conductivity, the conducting area of the internal phloem actually decreases (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). This is attributed to the restricted space when secondary xylem and phloem is formed by the internal cambium. The significant reduction of the pith diameter in older tissue indicates the space limitations for internal secondary phloem. Therefore, the impact of the internal phloem on whole phloem transport decreases with increasing secondary growth."

We found that large morning glory vines exhibited a significant increase in the conductivity of sieve tubes in the external phloem and that this increase was primarily due to larger sieve plate pores. In addition to changes in sieve tube structure, the pressure in sieve tubes scaled with the distance between leaves and roots, such that morning glory plants with greater distance separating leaves and roots had significantly higher source turgor pressures. In summary, plants actively adjust flow relevant parameters to accommodate a passive pressure driven mass flow."

Although many cellular aspects, such as the function of most p-proteins and sieve element plastids, remains unclear, the overall transport concept proposed by M\u00fcnch is supported. Prior to our study, many of the parameters governing phloem transport were poorly quantified. Thus, an additional important outcome of the study is a toolkit' for determining all of the parameters affecting flow. This means, that our work opens the door to new studies of phloem function. Foremost among the questions to be answered are how plants control the distribution of resources needed to support assimilate storage and the growth of new tissues."

A currently popular modification of the M\u00fcnch hypothesis that also accounts for phloem unloading is the high pressure manifold model (<a href=\"#bib18\">Patrick, 2013</a>). This model proposes maintenance of high hydrostatic pressures throughout the sieve tube system with minimal pressure differences from source to sink, but high differences between sieve elements and surrounding cells in the unloading zone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Our data, however, suggest that tube resistance will consume most of the energy provided by the source pressure to allow flow at the measured velocities (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Most importantly and contrary to the high pressure manifold model, small morning glory plants generate only low pressures sufficient for flow, but not additional large margins to maintain high pressure differentials in the unloading zone. This suggests that at least in the species investigated, either plasmodesmal conductance in the unloading zone is very high for passive unloading, or additional energy, e.g. in form of active unloading processes, is required. A better understanding of short and long distance flow patterns and assimilate distribution in plants will be necessary to resolve these important questions."

While active flows are dominated by proteins in the form of cytoskeletal elements or membrane transporters, passive flow is dependent on cell geometry and cellular connections in orchestration with concentration gradients and osmotic potentials (which are again generated by active flows). The lack of precise geometrical data of cellular connections is therefore a major problem, as this information forms the basis for modeling long distance flow patterns of assimilates, signaling molecules, and other substances. Large-scale efforts to collect cell geometrical data (a field one may call quantitative anatomy or 'Anatomics') at a resolution sufficient to extract sieve tube connections, diameters, length as well as plasmodesmal frequencies etc. throughout the plant are needed. Integration of physiological and molecular data (e.g. cell surface specific distribution of membrane transporters etc.) into a 'virtual model plant could lead to a major step forward in rationally designing crop plants to meet future societal and environmental needs. To accomplish this methods for tissue preparation, automated acquisition, and reconstruction need to be combined, but the technology is available."

The plants were moved outside at the end of May. The plants were grown on ropes to allow climbing and easy transport. Morning glory is a fast growing vine, but highly susceptible to pests. Primarily spider mites and aphids quickly grow in high numbers and have devastating impacts on the plants. In order to prevent potential effects of systemic pesticides on the plant\u2019s physiology, we chose to remove pests manually. Usually every day, but at least 4 days per week we checked every leaf and the stem of each plant and removed pests by spraying them off with a fine mist of water. All developing side branches and flower buds were pruned at the same time to maintain one single stem. Due to higher abundance of predators, pest infestation was much lower outside compared to in the greenhouse."

Phloem transport has been shown to be very stable and that diurnal changes have little or no impact on phloem transport velocities, likely due to sufficient starch pools even when photosynthesis capacity changes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Windt et al., 2006</a>). Therefore we did not expect negative effects of movement of the plants. At the main vein of the lowermost source leaf, a small paradermal section to remove cortical tissue and to expose sieve elements was made with a fresh razor blade by hand. The section was immediately covered with phloem recovery medium consisting of 10\u2009mM KCl, 10\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.2\u2009mM EDTA in unbuffered distilled water. Since the sieve tube to be measured must be the uppermost uninjured cell, the section was checked under the microscope. If sieve tube damage was observed, i.e. the cut was too deep, the leaf was removed and the plant was brought back to the growth site and a new attempt was performed after a recovery period of at least one day. If the section appeared useful in that the sieve tubes were well visible and appeared uninjured, a phloem mobile dye (CDFA or Esculin, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was injected locally into the leaf apoplast about 5 cm upstream of the preparation site by pushing the dye solution through the stomata with the blunt end of a 3\u2009ml syringe. About 2 cm<sup>2</sup> were filled with dye to provide sufficient fluorochromes for visualization after phloem loading. After filling up the apoplast, the phloem at the preparation site was observed for arrival of the fluorochromes which usually took 20\u201330 min. Translocating, intact tubes exposed to the surface were measured by impaling pico-gauges into the tube and monitoring the compression of the pico-gauge filling oil. Pico gauge production and pressure calculations were performed as described in detail in (<a href=\"#bib10\">Knoblauch et al., 2014</a>)."

I assume these geometrical data were taken from the \"bark samples\" collected along the stem and branches (in the eleventh paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). If so: are these data part of the numbers given in the second paragraph? In any case it would be interesting to actually see these data! Without these data the only \"hard\" data on trees are the measurements of source mesophyll turgor and the height of the tree. In this context it is particularly important to convincingly make the case why the data from De Schepper et al. 2013, collected on a different oak species of a different age, can be used. The same goes for the sap viscosity and sink turgor that is assumed to be identical to that determined in morning glory."

Collection of anatomical and physiological data was carried out on morning glory plants that had undergone two types of pruning. In one, branches and flowers were removed to produce ~ 7 meter long vines having source leaves distributed along the vine axis, but simplified sinks, namely the vegetative apex (and a few small expanding leaves) and the root system. In the other, as the vine grew, lower mature source leaves were removed to provide a situation in which the lower stem region was leafless; the same two sinks were in place. A pressure probe was used to determine the turgor pressure in the sieve elements (SE) located in the main vein of source leaves located along the plant axis. In parallel, anatomical studies performed on SE at various sites along the stem yielded parameters used to compute sieve tube radius, sieve plate pore numbers and radii, SE lengths and local phloem conductivity. These data were then used to calculate the theoretical pressure gradient that would be required to achieve the measured flow velocities. Based on data presented, the authors conclude that their study on morning glory provides experimental support for the phloem pressure flow model."

In addition, it is disappointing that, having gone to such pains to collect the anatomical data, the authors used assumptions from plants like <i>Arabidopsis</i> to design aspects of their experiments. For example, they assumed that, as in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, symplasmic phloem unloading occurs in morning glory roots. Added to this, even if symplasmic unloading were to take place, making turgor pressure measurements on cortical cells, rather than on SEs located in the sink region of the root, confounds data interpretation. Given that numerous cells are positioned between the SE and the cortical cell layer, the measured p value of 0.59 MPa will be lower than that within the root sieve tube system. Putting this aside, one has to puzzle as to how the authors arrived at the value of 0.485 MPa for the \"measured pressure differential.\" Inspection of the data presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> indicates an average p value of 1.2 MPa for the lower leaves which can be applied to the bottom leaf; this gives a delta p = 0.6 MPa, and a distance of ~2.5 m (measured based on the figure) from this bottom leaf and the point where the p root value was measured. This gives a delta p of 0.24 MPa, which we know would be an overestimate. So, the data are in the ballpark, but the authors have not yet knocked the ball out of the park!"

In terms of its significance there's no doubt in my mind that this paper will become the paper on this topic. Additionally, this paper raises several important issues for future research \u2013 one consequence is for example that phloem unloading must be re-evaluated. Nevertheless, I have some issues that I'd like to address.</i> "
