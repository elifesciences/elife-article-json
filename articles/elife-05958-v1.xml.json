We present a model for fibrous tissue growth based on 3D-electron microscopy of mouse tendon. We show that the number of collagen fibrils increases during embryonic development and then remains constant during postnatal growth. Embryonic growth was explained predominately by increases in fibril number and length. Postnatal growth arose predominately from increases in fibril length and diameter. A helical crimp structure was established in embryogenesis, and persisted postnatally. The data support a model where the shape and size of tendon is determined by the number and position of embryonic fibroblasts. The collagen fibrils that these cells synthesise provide a template for postnatal growth by structure-based matrix expansion. The model has important implications for growth of other fibrous tissues and fibrosis."

We present a model for fibrous tissue growth based on 3D-electron microscopy of mouse tendon. We show that the number of collagen fibrils increases during embryonic development and then remains constant during postnatal growth. Embryonic growth was explained predominately by increases in fibril number and length. Postnatal growth arose predominately from increases in fibril length and diameter. A helical crimp structure was established in embryogenesis, and persisted postnatally. The data support a model where the shape and size of tendon is determined by the number and position of embryonic fibroblasts. The collagen fibrils that these cells synthesise provide a template for postnatal growth by structure-based matrix expansion. The model has important implications for growth of other fibrous tissues and fibrosis."

These fibres provide strength to the tissue, but may also restrict its ability to grow."

The second stage happens after birth, during which the number of cells and fibres remains constant, but the tendons continue to grow because the fibres increase in diameter and length. The cells also move to form towers of cells running along the tendon."

Such forces occur during extended periods of activity with potentially devastating consequences on tissue integrity and cell survival. However, despite the high forces, tendon cells (tenocytes) remain viable and are able to sustain the integrity of the tissue. Our motivation for this study was to understand how tendons increase in size from an anlage of condensed mesenchyme to a mature tissue that is predominately ECM and which can withstand large forces without cell death."

However, the absence of a robust method of imaging cell-matrix organisation has precluded a detailed study of how the cell-rich anlage found in embryogenesis grows into a mechanically strong connective tissue in the adult. Advances in serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) provide a method to address this problem (<a href=\"#bib44\">Starborg et al., 2013</a>). SBF-SEM is a practical addition to serial section reconstruction and can typically provide data at \u223c10 nm resolution in the sectioning plane for \u223c100,000 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> volume of tissue, which is sufficient to quantify cell number, cell shape, and cell\u2013cell interactions, as well as estimate the number and organisation of individual collagen fibrils. When used in combination with a developmental series, SBF-SEM provides new information on the changes in cell organization and matrix assembly during tissue growth."

The generation of Scx-GFP mice showed the precise location of tendons in the proximal\u2013distal axis of the limb (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schweitzer et al., 2001</a>). Scx specifies important interactions between somatic muscle and cartilage cell lineages leading to tendon development (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brent et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sugimoto et al., 2013a</a>). However, Scx is also expressed in non-tendon tissues including ligaments, intervertebral discs, joints, and cartilage around the chondro-tendinous/ligamentous junction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sugimoto et al., 2013b</a>). Tenomodulin, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is expressed in tendons and ligaments and is a regulator of tenocyte proliferation and is involved in collagen fibril maturation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Docheva et al., 2005</a>). Further studies have shown that Mohawk (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2010</a>), EGR1, and EGR2 are transcription factors that are also involved in tendon formation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lejard et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the ability of EGR1 to promote tendon differentiation is partially mediated by TGF\u03b22 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guerquin et al., 2013</a>). Two main signalling pathways, TGF\u03b2 and FGF, have been identified in vertebrate tendon development (<a href=\"#bib32\">Maeda et al., 2011</a>, and for review see <a href=\"#bib47\">Tozer and Duprez, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schweitzer et al., 2010</a>).

Therefore, the expression of these transcription factors and structural proteins, and the presence of particular signalling pathways, does not, in itself, provide information on the development of tendon structure and function."

The distribution of collagen fibril diameters distinguishes two stages in tendon development. In mouse, stage 1 begins at E12.5 when narrow (\u223c35 nm) diameter collagen fibrils are formed within actin-dependent fibripositors at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canty et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kalson et al., 2013</a>). The length and width of the tissue doubles in a few days, and is accompanied by two-orders of magnitude increases in elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength (<a href=\"#bib33\">McBride et al., 1985</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">1988</a>). Serial section transmission electron microscopy (ss-TEM) of chick embryonic tendon showed that the tendon matrix contains bundles of collagen fibrils that undergo gradual rotation over several microns (<a href=\"#bib8\">Birk and Trelstad, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Birk et al., 1989</a>). Moreover, the collagen fibril bundles are stabilised by cell\u2013cell connections containing cadherin-11 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Richardson et al., 2007</a>). During stage 1 there is a modest increase in fibril diameter (to \u223c40 nm), which has been replicated in vitro by slow stretching of a 3-dimensional (3D) tendon-like construct containing embryonic tenocytes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kalson et al., 2011</a>). At birth (in the mouse), the unimodal distribution of narrow fibrils is quickly (within a few days) replaced by a bimodal distribution of fibril diameters with a range of 35\u2013400 nm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Goh et al., 2012</a>).

Crimp structure has been investigated by plane polarised light microscopy and by SEM (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raspanti et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Franchi et al., 2007</a>), but the structure of crimp is still debated; numerous studies describe a planar 2D undulating crimp, but mathematical modelling of crimped collagen fibrils in tendon suggests crimp to be helical in structure (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grytz and Meschke, 2009</a>). Again, technical limitations of techniques used to study crimp have prevented a definitive description; for example, SEM requires chemical treatment of tissue to remove cellular material, precluding analysis of the composite 3D architecture."

We here describe SBF-SEM studies of tendon development and show 3D reconstructions at three key stages of tendon development: stage 1 (embryonic), the stage 1\u20132 transition (newborn), and stage 2 (6 week). We interpret our findings as suggesting that the hierarchical structure of tendon, with collagen fibrils organised into fibril bundles with a biomechanically important spiral crimp structure, and the number of collagen fibrils in bundles, is established during embryogenesis. Subsequent postnatal tendon growth is achieved by increase in collagen fibril diameter and fibril length, likely by interface-limited molecular accretion, during which the spatial relationship between cells, fibril bundles and the crimp spiral, is maintained."

We therefore used SBF-SEM to extend our studies of tendon development (<a href=\"#bib44\">Starborg et al., 2013</a>). We studied mouse-tail tendon at the same developmental time points as <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Representative reconstructions of SBF-SEM datasets are presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. A transverse view (perpendicular to the long axis of the tendon) is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. The cells at E15.5 are rounded and close together. The cell bodies move apart as fibril bundles increase in size, eventually becoming star shaped (in transverse section) at 6 weeks postnatal. Longitudinal views (B and C) show the close relationship of cells, which are stacked on top of each other, thereby maintaining the precise longitudinal alignment of the fibril bundles. This end-to-end relationship of cells is maintained throughout development and is particularly striking in 6 week-old tendon. Reconstructing the fibril bundles in three dimensions (in red in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) showed that in newborn and 6 week tendon the fibril bundles had a regular wavy configuration (crimp). The fibril bundles reconstructed in red (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) are shown in the corresponding SBF-SEM images (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

One cell membrane is highlighted to demonstrate the membrane protrusions that form channels surrounding the fibril bundles. Longitudinal views demonstrate that the fibril bundle conforms to the shape of the cells; the cell and the fibril bundle remain in close apposition along the length of the cell. Contact between adjacent cell processes (which form the boundaries of these channels) is established during embryogenesis and is maintained during postnatal development of cell\u2013cell contacts. The cell processes lengthen to accommodate the larger diameter collagen fibrils, resulting in a stellate (star shaped) appearance of the cell in transverse view in postnatal tendon (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Cell body length decreased during development from 60 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm at E15.5, to 55 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm at birth, to 27 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm at 6 weeks (Data in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

The observation that cell body length decreases during development led us to measure the distance between cell nuclei in stacks. At birth cell nuclei were spaced 39.9 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5m apart (on the longitudinal axis) and at 6-weeks they were 27.5 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5m apart (p = &lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The discrepancy between cell length and distance between nuclei in newborn tissue was due to overlap of cells in stacks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These data suggest that there is a relative increase in the number of cells in longitudinal axis in cell channels during tendon growth comparing newborn with 6 week tendon. We also analysed the change in distance between adjacent cells in different cell stacks in transverse sections. The horizontal distance between cell nuclei increased from 6.2 \u00b1 0.2 to 31.5 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5m from birth to 6 weeks (p = &lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

Modeling of these cell\u2013cell contact regions in 3D revealed close apposition of membranes along the longitudinal axis of the tissue, thereby defining the fibril channels.

Fibrillar arrays representing bundles are shown in longitudinal and transverse section (labelled LS and TS, respectively) at the 3 time points (E15.5, newborn and 6 week). The embryonic growth stage involves fibril nucleation to increase fibril numbers along with fibril growth to increase both fibril diameter and length. The numbers of fibrils in the transverse section of the bundle is increased not only by fibril nucleation but also by axial growth of the fibrils into neighbouring regions of the bundle. The postnatal growth in stage 2 involves only fibril growth, with a major increase in fibril diameter and length, with no increase in fibril number. To maintain the observed invariant number of fibrils in the bundle transverse section, the increase in fibril length must match the local increase in tissue length. Right side panel. Schematic to represent cell and fibril growth during tendon development. Early embryonic tendon tissue (E10) is composed of rounded cells with little ECM. Collagen fibrils begin to appear in small bundles in poorly defined channels formed by cell\u2013cell adhesions by E15.5.

During embryonic development the number of fibrils per bundle increases (from E15.5 to birth). There was a significant increase in fibril diameter in postnatal tendon, and fibrils developed a bimodal diameter distribution. Also during postnatal growth (between birth and 6 weeks) the number of bundles per cell remained constant and the number of fibril profiles per bundle remained constant. The fact that the number of bundles per cell remained constant was a good indication that the cell\u2013cell junctions between neighbouring cells are stable. SBF-SEM allowed estimation of fibril length, which showed a significant increase in fibril length from E15.5 to newborn. Taken together, these data showed that growth during the period E15.5 to newborn was the result of new fibril formation together with an increase in fibril diameter and length. Recent studies have shown that the collagen fibrils in the extracellular channels, at this early stage of tendon development, are formed in cell-surface fibripositors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canty et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kalson et al., 2013</a>), and therefore, the cell strictly controls the number of fibrils deposited to the bundles."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, the number of bundles per cell and the number of collagen fibril profiles per bundle remain stable between birth and 6 weeks postnatal. During the same period, fibril diameters increase markedly and the distribution becomes bimodal. These data showed that, in mouse, cells set the number of bundles and number of collagen fibrils per bundle at the time of birth. Local growth in tendon size between newborn and 6 weeks postnatal is driven primarily by increase in collagen fibril diameter and length. Growth models have been proposed for the increase in fibril diameter based on inter-fibrillar fusion and accretion of newly-synthesised collagen molecules (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birk et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kadler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Trotter et al., 2000</a>). Inter-fibrillar fusion can potentially involve tip-to-tip, tip-to-shaft, and shaft-to-shaft fusion. Tip-to-tip fusion results in fibril lengthening. Quantitative mass mapping by scanning transmission electron microscopy and analysis of fibril staining patterns by TEM showed that tip-to-tip fusion occurs during early embryonic tendon morphogenesis and relies on unipolar collagen fibrils, in a process that is regulated by collagen-proteoglycan interactions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Graham et al., 2000</a>). Tip-to-shaft fusion also occurs, which generates branched networks (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kadler et al., 2000</a>). A model for linear and lateral growth of fibrils during tendon development has been proposed in which decorin, and perhaps related small proteoglycans, regulates surface interactions of participating fibrils (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birk et al., 1995</a>). Thus, fibril fusion is regulated by the directionality of collagen molecules in the fibril (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kadler et al., 1990</a>), the availability of tips from unipolar fibrils (<a href=\"#bib16\">Graham et al., 2000</a>), and by the presence of proteoglycans at the fibril surface (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birk et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Graham et al., 2000</a>). An important and often overlooked consequence of fibril fusion is the inevitable reduction in fibril numbers as fibrils fuse together, and the decrease in the number of fibrils per cell. It is also to be noted that fibril fusion has no effect on fibril volume fraction as no new fibril volume is created by any type of fusion; we found very few fibril fusion (tip-shaft) events when we tracked fibrils with SBF-SEM. The data presented here show that collagen fibril numbers (in profile) increased during stage 1 of development and remained constant during stage 2, despite increases in fibril diameter (in stage 1 and stage 2). Although we cannot rule out tip-to-tip fusion (which would not be expected to affect fibril diameter) our diameter and fibril number data do not support shaft-to-shaft fusion as a major contributor to increases in fibril diameter during tendon development. We also have not observed irregularly shaped fibrils, which would be expected to occur if lateral fusion was occurring."

The SNP model predicts that collagen fibrils have specific binding sites for collagen molecules, leading to growth in diameter and length. Thus, fibril growth is determined by local structure at the fibril surface and is an example of interface-controlled growth as opposed to diffusion-limited accretion onto the fibril surface. The occurrence of an abrupt limitation in fibril diameter at the growing tips of vertebrate collagen fibrils also suggests a structure-based mechanism for fibril growth (<a href=\"#bib23\">Holmes et al., 1998</a>). Evidence from collagen fibril diameter measurements in vivo also supports a structure-based assembly mechanism. If collagen molecules could assemble onto non-specific binding sites on the fibril in an uncoordinated manner, the axial mass profiles would be expected to show pronounced random fluctuations. In the case of diffusion-limited growth, collagen fibrils closer to the cell might be expected to have larger diameters because of the ready availability of collagen molecules emerging from the cell. However, as fibril diameters are independent of distance from the cell, it seems more likely that fibril growth (especially in postnatal tendon) is strongly influenced by the local structure of the fibril surface. Thus, the establishment of fibril number during stage 1 of development and subsequent growth in fibril diameter during stage 2 by the SNP mechanism (in the absence of overt shaft-to-shaft fibril fusion) would explain the observed increase in fibril diameter in stage 2 and the lateral growth of the tissue."

In contrast, cells in 6 weeks postnatal had prominent lateral cellular extensions that reached deep into the ECM, were short (\u223c25 \u00b5m) and stacked in rows on their blunt ends. Importantly, cells at 6 weeks postnatal tendon remained in contact with each other via their cellular extensions regardless of the distance between the cell bodies where the nucleus was located. The number of collagen bundles at the cell periphery (and therefore the number of cell\u2013cell contacts) was stable between newborn and 6 weeks postnatal. The data show that the main cell bodies move laterally apart because of the expansion of the ECM but maintain their longitudinal relationship, thereby generating the tramline organisation seen in mature tendon."

In relaxed tendons, the bundles of collagen fibrils are buckled into a wavy pattern, called crimp, which is readily visible using plane polarized light (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kapacee et al., 2008</a>). Unbuckling of the crimp during longitudinal loading functions as a natural shock-absorber on initial loading as well as being important in elastic recoil (reviewed by [<a href=\"#bib2\">Benjamin et al., 2008</a>]). Crimp first appears during embryonic tendon development (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shah et al., 1982</a>) but the mechanism of crimp formation remains unknown, largely because of the impracticalities of studying its formation in vivo. In our studies we were careful to preserve the tension in the tendon, avoiding major changes in crimp structure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shah et al., 1977</a>), by fixing whole tails without disturbing the axial attachment to the skeleton. Crimp 3D structure has been debated over a prolonged period. We found no kinks as previously described (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raspanti et al., 2005</a>) but instead observed a left-handed spiral running the length of our 3D reconstructions. A spring/spiral nature of the tendon crimp has been predicted in a mathematical model (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grytz and Meschke, 2009</a>). It is important to note that fibril bundles are continuous over the distances we have measured here, forming parallel spirals in axial register to provide uniform biomechanical properties when loaded, and there is a close relationship between the cell and the fibril bundle. The close association of cells with bundles suggests that the cell shape strongly influences the configuration of the crimp structure. This is consistent with studies suggesting that cell force generated by the actin-myosin system can create a crimp structure (<a href=\"#bib20\">Herchenhan et al., 2012</a>). As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, we showed that the crimp wavelength lengthens from \u223c14 \u00b5m at E15.5 to \u223c99 \u00b5m at 6 weeks postnatal. The length increase of the mouse-tail from newborn to 6 weeks by a factor of \u223c6.2\u00d7 closely matches the increase in crimp wavelength of \u223c7.1\u00d7. This suggests a simple crimp elongation process in synchrony with bundle and tissue elongation."

In stage 1 the organisation of fibroblasts and the cellular channels for fibril deposition and growth are established, and cell-mediated control of collagen fibril deposition occurs. This sets the developmental template for structure-based matrix expansion of the existing matrix in stage 2, which drives the increase in the size of the matrix that underpins tissue growth. Important features include the cell-regulated number of cell processes that define the boundaries of collagen fibril bundles and help to maintain the tramline organization of cells in the mature tissue. These mechanisms could be a paradigm for the growth of other matrix-rich tissues that are abundant in collagen fibrils."

Sections were examined using an FEI Tecnai 12 Twin transmission electron microscope (TEM). Images were captured using a 2 k \u00d7 2 k cooled CCD camera (F214A, Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems, Gauting, Germany). For each sample a minimum of three different sections were reviewed. An unbiased sampling of each section was performed. Three different magnifications were used: 2100\u00d7 for FAF and fibril bundle number per nucleus (giving a large-area survey), and 11,000\u00d7 for fibril diameter, fibril area and fibrils per \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>. The sampling procedure generated 20 images of each section at 2100\u00d7, 40 views per section at 6800\u00d7 and 60 views per section at 11,000\u00d7. All measurements were made using ImageJ software (NIH freeware, <a href=\"http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image\">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image</a>). For fibril diameter measurement 500 fibrils were measured in total from three separate samples per time point (200 from sample 1, 150 each from sample 2 and 3). Fibril area was calculated from fibril diameter assuming circularity (1/4 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 diameter<sup>2</sup>). Magnification calibration was performed for each magnification using a diffraction-grating replica grid (2160 lines/mm, Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK). 20 measurements of FAF were made for each time point (7 from sample 1, 7 from sample 2 and 6 from sample 3 [<a href=\"#bib44\">Starborg et al., 2013</a>]). 30 measurements were made for fibrils per bundle, bundles per nucleus and fibrils per \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> at each time point (10 measurements from each sample) on TEM images of transverse sections of tendon. This gave a measurement of fibril bundles per nucleus in transverse section. Fibril bundles are continuous along the length of the tendon, so there are significantly fewer bundles than tendon cells when the tendon is considered as a whole composite unit containing cells and ECM."

In addition, the approach described provides important new structural insights into the old problem of how cells determine the way in which the extracellular matrix is assembled in order to form a functional tissue. This data provides novel mechanistic insight into how tissue growth can be mediated. Hence, this is exciting work that presents a new framework in which to think about tissue growth. However, before it can be recommended for publication in <i>eLife</i> there are two major concerns that need to be addressed."

At E15.5 there are no distinct stacks of cells. Cell stacks are present at birth and at 6 weeks. The distance between nuclei of cells in stacks decreases from newborn to 6 week tissue, corresponding to a decrease in the longitudinal length of the cell. However, there is overlap of cells in newborn tissue, making the distance between nuclei less than the total length of the cell (40 vs. 55 \u00b5m). Cells in 6 week tissue are stacked end-to-end, with little overlap; their inter-nucleus distance corresponds closely to the length of the cell (28 vs. 27 \u00b5m).
