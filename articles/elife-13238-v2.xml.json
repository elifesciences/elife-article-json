However, the role of gap junctions in insect cognition remains poorly understood. Using a flight simulator paradigm and genetic tools, we found that gap junctions are present in <i>Drosophila</i> Kenyon cells (KCs), the major neurons of the mushroom bodies (MBs), and showed that they play an important role in visual learning and memory. Using a dye coupling approach, we determined the distribution of gap junctions in KCs. Furthermore, we identified a single pair of MB output neurons (MBONs) that possess a gap junction connection to KCs, and provide strong evidence that this connection is also required for visual learning and memory. Together, our results reveal gap junction networks in KCs and the KC-MBON circuit, and bring new insight into the synaptic network underlying fly\u2019s visual learning and memory."

However, the role of gap junctions in insect cognition remains poorly understood. Using a flight simulator paradigm and genetic tools, we found that gap junctions are present in <i>Drosophila</i> Kenyon cells (KCs), the major neurons of the mushroom bodies (MBs), and showed that they play an important role in visual learning and memory. Using a dye coupling approach, we determined the distribution of gap junctions in KCs. Furthermore, we identified a single pair of MB output neurons (MBONs) that possess a gap junction connection to KCs, and provide strong evidence that this connection is also required for visual learning and memory. Together, our results reveal gap junction networks in KCs and the KC-MBON circuit, and bring new insight into the synaptic network underlying fly\u2019s visual learning and memory."

A gap junction consists of an intercellular channel that is formed by two hemichannels, each containing six homo- or heteromeric protein subunits. These subunits belong to the <i>connexin</i> or <i>pannexin</i> gene families in vertebrates and the <i>innexin (inx</i>) gene family in invertebrates. Gap junctions allow the circulation of small molecules, such as ions and cAMP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Herv\u00e9 and Derangeon, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Phelan and Starich, 2001</a>). The function of gap junctions in noise reduction (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeVries et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Veruki and Hartveit, 2002</a>) and neuronal synchronization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bloomfield and V\u00f6lgyi, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pereda et al., 2013</a>) is critical for visual and olfactory processing in mammals. In addition, the synchronization of neurons through the function of gap junctions was proposed to play a key role in cognitive processes, such as perception, attention, as well as learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bissiere et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hormuzdi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 2000</a>). The complexity of the mammalian central nervous system makes it difficult to determine the function of gap junctions during cognitive processes. In comparison, insects have much simpler neural systems, yet still perform sophisticated cognitive functions, however, the role of gap junctions in cognition has rarely been investigated."

Gap junctions connect L1 with L2 neurons in the lamina, allowing for simultaneous activation of both pathways (<a href=\"#bib16\">Joesch et al., 2010</a>). Gap junctions in olfactory glomeruli mediate lateral excitation which promotes olfaction sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</a>).

The precise role of MBs in visual learning and memory, however, remains under debate. It was thought previously that MBs are not necessary for visual operant conditioning in a flight simulator system (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wolf et al., 1998</a>); however, recently it was reported that the MB \u03b3 lobe participates in visual learning and memory in color-based visual learning assays in groups of walking flies (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vogt et al., 2014</a>). Kenyon cells (KCs), the major neurons of MBs, are the main components of the MB neural network, which is composed of dopamine neurons (DAs), MB output neurons (MBONs), and other cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">b</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>). While eight <i>inx</i> genes are expressed in <i>Drosophila</i>, the existence of functional gap junctions in KCs remains to be investigated. Here, we set out to study the presence and function of gap junctions in MBs, using the visual conditioning paradigm in a flight simulator as well as dye coupling and whole-cell recording approach."

                                "text": "To study the role of MBs in visual cognition in flying flies, we combined an optogenetic stimulator with a flight simulator system. A laser was focused to an area between the two compound eyes of the fly to activate halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Gradinaru et al., 2010</a>), and <i>all-trans</i> retinal (ATR) was replaced with \u03b2-carotene to avoid photolysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). We found that visual learning and memory was impaired when \u03b1/\u03b2 neurons of KCs, driven by 17d-GAL4, were hyperpolarized, and the memory was restored when GAL4 activity was blocked in MBs by MB247-GAL80 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, upper panel). These experiments were repeated with a second UAS-NpHR strain, yielding similar results (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Hyperpolarizing \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons with MB370B-GAL4, \u03b3 neurons with MB131B-GAL4, or \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3 neurons of KCs with MB247-GAL4 also abolished visual learning and memory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> lower panel). These results indicate that KCs participate in visual learning and memory. However, when synaptic release was impaired via expression of <i>shibire<sup>ts1</sup> </i>(<i>shi<sup>ts1</sup></i>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kasuya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Praefcke and McMahon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">van der Bliek and Meyerowitz, 1991</a>) in KCs by 17d-GAL4, MB370B-GAL4 or MB247-GAL4, visual learning and memory was intact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Tetanus toxin (TNT) was also used to inhibit the chemical-synaptic transmission. When TNT was expressed in \u03b1/\u03b2 neurons (17d-GAL4) or all KCs (VT61721-GAL4), fly\u2019s visual learning and memory remained intact (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition to blocking the output of chemical synapses, hyperpolarization could also affect other mechanisms that influence visual learning and memory. To confirm the effect of hyperpolarization in KCs, Kir2.1, ectopic expression of an inward rectifier potassium channel that induces irreversible hyperpolarization was achieved in KCs by using the MB247\u2013GeneSwitch GAL4 driver (MBSwitch)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Osterwalder et al., 2001</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, visual learning and memory were again abolished. However, in agreement with previous report (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wolf et al., 1998</a>), visual learning and memory remained intact in flies of which MBs were ablated by hydroxyurea (HU) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Taking together, these results indicated that visual learning and memory might be influenced in real time by non-chemical-synaptic transmission in MBs. We therefore speculated that electrical-synaptic transmission via gap junctions was a plausible candidate for such observation."

The expression pattern of these GAL4 lines are illustrated above the bars. MB247-GAL80 restored memory impaired by17d-GAL4. The laser was off in the control groups (Control) and applied throughout the 24min assay (at 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) in the test groups (Laser On). (<b>C</b>) Blocking the chemical synaptic output of KCs labeled with 17d-GAL4, MB370B-GAL4 and MB247-GAL4 did not affect visual learning and memory.

First, the excitation light can disturb visual perception; second, <i>Drosophila</i> need to take in <i>all-trans</i> retinal (ATR) in order to use optogenetics. However, ATR is light-sensitive and must be protected from light (<a href=\"#bib35\">Suh et al., 2007</a>), while light deprivation leads to abnormal development of the visual system (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barth and Heisenberg, 1997</a>). (<b>A</b>) To solve the first problem, we focused the laser light into a small Gaussian spot (593 nm, diameter 0.3 mm) and directed it between the two compound eyes of <i>Drosophila</i>. (<b>B</b>) Visual learning and memory under different laser intensities were tested in wild type CS and eNpHR3.0/+ flies. A laser strength of greater than 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> impaired visual learning and memory. (<b>C, D</b>) To address the second problem, an optogenetic locomotor system was established. (<b>C</b>) Flies were individually placed into a 3.5 cm dish. The fly\u2019s locomotor behavior was recorded by a camera with a visible light filter. Illumination was supplied by three infrared LEDs. In the test groups, three yellow LEDs supplied yellow light (590 nm, 0.06\u20130.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). Temperature was controlled at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Yellow arrow, recorded fly. Scale bar, 1 cm. (<b>D</b>) Locomotor behavior of cha-GAL4 &gt; UAS-eNpHR3.0 and UAS-eNpHR3.0/+ flies raised in different conditions; this behavior reflects the activation of halorhodopsin. For each fly, the distance moved, time spent moving (activity) and speed were calculated. If the flies raised in a 12 hr L/D cycle were fed with ATR (changed every night), halorhodopsin would be disabled. The \u03b2-carotene has been reported to be transformed into ATR in <i>Drosophila</i> and is more stable in light (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yang and O'Tousa, 2007</a>). Feeding flies \u03b2-carotene for 3 days after eclosion could partially rescue the halorhodopsin inactivation. Thus, \u03b2-carotene could be used in place of ATR for optogenetics. N\u00a0=\u00a018 to 20 for each data point. All data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. (<b>E</b>) Hyperpolarization of KCs labeled with 17d-GAL4 with UAS-NpHR-YFP (raised with a 12 hr L/D cycle, fed with \u03b2-carotene food) also impaired visual learning and memory.

                                "text": "To verify the existence of gap junctions in KCs, we utilized a dye coupling method. Either biocytin or Alexa Fluor 568 was loaded into one KC of each fly brain upon whole-cell recording. The dye-filled neurons were identified based on their position and morphological characteristics as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 1999</a>). Among the 143 successfully stained brains, 64 \u03b1/\u03b2 neurons, 40 \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons and 39 \u03b3 neurons were loaded with dye. Dye-coupled neurons were observed in 14 brains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In 10 out of the 14 brains, dye coupling was observed between the same subtype of KCs, including 8 \u03b1/\u03b2-\u03b1/\u03b2, 1 \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019-\u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 and 1 \u03b3-\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). One representative example is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>. There, biocytin was loaded into a GFP-expressing \u03b1/\u03b2 posterior (\u03b1/\u03b2 p) neuron (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>) (driven by c205-GAL4). Across the calyx, the MB dendrites region, there was only one biocytin-filled fiber (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); however, two biocytin-filled fibers were found in the peduncle and the lobe region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). One fiber overlapped with the GFP fluorescence, while the other fiber showed no signs of GFP expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Tracing the two fibers, we found that one of them belongs to an \u03b1/\u03b2 p neuron, and the second belongs to an \u03b1/\u03b2 core (\u03b1/\u03b2 c) neuron (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Notably, there were three potential connection points between these two neurons, including the beginning of the lobes, the horizontal branch tip of the \u03b1/\u03b2 p neuron, and the middle of the vertical branches (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a> right panel, marked with \u201c*\u201d). In 4 of the 14 brains, dye coupling was observed between different KC subtypes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In 2 out of the 4 brains, the dye was loaded into a single \u03b3 neuron but stained multiple \u03b3 neurons and an \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neuron (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In the third brain, one \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 soma was filled with dye and two \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 somas, one \u03b1/\u03b2 and one \u03b3 fiber were stained (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). In the last brain, the dye was loaded into a single \u03b1/\u03b2 p neuron, and was also found in multiple \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 neurons and some non-KC neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Together, these results suggest that gap junctions exist in both the calyx and the lobes that link KCs of the same or different subtypes as well as some non-KC neurons."

                                "text": "In our dye coupling experiments, we found some dye-stained fibers from the area of \u03b2\u2019 lobe to areas outside the MBs and two dye-stained non-KC somas (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Based on the morphology of these fibers and the position of the somas, these non-KC neurons were likely to be MBONs. MBON-\u03b2\u20192mp neurons which have somas on the dorsal anterior surface near the mid-line of the brain, and arborize on the tip of \u03b2\u2019 lobe, were supposed to be reasonable candidates. To investigate the possible existence of an efferent pathway mediated by gap junctions in MBs, we explored whether there were electrical synapses between MBONs and KCs. We used either the proton pump eArch3.0\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Mattis et al., 2012</a>) or halorhodopsin (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gradinaru et al., 2010</a>) to hyperpolarize KCs (247LexA &gt; LexAop-eArch3.0-EYFP or 247LexA &gt; LexAop-eNpHR3.0-EYFP), and MBONs were labeled with split GAL4-driven tdTomato (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using whole-cell recording, we monitored the changes in membrane potential in MBONs whilst KCs were hyperpolarized simultaneously using a yellow laser (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Considering that the electrical coupling coefficient might not be high (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</a>), we used the maximal power of our laser, which should be the most promising condition to get obvious results. Inasmuch as there was no significant difference between the effect of eArch3.0 and eNpHR3.0 to hyperpolarize KCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), the data using eArch3.0 or eNpHR3.0 were pooled together for analysis. Upon hyperpolarization in KCs, we measured a hyperpolarization in MBON-\u03b2\u20192mp neurons labelled by MB002B-GAL4 or MB011B-GAL4. This response remained unchanged after the application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), which blocks chemical synapses by suppressing action potentials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, laser-induced hyperpolarization disappeared when gap junctions were blocked by 2-octanol (2-OCT) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bohrmann and Haas-Assenbaum, 1993</a>), and was recovered after 2-OCT was washed out (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), while 2-OCT application could induce slight hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The delivery of 2-OCT did not affect the optogenetic hyperpolarization in KCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that \u03b2\u20192mp MBONs are able to receive inputs from KCs through electrical synapses."

However, a possible involvement of gap junctions in cognition had not been well addressed, especially in KCs. Here, we showed that in addition to chemical synapses, gap junctions also exist in KCs and KC-associated neural networks, and play important roles in visual learning and memory. Compared with chemical synapses, gap junctions are simple, fast, and non-discrete for information transfer in neural networks. Similar to their function as a low-pass filter in reducing noise during sensory processing (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeVries et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Veruki and Hartveit, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), gap junctions in KCs may contribute to noise reduction, especially those that connect KCs of the same subtype with common inputs. Considering that the different KC subtypes have diverse functions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vogt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yi et al., 2013</a>), gap junctions that connect KCs of different subtypes may serve as a communication channel that links multiple processing units. The gating, assembly, internalization and degradation of gap junction channels can be delicately modulated by phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Laird, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Moreno, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Solan and Lampe, 2005</a>); and these regulation may underlie memory encoding in MB-MBON networks."

                        "text": "Our results showed that approximately 10% of all KCs possess active gap junction connections, which is very likely to be an underestimate of their density, due to the following reasons: 1) The dye coupling efficiency may be restricted with the gating of gap junction channels, which might not be always open and which might be delicately modulated; 2) filling an entire neuron with sufficient amounts of dye is a difficult and time-consuming (1\u20132\u2009hr) procedure, due to the slender morphology of their neurites. According to electron microscope results from our lab (unpublished data), KC neurites are extremely narrow in various sections, often only 50 nm in diameter. However, some organelles in the neurites, such as mitochondria, are quite big, with the diameter more than 500 nm. Thus, the diffusion of dye in KCs might be interrupted when neurites were congested by organelles. In general, Alexa Fluor 568 (791.8 Da) stained less details of the neurites than biocytin (372.48 Da) in KCs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). This difference also suggested that the KC neurites are not free enough for the dye diffusion. It is therefore unsurprising that the neurites of the coupled neurons were rarely completely filled with dye, with similar reasoning for the soma parts. The low efficiency of dye coupling was also evident in our results from \u03b2\u20192mp neurons. In this study, the probability of dye coupling was approximately 1/12 the probability of electrical coupling, which we believe is reasonable, as electrical currents flow more easily than dyes, both in neurites and through gap junctions. We could not exclude the possibility that the distribution of gap junctions between KCs, and between KCs and MBONs is rare, and possibly differs substantially across individual flies. It is worth noting that the proportion of simultaneously opened gap junctions is probably not very high, thus synchronizing only a minority of KCs. Otherwise, it would be akin to creating a single processing unit, and the MBs would lose their processing capacity. Thus, such fine-tuned modulation of gap junctions may be critical for MB function."

Combining whole-cell recording with both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing optogenetic tools could be helpful to study the electrical physiological properties of gap junctions, and further clarify the dynamics of neural networks with both chemical synapses and gap junctions."

The experiment was repeated with HU-treated MBs-ablated flies in our flight simulator, yielding similar results (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Therefore, this unconformity is unlikely to be caused by the upgrading of the flight simulator. Developmental compensation may be a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy in results. HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, blocking the synthesis of DNA, and causing the death of dividing cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sweeney et al., 2012</a>). It has been reported that the trajectory of the neurons which proliferated during larva period develop independently of each other, although the final branching pattern of these neurons is dependent upon the presence of appropriate neuronal targets (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lovick and Hartenstein, 2015</a>). In the MB ablated flies, MB-targeting neurons might still grow to the MB region and form new circuits with the remainder \u03b3 neurons which proliferated before larval hatching and therefore could not be ablated by HU (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). The developmental compensation might alleviate the change of the topological structure and function of the MB-associated neural network. A comparison of the MB-associated network between the MB-ablated flies and wild type flies, including the topological structure and the physiological responses during visual operant conditioning, would be helpful to understand the neural computations underlying visual cognition."

However, in the experiments using a flight simulator, visual conditioning was not affected when the chemical synaptic output of the \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3 lobes was inhibited by <i>shi<sup>ts</sup></i> or TNT. This discrepancy can probably be attributed to the differences between the behavioral paradigms. In the paradigms for the walking flies (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vogt et al., 2014</a>), to ensure the blocking of <i>shi<sup>ts</sup></i>, the flies was tested at high temperature (33\u00b0C), but in flight simulator, files could not accomplish the visual learning and memory task when the temperature was higher than 30\u00b0C. Moreover, the efficiency of TNT could not be tested in these behavior paradigms. Thus, we cannot formally rule out the possible roles of chemical transmission in visual learning and memory. Our results show that gap junctions in the \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b1\u2019/\u03b2\u2019 lobes, but not those in the \u03b3 lobes, are required for the operant visual learning, suggesting that the chemical synaptic circuits and electrical synaptic circuits may be complementary in distribution and function. Therefore, we propose that gap junctions cooperate with chemical synapses to perform the complex function of MBs. Tracing the gap junction networks in <i>Drosophila</i> and clarifying the synergy between gap junctions and chemical synapses should contribute to our understanding of functional neural calculations."

The torque meter measured each fly\u2019s yaw torque around its vertical body axis and rotated the panorama around the fly via a negative feedback mechanism. This arrangement allowed the tethered flies to stabilize and choose their flight orientation with respect to the panorama by adjusting their yaw torque. The flies\u2019 yaw torque and the panorama\u2019s angular position were recorded continuously and stored in the computer (sampling rate, 20\u2009Hz) for subsequent analysis. The panorama was divided into 4 quadrants, with horizontal bars at their respective centers. An infrared laser beam (10,600 nm) that projected to the fly\u2019s abdomen was switched on when the fly oriented to the dangerous quadrants and was switched off when the fly oriented to the safe quadrants. For half of the flies, the lower bars were coupled with punishment, and for the other half, the higher bars were coupled with punishment. Standard 24\u2009min training paradigms consisted of 12 blocks of 2\u00a0min each: blocks 1\u20133, pre-training sessions; blocks 4, 5, 7 and 8, training sessions; blocks 6 and 9\u201312, test sessions. In our experiments, the horizontal bars were black on white backgrounds; the bars had a length of 40\u00b0 and a width of 12\u00b0. The difference in the center of gravity between the higher and lower bars was 44\u00b0. Patterns in opposite quadrants were identical, whereas patterns in neighboring quadrants were different. These patterns were printed on paper with a color inkjet printer (Epson Stylus Photo 1390). The paper arena was illuminated by transmitted light from a white LED array. The performance of tethered flies was evaluated quantitatively in 2\u00a0min bins using the \u201cperformance index\u201d (PI), which was calculated as follows: PI = (t1\u2013t2)/(t1+t2), where t1 is the time spent heading toward safe patterns and t2 is the time spent heading toward dangerous patterns. The final PI was calculated as the average of PIs 9 to 12.

The saline was bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 gas for a final pH of 7.3. The sheath covering the target neuron was removed with fine forceps. For neuron targeting, four GAL4 lines (OK107, MB247, c205, and c305a) were used to drive EGFP expression in KCs, and two split-GAL4 lines (MB002B and MB011B) were used to label \u03b2\u20192mp neurons. Patch-clamp electrodes (20\u201330 M\u03a9) were filled with the following solution: 140\u2009mM potassium aspartate, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM KCl, 4\u2009mM MgATP, 0.5\u2009mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 1\u2009mM EGTA, and 100\u2009\u03bcM Alexa Fluor 568 (Life Technologies, Carsbad, California) or 1% biocytin hydrazide, pH 7.3, adjusted to 265 mOsm.

Only one soma was successfully recorded per brain or hemisphere. For each brain, 1~4 attempts were made to get successful recording. Brains without successful recording were discarded after 4 attempts. No obvious dye in the target soma was confirmed by fluorescence after failed attempts. After loading for one to two hours, the dye labeled the soma and neurites of the recorded neuron and diffused to other neurons through open gap-junction channels if present. Because of the small size of KC somas, they were almost always removed with the electrode when the electrodes were drawn out after dye loading was complete. Thus the loaded soma was observed in only a few brains. Next, the brain was fixed in 4% PFA for 12\u201315\u2009min at room temperature and then washed several times in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100. The Alexa Fluor 568-labeled brains were mounted in Vectashield H-1000 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California) for confocal imaging. The biocytin-labeled brains were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies; 1:200) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The brains were washed several times and then mounted in Vectashield H-1000 for confocal imaging. A Nikon Eclipse FN1 confocal system with a 40\u00d7 water-immersion objective and an Olympus FV10I system with a 60\u00d7 oil-immersion objective were used to obtain the Z-stacks of the brains. The dye-filled neurites were identified based on their position and morphology. The examples that meet the following criteria were counted as dye-coupled examples: (1) More than one dye-filled fibers were observed in peduncle. (2) Only one fiber was observed in peduncle, but fibers in lobe region belonged to different subtypes. (3) Only one fiber was observed in the peduncle and fibers in the lobe region belonging to the same subtype, but were not branches of one neuron. Condition (3) only applied to \u03b1\u03b2 core neurons, which generally have few branches. In blind experiments, the brain mounting, confocal imaging and identification of dye coupling were performed by an experimenter who was unaware of the genotypes of the brains."

The authors first reduce expression of a series of innexins, the genes encoding gap junctions, in the mushroom bodies, integrating neuropils which the authors characterize as the cognitive centers of the fly brain. They find that knocking down a specific subset of innexins renders flies' learning scores statistically indistinguishable from zero (no learning). Interestingly, blocking synaptic release using the dominant negative dynamin allele <i>shibire</i> has no effect on learning, suggesting that MB function in this behavior is gap-junction mediated. In a careful sequence of experiments and controls they are able to show that this effect is specific to regional subsets of the mushroom body and that <i>innexin</i> function is required post-developmentally. Next, the authors report diffusion of small dye molecules from patched Kenyon cells (KCs = MB intrinsic neurons) to other KCs. Using optogenetic stimulation paired with whole-cell recording, they show that hyperpolarization can be transmitted between KCs and a specific class of MB output neurons (MBONs), which can be temporarily blocked by the application of 2-octanol, a gap-junction blocker. Lastly, they find corresponding dependence of visual learning on innexin expression in those MBONs."

The paper is well written, with generally solid use of controls. The balance of evidence is convincing that gap junctions likely play an important role in visual learning in the MBs."

This previous literature made use of HU ablation of MB. In other words, flies that have no MB structures at all are able to perform normally in this visual learning paradigm. Defects in visual learning in MB-less flies are only revealed with more complex tasks that were not employed here. This literature includes several classic studies from the Heisenberg group (e.g. Wolf et al. 1998 and Liu et al. 1999), as well as a more recent study by Guo and colleagues (Peng et al., 2007). So if in fact MB are not required for this task, it would obviously undermine the very foundation upon which they test the requirement for gap junctions within MB for this task. The authors correctly point out that a recent study by Vogt et al. points to a role for MB (using <i>shibire</i> to block output) in a visual learning task, and they correctly point to the literature that MB are required for visual learning that involves changes in context. But still, in this flight simulator visual learning assay, the literature is very consistent in the finding that MB ablated animals have no defect. The authors suggest that this discrepancy could be caused by developmental compensation with HU ablation. And we suppose that methodological differences in the flight simulator assay employed here could differ from those circa late 1990s. But this is the crux of the current study, so we were really surprised that they didn\u2019t just do a simple HU ablation and test performance in their current assay. If performance is normal, it would be tough to read past the first figure without further explanation right? We see two types of explanation to reconcile the fact that HU ablation in previous publications has no impact on flight simulator visual learning, whereas acute manipulations of gap junctions does. One possibility is that when MB are ablated developmentally, there is some compensation mechanism in which the brain arrives at a solution that is independent of MB. This is certainly possible. But the other possibility is that the exact details of the current version of the flight simulator behavioral paradigm are sufficiently different from those historically reported. In this case, the current version of the flight simulator, in these researcher's hands, engages the MB in a way that previous versions of the assay did not. These are two really different interpretations. And it would be trivial for the authors to address this: just do an HU ablation of MB and test learning in their flight simulator. This lab has done HU ablation in the past. So this requires no new expertise and is such an obvious experiment that we would guess they have already thought of it. We agree that a positive result here would be an important addition to this study. If the authors find again that developmental ablation of the MB does not impair this behavior, then an in-depth discussion of the plausibility of developmental compensation is needed."
