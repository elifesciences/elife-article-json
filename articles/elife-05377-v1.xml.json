The house mouse is well suited for these studies because there are three subspecies that separated relatively recently, around 350\u2013500 thousand years ago (e.g., <a href=\"#bib1\">Boursot et al., 1993</a>). In parts of Central Europe, two of the subspecies\u2014<i>Mus musculus domesticus</i> and <i>Mus musculus musculus</i>\u2014live alongside each other, and they can mate and produce hybrid offspring (e.g., <a href=\"#bib7\">Sage et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Boursot et al., 1993</a>). However, when the two subspecies are cross-bred in the laboratory, the hybrid males are often less fertile than the parents (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Good et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">White et al., 2011</a>)."

Like in other species, it is clear that the X chromosome plays a major role in causing hybrid male mice to be sterile (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Good et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Mihola et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">White et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, reproductive isolation is not a simple trait that is caused by a few genes: it is due to the contributions of many genes throughout the genome (e.g., <a href=\"#bib11\">White et al., 2011</a>). These findings agree with the results of studies of wild mice caught in the hybrid zone in which researchers examined the exchange of genetic variation between the two subspecies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib9\">Tucker et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Payseur et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Teeter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Janou\u0161ek et al., 2012</a>)."

Over three decades of work using mapping and positional cloning techniques has only conclusively identified one gene that contributes to sterility in house mice, <i>PRDM9</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Mihola et al., 2009</a>). The main problem is that the candidate regions identified using these approaches are large and include many genes, and it is painstaking work to test each of these individual genes. With such a long list of candidates, investing a high level of effort in any one gene is a gamble."
