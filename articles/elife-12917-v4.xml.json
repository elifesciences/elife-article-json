In vitro studies suggest a novel approach to controlling seizures in SE: acute inhibition of estrogen synthesis in the brain. Here, we show in rats that systemic administration of an aromatase (estrogen synthase) inhibitor after seizure onset strongly suppresses both electrographic and behavioral seizures induced by kainic acid (KA). We found that KA-induced SE stimulates synthesis of estradiol (E2) in the hippocampus, a brain region commonly involved in seizures and where E2 is known to acutely promote neural activity. Hippocampal E2 levels were higher in rats experiencing more severe seizures. Consistent with a seizure-promoting effect of hippocampal estrogen synthesis, intra-hippocampal aromatase inhibition also suppressed seizures. These results reveal neurosteroid estrogen synthesis as a previously unknown factor in the escalation of seizures and suggest that acute administration of aromatase inhibitors may be an effective treatment for SE."

Most studies have assumed that the estrogens relevant to seizures are of ovarian origin and so have studied estrogen regulation of seizures on the time scale of the reproductive cycle.

The results demonstrated that neurosteroid estrogen synthesis is seizure-promoting, in both sexes, and that acutely inhibiting aromatase, either systemically or specifically within the hippocampus, strongly suppresses seizures. Thus neurosteroid estrogen synthesis is a previously unknown factor that contributes to seizures in SE, and acute treatment with an aromatase inhibitor may be an effective new approach to seizure control."

Vehicle-treated rats showed the expected progression of seizure activity, beginning with individual seizures that evolved to merging seizures (<a href=\"#bib74\">Treiman et al., 1990</a>) with high EEG amplitude and increased power. In contrast, fadrozole-treated rats showed much lower seizure activity, particularly during the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr when vehicle rats typically experienced merging seizures. Thus fadrozole suppressed seizure escalation. The effects of fadrozole were the same in males and females (all p values &gt;0.30) so data were combined. The seizure-induced increase in EEG amplitude during the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr was 46% lower on average in fadrozole-treated compared to vehicle-treated rats (time x drug: <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=10.36, p&lt;0.01, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and the time animals spent in seizures based on a 5x baseline threshold of EEG amplitude was 73% lower in the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr (time x drug: <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=20.88, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In addition to EEG amplitude, fadrozole also significantly attenuated the seizure-induced increase in EEG power in the \u03b4-\u03b8 (1\u201310\u2009Hz, <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=21.50, p&lt;0.001) and \u03b2-low \u03b3 (10\u201350\u2009Hz, <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=8.08, p=0.01) frequency ranges over the entire 2\u2009hr testing period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Additional analyses revealed that the effect on power was more prominent during the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr of seizure testing, when normalized power was significantly lower in all frequency ranges examined (time x drug: \u03b4-\u03b8: <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=20.86, p&lt;0.001; \u03b2-low \u03b3: <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=20.22, p&lt;0.001; ripple (100\u2013200\u2009Hz): <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=5.96, p&lt;0.05, not shown). We focused further analyses on \u03b2-low \u03b3 power because this is known to be sensitive to KA both in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Fisahn et al., 2004</a>) and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib46\">Medvedev et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">L\u00e9vesque et al., 2009</a>) and may contribute to the spread of seizures to other brain regions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Finnerty and Jefferys, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">L\u00e9vesque et al., 2009</a>). The seizure-induced increase in \u03b2-low \u03b3 power in fadrozole-treated rats was 59% lower during the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and time in seizure based on a threshold of 5x baseline \u03b2-low \u03b3 power was 44% lower in the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr (time x drug: <i>F</i><sub>1,19</sub>=16.87, p&lt;0.01, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>).

However, there is currently no direct evidence for hippocampal estrogen synthesis in vivo.

The mean basal concentration of E2 we detected in dialysate was 6.3 \u00b1 0.8 pg/ml (23.3 \u00b1 2.9 pM); levels were slightly higher in females (7.1 \u00b1 1.0 pg/ml) than in males (5.4 \u00b1 1.2 pg/ml), but the difference was not statistically significant (<i>t</i><sub>41</sub>=1.10. p=0.28).

We divided animals into those that experienced mild, moderate, or severe seizures based on the amount of time that each animal spent in seizure behaviors more severe than staring (Racine 1\u20135) during 2\u2009hrs after KA. This demonstrated that animals with relatively mild seizures (&lt;30\u2009min, n=10, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) showed a small increase in E2 (188 \u00b1 38% baseline, <i>F</i><sub>2,18</sub>=5.39, p&lt;0.05) that was delayed relative to KA administration, whereas those with moderate seizures (30\u201390\u2009min, n=17, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) showed a large increase in E2 (318 \u00b1 68% baseline, <i>F</i><sub>2,23</sub>=8.22, p&lt;0.01) evident within the first 30\u2009min. Interestingly, the small fraction of animals with very severe seizures (&gt;90\u2009min, n=4, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) began with significantly higher basal E2 (10.4 \u00b1 2.0 pg/ml) than those with mild or moderate seizures (5.3 \u00b1 0.8 pg/ml, <i>t</i><sub>29</sub>=2.22, p&lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and hippocampal E2 remained high during seizures in those animals (97 \u00b1 33% baseline). This is in contrast to animals with mild or moderate seizures in which E2 levels increased to 8.9 \u00b1 0.8 pg/ml, a significant difference from their baseline (<i>t</i><sub>52</sub>=2.54, p&lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). That already high hippocampal E2 did not increase further in animals with the most severe seizures suggests a ceiling on hippocampal E2 and raises the possibility that high basal E2 in the hippocampus of a small number of animals may have predisposed them to more severe seizures. Together, the results of microdialysis experiments demonstrated that KA seizures increase E2 levels in the hippocampus and indicated that high hippocampal E2 is associated with greater seizure severity."

Coupled with results from microdialysis showing seizure-induced E2 synthesis in the hippocampus, this suggests that E2 synthesized in the hippocampus may be acutely seizure-promoting. To test this possibility, we first bilaterally infused fadrozole (10 \u00b5g/side, n=10) or vehicle (30% \u03b2-cyclodextrin in saline, n=11) into the dorsal hippocampus 20\u2009min before KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and monitored seizures for 2\u2009hrs. We used pre-treatment in this experiment because of difficulties associated with intra-hippocampal infusion after the onset of seizures and to avoid the possibility that infusions would disrupt EEG recording. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> shows data from a representative vehicle-infused animal, demonstrating the same pattern of hippocampal electrographic activity and accompanying behavioral seizures as in non-infused animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). Also as seen previously, increased EEG activity in the hippocampus often corresponded to behaviors characteristic of mild limbic seizures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and the relationship between electrographic seizure activity was stronger for mild limbic than convulsive seizure behaviors (amplitude: <i>F</i><sub>4,94</sub>=44.02, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; power: <i>F</i><sub>4,94</sub>=21.13, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In contrast to systemic fadrozole, however, intra-hippocampal fadrozole did not affect the strength of cross-correlation between EEG amplitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) or power (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and seizure behaviors."

In contrast to systemic inhibition of aromatase with fadrozole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the effect of intra-hippocampal fadrozole was specific to the \u03b2-low \u03b3 frequency range; neither \u03b4-\u03b8 (1\u201310\u2009Hz) nor ripple (100\u2013200\u2009Hz) power showed significantly different seizure-related changes (p values &gt;0.2, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

For example, previous studies have shown that brain injury can induce aromatase expression in glia (<a href=\"#bib56\">Peterson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carswell et al., 2005</a>). To confirm that the effect of fadrozole to suppress seizures was not influenced by implanted electrodes, we repeated KA treatment (15 mg/kg) with intra-hippocampal vehicle (n=29) or fadrozole (n=29) in animals without electrodes in the hippocampus. The dose of KA was increased to achieve the same overall levels of seizure severity as in animals with EEG electrodes implanted. As in previous experiments, seizures were monitored for 2\u2009hrs after KA. This showed that fadrozole significantly delayed the onset of behavioral seizures (Racine 0, <i>t</i><sub>52</sub>=2.57, p&lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and strongly attenuated seizure progression. While the proportion of rats exhibiting the earliest stage of behavioral seizure, staring (Racine 0), was the same in vehicle- and fadrozole-infused animals, significantly fewer fadrozole-treated rats progressed beyond staring and the majority never progressed beyond mild limbic seizures. This was in contrast to vehicle-treated rats in which roughly 2/3 progressed to convulsive seizures (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>-tests, p&lt;0.05 or p&lt;0.01, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In addition, even among rats that progressed to more severe seizure behaviors, fadrozole significantly reduced the time animals spent in any seizures beyond staring (Racine 1\u20135, time x drug: <i>F</i><sub>1,30</sub>=6.99, p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and in mild limbic seizures specifically (Racine 1\u20132, time x drug: <i>F</i><sub>1,30</sub>=5.64, p&lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) in the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr. Mean time spent in convulsive seizures (Racine 3\u20135) was lower in fadrozole-treated rats, but this was not a significant difference (time x drug: F<sub>1,24</sub>=0.74, p=0.40). Seizure suppression by intra-hippocampal fadrozole is also readily visible in heatmaps plotting the maximum seizure stage reached per minute in individual animals (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results showed that the seizure-suppressing effect of acutely inhibiting hippocampal aromatase activity is not related to tissue damage resulting from hippocampal electrodes."

Overall, behavioral seizures were more severe with gonads intact, consistent with a proconvulsant effect of circulating hormones (<a href=\"#bib72\">Terasawa and Timiras, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nicoletti et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Woolley, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mejias-Aponte et al., 2002</a>). This was particularly evident in females, in which it was not feasible to use 10 mg/kg KA. Thus we lowered the dose of KA to 7.5 mg/kg in females (n=5 vehicle, n=4 letrozole), to achieve the same range of seizure severity as in males treated with 10 mg/kg KA (n=6 vehicle, n=6 letrozole). Statistical analyses in gonadally intact animals therefore included KA dose as a covariate."

We found that systemic administration of an aromatase inhibitor after the onset of KA seizures strongly suppressed electrographic and behavioral seizure activity, in both sexes, without additional interventions. Microdialysis showed that seizures stimulate <i>de novo</i> synthesis of estrogens in the hippocampus and that animals with more severe seizures began with or reached higher levels of E2 in the hippocampus. Because E2 is known to acutely promote hippocampal neural activity, this suggested that E2 synthesized in the hippocampus might be seizure-promoting. Consistent with this, infusion of an aromatase inhibitor specifically into the hippocampus also suppressed both electrographic and behavioral seizures. These results support the idea of a positive feedback loop between seizure activity and neurosteroid estrogens in which seizures stimulate estrogen synthesis in the brain, which then acutely promotes neural activity, contributing to further seizure activity. Breaking this cycle with aromatase inhibitor therapy may be a novel approach to clinical control of SE."

                                "text": "Decades of in vitro studies have shown that E2 acutely potentiates neural activity in the hippocampus. Since the early work of <a href=\"#bib73\">Teyler et al. (1980)</a>, which showed that E2 application to hippocampal slices rapidly increases extracellularly recorded field potentials, multiple groups have demonstrated acute E2 modulation of hippocampal intrinsic and synaptic physiology. For example, E2 suppresses Ca<sup>++</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents to reduce the slow afterhyperpolarization following a burst of action potentials (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kumar and Foster, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carrer et al., 2003</a>) and increases repetitive action potential firing in response to current injection (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). E2 also acutely promotes excitatory synaptic transmission through both increased glutamate release probability and increased postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kramar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Smejkalova and Woolley, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Oberlander and Woolley, 2016</a>). The molecular mechanisms that underlie these effects are under active investigation by our lab and others. Most studies indicate that E2\u2019s acute actions are mediated by membrane-associated forms of the classical estrogen receptors, ER\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huang and Woolley, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tabatadze et al., 2015</a>) and ER\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kramar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Smejkalova and Woolley, 2010</a>), as well as the G protein-coupled ER, GPER1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kumar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Oberlander and Woolley, 2016</a>), and involve downstream signaling through protein kinases including Src, Erk1/2, protein kinase A, and RhoA kinase (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boulware et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kramar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zadran et al., 2009</a>) to influence synaptic transmission. Although it is possible that inhibiting aromatase resulted in increased levels of estrogen precursors, such as testosterone or androstenedione, the well-known effects of E2 to acutely promote neural activity make an estrogen-based explanation for the seizure-suppressing effects of aromatase inhibitors the most parsimonious. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the possibility that aromatase inhibition suppresses seizures by influencing other steroids in addition to E2."

                                "text": "Our microdialysis results indicate that E2 reaches sufficient concentrations in the hippocampus to promote seizure activity. For example, based on our probe recovery estimate of ~30% and the mean basal concentrations of E2 we detected in dialysate, basal E2 concentrations in the hippocampus of gonadectomized rats average at least ~20 pg/ml (74 pM). The highest concentrations we measured indicate that hippocampal E2 reaches ~100 pg/ml (367 pM) after KA, which overlaps with E2 concentrations known to acutely potentiate intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission when bath-applied in vitro (100 pM, e.g., <a href=\"#bib65\">Smejkalova and Woolley, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). Separately, two considerations suggest that our estimates of extracellular E2 levels are likely to underestimate in vivo concentrations at or near synapses, where extranuclear ERs are located (<a href=\"#bib48\">Milner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hart et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Waters et al., 2015</a>). First, electron microscopic immunogold labeling indicates that aromatase is concentrated at synapses (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hojo et al., 2004</a>). This suggests that synaptic E2 levels could be substantially higher than levels measured using microdialysis, which samples a large extracellular volume. Second, we obtained the in vitro probe recovery value of 30% with no E2 carrier (e.g., BSA) in the bath; this value therefore reflects maximum recovery. If E2 is carrier-bound in the brain, then total E2 levels could be substantially higher than our estimates indicate. These considerations make it very likely that E2 reaches sufficient concentrations in the brain during seizures to potentiate neuronal excitability and/or synaptic transmission and thereby promote further seizure activity through one or more of the mechanisms that have been indentified in vitro."

Passive diffusion, active reuptake, and/or active metabolism could be involved. Passive diffusion in extracellular space is possible, as the maximum solubility of E2 in aqueous medium is estimated to be in the\u00a0low \u00b5M range (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shareef et al., 2006</a>). In addition, the lipophilic nature of estrogens allows their diffusion across or within membranes, including the plasma membrane, which could reduce E2 levels in extracellular space. Sequestration and/or transport of locally synthesized E2 may also be aided by carrier molecules, as is the case for steroids in circulation. Steroids bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) can be actively transported across the plasma membrane in an immortailized hippocampal cell line (<a href=\"#bib8\">Caldwell et al., 2007</a>), although it is currently not known whether SHBGs are expressed in the hippocampus in vivo."

Studies in peripheral systems show that the aromatase enzyme can switch between aromatase and hydroxylase activity in a pH-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib54\">Osawa et al., 1993</a>). Aromatization is the final step in E2 synthesis; hydroxylation is an initial step in conversion of E2 to an inactive form (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2003</a>). The ratio of aromatase to hydroxylase activity is greatest at acidic pH, whereas hydroxylase activity predominates at alkaline pH. This is potentially relevant to seizures in that, in vitro, KCl-induced depolarization of neurons (<a href=\"#bib68\">Svichar et al., 2011</a>) or treatment with the NMDA receptor co-agonist glycine (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diering et al., 2011</a>) produces biphasic changes in intracellular pH: an initial acid transient is followed by alkalinization. Thus, the proximity of aromatase to acid-loading or acid-extruding membrane proteins that mediate activity-dependent changes in intracellular pH during seizures (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sinning et al., 2011</a>) may control a balance of aromatase vs. hydroxylase activity in a way that initially promotes E2 synthesis, followed by E2 inactivation through hydroxylation. Further studies will be required to test this idea."

For example, glutamate retrodialysis reduced E2 levels in a cortical brain area in zebra finches (<a href=\"#bib59\">Remage-Healey et al., 2008</a>) and treatment of quail hypothalamic explants with glutamate receptor agonists lowered aromatase activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balthazart et al., 2006</a>). In contrast, glutamate receptor activation increases aromatase activity in rat hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hojo et al., 2004</a>) and our findings with in vivo seizures in rats are consistent with this. Thus there may be species- and/or brain region-specific regulation of aromatase activity. One possibility is that species differences in enzyme structure lead to differences in aromatase regulation. Aromatase activity requires access to lipophilic substrate, and differences between avian and mammalian aromatase are greater in a region responsible for membrane association (~58% identity) than catalytic activity (~73% identity, chicken vs. rat, <a href=\"#bib19\">Ghosh et al., 2009</a>)."

Thus, acute aromatase inhibitor treatment may be useful in seizure patients, most of whom are gonadally intact. One concern, however, is that aromatase inhibition would eliminate the neuroprotective effects of estrogens (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hoffman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schauwecker et al., 2009</a>), which could have the detrimental effect of excacerbating seizure-related damage in the brain. We investigated this and found no effects of either intra-hippocampal fadrozole in gonadectomized animals or systemic letrozole in gonadally intact animals on seizure-induced cell death. It is possible that the milder seizures with aromatase inhibition, which would be expected to result in less cell death, were balanced by loss of estrogen neuroprotection producing roughly equivalent seizure-induced cell death. Further experiments with more detailed analyses of seizure-related neuronal damage will be required to investigate how aromatase inhibition interacts with estrogen neuroprotection to influence downstream sequelae of seizure activity."

For EEG without intra-hippocampal infusions, the same recording electrodes were attached to guide wires with recording electrodes extending 2\u2009mm beyond the end of the guide wire. All implants were secured with skull screws and dental cement. Following surgeries, rats were housed in groups of 2\u20133 for infusion and EEG experiments or singly for microdialysis experiments.

For the experiment with fadrozole, 1\u2009ml/kg saline vehicle or fadrozole HCl in saline (40 mg/ml) was slowly injected, and drug solution inside the catheter was flushed with 0.2\u2009ml saline. Seven male rats failed to develop electrographic seizures within 45\u2009min of KA administration. These animals were returned to their home cages and re-tested 1\u20132 days later. Two developed electrographic seizures on the 2<sup>nd</sup> trial and were included (1 Veh, 1 Fad), whereas 5 failed to develop seizures on 2<sup>nd</sup> trial and were excluded. Procedures were the same for the experiment with letrozole except that 19% (w/v) (2-hydroxypropyl) \u03b2-cyclodextrin in saline was used as the vehicle. In this experiment, 4 female rats that failed to develop electrographic seizures within 45\u2009min on the 1<sup>st</sup> trial did develop seizures on the 2<sup>nd</sup> trial and thus were included (3 Veh, 1 Let). For intra-hippocampal administration of vehicle or fadrozole, rats were infused bilaterally (1 \u00b5l/side) either with vehicle (30% w/v (2-hydroxypropyl) \u03b2-cyclodextrin in saline) or fadrozole HCl (10 \u00b5g/\u00b5l), into the dorsal CA1 region at 1 \u00b5l/min through 28G internal infusion cannulae extending 2\u2009mm beyond the implanted guide cannulae.

Mild seizures (Racine 1\u20132) almost always continued after termination of an SE episode, but this was not counted as SE. If/when another 30 s period of uninterrupted Racine 3\u20135 seizures occurred in the same animal, SE was considered to have begun again and to last until 2\u2009min passed with no Racine 3\u20135 seizures. We also evaluated electrographic SE, for which there is also no consensus definition (<a href=\"#bib75\">Trinka et al., 2015</a>). We identified the onset of electrographic SE as an increase in EEG amplitude exceeding 10x baseline for at least 30 sec. After beginning, electrographic SE was considered to end if amplitude dropped below 3x baseline for 30 sec. We found that these parameters captured severe merging seizures without classifying earlier isolated seizures as SE. Also, note that while the term 'electrographic SE' has been used synonymously with non-convulsive SE (e.g., <a href=\"#bib80\">White et al., 2010</a>), the parameters used here were designed to capture severe electrographic seizures that can accompany behavioral SE."

To conduct these tests, we initially included 200 ng/ml of the steroid in 32 pg/ml of E2 standard and tested for a shift in measured E2 concentration. Assays were run in duplicates. If significant (&gt;0.02%) cross-reactivity was suspected, we assayed a series of concentrations of the steroid to quantify cross-reactivity.

N is number of animals, except in the case of microdialysis probe recovery experiments for which n = number of probes tested. EEG amplitude, PSD power and seizure duration data were analyzed with either two-way mixed (drug x time) ANOVAs with time as the repeated variable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>) followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons with unpaired <i>t</i>-tests between drug groups (vehicle vs. fadrozole) at each hr of testing with Bonferroni correction, or with unpaired <i>t</i>-tests between overall means for drug groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Cross-correlations were compared between seizure behaviors with one-way ANOVAs, followed by Newman-Keuls pairwise comparisons between each behavior and unpaired <i>t</i>-tests between drug groups (vehicle vs. fadrozole) with Bonferoni correction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Endogenous aromatase activity was assessed by comparing E2 concentration before vs. after 4-dione retrodialysis with a paired <i>t</i>-test (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Effects of KA-induced seizures on hippocampal E2 were analyzed with one-way repeated measures ANOVAs with time (hr) as the repeated variable followed by pairwise comparisons with post-hoc paired <i>t</i>-tests with Bonfferoni correction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). For behavioral seizure analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), proportion data for rats reaching each stage of seizure behavior were compared with \u03c7 <sup>2</sup> tests. The remaining group comparisons were analyzed with unpaired <i>t</i>-tests (e.g., behavioral seizure latency and duration, analyses of 1<sup>st</sup> seizures, Fluoro-Jade B cell counts). Because male and female rats received different doses of KA in the systemic letrozole experiment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>), KA dose was included as a covariate and results were analyzed by ANCOVA to allow for concurrent analysis of data from both sexes. In all cases, p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. To use the minimum number of animals necessary, we analyzed data once n=4~5 (or ~8 for the non-EEG/dialysis experiment) was reached, and the sample size was increased if a statistical trend (p&lt;0.2) was observed. Final effect sizes were generally large (Cohen\u2019s d\u22480.8) and never d&lt;0.69 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

In SE is studied, the latency to onset, the duration, and incidence should be measured. It seems that animals with fadrozole almost always failed to exhibit SE (from <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the heat maps), supporting the authors' conclusions, so it would be good to do an analysis of SE incidence at least."

However, we concur that the therapeutic potential of our results would be increased by demonstrating that aromatase inhibitors also suppress seizures in gonadally intact animals. To address this, we performed new experiments in which we used systemic administration of an aromatase inhibitor that is used clinically, letrozole, in gonadally intact animals (males and females) after seizures had begun. We also extended the period of seizure monitoring in this experiment to 6 hours, to address other concerns raised below regarding analysis of SE. In brief, these new studies showed that acute systemic aromatase inhibition effectively suppressed seizures in gonadally intact animals, similar to acute systemic aromatase inhibition in gonadectomized animals. These findings are described in a new section of the Results (\u201dSystemic aromatase inhibition acutely suppresses seizures in gonadally intact animals\u201d) and are shown in new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and 8."

One potential explanation for this is that milder seizures following aromatase inhibition, which would be expected to result in less cell death as the Reviewers point out, is balanced by loss of estrogen neuroprotection, producing roughly equivalent seizure-related cell death.
