Here we generated whole-genome, single-nucleotide resolution maps of DNA methylation in several regenerated rice lines. We found that all tested regenerated plants had significant losses of methylation compared to non-regenerated plants. Loss of methylation was largely stable across generations, and certain sites in the genome were particularly susceptible to loss of methylation. Loss of methylation at promoters was associated with deregulated expression of protein-coding genes. Analyses of callus and untransformed plants regenerated from callus indicated that loss of methylation is stochastically induced at the tissue culture step. These changes in methylation may explain a component of somaclonal variation, a phenomenon in which plants derived from tissue culture manifest phenotypic variability."

Here we generated whole-genome, single-nucleotide resolution maps of DNA methylation in several regenerated rice lines. We found that all tested regenerated plants had significant losses of methylation compared to non-regenerated plants. Loss of methylation was largely stable across generations, and certain sites in the genome were particularly susceptible to loss of methylation. Loss of methylation at promoters was associated with deregulated expression of protein-coding genes. Analyses of callus and untransformed plants regenerated from callus indicated that loss of methylation is stochastically induced at the tissue culture step. These changes in methylation may explain a component of somaclonal variation, a phenomenon in which plants derived from tissue culture manifest phenotypic variability."

They prepared high-resolution maps of DNA methylation in several regenerated rice lines, and found that regenerated plants produced in culture showed less methylation than control plants. The changes were relatively over-represented around the promoter sequences of genes\u2014regions of DNA that act as binding sites for the enzymes that transcribe DNA into RNA\u2014and were accompanied by changes in gene expression. Crucially, the plants' descendants frequently also inherited the changes in methylation status. These results are likely part of the explanation for a phenomenon called somaclonal variation, first observed before the era of modern biotechnology, in which plants regenerated from tissue culture sometimes show heritable alterations in the phenotype of the plant."

Tissue culture has been heavily used for decades for transformation procedures to generate transgenic crops such as rice and maize (<a href=\"#bib18\">Rao et al., 2009</a>). A previous study has reported that Arabidopsis cell suspension culture has a different epigenomic profile compared to wild-type plants, such that certain transposable elements (TEs) become hypomethylated and certain genes become hypermethylated (<a href=\"#bib22\">Tanurdzic et al., 2008</a>). This raised the question of how tissue culture processes affect the epigenome of regenerated plants derived from tissue culture. Changes in the epigenome have been proposed to be a source of somaclonal variation (i.e., phenotypic variation among regenerated plants) for decades (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kaeppler and Phillips, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kaeppler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Thorpe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Rhee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Miguel and Marum, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Neelakandan and Wang, 2012</a>). Indeed, some evidence suggesting changes in the epigenome of regenerated plants have been reported at several specific loci or by methods such as methylation sensitive restrictive enzyme digestion (<a href=\"#bib17\">Neelakandan and Wang, 2012</a>). However, the extent of methylation changes on a genome-wide level has not been previously assessed. Because, unlike most crops, Arabidopsis is almost exclusively transformed via Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip methods that do not utilize tissue culture (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clough and Bent, 1998</a>), Arabidopsis is not a good model for the study of the effect of plant regeneration on the epigenome. The study of the model plant rice, however, may have practical implications for other crop species that are transformed using similar tissue culture methods."

We observed that the tissue culture procedure induced stable changes in DNA methylation in regenerated plants, such that all regenerated lines had ectopic losses of DNA methylation. We found that loss of DNA methylation occurred stochastically, affecting individual plants somewhat differently, was associated with loss of small RNAs, and changes were enriched at promoters of genes. Loss of DNA methylation at promoters was associated with altered expression of particular genes."

To further characterize these sites, we defined differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in CG contexts by applying stringent thresholds (see \u2018Materials and methods'). We found that all regenerated plants tested were significantly enriched with CG hypomethylation DMRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). On average, we identified 1344 CG hypomethylation DMRs in the regenerated plants, whose sizes ranged from 100 to 3200 bp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), whereas on average we identified only eight CG hypomethylation DMRs in the inbred wild-type lines (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Importantly, we observed hypomethylation even in the T2/T4 non-transgenic plants in which the transgenes had been segregated away (samples 5, 7 and 12), suggesting that loss of DNA methylation is likely due to the tissue culture or transformation process, but not due to the fact that the plants contain transgenes. While loss of DNA methylation in different regenerated lines did not always occur at the same sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), there were significant overlaps of hypomethylation DMRs among regenerated lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This suggests that certain sites in the genome are susceptible to loss of DNA methylation in regenerated plants."

This suggests that most sites do not regain DNA methylation over several subsequent generations during the process of inbreeding. Approximately 10% of sites recovered methylation in T4, and this methylation was maintained in T6. In addition, 4.4% of sites recovered methylation in T6 but not in T4. This suggests that certain sites are able to regain methylation over generations. Approximately 2% of sites regained methylation in T4, but methylation was lost again in T6, suggesting that a small fraction of sites are epigenetically unstable and continue to switch states. Our results suggest that most of the DNA hypomethylation in regenerated plants was stable over generations."

Small interfering RNAs of 24-nt in length (24-nt siRNAs) are associated with DNA methylation, and are required to guide CHH methylation to particular sites (<a href=\"#bib14\">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</a>). We performed small RNA sequencing (smRNA-seq) on seven randomly chosen regenerated plants along with wild type (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We examined the distribution of 24-nt siRNAs over CHH hypomethylation DMRs and found that siRNAs are enriched over these sites in wild type, but eliminated in regenerated plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Although loss of DNA methylation occurred at a variety of sites, we found the most significant enrichments of DMRs at the promoters of genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These genes were not significantly associated with any particular biological processes (data not shown). Rather, they appeared to be a random set of genes involved in different processes (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Recent studies in Arabidopsis have shown that spontaneous changes in methylation over generations predominantly occurred in gene bodies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Becker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Schmitz et al., 2011</a>). It is possible that hypomethylation observed in regenerated plants occurs through an accelerated process of whatever mechanism causes spontaneous methylation changes over generations. Alternatively, since the DNA methylation changes we observed in regenerated plants was enriched in gene promoters, and was primarily in the direction of methylation loss, it could be a distinct phenomenon from the spontaneously occurring methylation changes in wild type."

We found that loss of DNA methylation at promoters was associated with higher expression levels of certain genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1, 2</a>).

To test this, we performed BS-seq on callus and three individual plants regenerated from untransformed callus, all of which were derived from a single parent plant (WT2011; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We were not able to perform BS-seq on individual calli because calli at the stage of transformation did not yield enough genomic DNA. Instead, we pooled multiple calli, and sequenced two separate batches. We found a strong loss of DNA methylation in plants regenerated from untransformed callus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Loss of DNA methylation in callus was much more modest, though significant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This relatively weak loss of DNA methylation may be because individual calli lose DNA methylation at different sites (despite being derived from the same parent plant), and pooling multiple calli diluted the loss of DNA methylation. Consistent with this notion, individual plants regenerated from untransformed callus showed differences in sites that lost DNA methylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, when examining methylation levels of these samples at CG hypomethylation DMRs that were common in all regenerated plants, we found significant losses of DNA methylation at these sites in callus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), indicating that the methylation losses observed in callus were at largely the same sites as those observed in regenerated plants. Like in the regenerated lines, the losses of DNA methylation in the non-transformed regenerated plants occurred stochastically, affecting DNA methylation in each plant somewhat differently (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). In summary, the loss of DNA methylation in regenerated plants is likely caused by the tissue culture step, and not due to the transformation process."

Consistent with those data we found that rice callus showed hypermethylation throughout the genome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Interestingly we found that the hypermethylation occurred specifically in CHH contexts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and showed high coincidence between the two callus samples (13 and 14) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These CHH hypermethylated regions mostly corresponded to promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Hence in callus, certain promoters are CHH hypermethylated, while others are hypomethylated in all cytosine contexts.

Consistent with a previous study in Arabidopsis cell culture using microarray hybridization on chromosome 4 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Tanurdzic et al., 2008</a>), we observed hypermethylation at certain genes in rice callus. We extend this observation by showing that hypermethylation predominantly occurs in CHH sequence contexts, most notably occurring at the promoters of genes. Interestingly, we found that this CHH hypermethylation was completely eliminated upon regeneration, suggesting that CHH hypermethylation may be linked specifically to the dedifferentiated state."

Instead, we found that DNA methylation was specifically lost at certain sites in the genome, appearing to affect individual plants somewhat differently despite coming from the same parent plant. We found that loss of DNA methylation was maintained upon plant regeneration, and was largely stable over subsequent generations. It is possible that some of the DMRs affected only one homologous chromosome and were segregating. However, because we required DMRs to have at least 70% reduction in DNA methylation compared to wild-type, the sites we analyzed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> are likely homozygous for loss of DNA methylation, consistent with their stability across generations. Loss of DNA methylation occurred in all sequence contexts, and was associated with loss of 24-nt siRNAs. Notably, these sites were frequently associated with promoters of genes, and loss of DNA methylation was associated with misregulation of expression of proximal protein-coding genes, indicating a biological importance of this phenomenon. Interestingly, genes significantly up-regulated (fourfold upregulated compared to wild type, p&lt;0.01) in each regenerated line were somewhat different (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). For this reason, it is difficult to assess the severity of impact of misregulated gene expression for any particular regenerated line, since some lines may have more biologically important genes affected than others. This would correlate with the observation that somoclonal variation affects only a proportion of plants that arise from regeneration experiments (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kaeppler and Phillips, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kaeppler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Thorpe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Rhee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Miguel and Marum, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Neelakandan and Wang, 2012</a>)."

While our results suggest that most DNA hypomethylation occurs near genes and are relatively depleted at TE related sequences (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), some of the hypomethylation did occur proximal to TE genes (average of 62.1 TE genes per line). The association of loss of methylation with TE gene reactivation was not clear (data not shown), however very subtle depletion of DNA methylation was observed over reactivated TE genes (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), suggesting that loss of methylation may in part be responsible for reactivation of TEs."

It therefore appears that the tissue culture step induces DNA hypomethylation in a rather stochastic manner affecting individual plants differently. We further show that descendants of regenerated plants stably maintain most hypomethylation across plant generations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Indeed, lines derived from the same original regenerated plant show very similar methylation profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; samples 4\u20138 and 11\u201312). It has long been proposed that changes in the epigenome may be a source of somaclonal variation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Thorpe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Rhee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Miguel and Marum, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Neelakandan and Wang, 2012</a>). Our genome-wide data support this notion since we show that stochastic hypomethylation in individual regenerants is associated with misregulated expression of certain genes. These epigenetic changes likely explain a component of somaclonal variation that has been observed for decades in a number of plant species."

Whereas the material used in this study were self-fertilized plants, a common practice in the development of agricultural biotechnology traits is to introgress new transgene loci into commercial genetic backgrounds, meaning that the plants used in agriculture are many generations removed from the initial regenerated plants (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bregitzer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bennetzen and Hake, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Johnson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Yang et al., 2012</a>).
