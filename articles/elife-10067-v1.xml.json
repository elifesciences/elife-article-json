We have developed a proteomics approach to quantitatively profile the changes of sulfhydrated cysteines in biological systems. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that sulfhydrated cysteines are part of a wide range of biological functions. In pancreatic \u03b2 cells exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, elevated H<sub>2</sub>S promotes the sulfhydration of enzymes in energy metabolism and stimulates glycolytic flux. We propose that transcriptional and translational reprogramming by the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) in pancreatic \u03b2 cells is coupled to metabolic alternations triggered by sulfhydration of key enzymes in intermediary metabolism."
