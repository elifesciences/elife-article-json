In alkaliphilic prokaryotes, high external pH activates voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>), which allows Na<sup>+</sup> to enter and be used as substrate for cation/proton antiporters responsible for cytoplasmic pH homeostasis. Here, we describe a new member of the prokaryotic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel family (NsvBa; <span class=\"underline\">N</span>on-<span class=\"underline\">s</span>elective <span class=\"underline\">v</span>oltage-gated, <i><span class=\"underline\">B</span>acillus <span class=\"underline\">a</span>lcalophilus</i>) that is nonselective among Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. Mutations in NsvBa can convert the nonselective filter into one that discriminates for Na<sup>+</sup> or divalent cations. Gain-of-function experiments demonstrate the portability of ion selectivity with filter mutations to other <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels. Increasing pH and temperature shifts their activation threshold towards their native resting membrane potential. Furthermore, we find drugs that target <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels also block the growth of the bacteria. This work identifies some of the adaptations to achieve ion discrimination and gating in <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels."

In alkaliphilic prokaryotes, high external pH activates voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>), which allows Na<sup>+</sup> to enter and be used as substrate for cation/proton antiporters responsible for cytoplasmic pH homeostasis. Here, we describe a new member of the prokaryotic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel family (NsvBa; <span class=\"underline\">N</span>on-<span class=\"underline\">s</span>elective <span class=\"underline\">v</span>oltage-gated, <i><span class=\"underline\">B</span>acillus <span class=\"underline\">a</span>lcalophilus</i>) that is nonselective among Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. Mutations in NsvBa can convert the nonselective filter into one that discriminates for Na<sup>+</sup> or divalent cations. Gain-of-function experiments demonstrate the portability of ion selectivity with filter mutations to other <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels. Increasing pH and temperature shifts their activation threshold towards their native resting membrane potential. Furthermore, we find drugs that target <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels also block the growth of the bacteria. This work identifies some of the adaptations to achieve ion discrimination and gating in <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels."

But how do ion channels discriminate amongst ions and how did they acquire this ability during evolution? To address these questions, researchers have studied a family of sodium channels from bacteria for the past decade. Here DeCaen et al. describe a new member from this ion channel family from a bacterium called <i>Bacillus alcalophilus</i>. This ion channel does not discriminate between positively-charged ions and <i>B. alcalophilus</i> needs this ion channel for it to dwell in environments that have high levels of potassium or sodium. DeCaen et al. demonstrate that these ion channels can be made selective for sodium or calcium with as little as two small changes in the gene that encodes the ion channel. Furthermore, making similar genetic mutations in related ion channel genes from other <i>Bacillus</i> species has the same effect. DeCaen et al. suggest that <i>Bacillus</i> ion channel genes are easily adapted to function in a variety of environmental conditions with different levels of positively-charged ions. Thus it is easier for <i>Bacillus</i> channels to evolve to be selective for different ions."

While the structural and biophysical determinants of K<sup>+</sup> selectivity are well described (<a href=\"#bib6\">Doyle et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Jiang et al., 2003</a>), those of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are unresolved. To fill this knowledge gap, the voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub> channels) from bacteria have been extensively studied by structural biologists. To date, two full-length (NavAb and NavRh) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Payandeh et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) and three pore-only (NavMs, NavAe and NavCt) (<a href=\"#bib18\">McCusker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Tsai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Shaya et al., 2014</a>) prokaryotic Na<sup>+</sup> channel crystal structures have been solved. The full-length structures demonstrate that four identical subunits, each containing 6-transmembrane segments, assemble together to form a functional channel. The first four transmembrane segments form the voltage sensor (S1\u2013S4) while the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments (S5, S6) form the pore domain. The selectivity filter, which forms critical interactions with the permeating hydrated ions, defines the pore and is scaffolded by two pore helices (P1 and P2) from each subunit. The dipole created by the helices, and an acidic residue from each subunit, create an electronegative region that attracts cations. However, the molecular arrangement that enables Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity in prokaryotes might differ from mammalian voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Thus, it is not clear if structural features that determine ion selectivity in homotetrameric prokaryotic Na<sub>V</sub> reflect the functionally heterotetrameric eukaryotic sodium channels."

Since then, Na<sub>V</sub> channels from at least 9 bacterial species have been functionally characterized. All full-length channels exhibit Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ren et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Koishi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Irie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ulmschneider et al., 2013</a>). Most bacteria require the ion-motive forces provided by H<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ions that move through the MotAB or MotPS stator to power the rotary motor proteins to drive the motion of the flagella, (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Fujinami et al., 2009</a>). In soda lakes and other extremely H<sup>+</sup>-poor (pH 9\u201312; 1 nM\u20141 pM [H<sup>+</sup>]) and Na<sup>+</sup>-rich environments (up to 500 mM), alkaliphilic prokaryotes couple motility and ion transporters to Na<sup>+</sup> rather than H<sup>+</sup>. Growth and motility of the alkaliphilic bacterium <i>Bacillus alcalophilus</i> AV (<a href=\"#bib31\">Vedder, 1934</a>) are better supported in K<sup>+</sup> rather than Na<sup>+</sup> conditions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Terahara et al., 2012</a>). In alkaliphilic <i>Bacillus</i>, either ion can drive the flagellar motor, and a single mutation in the MotS protein was identified that converted the naturally nonselective MotPS (Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>) stator into a Na<sup>+</sup>-selective stator. Presumably, bacterial Nav channels provide a source of Na<sup>+</sup> ions that drives the stators and maintains ion homeostasis. However, it is unclear what condition or stimulus would open these channels at the very hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials (\u03a8<sub>rest</sub> \u2248 \u2212180 mV) found in bacteria."

While related to members of the Na<sub>v</sub> superfamily (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), NsvBa is nonselective among cations. Using mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the nonselective filter from NsvBa can be converted into one that is more selective for Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that these features can be conferred onto the NaChBac filter. In addition to selectivity, we characterize the voltage-, pH- and temperature-dependence of <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels. We find that a combination of higher temperature and pH are required to reduce the activation threshold of channel opening in <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels, which is unique to this family of sodium channels. We also characterize Na<sub>v</sub> current antagonism by drugs that impaired the growth and motility of alkaliphilic <i>Bacillus</i> species at corresponding concentrations. These findings shed light on the biophysical requirements for ion channel selectivity, pharmacology, biochemical adaptations among <i>Bacillus</i> species, and the evolution of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels."

We cloned NsvBa and generated plasmids for mammalian cell expression to enable measurement by patch clamp methods. Currents from NsvBa-transfected HEK293T cells were robust (\u2248119 pA/pF in 150 mM extracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>]) with voltage-dependent activation and inactivation similar to NaChBac (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The time constant of NsvBa Na<sup>+</sup> current inactivation (\u03c4<sub>inact</sub>) measured at 0 mV was 42 ms, \u223c2 times faster than NaChBac (78 ms) but \u223c6 times slower than NavMs (7 ms, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The sequence TLESWxxG is conserved in the selectivity filters of prokaryotic Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Although the sequence of NsvBa is homologous to other prokaryotic Na<sub>v</sub> channels, the selectivity filter sequence (TLDSWGSG) deviates at the high field-strength site (Site<sub>HFS</sub> most extracellular site; see Discussion) with an aspartate residue replacing glutamate (D186) and a flexible glycine at an extracellular position (G189). When aligned, G189 and G191 form a \u2018GxG motif\u2019 commonly found in K<sup>+</sup>-selective (Kv) and nonselective ion channels (<i>e.g.</i>, TRP and CNG channels, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To determine the selectivity of the NsvBa channel, we patch clamped transiently-transfected HEK cells and measured voltage-dependent currents in the presence of monovalent alkali ions (Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>) or divalent alkaline earth metals (Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Compared to the relatively Na<sup>+</sup>-selective NaChBac channel, NsvBa was nonselective and all cations but Cs<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> permeated the pore (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). NsvBa Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> single channel conductances were equivalent (30 \u00b1 3 pS and 36 \u00b1 3 pS, respectively, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the channel does not distinguish between these ions."

These changes conferred Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity onto the channel and abrogated all other monovalent and divalent conductances (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). When tested separately, the single mutation D186E was sufficient for Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), whereas the single mutation of G189A substantially reduced, but did not entirely abolish, the permeability of K<sup>+</sup> and Rb<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Furthermore, the G189A mutant channel still conducted Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> divalent ions, whereas the D186E mutation did not. These data suggest that a glutamate at Site<sub>HFS</sub> selects Na<sup>+</sup> among other cations while the \u2018GxG motif\u2019 likely provides an extracellular K<sup>+</sup> or Rb<sup>+</sup> ion coordination site, possibly involving the glycine backbone carbonyls as found in the selectivity filter of the potassium and NaK channels (<a href=\"#bib6\">Doyle et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jiang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alam and Jiang, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alam and Jiang 2009b</a>). Next we sought to determine whether the NsvBa filter sequence could be transferred into Na<sup>+</sup>-selective NaChBac. When the Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity filter of NaChBac (TLESWASG) was mutated at two positions (E192D:A195 G) to conform to the NsvBa nonselective filter (TL<span class=\"underline\">D</span>SW<span class=\"underline\">G</span>SG), ion selectivity was identical to that of NsvBa (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>).

Voltage gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>s) are thought to achieve Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selectivity by a symmetric ring of 4 glutamate residues (EEEE), each contributed by one domain of the polypeptide (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hess et al., 1986</a>). In contrast, prokaryotes achieve Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity from an apparent 4-fold symmetry of acidic residues, each from a subunit in the homomer. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the Na<sup>+</sup>-selective NaChBac (TLESWASG) filter could be converted into one that prefers the divalents Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> by introducing acidic residues into three positions in the filter sequence (TL<span class=\"underline\">DD</span>WA<span class=\"underline\">D</span>G) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Yue et al., 2002</a>). This filter sequence also was grafted into the NavAb channel (called CavAb), shown to be more Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective, and the high-resolution structure determined (<a href=\"#bib26\">Tang et al., 2014</a>). We tested the LD<span class=\"underline\">D</span>W<span class=\"underline\">AD</span>G mutated filter (S187D:G189A:S190D) in the NsvBa channel and confirmed that it was divalent permeant (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>) but it also had measurable permeability to monovalent cations (including K<sup>+</sup> and Rb<sup>+</sup>), demonstrating that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-preference achieved by this filter (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub>\u223c30, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is much lower than mammalian Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> \u2273 1000) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tsien et al., 1987</a>).

Our findings demonstrate that this family of prokaryotic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels are not exclusively Na<sup>+</sup>-selective and that the filter sequence that controls passage of cations into the bacteria are transferable within the <i>Bacillus</i> genus. Through a series of mutations, we showed that the selectivity of <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels can be converted from nonselective, to relatively higher Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity, suggesting that the filter is readily mutable in evolution to adapt to ionic conditions. These highly adaptable selectivity filters are critical for the <i>Bacillus</i> alkaliphiles, allowing for the habitation of various cation-rich environments in which they presumably evolved.

In the CavAb structure, 3 hydrated Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions were found coordinated within the filter and 3 sites (Sites 1\u20133) proposed within the filter. Site 1, the one closest to the extracellular surface, is formed by 4 Asp carboxyl side chains, equivalent to positions Ser 196 in NaChBac and Ser 190 in NsvBa. Site 2 (equivalent to Site<sub>HFS</sub> in the wt NavAb crystal structure) is formed by four side chain carboxyls and four backbone carbonyls from equivalent residues of Glu 192 in NaChBac and Asp 186 in NsvBa. Our data suggest that the shorter side chain of the NsvBa Asp acidic residue at site 2 is correlated with decreased Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity, but Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity can be artificially endowed when replaced by a Glu (D186E) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In agreement with this interpretation, a recent report demonstrates that when the longer side chain Glu 192 is mutated to the shorter Asp in NaChBac (E192D), the channel becomes less selective for Na<sup>+</sup> among Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Finol-Urdaneta et al., 2014</a>). The full-length bacteria Na<sub>V</sub> from marine \u03b1-proteobacterium <i>Rickettsiales</i> HIMB114 (NavRh) was crystallized containing the selectivity filter TLSSWET-. Although the NavRh channel did not function when heterologously expressed in mammalian and insect cells, the filter was found to be Na<sup>+</sup>-selective when grafted into the NaChBac channel. It is surprising that although the glutamates within the NavRh and NavAb filters originate at distinct positions (See <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the carboxyl side chains from both channels occupy the same positions in space (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Thus, it is likely that selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> over other cations is partly achieved by the geometry of the arrangement of the carboxylates at Site 2 (Site<sub>HFS</sub>) within the filter of bacterial Na<sup>+</sup> channels. High-resolution crystal structures of Na<sub>v</sub> channels in which sodium ions are resolved are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

It is not clear whether cation-selective or nonselective filters arose first within prokaryotes. Analysis comparing domains of bacteria and mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels indicate that Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity was independently acquired in these channels families (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liebeskind et al., 2013</a>). Bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels are functionally more related to homotetrameric CatSper and Kv channels and thus may not be direct ancestors of mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels. Our results are consistent with this interpretation. Not surprisingly, we were not able convert <i>Bacillus</i> Na<sub>v</sub> channels to K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels by mutating the filter sequence, presumably since the pore architecture between Kv and bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels (e.g. lumen size, filter length and number of pore helices) are structurally divergent. Our results suggest that the \u2018GxG motif\u2019 found in the NsvBa filter evolved convergently within the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> family and is only distantly related to K<sup>+</sup>-selective Kv channels. A recent report on the expression and characterization of Na<sup>+</sup> channel homologs from the invertebrate sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> (NvNa<sub>V</sub>2.1), revealed a heterotetrameric Na<sup>+</sup> channels bearing noncanonical selectivity site (DEEA) that was not selective among K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gur Barzilai et al., 2012</a>). Thus it appears that the homomeric prokaryotic NsvBa and functionally-heteromeric eukaryotic NvNa<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels are examples of evolution of Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity to non-selectivity that occurred independently within prokaryotes and metazoans."

At first glance, this appears to contrast with the 140 mV difference between the \u03a8<sub>rest</sub> and V<sub>1/2</sub> of alkaliphilic <i>Bacillus</i>. But as we have shown, increasing alkalinity and temperature shift bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> V<sub>1/2</sub>'s to approximately \u2212100 mV. At temperatures approaching 40\u00b0C, our patch recordings became unstable, thus limiting the temperature range we tested to &lt;37\u00b0C. If the sodium current sensitivity is extrapolated to 60\u00b0C, the voltage dependence would likely be well within 80 mV of the most negative bacterial resting membrane potential. Since bacterial \u03a8<sub>rest</sub> is a function of metabolic state (Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> pumping) and bacteria occupy more variable ionic environments than neurons, the larger difference between \u2018optimal\u2019 a \u03a8<sub>rest</sub> and V<sub>1/2</sub> makes physiological sense. The high temperature and pH sensitivity of bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels is similar to TRP and some Kv channels (<a href=\"#bib20\">Patapoutian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yang and Zheng, 2014</a>), and is not shared by vertebrate Na<sub>v</sub> channels. We suspect that the fidelity of neuronal firing in metazoans, which depend on their Na<sub>V</sub> channels, led to evolution of less sensitivity to pH and temperature, perhaps by selection of the residues that become exposed to waters within the voltage-sensing S4 and selectivity filter (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chowdhury et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, we propose that alkaliphilic bacteria, which dwell in high temperature (35\u201360\u00b0C) and high pH (9\u201311) environments, employ homomeric Na<sub>v</sub> channels for an entirely different purpose, that of rapidly adjusting internal sodium concentration for metabolic control. This would thus impact growth rates of these <i>Bacillus</i> species as we have observed."

Although all three drugs affected motility for <i>B. pseudofirmus</i>, only tamoxifen and nifedipine increased tumbling frequency of <i>B. alcalophilus</i>. These results suggest that in <i>B. alcalophilus</i> there may be other transporters or channels besides NsvBa that provide a cation source to drive flagellar motion. These finding demonstrate that block of Na<sup>+</sup> entry via Na<sub>v</sub>, which disrupts the sodium cycle, can impair <i>Bacillus</i> motility and growth. The prokaryotic Na<sub>v</sub> from <i>Magnetococcus marinus</i> (NavMs), was recently crystalized with a brominated drugs bound and the proposed binding site validated (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bagneris et al., 2014</a>).

Cells were suspended in 1.0 ml of the MYE or KMYE medium (with or without 10, 30, 100, or 300 \u00b5M nifedipine), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. Microscopic observation was carried out immediately by the hanging drop method using a Leica DMLB100 dark field microscope (400\u00d7) and Leica DC300F camera, Leica IM50 version 1.20 software (Leica Geosystems, Tokyo), and recorded with Display capture ARE software (<a href=\"http://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win95/art/se221399.html)\">http://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win95/art/se221399.html)</a>. The swimming speed of 40 individual cells (swimming for more than 15 s), and swimming fractions of more than 50 individual cells were measured by 2D movement measurement capture 2D-PTV software (DigimoCo., Ltd.). All results shown are the averages of three independent experiments. Drug antagonism of bacteria growth was assessed using the equation:"

In this study, DeCaen et al. describe a new member of this family that lacks the selectivity of the canonical prokaryotic sodium channels. They determined the permeation and gating properties of NsvBa and demonstrated that the channel is nonselective among Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. Based on the filter sequence difference between NsvBa and other Na<sup>+</sup> selective prokaryotic Nav channels, the authors performed mutagenesis and demonstrate that the nonselective filter from NsvBa can be converted into one that is selective for Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that these features can be conferred onto the NaChBac filter. The authors also characterized the voltage-, pH- and temperature-dependence of several Nav channels from several Bacillus species and demonstrated that a combination of higher temperature and pH are required to reduce the activation threshold of channel opening in these alkaliphilic Bacillus bacteria. This lends credence to their claim that these channels are involved in transport of sodium and other alkali metal ions at highly hyperpolarized potentials which is also the resting membrane potential of this bacterial host. In addition, the authors also characterized the pharmacological properties of Bacillus Nav channels using various Nav channel antagonists and demonstrated that these drugs inhibit the cell growth likely due to the block of Na influx through Nav channels."

In addition, this group's discovery and characterization of several members of prokaryotic homo-tetrameric Nav channel family have provided excellent model systems for structural studies of Na/Ca channels. This work is well done and nicely presented."

The differences in E<sub>rev</sub>\u2019s measured at neutral pH/22\u2070C and basic pH/34\u2070C are not different for Na<sup>+</sup> conditions but do increase slightly (\u2264 5 mV) in the K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions. This translates to a 2-3 fold increase the relative permeability for K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is interesting but does not achieve the level of selectivity found in Ca<sub>v</sub>s or Kv channels.
