A progressive increase of neuronal excitability in medullary slices containing the pre-B\u00f6tC produces mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) characterized by large amplitude population bursts alternating with a series of small amplitude bursts. Using two different computational models, we demonstrate that MMOs emerge within a heterogeneous excitatory neural network because of progressive neuronal recruitment and synchronization. The MMO pattern depends on the distributed neuronal excitability, the density and weights of network interconnections, and the cellular properties underlying endogenous bursting. Critically, the latter should provide a reduction of spiking frequency within neuronal bursts with increasing burst frequency and a dependence of the after-burst recovery period on burst amplitude. Our study highlights a novel mechanism by which heterogeneity naturally leads to complex dynamics in rhythmic neuronal populations."

These rhythms consist of bursts of strong activity (\u201clarge amplitude bursts\u201d), essential for triggering regular breathing, separated by a series of bursts of weak activity (\u201csmall amplitude bursts\u201d). However, it is not clear how mixed-mode oscillations arise."

The first model consists of a diverse population of 100 neurons joined by a relatively small number of weak connections to form a network. The second model is a simplified version of the first, consisting of just three neurons. By manipulating the properties of the simulated networks, and analysing the data mathematically, Bacak, Kim et al. identify the properties of the neurons that allow them to generate mixed-mode oscillations and thus rhythmic breathing."

In this work, we introduce and explain a novel alternative paradigm for the generation of MMOs. The key element in the mechanism that we present is that a network of coupled oscillators can generative repetitive MMOs based on heterogeneity within the network. The importance of this paradigm for neural systems relates to central pattern generators (CPGs) that can intrinsically generate rhythmic activity controlling different motor behaviors such as breathing and locomotion. Heterogeneity in the quantitative features of the neurons involved is likely a ubiquitous property of such circuits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Butera et al., 1999b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Marder, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Mizuseki, 2014</a>), and thus our work predicts that MMO patterns should be attainable in a wide range of brain structures with rhythmic activity depending on mechanisms for neuronal synchronization. Furthermore, predictions that follow from the existence of this MMO-generation mechanism should be of similarly widespread relevance."

                        "text": "For concreteness, the present study focuses on computational models of a neuron population in a particular brain area, the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (pre-B\u00f6tC), where MMOs have been previously observed (<a href=\"#bib11\">Del Negro et al., 2002c</a>). The pre-B\u00f6tC is a medullary region representing an excitatory kernel circuit of the respiratory CPG in mammals that is critically involved in generating the inspiratory phase of respiration (<a href=\"#bib52\">Smith et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Smith et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). The pre-B\u00f6tC can generate rhythmic bursting activity <i>in vitro</i>, in medullary slices containing this structure (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koshiya and Smith, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Del Negro et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rigatto et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thoby-Brisson and Ramirez, 2001</a>) and even in <i>isolated</i> 'islands' extracted from these slices (<a href=\"#bib22\">Johnson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This rhythmic activity is typically induced by elevating the extracellular concentration of potassium ([<i>K<sup>+</sup></i>]<i><sub>out</sub></i>) up to 7\u20139\u2009mM, which putatively increases neuronal excitability (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koshiya and Smith, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lieske et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Del Negro et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Johnson et al., 2001</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib57\">Thoby-Brisson and Ramirez, 2001</a>). Pre-B\u00f6tC neurons, through a pre-motor population, project to the hypoglossal nuclei containing motor neurons, the activity of which can be recorded in rhythmically active slices from the hypoglossal (XII) nerve (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, panels A, B, and C1). Simultaneous optical recordings from individual neurons and XII output have shown that bursts in the XII root represent the synchronized activity of pre-B\u00f6tC neurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koshiya and Smith, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C1,C2</a>) and the amplitude of XII bursts clearly depends on the number of pre-B\u00f6tC neurons involved. Interestingly, a progressive increase in [<i>K<sup>+</sup></i>]<i><sub>out</sub></i> in slices containing the pre-B\u00f6tC evokes complex population MMOs characterized by amplitude modulation, with large amplitude (LA) bursts alternating with a series of small amplitude (SA) bursts (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koshiya and Smith, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Del Negro et al., 2002c</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kam et al., 2013</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom). An amplitude irregularity similar to the MMOs recorded from the pre-B\u00f6tC <i>in vitro</i> has also been observed during acute intermittent hypoxia simulated <i>in vitro</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib61\">Zanella et al., 2014</a>). Similar pathological patterns of breathing have been observed in vivo in association with different diseases, such as myocardial infarcts, obstructive sleep apneas, apneas of prematurity, Rett syndrome, and sudden infant death syndrome (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zanella et al., 2014</a>)."

Our simulations and analysis suggest that neurons with low excitability, which generate low frequency bursting with high intra-burst spike frequency, recruit LA bursts by synchronizing the activity of many neurons in the network and therefore play a critical role in the generation of MMOs. Our simulations and analysis of these models provide important insights into how heterogeneity of neural excitability and other network features contribute to the generation of rhythmic activities in neuron populations that are key components of central pattern generators in vertebrates."

Note that the sub-population of low excitability neurons, colored red, do not contribute to SA bursts. Activation of this sub-population during the LA burst is marked by a black, dot-dashed, vertical line at about 32.7 s. This vertical line intersects with a black, dashed, horizontal line indicating a threshold for the activation of red neurons. This line intersects the two SA bursts demonstrating that, although the amplitudes of both SA bursts rose above the marked threshold for activation of the red sub-population in the LA burst, the latter neurons were not recruited in SA bursts (note the absence of the red neuron cluster in SA bursts) and hence the full LA burst did not develop. We further find that the sub-population of neurons with low excitability (colored red) cannot be recruited by other sub-populations (participating in SA bursts), and hence cannot generate LA bursts, until sufficient recovery of bursting capability in the low excitability neurons (defined by the <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> inactivation variable <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>) has occurred. This observation suggests that with fixed parameter values, even though the low excitability neurons do not burst when uncoupled, the generation of LA bursts and the durations of their interburst intervals (IBIs) are mostly defined by the operation of an intrinsic burst-supporting mechanism in the less excitable neurons, rather than by variations in the intensity of their recruitment by the activity of highly excitable neurons involved in SA bursts."

At a weight of 1.8, each LA burst emerged regularly following five SA bursts (second trace); no parameter sets produced stable regimes with more than five SA bursts per one LA burst. Further increases in weights caused a quantal increase of LA frequency and the corresponding reduction in the number of\u00a0SA bursts between LA bursts (traces 2\u20134), until strong enough weights yielded LA bursts only (trace 5). A similar trend is seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B2</a> with increases in the probability of connections at a fixed value of synaptic weights (<i>w</i> = 1.8). Overall, for fixed connection weights, the availability of <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> in low excitability neurons still selects the cycles on which LA bursts occur during MMOs.

The model consisted of three neurons with mutual excitatory synaptic interactions (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A1</a>).

Each neuron was described using a non-spiking, activity-based model (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rubin et al., 2009b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib38\">Rubin et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib32\">Molkov et al., 2015</a>; see <i><b>Materials and methods</b></i>). The behavior of each neuron was defined by two dynamical variables, the membrane voltage, <i>V,</i> and <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> inactivation, <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>. For each neuron we calculated a nonlinear output function, <i>f(V)</i>, which approximated the aggregate activity of a cluster of neurons in the original 100-neuron model. <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> values were distributed such that in the absence of coupling, neuron 1 (high excitability, <i>HE</i>) engaged in high frequency bursting, neuron 2 (moderate excitability, <i>ME</i>) engaged in low frequency bursting with no special frequency relation to the bursting of the <i>HE</i> neuron, and neuron 3 (low excitability, <i>LE</i>) was silent; the three neurons\u2019 summed activity provided a representation of network output (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B1,C1,D1,E1</a>).

The green <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>-nullclines govern <i>HE</i> activity during network-wide activation (LA burst) and are depicted as a band because of the progressive decay of output from <i>LE</i> and <i>ME</i> neurons (resulting from the decrease in <i>f(V)</i> as their voltages decreased, see <a href=\"#equ14\">Equation 14</a>, following LA burst onset.

                                "text": "The reduced model provided an explanation for the emergence of quantal MMOs. A key point was that for each neuron, when it was silent, there was a level of synaptic input that caused its activation. This level depended on the degree of <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> deinactivation in the neuron, quantified by <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>,\u00a0as well as on its excitability. When one neuron was activated, it excited the other two neurons, and each of these could be activated if and only if the input it received was sufficiently large (cf. <a href=\"#bib37\">Rubin and Terman, 2002</a>). For the <i>LE</i> neuron, there were therefore discrete windows of opportunity for activation, corresponding to activation times of the other neurons. This idea can be visualized by considering the trajectory of the full system projected to the (<i>V<sub>3</sub>, h<sub>NaP3</sub></i>)-plane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3,C3,D3,E3</a>; see <i><b>Materials and methods</b></i>, <i><b>Time-scale decomposition in the reduced model</b></i>). When the <i>LE</i> neuron is not active, the trajectory evolves along the left branch of the cubic <i>V<sub>3</sub></i>-nullcline, corresponding to low <i>V<sub>3</sub></i>. The <i>LE</i> neuron is activated if the trajectory rises above the left knee, or local maximum, of the <i>V<sub>3</sub></i>-nullcline (analogously to the sample trajectory in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>)."

In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C3</a>, three <i>V<sub>3</sub></i>-nullclines are shown: black corresponds to no input, blue to input from the <i>HE</i> neuron only, and green to input from the <i>HE</i> and <i>ME</i> neurons. If a synaptic input lowers the left knee below the current value of <i>h<sub>NaP3</sub></i>, then the <i>LE</i> neuron is activated (e.g., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C3</a>, marked with 'iv'). Therefore, the activation of the <i>LE</i> neuron depends on the recovery of <i>h<sub>NaP3</sub> </i>when input arrives, and hence on the rate of recovery of <i>h<sub>NaP3</sub> </i>relative to the frequency of input arrival. For example, in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C3</a>, an SA burst involving only the <i>HE</i> neuron occurs when the trajectory is at position 'i'. Since the trajectory is below the knee of the blue nullcline, the <i>LE</i> neuron does not activate. An SA burst involving the <i>HE</i> and <i>ME</i> neurons occurs when the trajectory is at 'ii'. Again, <i>LE</i> neuron activation fails, because the trajectory is below the knee of the green nullcline. A failure similar to the first occurs at 'iii'. Finally, when the <i>HE</i> and <i>ME</i> neurons activate with the trajectory at 'iv', the green nullcline becomes relevant, the trajectory is above the knee, and the <i>LE</i> neuron activates, yielding an LA burst."

Critical connection weights that separate regimes correspond to tangencies to such curves. For example, the transition from 1:1 to 1:2\u00a0regimes as <i>w</i> is decreased occurs when the <i>ME</i> neuron no longer can activate on every cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D1</a>).

On the other hand, an increase in the excitability of the <i>HE</i> neuron alone caused an increase of the SA burst frequency. Since the time between SA cycles became shorter, there was less recovery of the <i>LE</i> neuron per cycle, such that more SA cycles occurred between LA cycles and the overall LA frequency remained approximately constant (data not shown)."

The reduced framework elucidates the mechanism underlying this feature. When some neurons are activated, the active neurons excite each other. Each active neuron\u2019s variables evolve along the right branch of its <i>V</i>-nullcline, and activation ends when they reach the right knee, or local minimum, of this nullcline (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>, red trace). Stronger excitation pushes a neuron\u2019s <i>V</i>-nullcline, including its right knee, to lower <i>h<sub>NaP</sub> </i>values and hence causes the active phase to end with more <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> inactivation (i.e., lower <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>-coordinate). Thus, a longer recovery period is needed before subsequent activation of the leading neuron. On LA cycles, all neurons excite each other, which causes a maximal lowering of <i>V</i>-nullclines and subsequently yields the longest IBIs."

The different-size loops shown in (<i>V<sub>1</sub>, h<sub>NaP1</sub></i>) correspond to SA and LA bursts, respectively, and therefore have different maximal <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> and minimal <i>h<sub>NaP1</sub></i> values, defined by positions of the <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>-nullcline during HE activation. The SA bursts occur due to the <i>HE</i> neuron\u2019s intrinsic rhythmicity. When the <i>ME</i> and <i>LE</i> neurons excite the <i>HE</i>, the <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>-nullcline moves to lower <i>h<sub>NaP1</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> values (lowest green nullcline, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This movement extends the active phase by pushing the right knee of the <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>-nullcline down. As <i>ME</i> and <i>LE</i> neuron activity adapts, excitation gradually decreases (green band, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) but nonetheless, when excitation from <i>ME</i> and <i>LE</i> neurons is removed, the <i>HE</i> neuron returns to the left branch of the <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>-nullcline at much lower <i>h<sub>NaP1</sub></i> values than following an SA burst.

In this form of MMOs, the time intervals between bursts are on a similar time scale regardless of whether an SA or an LA burst has just occurred, yielding quantal patterns of SA and LA events, although precise IBI durations actually depend on the amplitude of preceding bursts, and hence IBIs following LA bursts are longer than those following SA bursts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These MMOs appear to be a natural, perhaps inevitable, behavior of heterogeneous neural networks with excitatory coupling that can be expected to emerge widely in the nervous system, in which the rate of recovery of high excitability neurons dictates the period of subsequent events, while the recovery of low excitability neurons determines which subsequent events become LA bursts. LA bursts correspond to synchronous activation of most neurons in the network and occur when the least excitable neurons in the network can be recruited. Furthermore, feedback from these least excitable to the more excitable neurons is essential for synchronizing the network during LA bursts."

In these MMOs, even within SA events, there is a complete transition between different attracting states (hyperpolarized and depolarized) for the fast voltage dynamics, although only some variables in the network are involved in this transition. The MMOs that we studied here depend critically on the synaptic interactions leading to the emergence of neuronal clusters with synchronous bursting activity, whereas the other described classes of MMOs mainly arise from intrinsic dynamics even in single neurons. Therefore, we observed a transition through a range of quantal MMO regimes as synaptic parameters were varied (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A,B</a>,<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). Furthermore, LA bursts are gained, as parameters are varied, by conversion of particular SA bursts, arising roughly evenly between pairs of LA bursts, into LA bursts (reminiscent of period-doubling), whereas in time-scale-based MMOs, transitions involve the less radical loss or gain of individual SA oscillations occurring just before each LA burst."

In the other previous work, the reduced neuron models were used to investigate quantal recruitment of normally-silent late-expiratory neurons under hypercapnia (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rubin et al., 2011</a>).

Instead, they represent a common feature of most known cellular bursting mechanisms, in which the post-burst recovery time depends on the neuronal activity within the bursts and vice versa. For example, in the case of intrinsic bursting mechanisms based on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potassium (<i>I<sub>K</sub></i>(Ca<sup>2+</sup>)), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated nonspecific (<i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i>), or Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent potassium (<i>I<sub>K</sub></i>(Na<sup>+</sup>)) currents, involving intracellular accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ions, a functionally similar slow recovery is usually connected with operation of either the Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na+/K+ pumps (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ekeberg et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">el Manira et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wall\u00e9n et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rubin et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ryczko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dunmyre and Rubin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jasinski et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rybak et al., 2014</a>).

Both the prolonged IBI and the pause in tonic spiking after LA bursts rely on the synaptic excitation from the full collection of neurons in the network, and thus their presence can be taken as evidence that the least excitable neurons in the network are not recipients of feed-forward inputs but rather participate in the recurrent network structure."

These MMOs were artificially evoked at a moderate level of neuronal excitability produced by elevation of [<i>K<sup>+</sup></i>]<i><sub>out</sub></i> to 5\u20136\u2009mM and were characterized by a series of SA bursts ('burstlets') alternating with single LA bursts that, in contrast to the burstlets, were able to trigger the rhythmic bursts in the hypoglossal motor output and hence defined the frequency of output oscillations. This study established the quantal nature of MMOs emerging in the pre-B\u00f6tC in these conditions (e.g., Figure\u00a02\u00a0of <a href=\"#bib23\">Kam et al., 2013</a>)."

According to this concept, 'rhythm- and pattern-generating functions common to all CPGs are assumed to be segregated' so that the rhythm and the pattern are generated by 'separable microcircuits' and 'distinct mechanisms' (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feldman and Kam, 2015</a>), similar to that in a previous model of the spinal locomotor CPG suggesting the existing separate circuits for rhythm generation and pattern formation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rybak et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rybak et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</a>). In this interpretation, the role of intrinsic bursting mechanisms in neurons generating the LA bursts in the pre-B\u00f6tC is fully disregarded, and the lack of these bursts on the top of each burstlet (SA bursts) is considered as equivalent to the non-resetting spontaneous deletions (missing bursts) observed during fictive locomotion in the spinal cord."

The results of our present modeling study instead suggest that a single, inseparable population of coupled excitatory neurons incorporating endogenous neuronal oscillators with distributed excitability can reproduce, and is sufficient to explain, the coexistence of burstlets and bursts in population rhythmic activity (i.e., the MMOs described in this work). We implemented a sparse network connectivity pattern that reflects experimental data more completely than previous models (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rybak et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jasinski et al., 2013</a>) and precludes the existence of separable sub-networks. In the models of the locomotor CPG in the spinal cord mentioned above, the pattern formation circuits did not affect the rhythm generator circuits, but just responded 1:1 to the rhythm-generating input, unless accidental perturbations happened, changing the excitability of the pattern formation network and producing deletions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rybak et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</a>). In contrast, in the interconnected single network considered here, the activity of low-excitable neurons involved in generation of low frequency LA bursts (attributed by <i>Kam et al.</i> to the 'pattern generating circuits') synchronize the entire population activity, explicitly defining its output frequency ('rhythm'). Therefore, the intrinsic properties of these low-excitable neurons, specifically the temporal characteristics of their recovery (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D1,D2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>), but not deletions of unknown origin, define the output frequency of a rhythm generator that interacts with other circuits to shape the CPG activity pattern."

However, a preliminary analysis of the simulation results suggested that a minimal neural network could be used to reproduce the development of MMOs caused by the clustering of neurons with similar excitabilities. We therefore developed a reduced network consisting of three neurons simulated by an 'activity-based,' non-spiking model with different excitability defined by the <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> value for each neuron. In this reduced formalization, a neuron\u2019s activity represents the aggregate activity of a distinct cluster in the large-scale model. Similar reduced three-neuron models were previously considered in other contexts (e.g., <a href=\"#bib51\">Shilnikov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rubin and Terman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schwabedal et al., 2014</a>).

When projected into the (<i>V,h<sub>NaP</sub></i>)-plane, the dynamical variables, <i>V</i> and <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>, had steady states or 'nullclines' (sets of points for which the right-hand sides of <a href=\"#equ10\">Equations 10,16</a>, respectively, were set to zero). Some possible positions of the cubic <i>V</i>-nullclines are depicted by a gray band in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>. The upper and lower boundaries of the band correspond to the lowest and highest values of <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> that produced bursting, respectively. That is, the intersection of the <i>V</i>- and <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>-nullclines created a fixed point for the system that, when stable, denotes the point where solutions converge. There were two possible stable fixed points in our model for each neuron: (i) along the left branch of the <i>V</i>-nullcline (silence), and (ii) on the right branch of the <i>V</i>-nullcline, creating a state of constant depolarization (the activity-based analog to tonic spiking). When <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> was intermediate to values that produced silence and tonic behavior, the <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>-nullcline intersected the <i>V</i>-nullcline\u2019s middle branch, creating an unstable fixed point with a stable periodic orbit, or oscillation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>, red trace), that encompassed the local maximum and minimum of the <i>V</i>-nullcline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>, blue curve). The presence of a stable periodic orbit corresponded to endogenous bursting in these neurons."

During the slow components, the neuron could be silent or at rest when its trajectory was traveling up the left branch of its <i>V</i>-nullcline corresponding to an absence of spike generation, and it could be active or depolarized when its trajectory was traveling down the right branch of its <i>V</i>-nullcline, corresponding to spike generation. While at rest, a neuron in the bursting regime slowly 'recovered,' with its trajectory rising to higher <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>-coordinates until it reached the left knee (or fold) of the <i>V</i>-nullcline (a bursting neuron, shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>, red trace). At the left knee, a neuron\u2019s trajectory moved rightward in the (<i>V,h<sub>NaP</sub></i>)-plane under the fast dynamics to approach the right branch of the <i>V</i>-nullcline, corresponding to activation of the neuron. Once active, the neuron\u2019s trajectory traveled downward, to lower <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>\u2013coordinates, along the right branch of the <i>V</i>-nullcline until it reached the right knee (fold) of the <i>V</i>-nullcline, which caused a leftward jump in the (<i>V,h<sub>NaP</sub></i>)-plane corresponding to burst termination (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>, red trace). Similarly, a neuron with a stable fixed point could have slow transient dynamics and be in a rest (active) state as its trajectory traveled along the left (right) branch of its <i>V</i>-nullcline."

Such a change could cause the neuron\u2019s fixed point to switch from one branch of its <i>V</i>-nullcline to another, yielding a transition from silence to bursting to tonic spiking, depending on fixed point location. This change would also change knee locations; correspondingly, plots can be made showing the <i>h<sub>NaP</sub></i>-coordinate of the left knee as a function of a parameter or as a function of the input to a neuron in <a href=\"#equ13\">Equation 13</a>."

Mixed mode oscillations (MMO) are observed as small amplitude population oscillations that alternate with large amplitude population oscillations.

The authors studied this phenomenon in the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (pre-B\u00f6tC), a relatively small mammalian neuronal network that spontaneously generates respiratory rhythmic activity in isolation."

The mechanism explains the appearance of the large amplitude oscillation by recruitment of the large group of endogenously silent neurons. The variability of the oscillatory excitatory input into the group of silent neurons, i.e. the second key mechanism is explained by the heterogeneity of bursting frequencies in the endogenously bursting neurons. The mechanism was also theoretically explained with a simple model of three reduced neuron-like models representing three subpopulations (silent neurons, fast bursting neurons, slow bursting neurons)."

Here the authors state that the alternation between the large and small bursts emerges from the same rhythm generating mechanisms as a result of sparse connectivity combined with the heterogeneity of intrinsic membrane properties. The conclusions presented in this manuscript are of general relevance, since sparse connectivity and heterogeneity of membrane properties are a common property of many neuronal networks that consequently do also generate mixed mode oscillations."

This has been pointed out in Del Negro et al. (J Neurosci, 2005, PMID:15647488). The persistent sodium current appears to be the primary rhythm-generating conductance from embryonic development and the initiation of breathing rhythm (about embryonic day 15) through postnatal day 4 or 5 in mice and rats. After postnatal day 5, the calcium-activated, non-specific cation conductance (<i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i>) is also expressed and contributes to respiratory rhythm generation, perhaps more importantly than <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i>. The authors attempt to brush this aside in a paragraph that begins \u201cAlthough these key features in both our models\u2026\u201d and suggest that changes in the excitability of the neurons that generate MMOs is a generalizable phenomenon \u2013 which we agree with \u2013 that may not be dependent upon expression levels of <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i>. However, the kinetics of <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> are sufficiently different to make this a more intriguing computational problem to address in the context of MMOs. Toporikova and Butera (J Comp Neurosci, 2011, PMID: 20838868) developed a relatively simplistic model of pre-B\u00f6tC neurons that incorporates both rhythm-generating conductances five years ago. Dr. Rubin has a model that includes the <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> conductances. The authors will likely try to avoid re-designing their model for this manuscript. But, at the very minimum, the lack of an <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> should be discussed as a caveat in the Discussion section."

Providing a general physiological and/or pathological context is important to make it more interesting for a general readership- remember this is a manuscript for <i>eLife</i>. Indeed, because MMOs more likely represent a pathophysiological form of breathing, it is necessary for the authors to provide the reader with more discussion of eupneic breathing and the disturbances for example in sleep disordered breathing."

This has been pointed out in Del Negro et al. (J Neurosci, 2005, PMID:15647488). The persistent sodium current appears to be the primary rhythm-generating conductance from embryonic development and the initiation of breathing rhythm (about embryonic day 15) through postnatal day 4 or 5 in mice and rats. After postnatal day 5, the calcium-activated, non-specific cation conductance (I<sub>CAN</sub>) is also expressed and contributes to respiratory rhythm generation, perhaps more importantly than I<sub>NaP</sub>. The authors attempt to brush this aside in a paragraph that begins \u201cAlthough these key features in both our models\u2026\u201d and suggest that changes in the excitability of the neurons that generate MMOs is a generalizable phenomenon \u2013 which we agree with \u2013 that may not be dependent upon expression levels of I<sub>NaP</sub></i>.<i>. However, the kinetics of I<sub>NaP</sub> and I<sub>CAN</sub> are sufficiently different to make this a more intriguing computational problem to address in the context of MMOs. Toporikova and Butera (J Comp Neurosci, 2011, PMID: 20838868) developed a relatively simplistic model of pre-B\u00f6tC neurons that incorporates both rhythm-generating conductances five years ago. Dr. Rubin has a model that includes the I<sub>CAN</sub> conductances. The authors will likely try to avoid re-designing their model for this manuscript. But, at the very minimum, the lack of an I<sub>CAN</sub> should be discussed as a caveat in the Discussion section.</i> "

First, the primary objective of our study was not the modeling of the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (pre-B\u00f6tC) within a wide developmental range, but in the modeling and understanding of the phenomenon of MMOs emerging in this type of network. We believe that understanding such MMOs can be important for many different rhythm-generating networks in the brain. Second, although we considered this to be a general mechanism, we wanted to develop a realistic model of a real system that generates such MMOs and to analyze it in the context of the recent suggestion that the generation of such MMOs (alternating burstlets and bursts) in the pre-B\u00f6tC is based on separate rhythm- and pattern-generating circuits (Kam et al., 2013; Feldman and Kam, 2015). In this connection, it is important to note that all of the data showing these MMOs (or periodic alternation of bursts and burstlets) in the pre-B\u00f6tC, including the early data from Smith's lab (Koshiya and Smith, 1999; Johnson et al., 2001; see our <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and the recent data presented by Kam and Feldman (Kam et al., 2013; Feldman and Kam, 2015), were obtained in slices from neonatal animals of P0-P2, P0-P3, and P0-P5, i.e. within the developmental range in which, according to the reviewers' reference to Del Negro et al. (2005), the persistent sodium current (<i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i>) appears to be the primary rhythm-generating current. This implicitly validates the use of this current in the present model, and we clarify this point in the revised Discussion."

                    "text": "At the same time, the cellular mechanism (and ionic currents) responsible for rhythmic bursting in the pre-B\u00f6tC has not been conclusively determined. For example, Del Negro initially believed in the important role of <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> (Del Negro et al., 2001; 2002a), then claimed a critical role of <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> (Del Negro et al., 2005), and then suggested an involvement of transient potassium <i>I<sub>A</sub></i> (Hayes et al., 2008) and <i>I<sub>h</sub></i> (Picardo et al., 2013). Moreover, although <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> was widely studied and even modeled by some people including us (Rubin et al., 2009; Dunmure et al., 2011, Toporikova and Butera, 2011; Jasinski et al., 2013; Rybak et al., 2014; Toporikova et al., 2015), a series of recent experimental studies of <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> produced inconsistent results (Pena et al., 2004; Krey et al., 2010; Beltran-Parrazal et al., 2012; Ben-Mabrouk et al., 2012). Therefore, the involvement of <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> in pre-B\u00f6tC rhythmic activity remains controversial.

                    "text": "Finally, as we described in our original Discussion, and mentioned by the reviewers, we believe that these MMOs (and intermittent bursts and burstlets) are not a specific property of an <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i>-based mechanism, but rather are a common feature of many bursting mechanisms that are characterized by several simple properties. Specifically, as stated in the Discussion, these properties include a slow recovery process after each burst. This can be a slow voltage-dependent de-inactivation of <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> (as in our model), or a slow inactivation of <i>I<sub>K</sub></i> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or <i>I<sub>A</sub></i> current, or a slow pumping out of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ions accumulated during the burst, as in the case of <i>I<sub>K</sub></i> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and <i>I<sub>CAN</sub></i> currents (Rubin et al., 2009; Krey et al., 2010; Jasinski et al., 2013; Rybak et al., 2014). Such a recovery process requires a certain interburst interval for a full recovery. Therefore, if a neuron generates bursts at a relatively high frequency (i.e., has relatively short interburst intervals), then the recovery of its excitability between the bursts is limited. This makes its spiking activity within each burst relatively weak, not allowing these bursts to synchronize many other neurons to produce a large population burst. Thus, only neurons with a low background excitability that generate bursts with relatively low frequency have enough time between bursts for a full recovery, leading to generation strong neuronal bursts (with high spiking frequency) that can synchronize many neurons, hence producing large population bursts. This synchronization mechanism can be based on <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i> as in our model but is not specific to this current. To better express this point, we have expanded the consideration of this issue in the Discussion, section \u201cGeneration of MMOs: the role of endogenous bursting properties of neurons.\u201d"

The authors are probably aware that there is a large amount of computational literature on subnetwork oscillations that is not considered. The following publications need to be considered in this study. a) There has been considerable work done on mixed-mode oscillations by Shilnikov who refers to the same phenomenon as \"polyrhythmic oscillations\". Studies include e.g. \"subthreshold oscillations in a map-based neuronal model\" or \"Polyrhythmic synchronization in bursting networking motifs\" and \"Robust design of polyrhythmic neural circuits by Justus T.

The breathing pattern during eupnea in vivo is also very different from that recorded in slice from XII root. Therefore, even if similar MMO patterns are observed in vivo in some pathological states, they can be based on many unknown interactions and processes not present in slice. Hence it would probably be too speculative to suggest direct relations of these MMOs to disturbances or diseases in vivo. Of course, our point that the MMO mechanism we discuss is a general feature of rhythmic neuronal networks with certain properties holds irrespective of its connection with specific pathologies, and we hope that our work will inspire readers to consider the presence of MMOs in the rhythmic neuronal circuits of most interest to them."

And you can see that, in the model, the variability of the resting membrane potential (<i>V<sub>0</sub></i>) is directly defined by the variability of <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> and does not depend on <i>g<sub>L</sub></i>. This argument justifies our use of <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> as a parameter to control model neuron variability and excitability."

The reviewers are correct that in real neurons, excitability does depend on the input resistance or leak conductance(s), and its variability can also affect the variability in the network, even without variability in <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.

Although the term \u201cexcitability\u201d has been widely used in the computational modeling literature, it cannot be explicitly measured, especially in active and bursting neurons, since it does not represent a fixed quantity but rather varies in time with dynamical changes of conductances and neuron state. Therefore, in light of its relation to resting potential <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>, we thought it most suitable to order neurons by <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> (with constant <i>g<sub>L</sub></i>). We agree that this choice does not highlight the effect of <i>g<sub>NaP</sub></i> dynamics on the neuronal resting potential. At the same time, the applied variability of this conductance was small (5.0 \u00b1 0.5 nS, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and did not produce visible changes in the neural distribution, so that rearranging neurons by \"resting\" membrane potentials was not different from their distribution by <i>E<sub>L</sub></i>."

This means that we had 49 silent, 45 bursting, and 6 tonically active neurons. Note that with the small variability of <i>g<sub>NaP</sub></i> present in our study (see above), all neurons were potential bursters, although their actual activity patterns (silence, bursting, or spiking) depended on <i>E<sub>L</sub></i> and (in the coupled case) network interactions.

Also the MMOs of this type have been previously shown in pre-B\u00f6tC models that simulated networks of neurons with <i>I<sub>NaP</sub></i>-bursting properties and weak all-to-all excitatory connections, see Butera et al., (1999b, Figure 4) and Rybak et al. (2004, Figure 9), although these MMO patterns have not been specifically investigated in an all-to-all network. Therefore, sparsity is not absolutely necessary to produce MMOs. However, the sparsity can affect the realization of various MMO regimes, and the transitions between them (see Figure 4A1, A3, B2)."
