In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the conserved LIC domain, which binds the motor heavy chain, from a thermophilic fungus. We show that the LIC has a Ras-like fold with insertions that distinguish it from Ras and other previously described G proteins. Despite having a G protein fold, the fungal LIC has lost its ability to bind nucleotide, while the human LIC1 binds GDP preferentially over GTP. We show that the LIC G domain binds the dynein heavy chain using a conserved patch of aromatic residues, whereas the less conserved C-terminal domain binds several Rab effectors involved in membrane transport. These studies provide the first structural information and insight into the evolutionary origin of the LIC as well as revealing how this critical subunit connects the dynein motor to cargo."

In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the conserved LIC domain, which binds the motor heavy chain, from a thermophilic fungus. We show that the LIC has a Ras-like fold with insertions that distinguish it from Ras and other previously described G proteins. Despite having a G protein fold, the fungal LIC has lost its ability to bind nucleotide, while the human LIC1 binds GDP preferentially over GTP. We show that the LIC G domain binds the dynein heavy chain using a conserved patch of aromatic residues, whereas the less conserved C-terminal domain binds several Rab effectors involved in membrane transport. These studies provide the first structural information and insight into the evolutionary origin of the LIC as well as revealing how this critical subunit connects the dynein motor to cargo."

Invertebrates contain a single cytoplasmic dynein 1 LIC isoform while mammals have two LIC genes (LIC1 and LIC2) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hughes et al., 1995</a>), which may define two distinct cytoplasmic dynein 1 populations (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tynan et al., 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tan et al., 2011</a>). Cytoplasmic dynein 2 is associated with a third LIC isoform (LIC3) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grissom et al., 2002</a>) that is required for retrograde intraflagellar transport (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hou et al., 2004</a>). Knockdown studies have implicated LIC1 and 2 in membrane trafficking toward the endosomal-recycling compartment (ERC) in the cell center (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horgan et al., 2010b</a>), ER export (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kong et al., 2013</a>), lysosomal localization and morphology (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tan et al., 2011</a>), and axonal retrograde transport (<a href=\"#bib38\">Koushika et al., 2004</a>). During mitosis, LIC1/2 are required for many cytoplasmic dynein 1 functions including centrosome anchoring, dynein localization to the kinetochore, progression through the spindle assembly checkpoint, and chromosome alignment (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mische et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sivaram et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Raaijmakers et al., 2013</a>).

In addition to mediating cargo binding, the LIC may be important for the stability of the dynein heavy chain; the LIC is the most stably bound subunit to the heavy chain (<a href=\"#bib35\">King et al., 2002</a>) and is necessary for the stable expression and solubility of the recombinant human dynein heavy chain (<a href=\"#bib64\">Trokter et al., 2012</a>)."

However, bioinformatic databases, such as Pfam (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finn et al., 2014</a>), place the LIC in the same family as Ras-like, GTP-binding proteins.

In contrast, we find that the human LIC1 G domain is capable of binding guanine nucleotides, particularly GDP. Our results reveal that the cytoplasmic dynein LIC evolved from the small G protein superfamily and show biochemical differences between fungal and metazoan LICs that may play a role in dynein cargo transport. We further show how the LIC links the dynein motor domain to its multiple cargos."

However, these crystals were difficult to reproduce. When the crystals were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, three polypeptides corresponding to molecular weights of approximately 33, 27, and &lt;15 kDa were observed but not the full-length 60 kDa LIC protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Mass spectrometry showed that the 33 kDa and 27 kDa polypeptides contained sequences that resided within the conserved N-terminal domain. These results suggested that the full-length LIC was being digested by a minor contaminating protease over the course of a month and that the protease-resistant region that crystallized corresponded to the most conserved region of the LIC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

To produce the crystals with selenomethionine-labeled protein, we attempted in situ proteolysis during crystallization, as reported in prior studies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bai et al., 2007</a>). After testing a number of proteases, we found that chymotrypsin produced similar proteolysis products to those observed with our original crystals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Next, we performed in situ proteolysis of selenomethionine-labeled <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC in crystallization drops (molar ratio of 1:1000, chymotrypsin to LIC). Selenomethionine crystals appeared in 3 days and diffracted to 3.6 \u00c5, and the subsequent dataset was phased by Multi-wavelength Anomalous Dispersion (MAD) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and used to build an initial low-resolution model for the structure. This model was then successfully used in a molecular replacement search to phase the native 2.1 \u00c5 data set, previously obtained from our initial unlabeled protein crystals. After multiple rounds of refinement, we obtained a final 2.1 \u00c5 structure with an R-work of 17.4 and R-free of 22.0 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Arg44 and Thr394 were the N-terminal and C-terminal residues that were visible in the electron density map; the molecular weight of the intervening polypeptide chain corresponds approximately to the highest molecular weight band (\u223c33 kDa) seen from the crystals by SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, the additional two polypeptide fragments seen by SDS-PAGE of the crystals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) suggest that internal cleavage also occurred, most likely in regions where electron density is missing from our structure (74\u201388, 202\u2013210, and 346\u2013374)."

The crystal structure of the conserved 33-kDa fragment of the LIC indeed supports this similarity with Ras. The LIC structure revealed a central \u03b2-sheet flanked by \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), which in comparison with other protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the Dali server (<a href=\"#bib23\">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</a>), is most similar to the G domain of small GTP-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</a>). Like Ras (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pai et al., 1990</a>), the prototype of small G proteins, LIC has six \u03b2-strands in the core of the structure (five parallel and one anti-parallel) as well as five similarly placed \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). As a result of this structural similarity, we refer to this region as the LIC G domain. However, the LIC G domain also has conspicuous differences from Ras (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). In addition to the five-\u03b1-helices found in Ras, the LIC G domain has two-\u03b1-helical insertions (\u03b1-helix 3a and 4a) that extend from the core of the structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>). Rab28 and Rab33 also have a similar \u03b1-helix 4a insertion, and the Dali server identifies these Rabs, followed by Rab32, as the most similar to the LIC structure (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The LIC G domain also has three additional \u03b1-helices at the C-terminus (\u03b1-helix 6, 7, and 8; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) that interact with the core G domain structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and has a short seventh \u03b2-strand that extends the \u03b2-sheet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>).

We also performed a phylogenetic analysis of fungal and metazoan LICs within the Ras superfamily (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rojas et al., 2012</a>). The phylogenetic tree, which reveals similar subfamilies as seen in past work (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rojas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Basilico et al., 2014</a>), suggests that the LIC shares a common ancestor with the Ras/Rab subfamilies, whereas the SRPRBs and ARF families, basal subfamilies of the Ras superfamily, exclude the LIC clade (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

A similar glycine demarks the start of the P-loop at the end of \u03b21. However, three residues (V57, D58, and S59) form an extra turn of \u03b11 that shortens the \u2018P-loop\u2019 of <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC compared to the canonical P-loop of Ras (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Unusual for G proteins, the \u2018P-loop\u2019 and \u2018switch 2\u2019 of the <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC G domain interact with one another; the side chain of Q60 in the P-loop hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of G54 and the side chain of T116 in switch 2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This glutamine is found only in the P-loops of fungal LIC but is not present in metazoan LIC P-loops (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). As a result of this architecture, the <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC P-loop occupies the space of the bound GTP analogue GMPPNP in Ras (PDB: 5P21) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pai et al., 1990</a>) and sterically clashes with the \u03b1- and \u03b2-phosphates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, inset).

The G3 motif in G proteins follows after \u03b23 and contains a conserved Asp that coordinates the magnesium ion and a glycine that hydrogen bonds with the \u03b3-phosphate (DxxG) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</a>).

To test these ideas, we directly assayed for nucleotide-binding by <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC and human LIC1 G domains purified after <i>E. coli</i> expression (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). When the <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC G domain was injected onto a C18 column for reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) with acetonitrile, no 260 nm adsorbing molecule eluted from the column (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which is consistent with the lack of nucleotide in the crystal structure. In contrast, when the same experiment was performed with the human LIC1 G domain, a small molecule eluted with a retention time that did not match either GDP or GTP but which had an adsorption spectrum characteristic of a guanine nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The buffer used in the RPLC included tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, which binds to negatively charged entities, making them hydrophobic. Since the column retains hydrophobic molecules longer, more negatively charged molecules exhibit longer retention times. The molecule extracted from the LIC1 G domain has a longer retention time than even guanosine tetraphosphate, suggesting that it is slightly more negatively charged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). When the small molecule was separated from the LIC1 G domain before injecting it on the C18 column, it had the same retention time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that the long retention time was not an artifact of simultaneously injecting it along with protein on the column."

Within the margin of variation of different chromatographic runs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), the retention time of 150 \u00b5M ppGpp was similar to that of the guanine nucleotide co-purifying with 150 \u00b5M human LIC1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To determine if the nucleotides were truly identical, we combined and injected 150 \u00b5M ppGpp and 150 \u00b5M human LIC1 G domain. Only one peak was detected, which corresponded to the sum of the absorbances of the commercial ppGpp and the nucleotide co-purifying with the human LIC1 G domain injected separately (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, the nucleotide in the human LIC1 G domain co-purifies precisely with ppGpp in the same chromatographic run. The eluted human LIC1 nucleotide was not successfully identified by mass spectrometry, most likely due to its high negative charge and low quantity following extraction, and thus additional information on its identity could not be obtained by this method. However, with indistinguishable RPLC elution times and a guanine-like absorption spectrum, we believe that ppGpp is the most likely candidate for the LIC-bound nucleotide."

However, ppGpp is thought to only exist in bacteria and plants and not human cells (<a href=\"#bib62\">Takahashi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</a>). Thus, we do not believe that ppGpp is a natural ligand for the human LIC, but that binding of this ligand reflects an unnatural situation of bacterial expression. Nevertheless, ppGpp binding indicates that the metazoan LIC is indeed competent to bind nucleotide and also raised questions of its nucleotide specificity, especially since we did not detect bound GTP, which is present in millimolar concentrations in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buckstein et al., 2008</a>). Thus, we hypothesized that human LIC1 might have a higher affinity for guanosine diphosphates than triphosphates. As was observed in the crystal structure of Arl5 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2005</a>), LIC1 might bind only one of the two diphosphates of ppGpp, which can be more abundant than GDP during bacterial stress (<a href=\"#bib59\">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</a>). To test whether the human LIC1 G domain can indeed also bind GDP, the protein was incubated with 1 mM GDP and 5 mM EDTA (to promote the release of bound ppGpp). After quenching the exchange reaction with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and removing the unbound nucleotide, the protein was subjected to RPLC to analyze the composition of the bound nucleotide. Two peaks were now detected corresponding to the retention times of GDP and ppGpp, indicating that GDP in solution had partially exchanged for the ppGpp bound to the protein after bacterial expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In a similar nucleotide exchange experiment, we found that ADP did not bind to human LIC1 indicating that this G domain is indeed guanine-specific (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Furthermore, when the identical GDP exchange was performed with the <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC G domain, the GDP in solution did not bind to the fungal protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Therefore, the human LIC1 G domain, but not <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC, is capable of binding GDP and is most likely binding one diphosphate of ppGpp, as found previously with Arl5 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). Note, approximately 2.5 mg/ml of LIC1 was required to detect nucleotide above the noise in the described RPLC method; therefore, it is possible that GDP also may co-purify with bacterially expressed human LIC1, but its abundance is below our detection limit."

GMPPNP binds to many G proteins and has been widely used as a non-hydrolyzable analogue (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</a>). After quenching the exchange reaction with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the protein was analyzed by RPLC.

LC-MS analysis of the non-proteinaceous supernatant clearly revealed the presence of GDP, but no detectable GTP (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Porcine brain tubulin was used as a positive control to demonstrate that the LC-MS could detect both GDP and GTP. Thus, human LIC1 expressed in human cells co-purifies with GDP alone.

Interestingly, FIP3, RILP, and BicD2 each bound the C-terminal domain almost as equally well as to full-length LIC1 but showed no interaction with the G domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). The assay was also conducted with GFP alone, which showed no binding to the full-length LIC1 or its truncations (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, while the G domain contains the primary binding site for the dynein heavy chain, the LIC C-terminal domain appears to serve as a docking site for cargo adaptors."

We show that the dynein LIC contains a conserved domain with a G protein fold. However, in comparison to Ras, the LIC domain contains two helical insertions in the core structure, a short extra \u03b2-strand and additional C-terminal helices that pack against the core, which collectively define a unique G domain topology that sets the LIC apart from previously described G protein families (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</a>). The fungal LICs further differentiate themselves from other small G proteins by their closed P-loops and inability to bind nucleotide, while the metazoan LICs also show an unusual strong preference for binding GDP over GTP. Interestingly, the C-terminal half of the protein is involved in binding Rab effectors, whereas the G domain is the docking site for the dynein heavy chain. Collectively, these results provide insights into the evolutionary origin of the LIC and how this subunit participates in dynein functions."

                                "text": "The evidence that human LIC1 can bind nucleotide, unlike its fungal homologues, raises the question as to whether or not metazoan LIC acts as a GTPase switch. Most small GTP-binding proteins change their binding affinity for protein partners between GTP and GDP states, and one could envision a similar role for a nucleotide switch in cargo selection and binding by metazoan LICs. However, our data suggest that LICs do not function as GTPase switches. One reason is that the canonical GTPase switch 2 motif (DxxG), which plays a critical role in GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</a>), appears to be absent from the equivalent loop in metazoan LICs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Furthermore, human LIC1 binds guanosine diphosphate preferentially over guanosine triphosphate; even when GMPPNP or GTP is in 10-fold excess over GDP, little or no GTP binding to the LIC is detected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This preference for guanosine diphosphates explains why human LIC1 co-purifies with ppGpp from bacteria, even though the GTP concentration is approximately 1.6 mM in <i>E. coli</i> during exponential growth (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buckstein et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, the well-characterized GTPase Ras has a 10-fold higher affinity for GTP than GDP (<a href=\"#bib31\">John et al., 1990</a>). There are examples of G proteins that prefer guanosine diphosphates, such as ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), which has a &gt;25-fold higher affinity for GDP than GTP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#bib69\">Weiss et al., 1989</a>). ARF can exchange GTP for GDP under particular conditions (<a href=\"#bib69\">Weiss et al., 1989</a>), and it is possible that metazoan LICs can do so as well. However, given the combination of preferential GDP binding and the lack of a canonical switch 2 sequence, we find it unlikely that the LIC is a true GTPase. While metazoan LIC may not switch between a GDP-bound and a GTP-bound state, it is possible that it reversibly exchanges GDP and adopts an apo form. Small GTPases are stable in the apo form only when bound to a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor, or GEF (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cherfils and Chardin, 1999</a>); by analogy, LIC1 may release GDP upon binding the dynein heavy chain. This idea could be tested in the future by examining the nucleotide state of the LIC when in complex with the dynein heavy chain."

In support of a role of nucleotide in structural stability, we have found that human LIC1 is unstable with point mutations that interfere with nucleotide binding (K80A in the P-loop or D248A in the G4 motif; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Surprisingly, overexpression of the P-loop K80A mutation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> rescued the null LIC1 phenotype (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yoder and Han, 2001</a>), but endogenous expression levels may reveal a phenotype associated with instability of the mutant protein. The fungal LICs appear to have evolved another strategy for achieving protein stability in the absence of bound nucleotide. Two residues, Gln60 and Thr116, in the <i>C. thermophilum</i> LIC appear to play an important role in stabilizing a nucleotide-free state and preventing nucleotide binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Gln60 replaces the P-loop lysine, which is critical for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, and Thr116 replaces the aspartate found in switch 2 (DxxG), which contacts the nucleotide-bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion via a water molecule (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</a>)."

For example, the kinetochore nucleotide-binding protein BUBR1 does not hydrolyze ATP in carrying out its function in the mitotic checkpoint complex but rather requires ATP for its stability (<a href=\"#bib60\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</a>). We propose that metazoan LIC may be a \u2018pseudo-GTPase\u2019, where nucleotide is used for stability rather than in a cycle of conformational change. Another protein that also has a common G-protein fold with no nucleotide-binding or hydrolysis capability is CheY, a bacterial chemotactic protein (<a href=\"#bib5\">Artymiuk et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 1990</a>).

Our structure, combined with sequence analysis, provides some clues on residues that might be involved in the selective recognition of a particular dynein heavy chain. For example, the LIC3s have several class-conserved and mostly hydrophobic residues (conserved among LIC3s but not LIC1/2) that surround the hydrophobic groove (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). LIC1/2 exhibits fewer class-conserved residues on the face of the G domain with the hydrophobic groove, although a few such residues exist (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

The LIC domain structure has interesting parallels with the dynein intermediate chain, which has a well-ordered WD repeat domain that interacts with the heavy chain and a less conserved disordered region that binds the dynein light chains (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mok et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nyarko et al., 2004</a>) and cargo-adaptors like dynactin (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</a>). A number of disordered proteins become ordered upon binding other proteins. It will be interesting to determine what structure the C-terminal tail of the LIC adopts before and after binding to Rab effectors.

Recent studies have shown that these Rab effectors, in addition to linking dynein to membrane cargos, link dynein to dynactin to create an ultraprocessive motor (<a href=\"#bib42\">McKenney et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schlager et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the LIC may have a critical role in the mechanism of generating an ultraprocessive dynein\u2013dynactin complex. While the LIC may simply serve as a docking site for Rab effectors, it is also possible that the LIC N- and C-terminal domains communicate allosterically in some way with other dynein chains and dynactin to affect their activities."

In this revision, we expressed the human LIC1 G domain in human HEK-293T cells; the purified G domain was denatured by boiling, and the supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS.

We believe that ppGpp most likely binds with equal affinity as GDP. In the crystal structure of Arl5 with bound ppGp (a remnant of ppGpp), only the one diphosphate is bound in the active site, while the other phosphate is solvent exposed and not making contact with the protein (see structure below; (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2005</a>)). We speculate that the same situation applies to LIC1, where one of the diphosphates of ppGpp is bound to LIC1 (like GDP), while the other diphosphate extends into the solvent.

When bacteria are stressed with high protein expression, ppGpp can reach millimolar quantities (<a href=\"#bib59\">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</a>), indeed much higher than the approximate 200 \u00b5M GDP in exponential growth (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buckstein et al., 2008</a>). As described earlier, ppGpp is an alarmone that is unique to bacteria and plants (<a href=\"#bib59\">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Takahashi et al., 2004</a>) and not found in animal cells. Thus, we would like to emphasize that the co-purification of ppGpp with human LIC1 is simply an artifact of its purification from bacteria. It is also important to note that approximately 2.5 mg/mL of protein at a minimum is required to detect nucleotide above the noise in the RPLC method described, and thus GDP may also co-purify with bacterially expressed human LIC1, though in quantities below our detection limit. Nonetheless, the finding of ppGpp gave us the important clue that human LIC1 binds guanosine diphosphates preferentially over guanosine triphosphates, which we demonstrate with purified protein in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>. We thank the referees for expressing their concerns, and we have made these points clearer."

The retention time of LIC1\u2019s nucleotide has a higher standard deviation (\u00b10.355 min) than the commercial ppGpp (\u00b10.138 min), yet this variability is less than seen with even GMP, GDP and GTP (\u00b10.893, 0.494, and 0.643 min, respectively). Furthermore, the difference in retention times seen for the LIC nucleotide and ppGpp is not significantly different (p = \u223c0.2). Furthermore, the retention time of the LIC nucleotide shows that it is more electronegative than GTP, making ppGpp a good candidate. Of course, mass spectrometry would be more definitive, but ppGpp is technically very difficult to identify by mass spectrometry. In the revised manuscript, we now state, \u201c\u2026with indistinguishable RPLC elution times and a guanine-like absorption spectrum, we believe that ppGpp is the most likely candidate for the LIC-bound nucleotide.\u201d Furthermore, since we now show that GDP binds the LIC when expressed in human cells, it also becomes less essential to have complete certainty of the bacterially expressed nucleotide. The overall data (from bacterial expression, human cell expression and exchange studies with purified nucleotide) collectively suggest that the LIC has a preference for binding a diphosphate rather than triphosphate guanine nucleotides."
