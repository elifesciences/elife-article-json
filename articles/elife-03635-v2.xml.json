Using native elongating transcript analysis (NET-seq), we show that transcription itself is a component of bi-modal switches, facilitating reciprocal expression in gene clusters. <i>HMS2</i>, encoding a growth-regulated transcription factor, switches between sense- or antisense-dominant states that also coordinate up- and down-regulation of transcription at neighbouring genes. Engineering <i>HMS2</i> reveals alternative mono-, di- or tri-cistronic and antisense transcription units (TUs), using different promoter and terminator combinations, that underlie state-switching. Promoters or terminators are excluded from functional TUs by read-through transcriptional interference, while antisense TUs insulate downstream genes from interference. We propose that the balance of transcriptional insulation and interference at gene clusters facilitates gene expression switches during intracellular and extracellular environmental change."

Using native elongating transcript analysis (NET-seq), we show that transcription itself is a component of bi-modal switches, facilitating reciprocal expression in gene clusters. <i>HMS2</i>, encoding a growth-regulated transcription factor, switches between sense- or antisense-dominant states that also coordinate up- and down-regulation of transcription at neighbouring genes. Engineering <i>HMS2</i> reveals alternative mono-, di- or tri-cistronic and antisense transcription units (TUs), using different promoter and terminator combinations, that underlie state-switching. Promoters or terminators are excluded from functional TUs by read-through transcriptional interference, while antisense TUs insulate downstream genes from interference. We propose that the balance of transcriptional insulation and interference at gene clusters facilitates gene expression switches during intracellular and extracellular environmental change."

Individual genes can possess multiple, overlapping transcripts, in the sense and the antisense orientations with respect to the pre-mRNA, as well as poly-cistronic transcripts, which span neighbouring genes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kapranov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berretta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pelechano et al., 2013</a>). Genome-wide mapping of nascent transcription, using techniques such as NET-seq, shows that transcription commonly extends into and over the intergenic regions of both convergent and tandemly arranged genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</a>). For tandemly arranged genes, transcription into the promoter of the downstream gene would be expected to interfere with its expression by a variety of mechanisms, including modifying the local chromatin environment and interference by removal of transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Martens et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Martianov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hainer et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, extensive transcription antisense to (<a href=\"#bib54\">Venters and Pugh, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Murray et al., 2012</a>), and into the promoter of (<a href=\"#bib36\">Perocchi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Xu et al., 2009</a>), the canonical coding transcript is also implicated in modulating gene expression by similar mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hongay et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Camblong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Uhler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Houseley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pinskaya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Xu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">van Werven et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Castelnuovo et al., 2013</a>). An interleaved genome with overlapping transcription units requires that polyadenylation and transcription termination signals in the sense and antisense orientations are by-passed but it is not clear how this is achieved. In addition, questions are commonly raised about whether transcription of these overlapping transcription units is contemporaneous."

Indeed, periodic or cycling expression of genes can be detected using fluorescent reporters or dual-labelled RNA FISH in cultures of asynchronous cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Laxman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Silverman et al., 2010</a>), or in the absence of cell division (<a href=\"#bib41\">Slavov et al., 2011</a>). This periodic expression is a result of synchronization of respiratory and glycolytic activities into robust oscillations in oxygen consumption, characterized by phase-specific transcript signatures involving over 3000 genes, known as the Yeast Metabolic Cycle (YMC) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Klevecz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tu et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Soranzo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Slavov et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cai and Tu, 2012</a>). In the long-period YMC, a single cell alternates between periods of high (oxidative (OX) phase) or low oxygen consumption (reductive building (RB) and charging (RC) phases), the residence time in each phase being nutrient-dependent. For exponentially growing cells in batch culture, the majority of cells in the population will be in the OX phase of the YMC (<a href=\"#bib41\">Slavov et al., 2011</a>). Transcript levels for genes that cycle in the YMC will change as the cell moves through these phases; at any time, some cells in an asynchronous population will contain a transcript and some will not. These shifts through transcriptional states are robust but not invariable, as YMC-regulated genes switch on and off in response to cues prompted by both regulated and erratic changes in the intracellular and extracellular environment."

While genes displaying functional relatedness, such as the <i>GAL</i> genes, are regulated similarly by possessing the same <i>cis</i>-acting sequences (i.e. the UAS<sub><i>GAL</i></sub>), co-expression of clustered genes in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is largely independent of similarly controlled transcription, gene orientation, and/or shared regulatory sequences. However, members of adjacent gene pairs or clusters are more likely to belong to the same functional pathway than expected by chance (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lee and Sonnhammer, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Batada et al., 2007</a>).

We use a simple carbon source shift coupled with NET-seq to define genes whose transcription increases or decreases &gt;threefold, after transfer from glucose (GLU)- to galactose (GAL)-containing media and show a remarkable enrichment for genes whose transcripts cycle during the YMC. The majority of these genes have no functional associations with transcription factors that might mediate repression or induction in GLU or GAL, but are organised in clusters and subject to overlapping sense and antisense transcription. We exemplify this mode of gene regulation, state-switching by transcriptional interference and insulation, at the <i>HMS2:BAT2</i> tandem gene cluster. By engineering promoters and terminators at <i>HMS2:BAT2</i>, we demonstrate the formation of alternative transcription units underlies state-switching. We suggest that overlapping transcription and the formation of alternative transcription units, associated with temporally segregated gene expression, will be a general feature of gene regulation."

We used a change in carbon source by shifting exponentially growing cells from glucose- (GLU) to galactose-containing media (GAL) for 3 h and analysed the native transcripts associated with elongating RNA polymerase II (NET-seq) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</a>) to identify genes whose transcription is altered during this environmental change (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). 10.45% (551) of ORF-Ts (open reading frame\u2014transcripts) showed a &gt;threefold increase and 9.99% (527) showed a &gt;threefold decrease in transcription in GAL relative to GLU (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). By comparing the NET-seq output with a microarray of Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA, we show that for the majority (\u224888%) of genes, the change in transcript levels on the GLU to GAL shift reflects altered transcription rather than altered transcript stability (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed highly significant associations to growth, quiescence, and transcripts that cycle in the YMC, particularly during the oxidative (OX) and the reductive charging (RC) phases of the YMC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1C,D</a>). The genes whose transcription decreases in GAL are enriched (467; 88.6% p &lt; 1x10<sup>\u22125</sup>) for OX phase genes that are mainly involved in ribosome biosynthesis and growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). By contrast, for genes whose transcription increases in GAL, there is significant enrichment (392; 71.1%, p &lt; 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>) for genes whose expression peaks in the reductive charging phase (RC) of the YMC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These genes are associated with stress resistance, metabolism, and quiescence. 33.1% (891) of the 2691 annotated OX- and RC-regulated genes also show &gt;threefold change on the GLU to GAL shift, supporting a shared regulatory mechanism between the YMC and the GLU to GAL shift (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). In addition to ORF-Ts, many of the non-coding transcription events are regulated by the GLU to GAL shift. These include antisense transcription reads (to ORF-Ts), which increase in GAL compared to GLU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and 25.7% of the 1772 annotated non-coding transcripts, the stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs), or cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which show &gt;threefold change in transcription on the GLU to GAL shift (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>)."

Selected data from this analysis are shown in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>. In summary, pairs of ORF-Ts in the convergent orientation occur more often than expected, while tandemly arranged ORF-Ts occur less often than expected. YMC genes are clustered, with 503 (16.9%) YMC genes flanked by non-cycling genes, 1431 (48.4%) with a single adjacent YMC partner either upstream or downstream and 1023 (34.5%) with a neighbouring cycling gene both upstream and downstream. Compared to more isolated genes, ORF-T clusters are more likely to show increased transcription in GLU or GAL than expected, suggesting that clustering is associated with some aspect of their regulation. In addition, ORF-Ts flanked by annotated SUTs or CUTs (in any orientation) occur more often than expected and show a twofold to fourfold higher median expression upon change from GLU to GAL than the average median expression obtained through the simulations. This is consistent with CUTs and SUTs playing a role in modulating ORF-T transcription, particularly on environmental change (<a href=\"#bib57\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Convergent overlapping arrangements occur three times more frequently than expected, whether the feature is a non-coding transcript (NC) such as a SUT or a CUT, or an ORF-T, with a median overlap of 92 bp for convergent ORF-Ts and 462 bp for ORF-Ts with non-coding transcripts. Thus clustering with overlapping transcription and transcriptional regulation are common features of the yeast genome."

                                "text": "As the genes whose transcription changed during the GLU/GAL shift are enriched for OX and RC YMC genes, we examined whether the nature of the flanking gene influences transcription, focusing on the tandem, and divergent combinations of these genes (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>). OX genes, regardless of the nature (OX or RC) or orientation (divergent or tandem) of the upstream feature showed higher than expected transcriptional rates in GLU, but not in GAL, suggesting they are activated in GLU but not repressed in GAL. Similarly, RC genes are more likely to show higher than expected transcriptional rates in GAL. The behaviour of RC genes in GLU, however, does appear to be dependent on the orientation of the upstream OX gene. With a divergent upstream OX gene, the transcription of the downstream RC pair is not enriched or depleted in GLU. However, if the OX gene is in tandem, the RC gene is repressed in GLU. This raises the possibility that at the OX.RC tandem pair, transcription of the OX gene is mediating transcriptional interference and repressing the transcription of the RC gene in GLU. We note that the downstream gene in a tandem RC.RC pair also shows significant repression in glucose. To investigate further, we examined three different data sets: (i) three groups of tandemly arranged genes; OX.RC, RC.OX, and non-cycling (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>); (ii) three sets of 20 consecutive ORF-Ts from <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a> showing a sevenfold increase, no change or a sevenfold decrease on the GLU/GAL shift (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>); and (iii) GLU/GAL-regulated genes with an annotated antisense CUT or SUT that is also GLU/GAL-regulated (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1I</a>). From this analysis, we picked tandem gene clusters where the transcription of the target gene is regulated by GAL/GAL shift or not, and examined how neighbouring genes behave (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1J</a>). The tandem partner of a GLU/GAL-regulated gene is often also regulated by the GLU/GAL shift and the YMC, while non-regulated genes are less likely to be in tandem and if they are, are surrounded by genes that are also not regulated by the GLU/GAL shift or the YMC. Common features of the regulated tandem clusters include reciprocal transcription in GLU and GAL, reciprocally cycling transcripts in the YMC, reciprocal AS transcription to OX genes, di-cistronic transcripts, and/or antisense transcripts spanning promoters that could mediate temporal transcriptional interference and thus facilitate cycling transcription. We chose the OX.RC pair <i>HMS2:BAT2</i> for further study, as all the above characteristics are present and because the relatively abundant <i>HMS2</i> antisense transcript, <i>SUT650</i>, can be detected experimentally in both GLU and GAL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>)."

Interestingly, there is also a reciprocal relationship between <i>HMS2</i> and its antisense <i>SUT650</i> (transcripts A and B respectively). Dual-labelled RNA FISH revealed a degree of temporal separation in the production of the <i>HMS2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> transcripts. In multiple analyses, no examples of FISH signals for both <i>HMS2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> at the site of transcription in the nucleus are observed in either GLU or GAL. Cells with nascent transcripts (arrows, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) often have the opposite transcript type or both <i>SUT650</i> and <i>HMS2</i> transcripts in the cytoplasm, suggesting they are changing state. 35.5 \u00b1 7.9% of the cells contained both transcripts in GLU, 22.8 \u00b1 10.5% of all cells lacked both the <i>SUT650</i> and <i>HMS2</i> sense transcripts. The remaining cells contained either <i>HMS2</i> or <i>SUT650</i> transcripts but not both (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For cells containing a single type of transcript, more cells contained antisense transcripts in GAL than GLU while more cells contained sense transcripts in GLU than GAL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, the increase in levels of <i>SUT650</i> transcripts in GAL reflects an increase in the number of cells expressing <i>SUT650</i> and a concomitant decrease in the number of cells expressing <i>HMS2</i>, rather than a change in the levels of transcripts within a fixed number of cells in the population. We conclude that the expression of <i>HMS2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> is temporally separated, similar to the <i>PHO84</i> sense and antisense transcripts (<a href=\"#bib6\">Castelnuovo et al., 2013</a>). This suggests potential co-regulation between <i>BAT2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> and reciprocal regulation of <i>HMS2</i> and <i>BAT2</i>."

In the absence of <i>SUT650</i>, expression of the <i>HMS2:ADH1t</i> transcript remains sensitive to the change in carbon source, showing a similar decrease to full-length <i>HMS2</i> 1 h after transfer from GLU to GAL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). This suggests that the carbon source responsive signal is received at the <i>HMS2</i> promoter and that reciprocal switching of <i>HMS2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> is a function of sense transcription. However, as the levels of <i>HMS2</i> sense transcripts are higher without the antisense transcript, we asked if antisense transcription plays a role in limiting the number of cells containing sense transcript using RNA FISH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). When grown in glucose, optimal conditions for <i>HMS2</i> sense transcription, we observed an increase in the number of <i>HMS2:ADH1t</i> cells containing sense transcript compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), consistent with a role for antisense transcription in reducing the number of sense transcription initiation events, leading to a decrease in the number of cells in the population that contain the sense transcript.

                                "text": "Next, we asked whether transcription of <i>SUT650</i> antisense might prevent <i>HMS2</i> sense transcription from interfering with <i>BAT2</i>, thus insulating <i>BAT2</i>. To ablate <i>SUT650</i> whilst ensuring that the regulatory elements in the flanking sequences between <i>HMS2</i> and <i>BAT2</i> remained intact, we removed the transcription start sites (TSS) for <i>SUT650</i> located between +953 and +1038 relative to the <i>HMS2</i> ATG, near the end of the <i>HMS2</i> coding region. We chose to do this by substituting the complete coding region of <i>HMS2</i> with that of <i>URA3</i>, to ensure a natural ORF between the <i>HMS2</i> promoter and terminator, rather than mutating the regions containing multiple TSSs for <i>SUT650</i> within the ORF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We note that insertion of the <i>URA3</i> ORF could affect transcript stability, although the nature of the promoter may be the primary determinant of transcript stability (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bregman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Trcek et al., 2011</a>), so we focused on transcript size and relative abundance. We observed two clear effects. First, loss of the antisense transcript (B), which could be explained either by introduction of a unidirectional terminator in the <i>URA3</i> ORF coding region or loss of TSSs for <i>SUT650</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, an increase in the read-through transcripts (C<sub>1</sub><sup>U</sup>) relative to the <i>HMS2</i>:<i>URA3</i> sense transcript (A<sup>U</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). We confirmed these were read-through transcripts by inserting a terminator (T) at the 3\u2032 region of the <i>HMS2:URA3</i> hybrid gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and observing loss of the read-through transcripts and increased levels of a shorter transcript (A<sup>U</sup>T) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). We note that transcripts initiated at the <i>HMS2</i> promoter remain sensitive to a change in carbon source in the absence of antisense transcription (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), as we observed using <i>HMS2:ADH1t</i> (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and consistent with a regulatory input at the promoter. The increase in the read-through transcript (C<sub>1</sub><sup>U</sup>) relative to the <i>HMS2</i>:<i>URA3</i> sense transcript (A<sup>U</sup>) in the absence of antisense transcription suggests a role for antisense transcription in attenuating sense transcription and preventing interference at the <i>BAT2</i> promoter. Consistent with this, a twofold decrease in <i>BAT2</i> sense transcript is observed in the antisense-less <i>HMS2:URA3</i> strain relative to WT in GLU, concomitant with a threefold increase in A<sup>U</sup> and C<sub>1</sub><sup>U</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Taken together, the effect of blocking (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) or increasing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) <i>HMS2</i> transcription on levels of <i>BAT2</i> transcript supports transcriptional interference by <i>HMS2</i> at the <i>BAT2</i> promoter and a reciprocal relationship between <i>HMS2</i> and <i>BAT2</i>. We sought evidence for transcriptional interference resulting from increased levels of A<sup>U</sup> and C<sub>1,2</sub><sup>U</sup>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis at the <i>HMS2:BAT2</i> intergenic region reveals reduced initiation-related modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K56ac) and increased elongation-related modifications (H3K79me3 and H3K36me3) in the <i>HMS2</i>:<i>URA3</i> hybrid gene, consistent with transcriptional interference leading to repression of <i>BAT2</i> transcription initiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). We conclude that <i>SUT650</i> antisense transcription (i) changes the proportion of cells expressing <i>HMS2</i> and (ii) controls the amount of overlapping and read-through transcription from <i>HMS2</i> and thus levels of <i>BAT2</i> transcript. We envisage that at any one time in a single cell, formation of the <i>HMS2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> transcription units (TUs) is mutually exclusive, but the formation of the <i>SUT650</i> TU and the <i>BAT2</i> TU is not. Thus formation of the <i>SUT650</i> transcription unit insulates <i>BAT2</i> from interference by <i>HMS2</i> transcription, as the <i>HMS2</i> TU cannot form when <i>SUT650</i> is expressed."

                                "text": "To address whether <i>HMS2</i> transcription influences <i>SUT650</i> antisense transcription, we replaced the <i>HMS2</i> promoter with the inducible <i>GAL1</i> promoter (p<i>GAL1</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). When cultured in glucose, the <i>GAL1</i> promoter is repressed but becomes induced about 2 h after transfer to galactose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). <i>SUT650</i> is normally induced during the GLU-GAL shift (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However in the p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> strain, an antisense transcript (B<sup>G</sup>) is evident in GLU and remains until the sense transcript is induced by GAL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). This suggests that sense transcription represses the antisense transcript. We used the inducible p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> system in conjunction with the Anchor Away technique (<a href=\"#bib13\">Haruki et al., 2008</a>) to deplete the nucleus of the Gal4p activator during growth in GAL. Removal of Gal4p by treatment with rapamycin (Rap) for 1 h, after activation of p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> for 3 h with GAL, abolishes the <i>HMS2</i> transcript (A<sup>G</sup>) and leads to restoration of the antisense transcript (B<sup>G</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). This confirms that the reduction in the antisense transcript is a consequence of sense transcription, rather than the change in condition (GLU to GAL). To determine whether antisense transcription had any effect on p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> sense transcript induction rates, the antisense--less <i>HMS2:URA3</i> construct was placed under the control of the <i>GAL1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The sense transcript profile in poly(A)<sup>+</sup>-enriched RNA was examined using a probe for the <i>HMS2:BAT2</i> intergenic region (probe IG), a region transcribed in both constructs. No changes in induction rate were apparent, with the sense transcript only detectable after 2 h in both strains, signifying that antisense transcription does not impair sense activation kinetics (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Rather, this finding is compatible with our observation that without antisense, more cells would express the sense transcript (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). Activation of the p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> sense transcript results in up to 3.5-fold repression of <i>BAT2</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), consistent with p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> sense polyadenylation at 426 nt, just upstream of the <i>BAT2</i> ATG, interfering with <i>BAT2</i> transcription initiation in galactose (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that formation of the <i>HMS2</i> sense transcription unit represses the formation of the <i>SUT650</i> and <i>BAT2</i> transcription units, regardless of conditions."

Upon glucose repression of induced p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i>, levels of the long form of antisense transcript were recovered (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Antisense transcript shortening after transfer to GAL is an inherent property of the natural <i>SUT650</i> antisense transcript (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). To ask if this was a function of transcription factor binding to the promoter, we used the p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> construct and showed that shortening of the antisense transcript is independent of Gal4 binding at p<i>GAL1</i> and remains for 3 h in GAL in the absence of sense transcription (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). This rules out a potential roadblock by Gal4 as an explanation for the use of different antisense polyadenylation/termination sites in p<i>GAL1</i>. We conclude that <i>SUT650</i> antisense transcription is normally repressed by <i>HMS2</i> transcription but remains stably expressed in GLU or GAL, varying in the use of polyadenylation sites, when sense transcription is inhibited."

While under standard growth conditions in GLU these mutant strains showed normal expression of <i>HMS2</i> and <i>SUT650</i>, growth in nutrient-limited GLU-based medium depleted for tryptophan resulted in loss of the <i>HMS2</i> transcript and accumulation of the short isoform of the <i>SUT650</i> antisense transcript (B<sub>2</sub>) in the <i>cbf1\u0394</i> and <i>fkh1\u0394</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In contrast, the <i>fkh2</i>\u0394 strain showed reduced levels of <i>SUT650</i> and increased <i>HMS2</i> under these growth conditions. This supports transcription factors controlling the balance of sense, and thus antisense transcription, at this locus during the cell cycle (Fkh factors) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Granovskaia et al., 2010</a>) and during oxidative growth in metabolic cycles (Cbf1) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tsankov et al., 2011</a>). We ablated a number of non-essential transcription factors, including Gln3, with putative binding sites at the 3\u2032 region of <i>HMS2</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">MacIsaac et al., 2006</a>) but observed no significant change in levels of <i>SUT650</i>, <i>HMS2</i>, or <i>BAT2</i> transcripts with the exception of a small increase in the <i>HMS2:BAT2</i> read-through transcript (C) in a <i>gln3\u0394</i> strain in minimal medium (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We propose that transcription factors signal to the <i>HMS2</i> promoter (Input) to mediate state-changing (antisense-dominant to sense-dominant) in response to environmental conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). As we could find no direct evidence for regulation of <i>SUT650</i> either by TFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or by the GLU to GAL shift (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) but only by transcriptional interference resulting from activation of <i>HMS2</i> transcription, we examined OX and RC genes genome-wide to look for common themes in their regulation. We asked what factors are significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.01) at promoters of RC and OX genes, using a large data set of 202 factors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Venters et al., 2011</a>). We observed marked differences (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1K</a>). Of particular interest are the predominance of chromatin modulators and components at RC gene promoters, suggesting that RC promoters are particularly sensitive to chromatin-mediated repression (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</a>). These features, coupled with the distinct behaviour of OX and RC genes in GLU and GAL, particularly OX.RC genes in tandem (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>), lead us to propose chromatin-mediated repression of RC genes by transcriptional interference. In addition, antisense transcription into OX promoters, for example by <i>SUT650</i> at <i>HMS2</i>, may also limit OX gene transcription."

However, this occurred together with reduced levels of <i>HMS2</i> (A), <i>BAT2</i> (D), and <i>SUT650</i> (B) transcripts, as expected upon depletion of an essential transcription factor. To explore this further, we used a well-characterised allele of <i>SUA7</i> (<i>sua7-1</i>) (E62K) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pinto et al., 1994</a>), associated specifically with the 3\u2032 region of genes, polyadenylation/transcription termination and higher order structures (gene loops) in chromatin (<a href=\"#bib27\">Medler et al., 2011</a>). Remarkably, we observed an increase in <i>HMS2</i> transcript (A) and sense read-through transcripts (C), coupled with a decrease in the <i>SUT650</i> antisense transcript (B) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Thus, TFIIB may have a specific role in determining the antisense transcription unit by establishing directionality of transcription over the region (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tan-Wong et al., 2012</a>). For instance, by determining an antisense transcription unit, TFIIB aids in sense transcription termination, preventing \u2018read-through\u2019 over the intergenic region between <i>HMS2</i> and <i>BAT2</i>. The capacity to read through transcription regulatory regions such as promoters and terminators is an essential component of a model for gene regulation by transcriptional interference such as that developed for the <i>HMS2:BAT2</i> locus. To test this experimentally, we inserted a new transcription unit into <i>HMS2</i> to disrupt the <i>HMS2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> transcription units and asked what mutations would restore transcription between the beginning and end of these TUs."

A long deletion (<i>HMS2.TEFdel1:Kan</i>), removing all the <i>TEF</i> promoter sequences upstream of the TATA box, results in a significant reduction in expression of the <i>KanMX</i> cassette itself (transcript K) and in levels of the antisense transcript (E) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Remarkably, in this strain, we observed a new antisense transcript from the 3\u2032 end of <i>HMS2</i> that reads through <i>TEF</i>t (B<sup>pTEFdel</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). We confirmed that the B<sup>pTEFdel</sup> transcript spans the 3\u2032 region of <i>HMS2</i> using the H3AS probe (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Thus, the disabled weak p<i>TEFdel1</i> resulted in reduced functionality at <i>TEF</i>t allowing B<sup>pTEFdel</sup>, initiating at the <i>SUT650</i> antisense promoter, to read through <i>TEF</i>t, the <i>KanMX</i> cassette and into the <i>HMS2</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). This experiment illustrates (i) the conditional nature of the bi-directional <i>TEF</i> terminator and (ii) the remarkable plasticity of interleaved transcription units. We suggest that the p<i>TEF.KanMX.TEF</i>t expression cassette is strongly expressed (compare levels of transcripts A<sup>K</sup> and K in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), effectively preventing the formation of the <i>HMS2:SUT650</i> transcription units. When the <i>TEF</i> promoter is disabled, reducing expression of the p<i>TEF.KanMX.TEF</i>t expression cassette, the <i>SUT650</i> antisense transcription unit can form, resulting in the appearance of the long antisense transcript. Alternatively, reduced <i>KanMX</i> sense transcription decreases the ability of a terminator to stop antisense transcription from the <i>SUT650</i> antisense promoter. This illustrates the complex relationships that control levels of expression in the interleaved yeast genome (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

There are two states: a sense-dominant state (blue transcripts) and an antisense-dominant state (orange transcripts) with respect to <i>HMS2</i> (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6B and 7G</a>). Transcription factors (Input) at the <i>HMS2</i> promoter regulate sense transcription and loss of input results in the antisense-dominant state. <i>SUT650</i> transcription insulates <i>BAT2</i> from interference by <i>HMS2</i>, reinforcing the antisense dominant state-switch.

This raises the possibility of an antisense transcription unit-specific function for TFIIB at the 3\u2032 ends of genes, characterised here using the <i>sua7-1</i> allele. A simple scenario in which 3\u2032end TFIIB directs transcription by promoting both antisense transcription and physically terminating sense transcription is compatible with the interference/insulation model proposed here. It is also plausible that alternative higher order structures linking the sense or antisense promoters to one of a possible number of terminators could also explain dynamic state-switching between sense and antisense or multi-cistronic transcripts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Murray et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Only one structure would exist in each cell at any one time leading to temporal separation of the different TUs. By this model only the juxtaposed regions would function in transcription initiation and termination, allowing other promoters or terminators between these regions to be ignored (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). In either case, our data support the idea that the functions of these linked regulatory elements are coupled through the act of transcription. Thus, the interleaved architecture of the yeast genome not only lends itself to high degrees of transcriptional overlap, but more importantly, to an equally high degree of transcription unit interdependency by co-opting transcription itself as a regulatory mechanism."

Data analysis was performed by members of the Lars Steinmetz group at the European Molecular Biology Labs in Heidelberg, Germany (<a href=\"http://steinmetzlab.embl.de/cgi-bin/viewMellorLabArray.pl?showSamples=502_Glu1Vs503_Gal1%26type=heatmap%26gene=hms2\">http://steinmetzlab.embl.de/cgi-bin/viewMellorLabArray.pl?showSamples=502_Glu1Vs503_Gal1&amp;type=heatmap&amp;gene=hms2</a>). Native elongating transcript sequencing, (NET-seq) was done and analysed as described in <a href=\"#bib7\">Churchman and Weissman (2011)</a>. To assess the genome-wide significance of our observations, all genes in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a> were characterised according to their orientation with respect to their upstream (5P divergent, 5P tandem) or their downstream gene (3P, convergent), their own, and their neighbouring genes\u2032 gene type (ORF, CUT, SUT, other) and YMC status (OX, oxidative; RB, reductive building; RC, reductive charging; NA/NC, non-cycling) and the number of genes in each category and median expression level in glucose and galactose determined. Genes that were located more than 1,000 bp from their neighbouring genes were excluded from the analysis. Computer simulations were performed by shuffling the strand location, gene type, YMC status, and expression levels of individual genes on every chromosome while keeping distances between genes and the total number of genes on each strand and of each type constant (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Source code 1</a>\u2013MATLAB codes). Expression levels were simulated by randomly selecting recorded expression levels. After each simulation run, the number of genes and the median expression levels were calculated for each category. Simulations were run 10,000 times. Overlapping genes were defined as being positioned on the opposite strand and having 3\u2032 ends covering the same region of the genome. Enrichment analysis for factors was performed using the published data set by <a href=\"#bib55\">Venters et al. (2011)</a>. The dual-labelled single molecule RNA Fluorescence <i>In Situ</i> hybridization (FISH) protocol was adapted from <a href=\"#bib59\">Zenklusen and Singer (2010)</a>. Fluorescently labelled DNA probes to detect sense or antisense transcripts are shown in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1O</a>. Image acquisition was performed with a DeltaVision CORE: Wide-field fluorescence deconvolution imaging microscope. Using a 100x objective lens, 31 \u2018z-stacks\u2019 were collected. For each stack, an exposure time of 0.5 s for DAPI and 1 s for Cy3 (TRITC) and Cy5 filters was applied. Images were captured using a CoolSNAP HQ camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). To facilitate image analysis, 3D data sets were compressed into 2D images by using a maximum projection, using <i>hms2\u0394</i> cells to determine threshold signal for expression. Images displayed as 2D compressions of z-stacks 12\u201322 (11 stacks), which included most of the nucleus and cytoplasm. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described by <a href=\"#bib31\">Morillon et al. (2003, 2005)</a>. Primers used for RT qPCR are displayed in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1P</a>."

It has been appreciated that oxidative conditions are in conflict with reducing reactions, and vice versa. Consequently, cells have evolved mechanisms to temporarily separate these conflicting conditions, by oscillating both the oxygen consumption as well as the expression of \u223c3000 genes. The remarkable precision of the synchrony in maintaining oscillating levels of mRNAs must involve intracellular events and communication, the basis of which remains obscure. This paper provides some solutions to this enigma by demonstrating how transcription of tandemly arrayed genes can regulate a bi-modal switch so that activation of one gene would repress the other and vice versa. This paper will serve the scientific community in various aspects. First, it will drive the attention of the readers to the complexity of the YMC, an issue that is still underrepresented in the literature. Second, it illustrates the critical roles played by transcription terminators in both terminating transcription and initiating transcription in the anti-sense direction. Third, transcription of anti-sense (AS) as a key modulator of gene expression, in general, and its involvement in the bi-modal switch, in particular. Fourth, and most importantly, the paper demonstrates, in many ways, the intricate relationship between transcription of sense, anti-sense and neighbouring genes in a manner that supports the bimodal switch."

The paper focuses on two tandemly arrayed genes (HMS2/BAT2) whose expression switches during the YMC. They provide a detailed mechanism of the switching whereby transcription read-through into the downstream promoter downregulates transcription of the downstream gene and how AS transcription is involved. Their conclusion that the sense and AS transcription are in conflict, and that cells tend to separate the \u201csense state\u201d from the \u201cAS state\u201d temporarily is by itself remarkable. However, how general is this mechanism? What fraction of YMC-regulated genes is adjacent or anti-sense? More than expected by chance? And then what fraction of adjacent or anti-sense transcripts is co-regulated in the YMC? Moreover, if the mechanism is more prevalent than just HMS2/BAT2, do the anti-sense transcripts always fall into opposite YMC categories, i.e., oxidative vs reductive? Is this locus even representative of other glu-gal clusters? If 10 loci are chosen at random (based on having one strong glu-gal-regulated transcript), do the neighbouring genes show potent regulation like the one well-explored region? Reviewers agreed that a more global assessment of the prevalence of the mechanism described would raise the impact significantly. However, it was noted that the bioinformatics involved for a global analysis would not be trivial. Thus, reviewers request that the authors manually mine the NET-seq data regarding transcript isoforms (like the data shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1D</a>) and examine whether transcription of one gene invades the promoter of its neighbouring gene, and whether the AS transcription is anti-correlated. The control should be the same number of tandemly positioned gene pairs that are chosen at random. If the authors have the bioinformatic means to take a whole genome view, all the better."

If the authors know that ADH1t does not act as terminator in the reverse orientation, they should indicate it. Moreover, even if the ADH1t is not acting as terminator of the AS, it can introduce a destabilization element that leads to its rapid degradation.

The membranes were probed only with the H1 probe. This case might be an opportunity to examine if any of these factors play a role in the transcription of BAT2, by probing the membrane with an appropriate probe. URA3 ORF can be replaced back to HMS2 ORF by homologous recombination and selection on 5-FOA, thus resulting in a precise deletion of just the region around the TSS. Maybe one of these TFs is required for BAT2 transcriptional repression by C1 transcription (e.g., transcription through the binding site might displace the TF)."

There are 1772 annotated CUTs and SUTs but much more transcription antisense to genes is evident from the NET-seq analysis. A separate analysis suggests that 75% of all yeast genes are subject to some antisense transcription in the vicinity of the sense promoter that influences the chromatin organization around that promoter. Nevertheless, our analysis for this work suggests that YMC genes are much more likely to have antisense transcription, although the number of genes is relatively small because of the high thresholds (&gt;3-fold change in GLU/GAL both the YMC gene and the SUT or CUT). 71 of the 206 genes (34.4%) with regulated sense and antisense have SUTs/CUTs whose transcription also changes 3-fold in the GLU/GAL shift. 26% of all SUTs and CUTs show a &gt;3-fold change on the GLU/GAL shift.

Putative factor binding sites, and even ChIP data with tagged factors, does not provide evidence that a particular factor is functional at a particular site, for a variety of reasons (Lenstra TL, Benschop JJ, Kim T, Schulze JM, Brabers NA, Margaritis T, van de Pasch LA, van Heesch SA, Brok MO, Groot Koerkamp MJ, Ko CW, van Leenen D, Sameith K, van Hooff SR, Lijnzaad P, Kemmeren P, Hentrich T, Kobor MS, Buratowski S and Holstege FC: The specificity and topology of chromatin interaction pathways in yeast. Mol Cell 42: 536-49, 2011). Indeed, many of the experiments linking transcription factors to changes in particular transcriptional responses at genes are likely to be artefacts resulting simply from altered growth rate as a result of the genetic intervention (O'Duibhir E, Lijnzaad P, Benschop JJ, Lenstra TL, Leenen D van, Groot Koerkamp MJA, Margaritis T, Brok MO, Kemmeren P and FCP H: Cell cycle population effects in perturbation studies. Mol Syst Biol. 10: 2014; Slavov N, Airoldi EM, van Oudenaarden A and Botstein D: A conserved cell growth cycle can account for the environmental stress responses of divergent eukaryotes. Mol Biol Cell 23: 1986-97, 2013), (and the different times spent in the OX and RC phases of the YMC). We think this criticism applies to all the experiments we have done with TF KO strains in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a> and have been careful not to over-interpret the data to infer that these TFs actually bind to the DNA. Rather, the data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> showing the switching of the balance of <i>HMS2</i> sense and <i>SUT650</i> antisense suggest that ablation of some factors coupled to mild nutrient limitation leads to cells where transcription in the <i>HMS2:SUT650</i> region is predominantly in sense or antisense orientations. This provides evidence for reciprocal switching between <i>HMS2</i> sense and <i>SUT650</i> antisense and suggests a signalling input regulates this only at the <i>HMS2</i> promoter. We have a number of experiments in the paper to support this, particularly those in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. In summary these experiments show that expression of the antisense state (<i>SUT650</i> and <i>BAT2</i>) is constitutive in the absence of sense transcription, regardless of growth conditions (GLU or GAL). Normally <i>SUT650</i> transcription increases on the GLU to GAL shift but this reflects the reduction in <i>HMS2</i> sense transcription in GAL. Without sense, SUT650 levels remain high in GLU. Similar arguments apply to <i>BAT2</i>. Elimination of sense transcript in the p<i>GAL1:HMS2</i> anchor away experiment in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, by addition of Rapamycin to deplete nuclear Gal4 from cells in GAL, restores <i>BAT2</i> transcript levels. Thus the primary <i>BAT2</i> regulation is transcriptional interference by the sense transcription in GAL (in this experiment only as the inserted <i>GAL1</i> promoter is GAL-regulated)."

If there is no growth signal, transcription of <i>BAT2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> is constitutive, as if cells are in the quiescent state that occurs naturally when nutrients are limited. In fact all the changes that occur when yeast naturally enter stationary phase due to nutrient depletion also occur in RC cells (Shi L, Sutter BM, Ye X and Tu BP: Trehalose is a key determinant of the quiescent metabolic state that fuels cell cycle progression upon return to growth. Mol Biol Cell 21: 1982-90). This does not rule out TFs in the regulation of RC genes, but it does suggest they are not condition-specific. This is supported by our two new genome-wide analyses now included in the manuscript (Table S10). We have examined the nature of the transcription factors\u2019 association with the promoters of RC or OX genes (in GLU) from the Venters and Pugh work (2011) (now included in reference list). They looked at the association of 202 factors at yeast promoters. We used their dataset to ask whether OX and RC genes are enriched for particular factors, as both will be expressed in GLU-grown cells. We show significantly different (p&lt;0.01) ChIP-Chip binding patterns for factors at the two groups of genes. The RC genes are enriched for cohesion, the CCR4/NOT complex, elongator, chromatin and chromatin remodelling factors and four TFs, (Fhl1, Ino4, Ume6 and Skn7). By contrast, OX genes are associated with GTFs, TEFs, TFIID, and the TFs Ifh1 and Rap1. Although \u201cstress\u201d related transcription factors may play a role at the RC genes, these data suggest chromatin-mediated regulation as a central feature for RC genes. Our data support TI-mediated chromatin changes at the <i>BAT2</i> promoter."

As it stands, our data, albeit quite crude, provides no evidence for a role for these factors in activation of either <i>HMS2</i> or <i>SUT650</i>. We rule out TFs as roadblocks (at least Gal4 for <i>SUT650</i> transcribed into the <i>GAL</i> promoter) but do see a role for Gln3 (only in minimal medium) in preventing transcript C (<i>HMS2:BAT2</i> read through) and a reduction in <i>SUT650</i> levels (supporting increased TI at the <i>HMS2:BAT2</i> intergenic region). Given the literature supports a role for TFs and promoters in determining transcript stability, another explanation for the effect of loss of Gln3 is that transcript C is stabilised, but there is no change in transcription <i>per se</i> and thus no change in the transcript ratios. How RC genes are regulated is clearly complicated and beyond the scope of what we can do for a 2 month revision. We think the suggestion of the referee is excellent but have a number of reservations about this type of approach, especially as some of the putative TF binding sites are within the <i>HMS2</i> ORF (similar arguments to the <i>URA3</i> question above). Instead we have provided an Anchor-Away experiment to deplete nuclear Gln3 in Galactose (conditions expected to increase <i>BAT2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> expression). In the same experiment nuclear depletion of Sua7 results in loss of both <i>BAT2</i> and <i>SUT650</i> transcripts. We find no evidence that Gln3 is required for <i>BAT2</i> or <i>SUT650</i> expression in these conditions and the Sua7 control suggests this is not simple a result of the <i>BAT2</i> transcript being particularly stable in GAL. These data are now included in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>."
