                    "text": "Arrhythmogenesis from aberrant electrical remodeling is a primary cause of death among patients with heart disease. Amongst a multitude of remodeling events, reduced expression of the ion channel subunit KChIP2 is consistently observed in numerous cardiac pathologies. However, it remains unknown if KChIP2 loss is merely a symptom or involved in disease development. Using rat and human derived cardiomyocytes, we identify a previously unobserved transcriptional capacity for cardiac KChIP2 critical in maintaining electrical stability. Through interaction with genetic elements, KChIP2 transcriptionally repressed the miRNAs miR-34b and miR-34c, which subsequently targeted key depolarizing (<i>I</i><sub>Na</sub>) and repolarizing (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>) currents altered in cardiac disease. Genetically maintaining KChIP2 expression or inhibiting miR-34 under pathologic conditions restored channel function and moreover, prevented the incidence of reentrant arrhythmias. This identifies the KChIP2/miR-34 axis as a central regulator in developing electrical dysfunction and reveals miR-34 as a therapeutic target for treating arrhythmogenesis in heart disease."

Amongst a multitude of remodeling events, reduced expression of the ion channel subunit KChIP2 is consistently observed in numerous cardiac pathologies. However, it remains unknown if KChIP2 loss is merely a symptom or involved in disease development. Using rat and human derived cardiomyocytes, we identify a previously unobserved transcriptional capacity for cardiac KChIP2 critical in maintaining electrical stability. Through interaction with genetic elements, KChIP2 transcriptionally repressed the miRNAs miR-34b and miR-34c, which subsequently targeted key depolarizing (<i>I</i><sub>Na</sub>) and repolarizing (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>) currents altered in cardiac disease. Genetically maintaining KChIP2 expression or inhibiting miR-34 under pathologic conditions restored channel function and moreover, prevented the incidence of reentrant arrhythmias. This identifies the KChIP2/miR-34 axis as a central regulator in developing electrical dysfunction and reveals miR-34 as a therapeutic target for treating arrhythmogenesis in heart disease."

Aberrant remodeling culminates in altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Houser et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2008</a>), Na<sup>+</sup> current (<i>I<sub>Na</sub></i>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pu and Boyden, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Maltsev et al., 2002</a>), and a host of outward K<sup>+</sup> currents (<i>I<sub>K</sub></i>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">N\u00e4bauer and K\u00e4\u00e4b, 1998</a>), creating impaired cardiac excitability and performance, accounting for high rates of mortality in HF patients (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nattel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tomaselli and Zipes, 2004</a>). However, large variability and breadth of electrical changes present challenges in determining which mechanisms are critical in driving arrhythmias and disease progression. Intriguingly, loss of the Potassium Channel Interacting Protein 2 (KChIP2) has proven to be a consistent event following cardiac stress, sparking interest into understanding its contribution in disease remodeling (<a href=\"#bib27\">N\u00e4bauer and K\u00e4\u00e4b, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nass et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jin et al., 2010</a>)."

However, emerging evidence suggests KChIP2 may not be limited to this role (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thomsen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Li et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Desch\u00eanes et al., 2008</a>). Investigations following KChIP2 knock-down show reduced transcript expression for the cardiac sodium channel gene, <i>SCN5A</i>, and its accessory subunit <i>SCN1B</i>, in addition to Kv4.3 protein, prompting the loss of both <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Desch\u00eanes et al., 2008</a>). Considerably, these changes reflect conditions observed in the diseased heart, but more importantly implicate potential transcriptional significance for KChIP2 at the center of that remodeling. Indeed, other members of the KChIP family not expressed in the myocardium behave as transcriptional repressors, while also maintaining the ability to interact with Kv4 channels (<a href=\"#bib1\">An et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carri\u00f3n et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Savignac et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gomez-Villafuertes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ronkainen et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we sought to identify the existence of cardiac KChIP2 transcriptional activity and its significance in electrical remodeling and arrhythmia susceptibility. Here, we find KChIP2 transcriptionally represses a set of miRNAs known as miR-34b and-34c. Through KChIP2 loss, miR-34b/c are elevated, subsequently targeting other ion channel genes defining <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> densities. Either restoring KChIP2 expression or blocking miR-34b/c activity during cardiac stress reverses this remodeling and completely negates the occurrence of re-entrant arrhythmias. Together, this work unveils a novel, transcriptional mechanism for KChIP2, and defines it as a central mediator of cardiac electrical activity."

We therefore performed a miRNA microarray following KChIP2 silencing in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), resulting in the induction of a number of miRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We evaluated the miRNAs that achieved at least a two fold increase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) using TargetScan 7.1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>) to identify potential targeting to the mRNAs <i>SCN5A</i>, <i>SCN1B</i>, and <i>KCND3</i>. Ultimately, we identified miR-34b and \u221234c as the only miRNAs predicted to target not just one of these ion channel genes, but notably target all three collectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Notably, we also observed 14 miRNAs decreased greater than two fold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, a loss in miRNA expression is not consistent with the role of KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor, and also would not lead to a decrease in ion channel mRNA expression. Real-time qPCR was used to confirm the array results, showing elevation in the mature transcripts for miR-34b and \u221234c (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Importantly, we also performed overexpression of three different cardiac KChIP2 isoforms which reduced the expression of miRs-34b/c (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Together, these changes are consistent with the novel idea that KChIP2 behaves as a transcriptional repressor."

Notably, both miR-34b and \u221234c are transcribed in tandem under the regulation of a shared, intergenic promoter (<a href=\"#bib46\">Toyota et al., 2008</a>). To identify potential DNA binding locations for KChIP2, we borrowed from what is known about the putative nucleotide binding sequence for the transcriptional repressor DREAM (KChIP3). This member of the KChIP family shares a high degree of homology with KChIP2, but more importantly has known transcriptional activity occurring through interaction with a nucleotide sequence known as the DRE motif (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carri\u00f3n et al., 1999</a>). MatInspector software (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cartharius et al., 2005</a>) was used to evaluate the miR-34b/c promoter for occurrences of this motif, revealing a potential site beginning 254 bp upstream of the miR-34b stem-loop (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). A region of the promoter 500 bp to 191 bp upstream of the miR-34b stem-loop was cloned into the pGL4.10 luciferase vector and co-transfected with several KChIP2 isoforms into cos-7 cells. When compared to a GFP transfected control without KChIP2, we observed significant repression in the presence of KChIP2.3, 2.4, and 2.6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), showing that KChIP2 can directly act on the miR-34b/c promoter to impart repressive action. To determine if physical KChIP2 interaction with the promoter mediates the repressive state, native adult rat cardiomyocytes were used to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by qPCR with a primer set flanking the identified DRE site. KChIP2 pull-down resulted in significant enrichment of the DRE containing PCR fragment when compared to an IgG control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

This construct was co-expressed with the miR-34b/c precursors in HEK293 cells, resulting in reduced activity in all three constructs when compared to a control miR-precursor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Subsequently, mutations were made within the seed region where miR-34 targeting is predicted to bind (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), which significantly attenuated the repressive action (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This suggests that miR-34b/c are indeed targeting the predicted seed region in the <i>SCN5A</i>, <i>SCN1B</i>, and <i>KCND3</i> genes and directly influencing their expression."

Reflecting the changes in mRNA and protein, expression of miR-34b/c precursor produced a significant decline in <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). <i>I<sub>to</sub></i>, however, while having trended reductions, did not produce significant loss despite the loss in Kv4.3 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). This can be attributed to a number of reasons. The current evaluation was conducted in rodent myocytes, where <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> is comprised of the shared alpha subunits Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, which comprise a fast component of <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> referred to as <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i>. Additionally, there are the contributions of Kv1.4, another potassium channel subunit, which encodes a slow component, referred to as <i>I<sub>to,s</sub></i>. These descriptions are attributed to the respective rates of recovery from inactivation for each of these channels (<a href=\"#bib26\">Niwa and Nerbonne, 2010</a>). Notably, our patch protocol in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> took into account the contributions of all three subunits, or <i>I<sub>to,total</sub></i>. Therefore, despite reductions in Kv4.3 protein expression the change in current resists as it is not the predominant channel contributing to <i>I<sub>to</sub></i>. Importantly, Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 do not contain a miR-34 seed region. In fact, in response to miR-34b/c expression, mRNA levels for Kv4.2 actually experienced a trended elevation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) which could also contribute to the lack of reduction in <i>I<sub>to</sub></i>. We therefore modified our patch protocol to probe just <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> and remove the contribution of Kv1.4, which now revealed a significant reduction in the <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). To further identify if the presence of Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and Kv1.4 in rats could explain the resisted change in <i>I<sub>to</sub></i>, cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iCells) were used, since in the human background, Kv4.3 is the dominant contributor to <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Niwa and Nerbonne, 2010</a>). Expression of miR-34b/c precursors now produced a significant loss in <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>), while also maintaining reductions in <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Importantly, this not only satisfies why <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> loss was resistant in the NRVMs, but identifies conservation of miR-34 activity across species, implicating the importance of miR-34s in human cardiac ion channel regulation."

PE stimulation resulted in a dramatic decline of <i>KCNIP2</i> (KChIP2), while also yielding significant elevation in miR-34b/c (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). These conditions resulted in reductions in expression for <i>SCN5A</i>, <i>SCN1B</i>, and <i>KCND3</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Critically, maintaining KChIP2 levels through use of adenovirus encoding KChIP2 (Ad.KChIP2) normalized the expression of miRs-34b/c while reversing the loss in <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN1B</i>; however, <i>KCND3</i> levels remained suppressed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). Functional evaluation on both <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> shows significant loss in density following PE treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>), reflecting the changes we see in transcript expression and mimicking ion channel remodeling observed in HF. However, Ad.KChIP2 treatment restored the current density for both currents, despite <i>KCND3</i> transcript expression being unaffected by KChIP2 expression. These observations strongly implicate a role for KChIP2 in maintaining proper electrical expression during pathological remodeling in the stressed heart. Moreover, we were able to observe significant reduction of KChIP2 and elevation of miR-34b/c within failing human heart tissue compared to non-failing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Reinforcing this conservation was the identification of a predicted DRE motif proximal to the transcriptional start site, in the human miR-34b/c promoter as evaluated by MatInspector (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). At the same time, significant loss of <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>KCND3</i> transcripts in failing tissue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) also show conservation of miR-34b/c targeting within their 3\u2019-UTRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Interestingly, <i>SCN1B</i> does not preserve its target site in humans, however, we also observed no significant reduction in transcript expression from failing heart tissue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Together, this reinforces the concept of KChIP2 as a core transcriptional regulator of electrical activity under normal and pathologic conditions."

However, <i>I<sub>to,total</sub></i> density in the NRVMs did not observe the same rescue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

To begin to address this discussion, a gene expression array was performed on NRVM following 48 hr of KChIP2 silencing. Evaluation of genes that experienced at least a two fold change revealed an increase in expression for 293 genes and a decrease in expression for 407 genes in response to KChIP2 silencing (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Notably, of the genes experiencing increased expression, 192 of them (65.5%) were predicted to contain a DRE motif within promoter elements, implicating the potential of KChIP2 transcriptional activity directly mediating these changes. Additionally, of the genes responding with reduced expression, 71 of them (17.4%) were predicted to contain a miR-34b/c target site within their 3\u2019-UTR. Importantly, we see significant reduction to <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN1B</i>, consistent with previous data and the mechanisms investigated here. Considerably, whether these changes are the direct consequence of KChIP2 transcriptional repression, or more indirect KChIP2 dependent mechanisms, including prolonged APD from loss in <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> density contributing to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, the results are still relevant to cardiac remodeling, particularly given the associated loss of KChIP2 in cardiac disease states. Notably, a diverse range of gene pathways were implicated in response to KChIP2 loss, including cardiovascular signaling, regulation to G-protein coupled receptor pathways, relaxation and contraction, TGF\u03b2 signaling, apoptotic, and NF\u03baB dependent signaling mechanisms, all of which have a relevance in disease remodeling (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Importantly, these data are supportive of our conclusion that KChIP2 is a key regulator of cardiac pathology. While our study focused on the transcriptional pathway by which KChIP2 could exert a concerted regulation of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>to</sub></i>, further investigations pursuing some of the targets highlighted from this gene expression array will likely reveal a broader role for KChIP2 as a transcriptional regulator of cardiac physiology much like is seen for KChIP3 (DREAM) in the brain."

Our previous work has also suggested that KChIP2 is part of a larger macromolecular complex that includes subunits for both Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and Kv4 channels that lead to functional increases in both currents when coexpressed with KChIP2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeschenesDesch\u00eanes et al., 2008</a>). In the same study we also identified transcriptional changes in <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN1B</i> following acute knockdown of KChIP2 in NRVM, which provided the motivational basis for the work presented here.

Even the role of KChIP3 as a transcriptional repressor is multimodal, including direct binding to DRE motifs, in addition to interacting with and suppressing the activity of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), an established transcriptional activator (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ledo et al., 2002</a>). Both of these processes are Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated, due to three functional high affinity EF-hand motifs residing in the protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carri\u00f3n et al., 1999</a>). Occupancy of these sites upon increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> lead to conformational changes that cause DNA binding release (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carri\u00f3n et al., 1999</a>) or dissociation from CREB (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ledo et al., 2002</a>), causing de-repression of downstream gene targets. Given that the entirety of the KChIP gene family displays strong conservation around these EF-hand residues, suggests conservation of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated responses. Indeed, we observed that caffeine stimulation produced increased activity of the miR-34b/c promoter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) in the presence of KChIP2. Additionally, when we deleted the DRE element in the miR-34b/c promoter, we observed an incomplete removal of suppression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, as KChIP3 represses gene expression through alternative CREB dependent regulation, the partially retained repressive activity may be attributed to this secondary function. Further analysis of the promoter by MatInpsector revealed several potential sites of predicted CREB binding that may have allowed for partially maintained KChIP2 suppression, even in the absence of the DRE site. Given that KChIP2 and KChIP3 share a high degree of homology only reinforces the observation of multiple activities for KChIP2 as well."

Rapid depletion of KChIP2 protein is a widespread event that underlies remodeling in many cardiac diseases, including chronic HF, MI, and atrial fibrillation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nattel et al., 2007</a>). Considerably, these diseases also present with reductions in <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i>. The relationship between KChIP2 and <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> has been heavily studied, frequently identifying that KChIP2 loss induces the destabilization of Kv4.2/4.3 channels and mediates the decline in current density (<a href=\"#bib11\">Foeger et al., 2013</a>). However, the work presented here offers the unique alternative that translation block through miRNA interaction mediates the decline in Kv4.3. Given that Kv4.2 does not contain a miR-34 target region in its 3\u2019-UTR, but still experiences degradation following KChIP2 loss, it is likely that both mechanisms contribute to the resulting loss in <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i>. However, it is also observed that reduced KChIP2 expression stimulated by phenylephrine + propranolol in in vitro cultures of NRVM experienced increased Kv4.2 protein while KChIP2 and Kv4.3 levels were reduced (<a href=\"#bib29\">Panama et al., 2011</a>), supporting the opportunity for miRNA dependent translational block targeting Kv4.3, rather than just destabilization of all Kv4 channels."

Our data of miR-34 targeting Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 provides a means for describing this loss in activity. Notably, others have shown a loss in the full length transcript for Nav1.5 mRNA and a corresponding increase in a truncated isoform without the miR-34b/c target region present (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shang et al., 2007</a>), reinforcing the observations for miR-34b/c mediating the decline of <i>SCN5A</i>. Overall, the consequential loss of both <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i>, and <i>I<sub>to</sub></i>, suggests KChIP2 loss during cardiac stress may be a nodal event in a cascade of gene regulation defining electrical remodeling in the stressed myocardium. Indeed, earlier work was done that sought to determine the significance of KChIP2 in the development of hypertrophic remodeling. In a rat TAC banding model, it was observed that maintaining KChIP2 expression attenuated hypertrophy and pathogenic remodeling that otherwise lead to a worsening myocardium during pressure overload (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jin et al., 2010</a>). This reverse in remodeling was attributed to changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling brought on by restoration of an abbreviated APD. Yet, we were able to observe that inhibition of miR-34b/c could also attenuate adverse remodeling without influencing APD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) implicating multiple pathways of KChIP2 intervention. Indeed, the miR-34 family has recently been implicated in the development and progression of hypertrophy and heart failure, in rodent models of both MI and pressure overload (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernardo et al., 2012</a>). Critically, these studies, combined with our own data, show that blockade of the miR-34 family can attenuate pathologic remodeling, expanding the significance of KChIP2 and miR-34 in cardiac pathogenesis."

Investigations conducted in KChIP2 null mice have shown that when submitted to TAC banding, there is no worsened phenotype when compared to wild type mice (<a href=\"#bib37\">Speerschneider et al., 2013</a>). In fact, arrhythmia susceptibility was lowered in the KChIP2 null mice during heart failure, believed to be the result of reduced dispersion of repolarization. At the same time, there were no observed changes to <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i>. While our current understanding is unable to account for this disparity, it may be that compensatory regulation exists in these mice as a consequence of constitutive KChIP2 absence during development, fundamentally changing its regulatory significance. Evidence for this is observed when restoring KChIP2 expression in myocytes isolated from KChIP2 null mice, which resulted in no rescue of Kv4.2 protein expression or recovery of <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Foeger et al., 2013</a>). However, restoration of KChIP2 following acute loss from pathologic consequences in a rat model was able to rescue <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jin et al., 2010</a>), consistent with what we see in our own maintenance of KChIP2 following prolonged PE exposure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

Indeed, previous studies have revealed the relationship between changes in Na<sup>+</sup> channel density and arrhythmia induction. As <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> becomes compromised, it begins to resolve an expanding interval of premature stimuli declared the vulnerability period. Within this interval, reentry is more likely to occur as a result of non-uniform conduction block surrounding the point of excitation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Starmer et al., 2003</a>). Both theoretical (<a href=\"#bib38\">Starmer et al., 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">1993</a>) and experimental (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nesterenko et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Starmer et al., 1992</a>) studies show that when Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability is reduced, the vulnerable period increases.

Briefly, freshly isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were fixed in a 1% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 14 min and quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min. Cells were treated with a 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA 1x PBS solution for 8 min at 37\u00b0C to partially digest the cells aiding in removal of cytoplasmic extract and purification of nuclear extract during cell lysis steps. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 10% FBS, and the cell pellet was rinsed 3x in ice cold PBS. Chromatin was extracted by the treatment with several lysis buffers. Lysis buffer 1 (50 mM Hepes-KOH, Ph7.5; 140 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10% Glyerol; 0.5% Igepal; 0.25% Triton-X) was added to the cells for 10 min with rocking, followed by 15\u201320 dounces with a glass teflon douncer on ice. This cell lysate fraction was discarded and the remaining cell pellet was resuspended in Lysis buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,0, 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM EGTA) for 5 min with rocking. This was again followed by 15\u201320 dounces with a glass teflon douncer on ice. Lastly, remaining cell pellet was resuspended in Lysis buffer 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM EGTA; 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate; 0.5% <i>N</i>-lauroylsarcosine). Cell suspension was split in half to be used for IgG or KChIP2 ChIP. Samples were then sheared on a BioRuptor (Diagenode, total 18 cycles, hi-power, 30 s on/off). The sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 15 ug of antibody (either \u03b1-KChIP2 or IgG control) bound to Dynabeads (Invitrogen) followed by washing and elution. Immuoprecipitate and input chromatin samples were then reverse crosslinked followed by purification of genomic DNA. Target and nontarget regions of genomic DNA were amplified by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green. Data were analyzed by calculating the immunoprecipitated DNA enrichment normalized to a region 8 kb upstream of the target site in the KChIP2-IP compared to the IgG-IP. Antibodies used in ChIP were KChIP2 (UC Davis NeuroMab 75\u2013004) and IgG (Millipore Cat# 12\u2013371 RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_145840\">AB_145840</a>) ChIP-PCR primer sequences were: miR-34b target site: forward 5\u2019- GGTCACTCGGCCAGTAGGA-3\u2019, reverse 5\u2019- GGAGTCCTGCTCTCCCTCA-3\u2019. miR-34b 8 kb upstream: 5\u2019- CCACCCTCTCAGTAGCTTGC-3\u2019, reverse 5\u2019- CAGTGCCAGGGGATAGGAAG-3\u2019"

RNA studies for gene expression changes were conducted in 6-well plates with 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells plated per well for the collection of RNA. For patch-clamp recordings, NRVMs were on coverslips coated with laminin (Sigma, L2020) inside of 35 mm dish at a density of 100,000 cells/well. For optical mapping 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2227</sup>6 NRVMs were plated on aclar coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) coated with fibronectin (BD Biosciences, 356008) in a 35 mm dish. Following the initial 24\u201336 hr of plating, media was switched to 1:1 DMEM:F12 (without serum or BrdU) and supplemented with 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium-X (Invitrogen), 1% PS, and 142 \u03bcM Na<sup>+</sup> Ascorbate for an additional 24\u201336 hr. After this time, treatment media was applied, consisting of the same DMEM:F12 media with supplements and 100 \u03bcM phenylephrine. At the same time, control cells without phenylephrine were transduced with adeno.GFP, while phenylephrine treated cells received either the adeno.GFP or adeno.KChIP2.6 to restore KChIP2 expression during phenylephrine treatment. Alternatively, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAi Max using manufacturer\u2019s protocol to deliver a control or combination of miR-34b and \u221234c antimir. In the case of transfected cells, the transfection was performed prior to the initiation of phenylephrine treatment. Phenylephrine treatment was sustained for 48 hr (fresh media was swapped after 24 hr, maintaining phenylephrine treatment, but no more virus was applied). Phenylephrine studies were also performed on iCells. iCell Cardiomyocyte Maintenance Medium was supplemented with 142 \u03bcM Na<sup>+</sup> Ascorbate. iCells were only treated with the antimirs and submitted to patch-clamp recordings with the same treatment conditions applied to the NRVM. Notably, cells used for patch clamp recordings or optical mapping were washed at least three times over a minimum of 20 min in media without phenylephrine present for washout."

To measure <i>I<sub>to</sub></i>, cells were placed in the Tyrode's solution containing (mmol/L) NaCl 137, KCl 5.4, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.0, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.0, Glucose 10, HEPES 10, CdCl<sub>2</sub> 0.3, and TTX 100 mM, pH to 7.35 with NaOH.

Recording <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> used a modified protocol to kinetically isolate the current. A 150 ms voltage step to \u221280 mV from a holding potential of \u221220 mV was used to allow recovery of <i>I<sub>to,f</sub></i> but not <i>I<sub>to,s</sub></i>. This was followed by a 50 ms prepulse to \u221220 mV to eliminate <i>I<sub>Na</sub>. I<sub>to,f</sub></i> amplitude was then measured as the difference between peak current and steady-state current during 500 ms voltage steps ranging from \u221230 to\u00a0+40 mV. Ionic current density (pA/pF) was calculated from the ratio of current amplitude to cell capacitance. All experiments were performed at 35\u00b0C except <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> (room temperature). Low-resistance electrodes (&lt;2 M\u03a9) were used, and a routine series resistance compensation was performed to values of\u00a0&gt;80% to minimize voltage clamp errors. The uncompensated Rseries was therefore\u00a0&lt;2 M\u03a9. Command and data acquisition were operated with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier controlled by a personal computer using a Digidata 1200 acquisition board driven by pCLAMP 7.0 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Current densities, cell capacitance, current-voltage relationship, and conductance, were measured as previously described (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shinlapawittayatorn et al., 2011</a>)."

A solid-state light source (Sola Light Engine, Lumencore) was used for dye excitation (510/80 nm) over a 16 \u00d7 12 mm field of view. Cells were paced by point stimulation at cycle lengths of 1000 ms, 750 ms, 500 ms, 350 ms and 350 ms to obtain conduction velocity and APD restitution curves. Analysis of recordings were conducted via custom software developed in Matlab (MathWorks) as described previously (PMID: 12960954). Additional Matlab custom software (Rhythm) was also used for analysis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Laughner et al., 2012</a>).

                    "text": "The manuscript by Nassal and Deschenes and colleagues addresses the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in patients with heart disease. They describe a transcriptional repression role for the proteins KChIP2 \u2013 previously known to interact at the membrane with and regulate the Kv4.3 potassium channel in a Ca-dependent manner, and identifies genes for mir34b and c as targets of this transcriptional repression. These miRs regulate channel subunits transcripts responsible for <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>to</sub> (SCN5</i>A, <i>SCN1B</i> and <i>KCND3</i> itself) through degradation and translational repression mechanisms. Thus, this work proposes a new arm of a regulatory network in the heart controlled by the multifunctional proteins KChIP2, which is known to be significantly repressed in heart disease. The idea that KChIP2 can be a transcriptional regulator is derivative of similar findings on a highly related channel-regulator KChIP3/DREAM active in neuronal cells, which has been characterized in detail. Nonetheless, KChIP2 expression is specific to the heart, giving this study specific context, and the elucidation of the down stream miR pathway is novel. The data appear for the most part robust and modulation of miR23bc and channel subunits appears to be confirmed in human failing heart samples, although here controls are missing. The second part of the paper addresses the functional implications of this pathway in an in vitro model of cardiac disease (PE treated NRVMs). They provide a surrogate that appear to support the model of critical involvement of the above pathway in dampening of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> currents in disease. Overexpression of miR34b and c precursors dampens currents (<i>I<sub>to</sub></i> only in human cells as there is compensatory expression of Kv4.2 in mouse CMs), while over expression of KChIP2 restores currents dampened after PE treatment of NRVC. A strong finding is that point pacing induced arrhythmogenic activity in monolayer cultures treated with PE and this can be blocked by antimeres to miR34b/c."

Downregulation of several miRNAs upon KChIP2 knock-down is less compatible with KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor, thus it should be clearly visible in the figure. A list of all significantly regulated miRNAs more than two-fold up/down would also be appreciated by the community. In addition analysis of miRNA is fine; however it is unlikely that a transcription factor specifically regulates only these miRNAs. If KChIP2 is a transcription factor, a more thorough analysis of transcriptional changes upon acute/chronic down- or upregulation of KChIP2 would be potentially interesting and support the findings."

Importantly though, the primary focus of this manuscript was the identification of the KChIP2/miR-34b/c axis of regulation and its implications in electrical remodeling of the heart. Given the degree of verification and confirmation in identifying KChIP2 transcriptional targets, particularly considering its multimodal function, a full gene analysis following KChIP2 loss presents with the challenging task of understanding which are direct targets of transcriptional activity and which are secondary responses. However, gene changes following KChIP2 loss either by direct or indirect means are still substantial in understanding molecular changes that might be precipitated by KChIP2 loss during heart failure remodeling. Therefore, to begin populating a list of genes that are altered in response to acute KChIP2 loss, a whole-transcriptome microarray was performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with an shRNA to acutely suppress KChIP2 expression. A list of significantly up- and down-regulated mRNAs has been provided as a table in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and D. Importantly, we saw the conservation of decreases in both <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN1B</i>. At the same time, we see that other highly predicted miR-34b/c targets such as Sema4b are also reduced. In total, 293 genes experienced at least a 2 fold increase in expression and 407 genes a 2 fold decrease. Notably, of the genes experiencing increased expression, 192 of them (65.5%) were predicted to contain a DRE motif within promoter elements, implicating the potential of KChIP2 transcriptional activity directly mediating these changes. This is consistent with the role of KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor and highlights its potential involvement in transcriptionally influencing a large portion of these gene changes."

Initially, we had settled on this approach due to expected limitations in the experimental design which could not be easily addressed. Most ChIP studies are critically dependent on the availability of an appropriate ChIP-grade antibody for maximizing the efficiency of pulldown. However, as we are characterizing novel KChIP2 DNA binding, there is no available antibody designed for this purpose. At the same time, NRVM were chosen over adult myocytes due to the easier disruption and isolation of nuclear content, without cytosolic contamination, assisting in a more efficient sonication of chromatin material, as well as being able to shed non-DNA bound KChIP2 residing in the cytosol. However, NRVM express native KChIP2 at a dramatically lower amount, therefore, we had chosen to over-express the protein. Regardless, artificial expression of KChIP2 does have the potential to create artifacts, and so to satisfy that concern we optimized our ChIP-PCR workflow to handle native adult rat cardiomyocytes. The results of those efforts revealed a significant enrichment of the miR-34b/c promoter following KChIP2 pull-down compared to IgG control in native adult rat myocytes without needing to overexpress KChIP2 (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), reinforcing that this transcriptional interaction is indeed a native event."

However, we consistently ran into difficulties at the point of library generation. Consultations with ChIP-seq experts suggested that without a proper ChIP grade antibody or alternatively a tagged fusion protein, we would not achieve sufficient chromatin enrichment for successful library generation. While a tagged fusion was a possible alternative, we would still run into the issue of having to over-express the construct, while at the same time run the risk of modifying the native behavior of the cell by addition of the tag. Lastly, a transgenic animal with the fusion could be made to maintain endogenous gene levels, however, that would be beyond the scope of this manuscript at this time.

As sodium channel excitability becomes compromised, there becomes an expanding window of vulnerability where a premature stimulus at the right time will capture and propagate in one direction, but will still be in a state of refractoriness in another, establishing the substrates necessary for reentry to occur. Both mathematical and experimental data are in support of this mechanism (1-4).

Physiologically, an ectopic beat from an event such as a delayed after depolarization could lead to a premature stimulus that if occurring within this vulnerable window would establish the same events leading to the formation of reentry. Therefore, we believe that the observations made after miR-34b/c blockade are, in fact, major contributors to arrhythmic risk as observed in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, and consistent with the mechanisms identified throughout the manuscript."

Although I agree that the present study provides strong evidence supporting KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor through modulating miR-34, the discussion may need to state limitations of this study and potential alternative regulation of I<sub>to</sub> factors other than miR-34.</i>"

                    "text": "The reviewers are correct in this observation. There are multiple modes of regulation by which KChIP2 can target the family of Kv4 channels and we appreciate the opportunity to clarify these mechanisms. Numerous publications have investigated the physical interaction KChIP2 has with both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, leading to the enhanced trafficking and increased stabilization of the channels (<a href=\"#bib30\">5</a>). With KChIP2 loss, the consequence has been reduced expression of both Kv4 channels. Therefore, while we highlight a transcriptional capacity of KChIP2 to target miR-34b/c and indirectly target Kv4.3, KChIP2 is also destabilizing both Kv4.3 in addition to Kv4.2 through its physical interaction. These distinctions are highlighted well in the experiments where we treat the NRVM with phenylephrine and either restore KChIP2 with adenovirus or instead treat with miR-34b/c antimirs. We see that with miR-34b/c block, we are unable to effectively restore <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> in rodent cells, but are successful in doing so in human derived cells where Kv4.3 is more dominant. However, when we restore KChIP2 in the NRVM, we are able to restore <i>I<sub>to</sub></i> because KChIP2 can directly stabilize Kv4.2 expression as well. Potential limitations of these distinctions will be especially important when considering the species of animal being investigated and whether or not KChIP2 expression or miR-34b/c activity is being targeted."
