Here, we report our experience of using the MinION, a mobile sequencer, in a 13-week academic course for undergraduate and graduate students. The course consisted of theoretical sessions that presented fundamental topics in genomics and several applied hackathon sessions. In these hackathons, the students used MinION sequencers to generate and analyze their own data and gain hands-on experience in the topics discussed in the theoretical classes. The manuscript describes the structure of our class, the educational material, and the lessons we learned in the process. We hope that the knowledge and material presented here will provide the community with useful tools to help educate future generations of genome scientists."

Here, we report our experience of using the MinION, a mobile sequencer, in a 13-week academic course for undergraduate and graduate students. The course consisted of theoretical sessions that presented fundamental topics in genomics and several applied hackathon sessions. In these hackathons, the students used MinION sequencers to generate and analyze their own data and gain hands-on experience in the topics discussed in the theoretical classes. The manuscript describes the structure of our class, the educational material, and the lessons we learned in the process. We hope that the knowledge and material presented here will provide the community with useful tools to help educate future generations of genome scientists."

Sequencers have become the ultimate tool for a wide range of applications, from prenatal genetic screens and microbe identification to forensic sciences and autopsies. As such, genomics requires interdisciplinary thinking that involves concepts from molecular biology, statistics, computer science, and ethical and societal issues. Previous work has highlighted the benefit of hands-on training to help students put these concepts into context (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altman 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Donovan, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Reisdorph et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Magana et al., 2014</a>). Hands-on training is also the preferred learning style of the Millennial generation, which currently makes up the majority of undergraduate and graduate students. Research has shown that people in this generation are technology focused, work most effectively in groups, and absorb information most efficiently by kinesthetic learning (learning by doing; <a href=\"#bib14\">Shapiro et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Evans et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Linderman et al., 2015</a>)."

In the first hackathon, entitled \u201cfrom snack to sequence\u201d, the students received unlabeled DNA collected from food and supermarket ingredients. They had to use the sequencers to collect the DNA data and devise a pipeline to infer the ingredients. In the second hackathon, called \u201cCSI Columbia\u201d, the students sequenced several human DNA samples without knowing the identity of the samples. The hackathon focused on collecting data from these samples and students were encouraged to try any possible method they could imagine to generate investigative leads."

The identification of bighorn sheep was suspicious, since this animal is not domesticated. Cow is part of the <i>Bovidae</i> family, as are the bighorn and domesticated sheep. The students reasoned that the sample could be from a family member and selected the domesticated sheep as the most likely candidate. A surprising finding was the detection of DNA from the parasites <i>Babesia bigemina, Wuchereria bancrofti</i> and <i>Onchocerca ochengi</i> in the raw beef samples (at least two or more reads per parasite). These findings led to a vivid discussion in the class on food safety. (Note: After reading a previous version of this manuscript on bioRxiv, Steven Salzberg noted that the Genbank sequences of these parasites are likely to be contaminated with cow DNA. Thus, the BLAST matches to these parasites do not conclusively indicate that they were present in the food samples.)"

The aim of this hackathon was to test whether it would possible to use this technique to identify individuals using MinION shotgun sequencing with extremely shallow coverage. We also encouraged the students to test various methods to identify the person, such as examining the mitochondrial haplogroup, the sex of the person, and estimating his or her ancestry.

Interestingly, some of the undergraduate students told us later that this was the first time they were exposed to an open-ended real-world research problem and that this task gave them a better understanding of academic research. The students also suggested that more discussions between the groups during the hackathon could have helped to solve some of the technical problems. This can be done using online communication tools (like Facebook or a Piazza website). Future instructors of this hackathon can circumvent some of the difficulties by restricting the scope of the analysis. For example, instead of instructing the students to generate any possible identity lead, students could be told to focus only on ancestry analysis from shotgun sequencing or sequence specific regions such as the mitochondria for a more structured analysis."

Cloud-based products, such as Dropbox, do not support synchronizing this amount of data with their free accounts. As an alternative, we used the free version of BitTorrent Sync, which allows sharing of files over the P2P BitTorrrent network without a size limit. BitTorrent can be pre-installed on the workstation and can be synchronized with the student\u2019s personal computer by exchanging a folder-specific key. This solution for large files can be set up within a few minutes and prevents technical challenges."

The hackathons seemed to have shaped a more realistic view of the technical challenges inherent to genomic applications. For instance, for the question \u201cHow long do you think it takes from sample preparation to sequencing results using MinION?\u201d, about 70% of the students answered \u2018one hour\u2019 (or less) before the hackathon; but after the hackathon, only 30% of the students thought it would take one hour. After the hackathons, students also thought that it would take more time for mobile sequencers to be used for health tracking by the general public and suggested lower costs for home sequencing applications. Despite discussing the\u00a0ethical implications of DNA analysis quite extensively throughout the course,\u00a0we did not observe changes in the students views on several ethical issues such as \u201cDo you think it is ethical to sequence hair found on the street?\u201d or \u201cDo you think getting your genome sequenced is safe?\u201d These trends suggest that the hackathon mainly shaped the students\u2019 technical understanding and demonstrated the value of hands-on experience as a way of helping them to\u00a0develop realistic views of the challenges of new technologies."

Even though most students were computer science majors, it could be suitable for other majors such as molecular biology\u00a0and pharmacy, and also\u00a0for\u00a0medical school students. We highly recommend instructors of students with limited programming backgrounds to design assignments that use existing data analysis pipelines (such as ONT\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s in my pot\u201d tool). It might also\u00a0be useful to customize the assignments to the major of the students. For example, for biology students, the assignment could focus on taxonomy,\u00a0while medical students could benefit from sequencing microbes that are known to cause disease. We also see the potential of using these devices in high school STEM curricula and enrichment programs. Such activities can expose pupils early in their training to the fascinating world of DNA and serve as an educational springboard to study other disciplines such as math, computer science and chemistry. We hope that the resources and experience outlined in this manuscript will help to facilitate the advent of these programs."
