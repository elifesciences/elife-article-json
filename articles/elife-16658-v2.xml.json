Spatial discrimination of electric fields in anesthetized rats allowed us to compare the pathway-specific field potentials corresponding to the gamma-paced CA3 output (CA1 Schaffer potentials) and CA3 somatic inhibition within and between sides. Bilateral excitatory Schaffer gamma waves are generally larger and lead from the right hemisphere with only moderate covariation of amplitude, and drive CA1 pyramidal units more strongly than unilateral waves. CA3 waves lock to the ipsilateral Schaffer potentials, although bilateral coherence was weak. Notably, Schaffer activity may run laterally, as seen after the disruption of the connecting pathways. Thus, asymmetric operations promote the entrainment of CA3-autonomous gamma oscillators bilaterally, synchronizing lateralized gamma strings to converge optimally on CA1 targets. The findings support the view that interhippocampal connections integrate different aspects of information that flow through the left and right lobes."

Spatial discrimination of electric fields in anesthetized rats allowed us to compare the pathway-specific field potentials corresponding to the gamma-paced CA3 output (CA1 Schaffer potentials) and CA3 somatic inhibition within and between sides. Bilateral excitatory Schaffer gamma waves are generally larger and lead from the right hemisphere with only moderate covariation of amplitude, and drive CA1 pyramidal units more strongly than unilateral waves. CA3 waves lock to the ipsilateral Schaffer potentials, although bilateral coherence was weak. Notably, Schaffer activity may run laterally, as seen after the disruption of the connecting pathways. Thus, asymmetric operations promote the entrainment of CA3-autonomous gamma oscillators bilaterally, synchronizing lateralized gamma strings to converge optimally on CA1 targets. The findings support the view that interhippocampal connections integrate different aspects of information that flow through the left and right lobes."

The recordings made by Benito et al. show that the two hippocampi produce parallel strings of waves, although the waves that originate in the right hemisphere are generally larger than those that originate in the left. Right-hemisphere waves also tend to begin slightly earlier than their left-hemisphere counterparts."

In healthy animals, however, the right-hand dominance acts as a master-slave device, and makes the waves from the two hemispheres pair up and merge in the neurons that receive them both. Thus the information running in both hippocampi can be integrated or compared before sending to the cortex for task execution or storage."

For example, fMRI studies have shown bilateral or lateral activation of the same structures when subject performs different tasks (<a href=\"#bib69\">Smith and Goodale, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lee et al., 2016</a>)."

However, the existence of important bilateral connections between the same and different hippocampal subregions does suggest some degree of integration and cooperation. In rodents, hippocampal lateralization is observed during certain memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib40\">Klur et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Shipton et al., 2014</a>), in the expression of synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kohl et al., 2011</a>), or following environmental enrichment (<a href=\"#bib67\">Shinohara et al., 2013</a>). In the human, such lateralization was reported during sequence disambiguation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kumaran and Maguire, 2006</a>) and in cognitive navigation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Iaria et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Igl\u00f3i et al., 2015</a>). Available data is however limited and it provides no mechanistic insights. Here we have used pathway-specific local field potentials (LFPs) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herreras et al., 2015</a>) in anesthetized rats to study the spontaneous transmission in the bilateral CA3\u2192CA1 Schaffer segment during irregular non-theta EEG states, a pattern that in active animals is associated to sensory input during immobility and consummatory behaviors."

The left and right CA3 are connected reciprocally through the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC), and they also send excitatory inputs to the CA1 on both sides of the brain through an associational (Schaffer)-commissural system that converges on pyramidal cells (PCs, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Hence, this system represents an ideal model to explore the flow of activity and its integration in bilateral networks. In addition, numerous electrophysiological studies show that the CA3 region behaves as a powerful gamma oscillator with inhibitory and excitatory local network components (<a href=\"#bib74\">Traub et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fisahn et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartos et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Csicsvari et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">H\u00e1jos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Oren et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">H\u00e1jos and Paulsen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pietersen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Guly\u00e1s et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mann and Mody, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kohus et al., 2016</a>).

In raw LFPs (black traces), several bands of coherent voltage fluctuations are observed that indicate multiple activation in different synaptic territories (three are outlined by filled ovals spanning the CA1 and the Dentate subfields, while small maroon ovals mark activity in the st. pyramidale of the CA3). The ICA returns the spatially-coherent components and provides readout of the temporal dynamics free of a contribution by the others. A set of components or LFP-generators was obtained per shank, each with a characteristic spatial distribution or voltage weight (V<sub>wt</sub>) that enabled matching between shanks.

We also studied the impact of excitatory bilateral convergence on the output of neurons in the next station, the CA1, by comparing the waveform details of Schaffer gamma waves on both sides and cell firing of CA1 units. To extract the Schaffer and CA3<sub>som</sub> LFP activities from the field contributions added by other concurrent pathways, we applied a spatial discrimination method to multisite linear LFP recordings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herreras et al., 2015</a>). This approach provides unprecedented temporal precision and specification of the origin such that each spatially-isolated activity reflects the envelope of postsynaptic currents elicited by an afferent population on another (<a href=\"#bib50\">Makarova et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mart\u00edn-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schomburg et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib29\">Herreras et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, we previously reported that the Schaffer LFPs contain a regular succession of gamma waves (gamma strings) that reflect excitatory packages of extremely variable amplitude (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2012b</a>), these being elicited in CA1 PCs by the synchronous firing of CA3 PC assemblies at gamma intervals (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fisahn et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">H\u00e1jos and Paulsen, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib72\">Takahashi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2012a</a>).

These form strings of gamma waves that may run unilaterally as seen upon VHC disconnection. In both sides, Schaffer waves may lead at different antero-posterior CA1 locations indistinctly, although they are all submitted to global bilateral asymmetric entrainment that optimizes bilateral convergence in the CA1. This inference is supported by the preferred firing of CA1 pyramidal cells during bilateral waves in contrast to the preferred unilateral driving of putative interneurons."

Here we use the term gamma wave to refer to each pulse-like fluctuation of the LFP repeating at intervals of 20\u201325 ms, i.e. the wavelength of the oscillation, regardless of the duration of individual waves that differ for specific synaptic pathways (see below). Epochs containing layer-specific strings of gamma waves were observed in all hippocampal subregions, but they blend with activities at multiple frequencies and temporal patterns in a variable fashion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Accordingly, the precise time course of individual waves cannot be reasonably assigned to a specific synaptic pathway. By using independent component analysis (ICA) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell and Sejnowski, 1995</a>) to maximize spatially coherent activity, we isolated a small number of pathway-specific LFPs (colored traces) with characteristic spatial voltage weights (V<sub>wt</sub>) that corresponded to a linear sample of the voltage shell produced by each synaptic pathway in the volume (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herreras et al., 2015</a>).

The occurrence and duration of gamma strings was unpredictable, ranging from a few waves to many seconds and they were no further characterized. To test the bilateral complementariness we first compared the time course of Schaffer activity as a whole (containing interspersed gamma strings and irregular fluctuations) in two pairs of left-right homotopic sites of the dorsal hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We found significant wide band coherence between pairs of sites that are 0.5\u2009mm apart within antero-posterior (a-p) lamellar strips. This coherence is reduced and restricted to the gamma band in bilateral comparisons (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Therefore, we quantified the features of individual waves obtained through a deconvolution approach (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1 and 2</a>, and Materials and methods) and compared these between different sites. To avoid noisy LFP events, waves were only considered when they lasted &gt;5 ms and reached &gt;20 \u03bcV. The amplitude, duration and start time of individual Schaffer gamma waves reflect the size and synchronization of CA3 PC assemblies. Waves were designated as paired when they overlapped at two sites by at least 70% of their duration. Despite of a clear amplitude fluctuation at any site, paired waves were nearly identical along lamellar strips in one side (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>; covariance was \u03c1<sub>A</sub> = 0.78 \u00b1 0.02 for the amplitude and \u03c1<sub>D</sub> = 0.63 \u00b1 0.02 for the duration in La:Lp comparison), while they showed less co-variation between homotopic La-Ra sites (\u03c1<sub>A</sub> = 0.5 \u00b1 0.04 and \u03c1<sub>D</sub> = 0.44 \u00b1 0.03; see population statistics in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). The matching waveforms and strong covariation of ipsilateral waves rule out the possibility that the modulation of amplitude over successive waves is due to a different site of origin of the waves and hence, the distance to the electrodes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benito et al., 2014</a>). Rather, it is consistent with a coarse lamellar-like distribution of Schaffer fibers in the CA1 for all waves, regardless of their amplitude.

These observations indicated an independent discharge by left and right CA3 assemblies that project to the anterior or posterior sites of CA1 indistinctly, while the overall lag towards the right-hand side supports a global right-to-left asymmetric entrainment. Such directionality is also supported by the fact that the mean lag from crossed L<sub>p</sub> to R<sub>a</sub> sites (1.13 \u00b1 0.25 ms) was roughly equal to the accumulated lag from right to left plus the lag used by a-p axonal conduction: R<sub>a</sub>\u2192L<sub>a</sub> (0.62 \u00b1 0.14 ms), L<sub>a</sub>\u2192L<sub>p</sub> (0.52 \u00b1 0.1 ms).

We also estimated the shortest possible lag for the direct driving of CA3 to the contralateral CA1 through the latency of the evoked commissural fEPSP in CA1, which amounted 5.8 \u00b1 0.3 ms (n = 7, i.e.: three-fold the L-R lag for spontaneous paired waves).

For waves that were longer in anterior sites the a-p lag increased to 2.6 \u00b1 0.3 and 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 ms in the right and left sides, respectively (R-L: F<sub>(1,12)</sub> = 0.65, p=0.4; total <i>vs.</i> longer R: F<sub>(1,12)</sub> = 102, p&lt;0.001). More notably, when posterior waves were longer they preceded anterior ones by 1.13 \u00b1 0.5 and 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 ms for the R and L sides, respectively (R-L: F<sub>(1,12)</sub> = 1.24, p=0.29; total vs. longer L: F<sub>(1,12)</sub> = 53, p&lt;0.001). Thus the large CA3 PC assemblies initiate firing on any side and location, regardless of the overall bilateral coupling that maintains a global precedence on the right-hand side."

This so-called the CA3<sub>som</sub> generator is known to be part of a gamma pacemaker in this region (<a href=\"#bib74\">Traub et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fisahn et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartos et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Csicsvari et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">H\u00e1jos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Oren et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">H\u00e1jos and Paulsen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pietersen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Guly\u00e1s et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mann and Mody, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kohus et al., 2016</a>).

The data were pooled by side (La-Lp and Ra-Rp: n = 7) or position (La-Ra and Lp-Rp: n = 8), and like the Sch LFPs, the CA3<sub>som</sub> LFPs displayed close-fitting within-side activities, whereas bilateral synchrony was far less marked and mismatches of individual waves were more frequent (unilateral CA3<sub>som</sub> waves: 22 \u00b1 1.2 and 26 \u00b1 2.3% for the L and R sides, respectively; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, La-Lp vs. Lp-Rp traces). Accordingly, the antero-posterior wide band coherence gave significant values for frequencies above 25\u2009Hz in all cases, whilst none gave significant values for bilateral comparisons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, spectral coherence plots). The CCs behaved similarly (a-p: 0.66 \u00b1 0.6; L-R: 0.27 \u00b1 0.02; F<sub>(1,12)</sub> = 32, p&lt;0.001, with a non-significant phase difference between a-p comparisons (\u03c4<sub>max</sub>: 0.1 \u00b1 0.2 ms), but similar to Schaffer activity in R-L comparisons (0.42 \u00b1 0.8 ms). The comparisons between extracted CA3<sub>som</sub> gamma waves yielded similar results as that for Schaffer activity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, the amplitude covariance of bilateral waves was stronger in intra (\u03c1A = 0.62 \u00b1 0.06) than interhippocampal waves (\u03c1A = 0.24 \u00b1 0.04; F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 42, p&lt;0.001), although the amplitude did not differ in the left and right hemispheres (La: 162 \u00b1 26; Ra: 183 \u00b1 28 \u03bcV; (F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 0.32, p=0.58). Also, on average R-waves led by 0.34 \u00b1 0.1 ms (n = 8), and this lag increased to 2.72 \u00b1 0.01 ms when the R-waves were longer (total vs. longer R: F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 297, p&lt;0.001), and longer L-waves also preceded the right-hand ones by 2.28 \u00b1 0.02 ms (total vs. longer L: F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 643, p&lt;0.001;\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), matching the relationships to the Schaffer waves."

                                "text": "Since unilateral Schaffer waves were slightly smaller than bilateral waves, we explored the possibility that increased association of PC firing to bilateral waves was due to stronger ipsilateral input rather than to the bilateral convergence of Schaffer and Commissural inputs. Given the sparseness of cell firing compared to the abundance and amplitude range of gamma waves we devised a global approach by estimating the probability with which spikes emitted by PCs deviate from spikes drawn from a random spike train over the instantaneous power distribution of the Schaffer generator. The typical distribution of the instantaneous power of the Schaffer generator (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) has two regions that follow power laws, <i>ax<sup>k</sup></i>, with different scaling constants (<i>k</i><sub>1</sub> = \u22121.22 for power &lt; 1, and <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> = \u22122.66 for power &gt; 1; to compare between different experiments we scaled the generator power equal to 1 at the critical point). The first region corresponds to noisy dynamics, whereas the second one is associated with rarer but sufficiently strong gamma waves (bi- and unilateral). The mean differential probabilities of PC spikes emitted during unilateral R and L waves (blue and red curves, respectively) or bilateral waves (black curve; data obtained over n = 40 PCs) were plotted (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In both cases the differential probabilities were negative in the noisy regions (power &lt; 1), i.e.: PC firing was unlikely in association with small noisy events. For strong gamma waves (power &gt; 1) bilateral spikes exhibited quite a flat distribution over the wave power. Moreover, the probability was smaller than that for spikes emitted during unilateral gamma waves on the same side. Thus, the coincidence of left-hand and right-hand waves (i.e.: bilateral excitation) plays crucial role in PC firing, while the associated power increase has a marginal effect."

Thus, we explored the role of interhippocampal CA3\u2194CA3 connections by micro-injection of lidocaine in the VHC. Effective disruption was confirmed by the abolition of evoked fEPSPs in the CA1 of both hemispheres following stimulation through the injecting pipette (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). Notably, although Schaffer gamma strings were still observed bilaterally, frequent unilateral strings occurred that were not seen in the controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When they co-occurred we found that the overall power and wave characteristics on either side did not change (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), evidence that each CA3 can autonomously generate gamma in vivo, as reported earlier for chemically-induced gamma oscillations in vitro (<a href=\"#bib59\">Oren et al., 2010</a>). Coarse bilateral co-modulation was maintained, albeit reduced (CC, 0.62 \u00b1 0.03 <i>vs</i> 0.45 \u00b1 0.05; p=0.007; mean of epochs lasting 100\u2009s in n = 4 animals; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u00a0and\u00a0E</a>). Moreover, bilateral gamma coherence was lost (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>) and consequently, the L-R synchrony of individual gamma waves disappeared while the amplitude variability of the waves remained high in both sides (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Thus, we sought here to obtain mechanistic evidence for the bilateral integration of spontaneous activities in the intact animal, focusing on those running through the CA3-CA1 segment of the two hippocampal lobes. By inspection of CA3-originated Schaffer potentials in the CA1, we established that the gamma-paced firing of CA3 PC assemblies is bilaterally entrained in an asymmetric manner, such that the right side commands over the left. Such dominance may serve to expedite and fine-tune a bilateral trade-off of autonomous oscillators on both sides of the hippocampus, as it would optimize the convergence of lateralized excitatory gamma strings on CA1 units. Indeed, CA1 PCs fire better upon bilateral gamma waves and although disruption of the VHC modifies their individual firing rate, the overall PC population output does not vary. These findings support the view that the two lobes of the hippocampus may convey different aspects of information that are cross-checked in the CA3-CA1 segment, although the output to cortical structures probably remains lateralized."

Similar caution should be taken to interpret the lags yielded by the \u03c4<sub>max</sub> from CCs and the phase-difference test, both pointing to a precedence of right-hand over left-hand activities. In a strict sense, the primacy of the right lobe is supported by evidence from the extracted waves, which can be considered discrete events independent from each other: (a) the mean lag between paired bilateral waves shows quantitative advance on the right-hand side (around 0.6\u20130.8 ms); (b) The mean amplitude of Schaffer waves was 30% larger on the right-hand side; (c) CA3<sub>som</sub> waves showed a similar advance on the right-hand side; (d) The cumulated lag in crossed comparisons, either summed (Lp-Ra) or balanced (La-Rp), in consonance with the partial lags between a-p and R-L sites.

Since the fate of a Schaffer wave is to excite CA1 units where it integrates with input from the contralateral side it is crucial to optimize the temporal overlap of the respective excitatory envelopes. Therefore, the short mean lag between paired bilateral waves indicates that the system is so finely adjusted (see functional implications below). However, in terms of connectivity it appears too small lag to consider unilateral CA3 assemblies driving Schaffer waves on the opposite side to be a general mechanism. Yet, since waves may lead on either side, the mean bilateral lag is to a large extent balanced. Subgroups of longer left or right waves do present longer mean lags (1.5 and 3.2 ms). Nevertheless, the minimum time required for CA3 spikes to reach contralateral CA3 PCs is 2.5 ms, which when added to the time required for synaptic integration and assembly recruitment is insufficient to explain the lag in the majority of paired waves. Such view might change depending on how PC assemblies are recruited. For instance if PC assemblies are recruited through the so-called leader PC cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fujisawa et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wittner and Miles, 2007</a>), the driving factor between such cells may require shorter lags. On the other hand, a direct contralateral driving of gamma waves in the CA1 via commissural fibers is less likely for several reasons: (a) the minimum lag of commissural evoked potentials is already in the higher range of the lags between spontaneous bilateral waves; (b) the commissural pathway contributes little to field potentials due to anatomical and geometrical factors (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mart\u00edn-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2015</a>), making gamma waves of such origin unlikely; (c) the presence of unilateral waves coincides on the same idea, i.e., since a CA3 assembly may initiate a Schaffer wave that has no contralateral counterpart, when contralateral waves appear they most likely have an ipsilateral origin; (d) finally, the disruption of the VHC, or the unilateral inactivation of the CA3 would markedly reduce the presence of Schaffer waves and dampen the mean power of the Schaffer generator, which does not happen. Therefore, although unilateral CA3 assemblies driving contralateral ones cannot be ruled out entirely, the most likely origin is an independent ipsilateral driving."

The CA3 assemblies elicit ipsilateral Schaffer waves that are matched by near synchronous waves on the other side at roughly homotopic sites (i.e.: bilateral waves <i>a-h, b-g</i>).

Very few assemblies projecting to a given CA1 domain overlap in the same cycle. For example, domain <i>d</i> receives two ipsilateral Schaffer waves (in cyan and dark green) and a contralateral (unseen) wave (in orange).

Such long delays may indicate independent ignition of CA3 assemblies whose projection to CA1 may follow either lamellar or longitudinal topologies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 1994</a>), while the lead on anterior or posterior sites appears to reproduce the different septotemporal CA1 projections of the CA3 subzones (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ishizuka et al., 1990</a>). We also reported previously that Schaffer coherence decreases rapidly over the septo-temporal axis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benito et al., 2014</a>). The emerging view (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) is that once every gamma cycle a collection of spatial modules of the CA1 dendritic space is activated over the septo-temporal axis by multiple independent CA3 assemblies with either a dominant lamellar or longitudinal projection, converging with others entering from the contralateral side. Such complex modular bilateral mating requires precise intra and interhippocampal control of their timings to achieve efficient global orchestration. There is insufficient data available to draw a more complete picture, and obtaining such information requires simultaneous recording over more CA1 and CA3 sites than was performed here, and additional techniques to monitor the spontaneous activity of other subpopulations not accessible from LFPs. Nevertheless, some roles of local inhibitory networks can be derived from present CA3<sub>som</sub> data and the available literature."

For instance, the bilateral coherence between right and left CA3<sub>som</sub> activities, and the covariation of paired waves, is very small. Instead, the CA3<sub>som</sub> gamma wavelets are tightly locked to ipsilateral Schaffer waves. The results obtained with the phase-difference test indicate a preferred CA3<sub>som</sub> to Schaffer direction, possibly distorted by the frequent mismatch of waves and shorter duration of CA3<sub>som</sub> waves. The lag between paired waves is a more realistic estimation, and it determines that the two initiate nearly simultaneously, as seen in evoked potentials. We should have in account that the Schaffer waves are detected in CA1 recordings ~2\u20133 ms after CA3 PCs fire, a lag that is fully compatible with CA3<sub>som</sub> waves arising from basket cell-mediated recurrent inhibition following the same PC firing (<a href=\"#bib34\">H\u00e1jos et al., 2004</a>). All these findings support a main participation of the CA3<sub>som</sub> activity in ipsilateral mechanisms, as also indicated by the large ipsilateral coherence and the nearly synchronous occurrence of waves at anterior and posterior sites. This latter feature is consistent with the reported coupling of activity in subnetworks of inhibitory cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib73\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 2000</a>), which provides modulation of CA3 output over extended domains.

However, the strikingly poor covariation between CA3<sub>som</sub> and Schaffer waves does not appear to be in consonance with this view. Another possibility is that multiple CA3 assemblies share a common domain, since nearby PC cells rarely fire together (<a href=\"#bib72\">Takahashi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Matsumoto et al., 2013</a>). Thus they would deliver Schaffer waves of similar spatial coverage in CA1. It is also compatible with the finding that Schaffer and CA3<sub>som</sub> waves have a tight covariation in a longer time scale. A possible explanation of this is that both CA3 PCs and basket cells receive a common tonic input (<a href=\"#bib25\">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freund and Katona, 2007</a>) that codes for the duration of the gamma strings and intermissions, possibly as an energy-saving mechanism to stop the intrinsic oscillators in absence of activity and when bilateral entrainment is unnecessary."

Indeed, the optimal use of these chunks would be to meet other inputs at precise times. One of these is the contralateral homonymous input with which it maintains tight covariation in some gamma strings but not in others, albeit always in phase. This observation already indicates that in some epochs the information conveyed is similar on both sides and it differs in others, which is also supported by the bilateral out-phasing of gamma waves and the occurrence of some unilateral gamma strings upon VHC disruption."

Similar population balance of unitary changes has been reported following long-term synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Martin and Shapiro, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dragoi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yun et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib18\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Ruiz et al., 2012b</a>). In the context of bilateral integration, we may then infer that the two CA3-originated excitations summed in CA1 units do not operate as a simple integrator, but rather the output is defined on a single cell basis in concert with other inputs, such as that from inhibitory neurons that are also modulated by interhippocampal disruption. The rather disperse firing of PCs over the gamma cycle, in clear contrast to the phase-locked firing of putative interneurons, supports this concept. Such dispersion may arise from the slower dynamics of intracellular EPSPs compared to EPSCs (reflected in extracellular field waves), and/or the variable influence of different interneuron subtypes with distinct phase coupling to gamma waves (<a href=\"#bib34\">H\u00e1jos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tukker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Vinck et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Varga et al., 2014</a>). Indeed some interneurons can be envisaged as timing devices for different inputs to converge at optimal instants. In turn, the gamma-phase shifting of CA1-PCs is in contrast with the tight gamma coupling of CA3-PCs (<a href=\"#bib34\">H\u00e1jos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2012a</a>), indicating a short-lived gamma pattern restricted to this segment of the hippocampal circuit.

The dominance of the right side of the CA3 may thus constitute a physiological mechanism to provide a fast dynamic trade-off between left and right CA3 gamma oscillators for the fast bilateral synchronization and stabilization of the entrainment of autonomous CA3 gamma oscillators despite of the strong amplitude variability of individual waves. Overall, the present observations are compatible with the hypothesis that the main functional role for CA3 gamma oscillations is their bilateral entrainment, rather than transmitting gamma activity to the cortex."

                                "text": "It is important to differentiate between asymmetric connectivity and lateralized routing of information. The larger Schaffer waves in the right-hand side may reflect left-right asymmetry in the subunit composition of Glutamate receptors reported in the CA1 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kawakami et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Shinohara et al., 2008</a>), although a larger size of CA3 assemblies on the right-hand side cannot be excluded. In addition, right dominance better fits a hardware-like role to promote the integration of lateralized streams of information, but we cannot rule the priority or the qualitative relevance of that running through the left and right circuits during specific tasks (<a href=\"#bib40\">Klur et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shinohara et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib68\">Shipton et al., 2014</a>). Different hippocampal subregions are known to be differentially involved in the encoding and consolidation/retrieval of spatial information (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jerman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hunsaker et al., 2008</a>), or in perceived versus reconstructed scenes (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zeidman et al., 2015</a>). Also, spatial and non-spatial information converge in the hippocampus to form episodic memories (<a href=\"#bib47\">Leutgeb et al., 2004</a>), although functional difference between hemispheres has rarely been invoked. A significant finding is that both CA3 are required for short-term memory, yet only inactivation of the left CA3 impairs performance in an associative spatial long-term memory task and plasticity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Shipton et al., 2014</a>). Along with the present observations of independent gamma strings upon VHC blockade, it becomes clear that the left and right sides do not convey equivalent information. Whether lateralization is devoted to different sensory modalities, to features of a scene, or to the perceived/recalled nature remains unknown."

How these events are coded at the cellular level is a matter of intense study, although experimental evidence that is largely based on unitary studies is hard to unite in a single framework. Based on the assembly code of CA3-transmitted activity, one interesting possibility is that groups of CA3 assemblies distributed over the septotemporal axis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benito et al., 2014</a>) sequentially code the relevant features of a scene in a gamma string, which are checked against each other bilaterally to form higher order features and to modulate parallel or lateralized output to the cortex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ciocchi et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The simplicity of this mechanism makes likely that it subserves bilateral assemblage of lateralized activity in other brain structures."

In experiments aimed at exploring the inter- and intrahippocampal Schaffer gamma (n = 7 animals) one or two concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes were placed in the soma layer of the CA3b region in the left or in both hemispheres for orthodromic activation of the CA1 (AP 2.9; L \u00b1 2.6; V 3.4\u2009mm from Bregma and cortical surface). Recordings were obtained from a total of 64 sites by two twin-shank linear probes (16 channels per shank, 100\u2009\u03bcm intersite distance: Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI) that were located at homotopic sites of the dorsal hippocampus across the CA1 region and that also spanned the DG/CA3 (AP 4\u20134.5; L \u00b1 2.6\u2009mm) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

The probes were soaked in DiI (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) before insertion for postmortem evaluation of their placement in histological sections.

To this end in another group of experiments (n = 4) we used the selective blockade of the CA3 itself on the left-hand side, sparing the circuitry on the right-hand side. Larger microdrops (0.1\u20130.2 \u00b5l) of lidocaine were injected into the septal pole of the left CA3 through a 200 \u00b5m wide silica cannula inserted into the cannula of the concentric stimulating electrode along with the inner wire, connected through a plastic tube to a 5 \u00b5l Hamilton syringe. Admittedly, the disruption of the interhippocampal communication through the VHC may not be complete since fibers originating in dorso-caudal CA3 sites running into the fimbria (<a href=\"#bib45\">Laurberg, 1979</a>)\u00a0are spared by the injection. The extension of the drug was monitored by the modulation of evoked potentials elicited by the ipsi- and/or contralateral CA3, whose fibers pass above the injection site on their way from the fimbria to the CA1. Typically 1 or 2 injections were sufficient to ensure complete blockade of ipsilateral CA1 fEPSPs that was stable for at least 10\u2009min. For longer drug action, successive microdrops were injected at 5\u2009min intervals, resulting in reasonable stability as witnessed by the selective steady effect on ipsilateral CA1 fEPSPs. Although evoked activity began to recover 15\u201330\u2009min after injection, we noted that hippocampal LFP activity displayed abnormal interregional patterns for long periods (&gt;60\u201390\u2009min).

Only pathway-specific LFPs have unique time dynamics that can be interpreted as a postsynaptic convolution of the spike output in a homogeneous upstream population (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herreras et al., 2015</a>). However, due to the far reach of field potentials from currents sources, the features of individual events recorded at a single site contain a mixed voltage contribution from several sources and cannot be safely assigned to a specific pathway. To obtain the precise temporal dynamics of CA3 PC output we used the Schaffer LFP activity in CA1 of each side. Other field potential contributions added by local or remote co-activated pathways were removed using the ICA (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herreras et al., 2015</a>) assuming spatial constancy of the electrical fields created by the synaptic inputs. The pathway-specificity of the so obtained CA3 Schaffer input to CA1 has been already verified (<a href=\"#bib43\">Korovaichuk et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2012a</a>).

In this study we employed the kernel density ICA algorithm (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen, 2006</a>), customarily implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks). Normally few LFP-generators (four\u00a0to\u00a0seven) exhibited significant variance and distinct spatial distributions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), which permits further optimization by pre-processing the LFPs prior to performing the ICA through dimension reduction using the principal component analysis (PCA). This approach efficiently diminishes the presence of noisy weak generators. The PCA also stabilizes and accelerates the subsequent convergence of the ICA. This analysis can be performed with our LFP-sources software, freely available at <a href=\"http://www.mat.ucm.es/~vmakarov/downloads.php\">http://www.mat.ucm.es/~vmakarov/downloads.php</a>. Given the small variance contributed by the Schaffer or CA3<sub>som</sub> LFPs to CA1/DG profiles (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mart\u00edn-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2015</a>) the optimal separation may require different strategies as to the selection of recordings channels making up the data matrix, depending on the features of the spatial gradients captured by the linear arrays (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We earlier showed that the separation of blended sources that share a high percentage of co-varying time-points (e.g, a high content of phase-locked gamma waves in both) benefits from channel selection, otherwise it is not necessary (<a href=\"#bib50\">Makarova et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mart\u00edn-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2015</a>).

We applied the Hilbert transform to left and right Schaffer activities (implemented in Matlab) and we evaluated the phase dynamics of both generators, <i>\u03d5<sub>L</sub>(t)</i> and <i>\u03d5<sub>R</sub>(t)</i>. We then found time instants <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> of zero crossing from above of the phase of the R generator (i.e., <i>\u03d5<sub>R</sub>(t<sub>i</sub>)=0</i> and <i>\u03d5\u2019<sub>R</sub>(t<sub>i</sub>)&lt;0</i>). Such time instants correspond to the beginnings of negative pulses (fEPSPs) in the R Schaffer. Finally, for these time instants we found the phases in the left Schaffer generator,\u00a0{<i>\u03d5<sub>L</sub>(t<sub>i</sub>)</i>}. If there is indeed a time lag between the right and left sides, then the distribution of these phases plotted in a probability distribution histogram (PDH) should have a statistically significant peak at positive phase values. Since phases are defined in a circle, to test the statistical significance of the peak and to evaluate the mean value of the phase difference we employed the circular statistics toolbox for Matlab (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berens, 2009</a>). Then the time lag was calculated by evaluating the ratio of the phase lag over the mean circular frequency of the L generator."

Hence, for the Schaffer activity, the time course <i>s(t)</i> is produced by spatiotemporal summation of excitatory currents elicited in CA1 PCs by CA3 inputs alone, while the CA3<sub>som</sub> generator results from summation of inhibitory currents at CA3 somata and proximal dendrites. In the latter the mean duration of waves was significantly shorter than the cycle period, thus the baseline was readily recovered and the start time of individual waves easily determined. However, the longer duration of Schaffer waves promotes unknown overlap amongst successive waves in a gamma string that hampers accurate determination of start and end times. Even slow envelopes can also be seen that may have an alternative origin in the asynchronous input from origin cells firing out of the gamma-organized assemblies. We noticed two possible sources of error. On the one hand, the method uses an interpolated baseline for overlapped waves that bias amplitude and duration towards smaller waves (these are estimated larger and longer than they in fact are: note the apparent amplitude equalization between the raw and model waves). On the other hand, the gamma waves were fitted to \u03b1-function waveforms that disproportionately overestimate the tail. To lessen the impact of these possible errors, we adjusted the duration of the numerically fitted waves using a reduction factor obtained in each experiment from 50 waves chosen randomly (0.7\u20130.8 for Schaffer and 0.4\u20130.5 for CA3<sub>som</sub>). Yet, since the bulk of results shown in this study are based on the start times of paired waves that are barely affected by the chosen baseline, the main conclusions hold whatever buildup for the baseline is considered."

For each recording, the time line was divided into four types of time-windows according to the presence of gamma waves induced by the left or right Schaffer generators: (1) None, i.e.: no gamma waves on any side; (2) R, i.e.: a wave is present on the right side only; (3) L, i.e.: wave is present on the left side only; and (4) Bilateral, i.e.: gamma waves on both sides. Then each spike in a spike train falls into one of these classes of time-windows. For each spike train we calculated the number of spikes of different classes {<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>q</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>q</i><sub>3</sub>,<i>q</i><sub>4</sub>} and we evaluated the ratios of the total length of the four classes of time-windows to the recording time {<i>r</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>r</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>r</i><sub>3</sub>,<i>r</i><sub>4</sub>}. For statistical inference, as a model of a random spike train (i.e.: not dependent on field potentials) we used a train generated from an independent Poisson distribution. For such a train the number of spikes falling inside time-windows of the <i>i</i>-th type follows binomial statistics <i>Y<sub>i</sub> ~ Bin(n,r<sub>i</sub>)</i>. Therefore, we can establish the confidence limits for the number of spikes of a random spike train <math id=\"inf27\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo>\u00b1</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mrow><mn>0.95</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><msqrt><mi>n</mi><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2212</mo><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></msqrt></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>, where <i>\u03bb<sub>0.95</sub></i> is given by the normal distribution. If <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> exceeds these limits, then we can conclude that the number of spikes of the given class in the train cannot be explained by mere coincidence."

Then, any random spike train will have the same distribution of spikes over the power of the LFP-generator, since it will represent a random sampling from <i>p(t</i>). Therefore, for a given spike train {<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>} of a pyramidal cell, we evaluated its power distribution from the sample {<i>p(t<sub>i</sub></i>)} and then subtracted the baseline distribution <i>f(p</i>) corresponding to a random train. The differential distribution obtained describes the deviation of the given spike train from a random one. Positive values indicate a higher firing rate at the corresponding power of the LFP-generator, while a negative differential distribution points to less frequent PC firing relative to a random train."

For spikes of the first three classes we evaluated the differential power distributions.

These data fit to previous investigations showing lateralized gene expression, spine size, and synaptic plasticity. \u0393 activity is very synchronous between the two CA3 areas due to their tight mutual coupling whereas a \u03b3 phase shift was observed in CA1. Principal cell activity in CA1 is associated with bilateral \u03b3 waves whereas interneuron activity was associated to unilateral \u03b3 patterns. These findings were considered by the reviewing editor and the two reviewers as potentially very important based on detailed state-of-the-art analysis of local field events. However, some concerns emerged during the discussion among the reviewing editor and the two reviewers which need to be considered by the authors during the revision phase:"

In particular, certain essential terms like '\u03b3 strings' and '\u03b3 waves' have not been quantitatively defined. It would be an advantage if the authors could define each term quantitatively (e.g. what frequency and amplitude criteria were used to identify \u03b3 waves, and how long would a sequence of \u03b3 waves need to be in order to be termed a string?). It is unclear why the authors choose one term over another. For example, what is the difference between a '\u03b3 event' and a '\u03b3 wave', or between a 'string' and a 'thread'?"

It would be an advantage if the authors could define each term quantitatively (e.g. what frequency and amplitude criteria were used to identify \u03b3 waves, and how long would a sequence of \u03b3 waves need to be in order to be termed a string?). It is unclear why the authors choose one term over another. For example, what is the difference between a '\u03b3 event' and a '\u03b3 wave', or between a 'string' and a 'thread'?</i> "
