Using brain imaging, Tsetsos et al. found that one of the two brain regions (called the dorsal ACC for short) was involved in weighing up the cost of rejecting an offer, but not accepting it. The other region (called the rostromedial prefrontal cortex or rmPFC) was involved in assessing the value of an offer only when the participant decided to defer making a decision, and not when they decided to commit."

Laboratory-based tasks have investigated reward-guided decision-making by requiring successive, independent choices to be made in pursuit of a primary reinforcer (e.g., juice) or a flexible resource (e.g., money). For example, on each trial participants might be asked to choose between one of two abstract symbols to obtain a variable monetary reward (<a href=\"#bib8\">Daw et al., 2006</a>), or decide which of two snacks they would like to eat upon completion of the experiment (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lim et al., 2011</a>). In these tasks, decisions are often characterised by stereotyped biases that hinder outcome maximisation, including a tendency to weight losses more heavily than gains (loss aversion) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tversky and Kahneman, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tom et al., 2007</a>), or an undue preference for an already endowed or \u2018default\u2019 option (status quo bias) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kahneman et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">De Martino et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>).

These decisions depend on the momentary utility of a stimulus, that is, the reward that would accrue if that stimulus were to be consumed or disbursed all at once, whether immediately or (as in inter-temporal choice) after a delay (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</a>). However, many (perhaps most) economic behaviours are not well captured by this paradigm, because rather than involving successive, independent choices, they require <i>investment</i>\u2014that is, long-term commitment to a prospect in anticipation of sustained economic return, and with penalties incurred by any future change of mind. For example, the benefits of choosing the right employment could persist for many years into the future, whereas a poor decision about which mobile telephone to purchase might cause frustration for several months. Other decisions reverse a previous commitment, for example when deciding to sell stock options or to end a failing relationship. In these types of decision, which we refer to as economic \u2018commitments\u2019, prospects are irreversibly \u2018ruled in\u2019 (i.e., by acceptance) or \u2018ruled out\u2019 (i.e., by rejection) of a portfolio of assets that yield sustained positive or negative return to the individual. Unlike the choices made in most current lab-based approaches, economic commitments are not independent: a decision made at a time <i>t</i> continues to contribute to economic return at a later time <i>t</i> + 1, and may influence other choices made at that time. The aim of the current work was to understand the computational mechanisms by which economic commitments are made in humans, and to investigate their neural implementation in the reward circuitry of the medial prefrontal cortex."

For example, a university student might decide to opt for a course after attending an interesting first seminar (acceptance, or \u2018ruling in\u2019); or she might decide to wait until after a second seminar to make a commitment. Equally, the student might decide to drop a course after attending a particularly boring lecture (rejection, or \u2018ruling out\u2019); or she might give the lecturer another chance, and defer the decision until later. In other words, many behaviours involve choosing between either acceptance and deferral, or rejection and deferral. The notion that deliberation incurs a dual demand associated with selection (what to decide, either option A or B) and commitment (when to decide, either now or later) has received detailed consideration in psychophysical studies, in particular via the modelling of reaction time distributions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>). However, studies requiring fast category judgments make it hard to disentangle the mechanisms determining what to decide and when to commit. In description-based judgment tasks, framing a choice as \u2018accept\u2019 or \u2018reject\u2019 provokes well-described biases in choice behavior (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tversky and Kahneman, 1981</a>). However, the issue of how commitments to prospects are made by acceptance or rejection has received less attention in the domain of neuroeconomics (<a href=\"#bib15\">Furl and Averbeck, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gluth et al., 2012</a>)."

This may be because dACC preferentially responds to decision entropy or conflict (<a href=\"#bib6\">Botvinick et al., 1999</a>), or alternatively because it encodes the value of disengaging from a current or default state to explore a novel course of action (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kolling et al., 2012</a>). In either case however, it remains unknown whether this value difference coding depends on whether stimuli are accepted or rejected, because when deciding between two prospects, an option may be chosen either because it was preferred, or because the alternative was dispreferred. Moreover, it remains unknown how value encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex depends on whether decisions involve economic commitment or not."

In half of the blocks, participants had to choose between accepting (<i>inclusion by commitment</i>) and deferring acceptance of a prospect (<i>exclusion by deferral</i>). In the other half of the blocks, participants chose between rejecting (<i>exclusion by commitment</i>) and deferring rejection (<i>inclusion by deferral</i>). Therefore, preference for a bandit would be implied by commitment in rule-in and deferral in rule-out. Our task, thus, allowed us to probe value encoding in the prefrontal cortex as a function of whether a stimulus was preferred (i.e., included or excluded) and whether commitment was made now or deferred until later. Further, the task captured many aspects of economic decisions in the real world: uncertainty about the true value of a prospect, sustained yield accruing from the investment, economic benefit determined collectively by current assets, and the need to trade-off exploration and exploitation."

The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded value when a prospect was excluded (not included) while the rmPFC encoded value only during deferral (not commitment). Furthermore, joint consideration of the behavioural data and the dACC activity allowed us to pinpoint two pressures that shaped decisions in the task: a bias to defer until a later date, and a bias to weight unfavourable (excluded) options more heavily. Although similar biases typically hinder reward harvesting in standard tasks, for our ecologically valid setting we show that they actually allow participants to perform closer to a reward-maximizing agent."

On each trial, each spiral of length <i>s</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> was drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean <i>v</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> that remained unchanged for that bandit during a block of 12 trials (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). On each trial of a given block, a virtual <i>pool of assets</i> contained the preferred bandits thus far. The contents of the asset pool were converted to monetary reward, as we describe below. Each bandit yielded a monetary <i>payoff</i> (<i>\u03bc</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) determined by the rank of its mean <i>v</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> relative to the mean of all four bandits in the block (longer spirals were associated with greater payoff). After viewing the spiral participants chose whether to <i>commit</i> to that bandit, or to <i>defer</i>. Critically, commitment engendered a sustained alteration in the per-trial economic yield, in a manner that varied according to <i>rule type</i> (\u2018rule-in\u2019 vs \u2018rule-out\u2019). On rule-in blocks, participants began the block with an empty pool of assets and the per-trial momentary yield was determined by the average payoff of all bandits committed to (<i>accepted</i>) thus far (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>: upper panel and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). On rule-out blocks, participants' asset pool initially included all four alternatives and the per-trial yield was the average of the payoff of all bandits not yet committed to (not yet <i>rejected</i>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>: lower panel). The total yield at the end of a block was the sum of the per-trial yields (see example in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Per-block yield was converted to a real financial incentive via a lottery procedure at the end of each run of the experiment."

We were thus surprised to find that no voxels in this region varied inversely with the three-way interaction between rule, decision and value (i.e., encoded decision x value inversely under the two rules). Thus, we searched across the brain for voxels that correlated with value on defer and commit trials separately (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Whereas no voxels responded to the rule x value interaction on commit trials (right panel), a prominent cluster in rmPFC was sensitive to the interaction of rule and value when participants made deferral choices (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, left panel; peak at \u22122, 56, 18; rule x value interaction on defer trials: <i>t</i><sub>(19)</sub> = 5.47, p &lt; 0.00003; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In this region, value encoding on defer trials differed from zero on rule-in (<i>t</i><sub>(19)</sub> = 5.21, p &lt; 0.0001) and rule-out (<i>t</i><sub>(19)</sub> = 3.41, p &lt; 0.002) blocks, but failed to diverge from zero when commitments were made for either rule-in (p = 0.13) or rule-out (p = 0.07) blocks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). A statistically indistinguishable pattern of activity was observed more ventrally in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (BA 10), a region that has been labeled arMFC or vmPFC (rule x value interaction on defer trials: peak \u22122, 52, \u221210; <i>t</i><sub>(19)</sub> = 4.85, p &lt; 0.00006) and where activity typically correlates the expected value during independent choices (<a href=\"#bib34\">O\u2019Doherty et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Plassmann et al., 2007</a>). This sensitivity to value during deliberation but not at commitment in the rmPFC is reminiscent of single neurons in the parietal cortex that parametrically encode confidence about sensory signals but drop off precipitously at the choice point (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</a>)."

Here, we devised a task in which decisions involved commitment to an asset with enduring financial consequences. Whereas previous tasks have sought to mimic the experience of a gambler choosing which one-armed bandit has the highest yield, our experiment captures that of a consumer deciding to sell an ageing car or of an animal electing whether to accept a prospective mate. This approach thus allowed us to model the factors that drive everyday economic commitments, and to measure how brain activity differed when commitments were made relative to when they were deferred to a later time."

By contrast, the rmPFC encoded value differentially along the latter axis, covarying with value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, and not at the point of commitment."

BOLD activity in this region resembles firing rates of \u2018integration\u2019 neurons that build up to the point of choice and then falls away (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</a>). The wider function of the rmPFC in humans may be to integrate value across time and assets, potentially to calculate the value of prospective states or investments.

Empirically observed criteria for ruling-in and ruling-out differed, allowing the same offer to be both perceived as both \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019, depending on the framing of the task. Similar preference reversals due to violations of the rational principle of description-invariance have been previously described in one-shot multi-attribute choices (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shafir, 1993</a>). However, in our ecologically valid task, this misalignment of the criteria for acceptance and rejection is the policy that maximises reward. Intuitively, this asymmetry reflects a default bias towards deferring commitments, and the fact that this bias shifts the criterion in opposite directions in rule-in and rule-out. To revert to a consumer example, when purchasing a house one may wish to begin with a critical eye (stringent criterion), not accepting impulsively any one property before obtaining an overview of the market and its options; but when selling a house, one might wish to be less critical (less stringent criterion) so as not to reject early offers before enough information is collected. Our finding thus provides an adaptive explanation for violations of description invariance, or preference reversal due to \u2018framing effects\u2019 in economic choice tasks (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shafir, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">De Martino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsetsos et al., 2012</a>)."

In other words, the dACC is a good candidate for encoding the two biases observed in behavioural data: an overall (additive) proneness to defer, and a heightened gain of encoding value when participants dispreferred a prospect. BOLD signals may have been higher for commit than defer because participants had a higher threshold for commit decisions, leading to greater deliberation and more overall decision-related activity on these trials, consistent with prolonged reaction times observed for commit than defer decisions. We thus speculate that the two key decision biases described here on choice can be accounted for with discrete additive (deferral bias; e.g., biasing the deferral threshold) and multiplicative (exclusion proneness; e.g., modulating the rate of accumulation for negative values) parameters under mechanistic models of choice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</a>), and that the dACC may implement these biases in our task.

BOLD signals in the rmPFC and dACC both correlate with the relative value of two prospects under consideration, but do so with opposite sign, which has led researchers to puzzle over their unique contributions to decision-making. Some theories have proposed that rmPFC and dACC encode the value of stimuli and actions respectively (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rudebeck et al., 2008</a>), or the value and saliency of stimuli (<a href=\"#bib31\">Litt et al., 2011</a>), or the value of choosing a food item relative to that of foraging elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kolling et al., 2012</a>).

On each trial (<i>t</i>), they viewed a spiral of variable length (<i>s</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<i>t</i>)) that appeared in one (<i>i</i>) of four pink or blue boxes (\u2018bandits\u2019), placed in the four quadrants of the screen. Bandits were randomly assigned the following four <i>payoffs</i> (<i>\u03bc</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>):\u00a315/24, \u00a35/24, \u2212\u00a35/25, \u2212\u00a315/24 corresponding to the symbols <i>H(high), L(low), \u2212L, \u2212H</i> in the figures. Although payoffs were fixed, the mapping from payoff to the nominal mean spiral length changed block-by-block, so that bandit payoff was relative to the other spiral lengths observed in any given block. Each bandit\u2019s spiral length was drawn from a normal distribution <i>N</i>(<i>v</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) where <i>v</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> was related ordinally to the payoff <i>\u03bc</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> of the <i>i</i>th bandit, and <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> stood for the standard deviation of the distribution. There were six possible mean spiral lengths,<i>v</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, in the experiment: 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and 5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Splitting these six means into contiguous groups of four resulted in three different <i>context types</i>, presented in pseudorandom order: (a) \u2018short\u2019 blocks comprised of bandits with mean lengths (from least to most valuable) of 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0, (b) \u2018medium\u2019 blocks with bandits with spiral length means 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5, and (c) \u2018long\u2019 blocks with bandits with spiral length means 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0. Additionally, on each trial, two of the bandits had a standard deviation of 0.5 while the other two had a standard deviation of 1.0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Since the only determinant of a bandit\u2019s payoff, <i>\u03bc</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, was the rank of its mean length within the block context, the bandit whose spirals had mean length <i>v</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 4.0 would be second in rank and be worth <i>\u03bc</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = \u00a35/24 (<i>L</i>) in a \u2018short\u2019 block and would rank third, yielding <i>\u03bc</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = \u2212\u00a35/24 (\u2212<i>L</i>) in a \u2018long\u2019 block. This approach precluded fixed strategies such as accepting or rejecting all bandits below or above a single spiral length. The presentation order of the blocks was pseudo-randomized such that there where 4 blocks of each length type within a scanner run (12 blocks per run)."

These variables varied across two features: (a) <i>integration</i> or computation of the <i>absolute value</i> of a bandit through averaging the spiral lengths presented thus far for that bandit and (b) <i>anchoring</i> of the absolute value (integrated or not) for each bandit to a reference value that represents the value of the other bandits in the block. For any given variable, integration (averaging) was either present or absent. Absence of integration means considering the momentary length presented at a bandit while ignoring all previous spirals encountered before at the same bandit. Anchoring could be omitted (\u2018absolute\u2019 DV) or manifest itself by means of subtracting an implicit reference value from the absolute value of a given bandit. The reference value (<i>r</i>) changes trial-by-trial as new information is presented. Thus, at trial <i>t</i>, <i>r</i>(<i>t</i>) could be the absolute value (integrated or not) of the temporally previous bandit, the absolute value of the next-best bandit, or the average of the absolute values of all bandits in the block. For DV\u2019s that involved anchoring the reference on the very first trial of a block was set to <i>v</i><sub><i>prior</i></sub> = 3.75, which reflected the mean spiral length in the experiment given the distributions in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. The formulas associated with each DV are given at <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>.

Images were resampled to 4 mm cubic voxels and spatially smoothed with a 8 mm full width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. A 128 s temporal high-pass filter was applied in order to exclude low-frequency artifacts. Temporal correlations were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood estimates of variance components using a first-order autoregressive model. The resulting nonsphericity was used to form maximum likelihood estimates of the activations. Importantly, SPM8 orthogonalises sequentially-entered regressors in the design matrix, but we ensured that this option was turned off for all analyses.

To do that right they ought to consider, at the least, the main competitors to the DDM: The Cisek Model and the Stuphorn Model, also they might consider Usher-Mclelland. And of course if they want to do a really good job they should include a normative benchmark like the Beck/Ma/Pouget Bayesian modelling process.

As the authors point out, the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying decisions involving long-term commitments and interrelated choices are largely unknown and understudied. The authors have designed a novel and suitable decision paradigm in which to examine this type of choice. Moreover, their use of computational modeling methods at the behavioral level and the integration of those computationally defined parameters and values into the neuroimaging analysis yields results at both the descriptive and mechanistic levels. In general, the work is great and I think it will be quite influential in the field. There are a few puzzling aspects of the results, especially with regards to the specificity of value (DVcur-DVave) representations in the brain for different contexts and choice types. Puzzling results are not at all bad, quite the opposite as they often promote better understanding. However, there is one straightforward analysis that the authors have not presented in the paper, but could readily apply to the current data, and may be relevant to this issue. I outline this analysis and present two minor points below."

This is a perfectly reasonable definition of value and numerous fMRI papers have reported that such a difference term is reflected in mPFC, PCC, or striatal BOLD signals. However, there are also a number of fMRI (e.g. <a href=\"#bib38\">Plassman et al., 2007</a>; Wunderlich et al., 2009) and single unit recording papers (e.g. <a href=\"#bib35\">Padoa-Schioppa &amp; Assad 2006</a>) that describe BOLD activity or firing rates as correlating with offer or chosen values rather than or in addition to difference values. Therefore, I wonder whether there might be regions in the brain that represent DVcur as opposed to DVcur-DVave and whether those regions also show choice and context specificity? Although testing this idea would require a small amount of additional work, I believe either positive findings or null results will provide a basis for a more complete interpretation of the currently reported results."

The work is elegant and uses a sophisticated approach that combines modelling with neuroimaging data to address an important issue in decision theory (i.e. commitment vs. deferral). I am already familiar with this paper since I have reviewed it for a previous submission to a different journal. Since their original submission the authors have done a great job in reanalysing their data so as to address the concerns I had at the time. Furthermore in this current submission the authors have also extended their work to provide an intriguing explanation of how the framing bias observed in many classical decision tasks might be adaptive (increase reward maximisation) in the context of a more ecological task in which decisions are not taken in isolation. In this regard, I suggest that the authors look at the recent paper by Erev and Roth (just out in PNAS) that puts forward a similar case for reward maximisation in the context of learning. In this version of the manuscript Tsetsos and colleagues have also fitted a drift diffusion model to their data so as to provide an algorithmic description of the computational process preformed in PFC. I am happy to recommend this paper for publication in <i>eLife</i> and I am sure it will spark great interest in the community."

At its core, the paper seeks to study a kind of decision that has not been too heavily studied within the area of decision neuroscience; the study of long-term commitments that yield variable income streams. Of course a number of papers have been published that look at 'investing' in stock-like objects (Cami Kuhnen was probably the first to do this a decade ago) that yield income on each trial of an experiment, but in most of those experiments subjects can change their 'investments' on each trial. A number of people have also looked at foraging decisions, which also have a similar flavor. In those experiments (and Ben Hayden's postdoc papers are probably the best early example) subjects have to decide whether to stay and harvest declining rewards or to leave and search for new, possibly better, rewards. In these experiments subjects do need to make a commitment, because deciding to switch costs them something in time and reward rates. So in these studies (which include work by Newsome's group and a lovely recent paper from Rushworth's group) there is a commitment being studied, but it is a costly rather than an irreversible commitment."

One could complain that they have overstated the novelty of the study by not acknowledging that studies which impose costs for 'changing your mind' (as in the matching law experiments of Newsome and Co, the foraging experiments of Hayden and Platt, or of Rushworth and Co.) are studies of commitment, but those are criticisms of exposition rather than core content."

That is an interesting finding and one that accords well (as noted in the paper) with previous findings by Rushworth's and Platt's groups. But even with regard to this finding, I was torn. The task that the authors used is, at heart, quite complicated. The subjects are asked to address a set of 4 uncertain bandits and to decide whether and when to commit to those bandits. So a number of phenomena are happening in parallel. First, the subjects face uncertainty which diminishes with each sample. Second, the subjects face bandits of different values. Finally, the subjects commit and face two commitment rules. So in essence one has a pile of variables moving in the task: value, certainty + probability of reward, rule, and a diminishing horizon to the end of the block. The subject adds to these her two decisions. And I think that there is enough going on these that one can\u2019t be completely certain what is being represented at any point in time. That doesn't by any means make their findings uninteresting, not in the least, but it does make the experiment hard to interpret. Does the fact that the anterior MPFC responds more strongly in pass trials than on commit trials tell us about conditional value coding as the authors suggest or about something related to the decision other than value coding? It\u2019s just hard to be certain."

The fits certainly capture the trends in the data, but in a subjective way. I really didn't know if the fits were 'good' in some objective sense."

The DDM doesn't enhance our understanding of the scanner data, I don't think. And it isn't compared with any other reaction time model so the paper isn't arguing that the DDM is superior to some of other set of models for reaction time commitment decisions."

This is a very high cost commitment and that is novel."

These are aggregate discounted expectations, so there is some subtlety here, and risk aversion must be taken into account, but this is pretty standard stuff from finance 101. Then one needs to try and relate these standard finance assessments to neural activation. What one needs to show is that these standard normative models FAIL to account for what is going on and that some alternative framework exceeds the predictive neural power of this standard benchmark model."

The note, for instance, Shafir's axiomatic proof about preference reversals and then go on to argue that their data show that under these conditions such preference reversals are normative. This is super tangled. The normative question is: are there times when you would rule out/rule in asymmetrically in this task. That really calls for an axiomatic proof, which would be quite do-able. But instead they use a simulation to try and show that they get good maximization with an asymmetric rule. This gets confusing fast. I would urge the authors to try and do the axiomatic proof for their environment or to just stay away from axiomatics altogether. Mixing them haphazardly with numerics is just making the story hard to follow."
