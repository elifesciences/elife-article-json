It remains unknown what quantitative changes to the activity of metabolism are necessary and sufficient for this phenotype. We developed a computational model of glycolysis and an integrated analysis using metabolic control analysis (MCA), metabolomics data, and statistical simulations. We identified and confirmed a novel mode of regulation specific to aerobic glycolysis where flux through GAPDH, the enzyme separating lower and upper glycolysis, is the rate-limiting step in the pathway and the levels of fructose (1,6) bisphosphate (FBP), are predictive of the rate and control points in glycolysis. Strikingly, negative flux control was found and confirmed for several steps thought to be rate-limiting in glycolysis. Together, these findings enumerate the biochemical determinants of the WE and suggest strategies for identifying the contexts in which agents that target glycolysis might be most effective."

It remains unknown what quantitative changes to the activity of metabolism are necessary and sufficient for this phenotype. We developed a computational model of glycolysis and an integrated analysis using metabolic control analysis (MCA), metabolomics data, and statistical simulations. We identified and confirmed a novel mode of regulation specific to aerobic glycolysis where flux through GAPDH, the enzyme separating lower and upper glycolysis, is the rate-limiting step in the pathway and the levels of fructose (1,6) bisphosphate (FBP), are predictive of the rate and control points in glycolysis. Strikingly, negative flux control was found and confirmed for several steps thought to be rate-limiting in glycolysis. Together, these findings enumerate the biochemical determinants of the WE and suggest strategies for identifying the contexts in which agents that target glycolysis might be most effective."

Cancer cells often convert most of their glucose into lactate, rather than breaking down pyruvate in their mitochondria: an observation known as the \u2018Warburg effect\u2019.

In these treated cells, the levels of a chemical called fructose-1,6-biphosphate (which is made in a step in the pathway between glucose and pyruvate) were either very high or very low. Shestov et al. proposed that the flow of chemicals through the glycolysis pathway is controlled by the GAPDH enzyme when the chemicals used by the enzymes upstream of GAPDH in the pathway (which includes fructose-1,6-biphosphate) are plentiful. However, if these chemicals are limited, other enzymes that are involved in earlier steps of the pathway regulate the process instead."

This difficulty arises from the tremendous amount of heterogeneity within cells at multiple levels. The origins of this heterogeneity vary from genetic variation observed across cancer types, tumor types, differences in signaling mechanisms that affect post-translational modifications in each cell, and the differences in microenvironmental pressures (e.g., the oxygen availability) that each cell within a given tumor experiences, as well as the inherent cell to cell variation common to all cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marusyk et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we developed an integrated algorithm to evaluate the statistics of the kinetics of glycolysis that accounts for the possible variation within metabolism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

In each simulation, concentrations, fluxes, metabolic control coefficients, and thermodynamic quantities are computed and recorded. This statistical analysis explores the space of glycolysis in the context of the Warburg Effect. By assessing the statistics, inferences can be made on the determinants of the Warburg Effects and its context dependence to pharmacological intervention and nutrient environment. For experimental confirmation of the model, we first utilized a recently developed a NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> fluorescent reporter (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hung et al., 2011</a>) and measured the ratio of NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> across a population of cells where some experience hypoxia and others glucose deprivation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

The distribution of values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) of the Warburg Effect (the ratio of flux to lactate over that entering the mitochondria) ranged from less than one (primarily oxidative metabolism) to over 95% of glucose being converted to lactate. The dynamic range over which the Warburg Effect was observed in our model allowed us to investigate to other variables in metabolism. We correlated the calculated value of the Warburg Effect with metabolite concentrations of intermediates in glycolysis. From an analysis of these correlations, a pattern within glycolysis emerges. The levels of intermediates in the beginning steps in glycolysis positively correlate with the Warburg Effect, the levels leading up to the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phopshate (GAP) by GAPDH negatively correlate with the Warburg Effect, and those following GAPDH positively correlate with the Warburg Effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) suggesting together that a bottleneck exists in the pathway that determines the extent of fermentation. An analysis of the correlation of enzyme expression with the Warburg Effect revealed that the enzyme expression for any single step within glycolysis did not completely correlate with the Warburg Effect. However, across glycolysis, GAPDH, the enzyme that carries out oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to yield NADH and 1,3-diphosphoglycerate most strongly correlated with aerobic glycolysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Notably many of the correlations although significant, appear not very strong indicating that the expression of individual enzymes is not sufficient for induction of aerobic glycolysis. The model also captures many of the activities that are known to correlate with aerobic glycolysis. These include glucose transport, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase activities. Interestingly, the expression of enzymes such as hexokinase and phosphofructokinase were either uncorrelated or negatively correlated with the extent of aerobic glycolysis likely indicating their role in creating bottlenecks at other points along the pathway.

Metabolic control analysis (MCA) provides a mathematical framework for evaluating the extent that a change in metabolic activity affects a given flux. In MCA, a pure rate-limiting step occurs when the flux control coefficient (FCC) (Supplementary Information) is one at that step and zero at all other steps. In most cases, values of FCCs are distributed with gradual values across a pathway. We carried out a metabolic control analysis using MCA within our statistical algorithm to investigate the influence of each node in glycolysis on lactate flux across the ensemble of statistical realizations of glycolysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We first computed the distribution of FCCs for lactate production for each step in the pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It was found that for each step within glycolysis, the average control exerted was near zero. Steps early in glycolysis involving enzymes Hexokinase (HK), Phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), and Phosphofructokinase (PFK) exhibit both positive and negative control, and GAPDH on average exhibits the most positive control on the flux through the pathway. In addition to steps within glycolysis, ATPase activity exerts the most influence over lactate production with oxygen consumption having less of an affect. Together, these results both confirm the long-standing hypothesis that ATPase activity is the most prominent rate-determining step in glycolysis but also suggest that GAPDH can often exert a large control on the flux to lactate. In addition, an analysis of the statistics indicates that depending on the context, any point along the pathway can exert large flux control on lactate production with some steps (e.g., pyruvate kinase) less likely to exert control over the Warburg Effect than others. Although the finding that pyruvate kinase typically does not exert substantial control over glycolysis may appear surprising, this finding is consistent with studies that have observed only modest changes in glycolytic flux due to changes in pyruvate kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Christofk et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Israelsen et al., 2013</a>)."

However, for lower glycolysis the flux control is uncorrelated suggesting that when a step is limiting in lower glycolysis, it can be more readily disrupted. This behavior is in contrast with that of upper glycolysis where limiting steps co-occur. Furthermore, an analysis of ATPase and Oxygen consumption activities reveals their control to be related to the control of enzymes clustered at different points in glycolysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) indicating that flux control exerted by these ancillary fluxes are tied to different regions of glycolysis.

Inhibition of LDH as predicted also resulted in little flux control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Together, these findings confirm the mechanisms of flux control of glycolysis predicted by the model and demonstrate the novel regulation of glycolytic flux that can be differentially perturbed by pharmacological compounds."

An analysis of metabolite levels across a series of 14 conditions in triplicate involving pharmacological perturbations of PFK2, LDH, and GAPDH at different concentrations and two separate vehicle treatments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) revealed large magnitude, dynamic responses in FBP levels. We next investigated the extent that FBP levels could characterize the metabolic state of glycolysis. The simulated PDF of FBP levels exhibited a bimodal distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) consisting of a state of low FBP where the concentration was in the high micromolar range. In addition, there existed a state of FBP where the concentration was several orders of magnitude high in the millimolar range. When demarcating the experiments into two groups (high and low FBP) we correlated the levels with lactate flux experimentally (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,E</a>) and found the results to match those observed computationally (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,F</a>). In addition, correlations in these two states with the remainder of the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates agreed well with experiments. Together these findings suggest in addition to the model being able to capture a diverse set of experimental metabolic conditions, the FBP status in cells was able to determine the state of glycolysis and its rate-limiting steps."

When the levels of FBP are low, metabolite levels of glycolytic intermediates tend to be more evenly distributed across the pathway. In this circumstance, flux through the pathway is controlled largely through the initial steps in glycolysis involving hexokinase and phosphofructokinase. Bottlenecks downstream of these canonical rate-limiting steps are not affecting flux through the pathway. Under these conditions, FBP is also not allosterically activating pyruvate kinase. In contrast, when the levels of FBP are high, there is a disconnect in the relative concentration of glycolytic intermediates that is marked by a separation between upper and lower glycolysis at the GAPDH step. In this case, there is an accumulation of intermediates in upper glycolysis, most notably FBP and a depletion of intermediates downstream of GAPDH. Under these circumstances, GAPDH exerts control as the most rate-determining step in the pathway since increased activity through GAPDH will serve then to create a balance along the pathway by pulling the metabolites from upper glycolysis into lower glycolysis. Under these conditions, the beginning steps of glycolysis can exert negative control on the pathway since inhibiting them will result in even greater increases in the intermediates in upper glycolysis. This state has analogies with a recently observed state of glycolysis observed in yeast where an accumulation of FBP leads to cellular toxicity (<a href=\"#bib52\">van Heerden et al., 2014</a>). Notably in this case, in order to balance the fluxes in higher and lower glycolysis, an imbalance in the concentrations of metabolites in upper and lower glycolysis results."

Historically, glycolysis is thought to have a rate-limiting step at several points in the pathway (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chance and Hess, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wu, 1965</a>). These points correspond to positions in the pathway where large free energy differences arise including the ATP-coupled enzymes Hexokinase, Phosphofructokinase, and Pyruvate Kinase (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rose and Warms, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rapoport et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hue and Rider, 1987</a>). Surprisingly, we identified a strong context-dependence with both positive and negative control in glycolysis at each of these steps. In the case of inhibiting flux through PFK, the observed negative control in certain conditions implies that inhibiting this point in the pathway can lead to increased rates of fermentation. This finding provides a possible explanation for why its efficacy may be more prevalent in stromal cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schoors et al., 2014</a>)."

This finding, first documented to our knowledge in parasitic bacteria feeding on high glucose (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bakker et al., 1999</a>), is in contrast to the longstanding notion that GAPDH is not a rate-determining enzyme in glycolysis with the activity of enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase thought to be more controlling. In the case of GAPDH, the bottleneck occurs due to its unique placement in the pathway where it can be regulated by ATP, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and the levels of glucose-derived intermediates in the pathway that affects the thermodynamics of glycolysis. There are multiple mechanisms that lead to this finding. ATP consumption has previously been reported to control the rate of glycolysis and this effect likely occurs to some extent through GAPDH (<a href=\"#bib38\">Racker, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Locasale and Cantley, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</a>). NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration that is mediated by the malate\u2013aspartate shuttle and lactate dehydrogenase also affects flux through glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Locasale and Cantley, 2011</a>). In addition, the activity of the pathway upstream and downstream of GAPDH changes the balance of the levels of intermediates in glycolysis and results in driving the thermodynamics of the reactions out of equilibrium also can result in greater flux control (<a href=\"#bib36\">Noor et al., 2014</a>). Each of these mechanisms separately or together acts to allow for GAPDH to exert flux control over the glycolytic pathway."

For example pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase have numerous small molecule effectors and post-translational modifications that affect their activities (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chaneton and Gottlieb, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Keller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yi, et al., 2012</a>). It is notable that GAPDH also is subject to multiple forms of regulation including post-translational modifications such as nitrosylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that interacts with the catalytic cysteine in GAPDH to inhibit its activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gaupels et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tristan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Moellering and Cravatt, 2013</a>). In the context of ROS, it is tempting to speculate that alterations in ROS could lead to selective modulation of glycolytic flux as has been suggested to occur with pyruvate kinase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anastasiou et al., 2011</a>). While ROS-mediated inhibition is unlikely in conditions of exponential growth, it may be more apparent in physiological conditions of hypoxia and glucose deprivation with higher concentrations of ROS. Another critical aspect of the flux control that GAPDH exerts over the glycolytic pathway is high expression of GAPDH in cells undergoing aerobic glycolysis. Indeed, reports of quantitative protein abundance in mammalian cells have identified enzymes in the pathway glycolysis as the most highly expressed collective of proteins in cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Moghaddas Gholami et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, it was found that within glycolysis, GAPDH is often the mostly highly concentrated protein in glycolysis suggesting that the role of this high expression in these cases is to support the increased amount of glycolytic flux in these cells. Nevertheless, although mechanisms that regulate phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase for example have been shown to mediate cell growth and proliferation, whether regulatory mechanisms of GAPDH have functional roles in cell growth and proliferation related to aerobic glycolysis is not known."

Notably, the FBP levels have implications on the activity of pyruvate kinase that is also allosterically activated by FBP. At low FBP concentration, pyruvate kinase is not activated by FBP but this occurs only in the high FBP state. This finding could have implications in understanding the contexts in which pharmacologically activating pyruvate kinase may have efficacy. Furthermore, it remains to be seen if any signature of these metabolite states could manifest in the alterations of peripheral metabolism involving pathways whose fluxes emanate from glycolysis. If this were the case, then a tempting possibility would be that these states of glycolysis could be predicted from measurements of peripheral metabolites that could be excreted into circulation allowing for the possibility of developing serum biomarkers for the status of glycolysis in tumors beyond what can be resolved with positron emission tomography using radioactive glucose."

From our model analysis, the consequences of inhibiting glycolysis appear enormously complex that limit biomarker development due to the nonlinear mechanisms that determine the response of the pathway to a drug perturbation.

We therefore developed a novel algorithm to assess these features. The algorithm involves a global sensitivity analysis based on a Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo analysis allows for sampling of parameter space over a broad range of simultaneous variations of parameters (enzyme expression levels) followed by statistical assessment of the resulting solution. The idea of this method is to inject uncertainty of the parameters in the model by randomly selecting parameter values from uniform probability distributions. This was achieved by a Monte Carlo method using a randomly drawn set of parameters. The range of parameters chosen with uniform sampling was within two orders of magnitudes of each Vmax (which is proportional to enzyme activity level and was in the range of 10 times less and 10 times greater than the initial Vmax value). Such a sampling was chosen to be large enough to cover all feasible solutions of aerobic glycolysis. The sampling was carried out using a Latin Hypercube sampling method (<a href=\"#bib37\">Oguz et al., 2013</a>). For each chosen set of random parameter vectors the model was simulated between 2000 and 5000 times and its output was calculated. Briefly, we divided the range of the <i>i-th</i> normalized parameter into n (n = 2000\u20135000) subintervals of equal size. Then, we randomly sample n values (e.g., <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><i>, i = 1, \u2026, n</i>), one from each subinterval, for the <i>i-th</i> parameter. We next randomly permuted the n values for each parameter to get the parameter vector. We then evaluated the following: the Warburg Effect value, energy and redox states, metabolite steady-state concentrations and fluxes and flux control coefficients (FCCs). The flux control coefficient that an enzyme <i>E</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> exerts on the lactate flux <i>J</i><sub><i>Lac</i></sub> is defined as (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heinrich and Rapoport, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fell, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shestov et al., 2013</a>):"

On the day of the experiment, cells were placed in custom DMEM/F12 (Gibco) containing no glucose and supplemented to the levels mentioned. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Nikon inverted Eclipse Ti microscope, equipped with a Nikon 20\u00d7/0.75 Plan Apo objective, three different regions of interest chosen, images sequentially acquired every 8 min with 50\u2013100 ms exposure and 2 \u00d7 2 binning. Using a custom MATLAB algorithm previously developed, we subtracted background, set a threshold for cell segmentation, and analyzed the data as previously described (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hung et al., 2011</a>). The concentration of glucose is maintained by considering a culture system in which cells are seeded at low density and media are present in vast excess. An estimate of glucose maintenance in the media in the low glucose condition can be considered using values the glucose uptake rate of the cells (\u223c100 fmol/cell/hr), the cell number (\u223c2000), the volume of media used (400 \u03bcl), and concentration of glucose in the media (750 \u03bcM, 500 \u03bcM from supplementation + 250 \u03bcM from the Horse Serum). Thus in 24 hr, we estimate that about 5 nmols of glucose are consumed. The media contain roughly 200 nmols of glucose which is in excess of the amount consumed by the cells."

An input file of theoretical <i>m/z</i> and detected retention time known metabolites is used for targeted metabolite analysis with data collected in both positive and negative mode. <i>m/z</i> width is set at 10 ppm. The output file including detected <i>m/z</i> and relative intensity in different samples is obtained after data processing. For resulting simulation data, hierarchical clustering was carried out using spearman ranked correlations and the Gene-e software package (Broad Institute).

In fact, GAPDH is the most abundant enzyme in glycolysis suggesting that in many cases the expression of glycolytic enzymes is designed to achieve optimal flux through the pathway (see Moghaddas, Cell Reports 2013, now cited in the text). An increase in activity can occur through multiple mechanisms including the alleviation of its inhibition by ROS or other mechanisms, increasing its activity through allosteric activation, or by increasing its expression which proportionately increases the enzyme activity through increasing Vmax. Together each of these possibilities would manifest themselves in different contexts. We have included the mention of these multiple possibilities in the Discussion. A thorough discussion of each of these effects is mentioned in a revised manuscript."

In designing this study, we reasoned that a more conclusive measurement of glycolytic flux was the rate at which glucose was being converted to lactate. This measurement accounts for both glucose uptake and production of lactate. We reasoned that glucose uptake alone does not account for the portion of glycolytic flux that is siphoned into biosynthetic pathways or into the mitochondria. Nevertheless, we have also measured additional fluxes (Author response image 1) including glucose uptake rate, and a biosynthesis rate from glucose and found that each does correlate reasonably well with the rate of glucose to lactate.

By our calculations shown below and now contained in the Methods, the glucose concentration should be close to constant over the duration of the experiment. The concentration of glucose is maintained by considering a culture system in which cells are seeded at low density and media is present in vast excess. A quantitative estimate of glucose maintenance in the media can be considered using values of the glucose uptake rate of the cells (\u223c100fmol/cell/hr), the cell number (\u223c2000), the volume of media used (400 \u03bcL), and concentration of glucose in the media (500\u03bcM). Thus in 24 hours, we estimate that about 5nmols of glucose are consumed. The media contains about 200nmols of glucose which is in excess of the amount consumed by the cells."
