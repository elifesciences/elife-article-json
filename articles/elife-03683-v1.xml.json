Mutations of CFTR cause CF disease that involves multiple organs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Knowles et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kerem et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Riordan et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rommens et al., 1989</a>). In the lungs of CF patients, defective CFTR leads to production of thick mucus that obstructs airways and thus predisposes the patients to recurring bacterial infection. Although CF disease originates from genetically defective CFTR protein, the severity of CF lung disease is not well correlated with genotype. The CF lung pathology is not fundamentally different from those of many other types of chronic pulmonary infectious and inflammatory diseases. Aggressive antibiotic treatment and supportive measures have prolonged the median life span of patients from 5 to 37 years (<a href=\"#bib27a\">The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2004</a>). These observations underscore the profound impact of infections on progression and severity of CF lung disease. Given that the lung disease generally determines CF patients' prognosis and causes \u223c90% of their morbidity and mortality, it is extremely important to effectively control or mitigate lung infections in the early stages of CF disease."

Most <i>S. aureus</i> strains, including methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA), secrete the pathogenic factor sphingomyelinase (SMase) C, which cleaves sphingomyelin into phosphocholine and ceramide (<a href=\"#bib9\">Doery et al., 1963</a>) (upper panel, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Our group has previously discovered that SMase C hydrolysis of sphingomyelin surrounding CFTR protein profoundly suppresses CFTR activity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ramu et al., 2007</a>). Thus, bacteria can further diminish critical residual CFTR activity in CF patients, worsening the negative impact of mutations. By inhibiting CFTR, SMase C-producing bacteria can also create a temporary condition, analogous to CFTR deficiency, in non-CF patients with lung infection. Additionally, compounding this already very serious problem, SMase C strongly inhibits the activity of Kv1.3 voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels of lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Xu et al., 2008</a>). Inhibition of these channels is well known to cause immunosuppression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chandy et al., 2004</a>)."

This observation suggests that SMase C modifying the head group chemistry of sphingomyelin molecules surrounding CFTR makes activation of CFTR more energetically difficult, and this SMase C action can be markedly overcome by \u2018over-phosphorylating\u2019 the channel's R-domain until all four sites are phosphorylated. This hypothesis implies that mutant CFTR channels with individual key phosphorylation sites ablated would suffer more pronounced suppression by SMase C at these \u2018supersaturating\u2019 levels of PKA's catalytic subunit. To test this prediction, we replaced each of the four phosphorylation sites, one at a time, with alanine and examined SMase C's effect on these single-mutant channels. As a control, we showed that in the presence of a supersaturating level of PKA's catalytic subunit, SMase C suppressed only 25% of the wild-type CFTR current (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast and as predicted, under the same experimental condition, SMase C suppressed 40\u201365% of the mutants' currents. A second corollary of our hypothesis is that a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor agonist should alleviate the SMase C-caused suppression of CFTR current by boosting intracellular cAMP. In fact, \u03b2 receptor agonists are routinely used as bronchodilators in patients suffering from pulmonary infectious and inflammatory diseases. Thus, application of \u03b2 receptor agonists would not be contraindicated in cases of infection by SMase C-positive bacteria and likely be beneficial. However, given that a \u03b2 receptor agonist unlikely causes overphosphorylation of the R domain, it may only modestly counteract the SMase C-dependent suppression of CFTR current."

Although tannic acid has been reported to bind to the choline group of phosphatidylcholine (PC), it does not appear to antagonize SMase C activity by binding to PC and thereby preventing SMase C from accessing sphingomyelin because tannic acid binds to PC only at much higher concentrations than what is required to antagonize SMase C activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kalina and Pease, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Simon et al., 1994</a>).

CFTR current from the Calu-3 cell line was recorded in the whole cell configuration with a patch-clamp amplifier (200B; Axopatch), filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz using a Digidata 1322 interfaced to a PC. Electrodes were fire polished (2\u20134 M\u03a9) and coated with beeswax. Capacitance and series resistance were electronically compensated. Molecular Devices pClamp 8 software was used for amplifier control and data acquisition. The bath solution contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (pH 7.30 adjusted with NaOH) and the electrode solution contained (in mM) 140 KCl, 10 EGTA, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (pH 7.30 adjusted with KOH). SMases were manually added to the recording chamber to test their effects."

To produce recombinant SMases C and D, <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the respective cDNAs cloned into pET30 vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA), grown in LB medium to \u223c0.6 OD at 600 nm, and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 2 hr. The bacteria were harvested, resuspended, and sonicated. The resulting samples were loaded onto a cobalt affinity column and eluted by stepping the imidazole concentration from 50 to 500 mM (all SMase proteins contain N- and C-terminal His tags). The imidazole was later removed by dialysis."

First, sphingomyelinase hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, yielding ceramide and phosphocholine. Second, an alkaline phosphatase hydrolyses phosphocholine, yielding choline. Third, choline is oxidized by choline oxidase to betaine and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase, reacts with Amplex Red reagent in a 1:1 stoichiometry to generate the highly fluorescent product, resorufin. Resorufin has absorption and fluorescence emission maxima of approximately 571 nm and 585 nm, respectively. During the screen, individual wells of a PerkinElmer OptiPlateTM-384 HB black plate containing Spectrum 2320 compounds (each at 10 \u03bcM) dissolved in DMSO were added with 20 \u03bcl of a mixture containing sphingomyelin (100 \u03bcM), alkaline phosphatase (16 U/ml), choline oxidase (0.4 U/ml), horseradish peroxidase (4 U/ml), Amplex red (100 \u03bcM), and triton X (0.4%) (Amplex red sphingomyelinase assay kit A12220; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), using a Bio Tek microdispenser (Janus Automated Workstation, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). To start the enzymatic reaction, 20 \u03bcl of a solution containing <sup>Sa</sup>SMase (30 nM) was dispensed into individual wells. For chemical library screening, SMase C activity was quantified from the intensity ratio of fluorescence excited at 570 nm and detected at 590 nm in the presence and absence (DMSO only) of tested compounds whereas it was quantified by monitoring absorbance at 570 nm in the tannic acid dose\u2013response study."

Mainstream CF research largely aims to correct defective folding and trafficking of the CFTR channel and to boost function of residual CFTR, so improving the flow of Cl- ions, and consequently water, across the critical epithelia of the lung and pancreatic and vas deferens ducts. Most CF morbidity and mortality results from bacterial colonization of dehydrated mucus in the lung and subsequent bacterial infections. The Lu lab has shown that snipping of the phosphocholine headgroup from sphingomyelin by secreted bacterial sphingomyelinase C (SMase C) diminishes Cl- current through adjacent CFTR channels as well as K+ current through lymphocyte Kv channels required for the immune response. Arguing that this two-pronged assault by bacterial SMase C in the lung contributes importantly to both CF and non-CF lung disease, the Lu lab report here their search for a small-molecule inhibitor of SMase C that included screening a library of 2,000 approved drugs and natural products. They found a promising candidate, tannic acid, active below 200 nM."

They apply PC-specific PLC to cleave phosphocholine from PC, and show that this application neither precludes SMase C diminution of Kv1.3 (as they also previously found for Shaker channels), nor prevents tannic acid from inhibiting that action of SMase. The problem is that the authors' interpretation of these observations requires that the PC-PLC removed the phosphocholine from PC in the oocyte membranes, and yet there is no evidence here (and little in <a href=\"#bib29\">Xu et al., 2008</a>) that the PC-PLC was active.

The problem is that the authors' interpretation of these observations requires that the PC-PLC removed the phosphocholine from PC in the oocyte membranes, and yet there is no evidence here (and little in</i> <a href=\"#bib29\"><i>Xu et al., 2008</i></a><i>) that the PC-PLC was active. BSA would be expected to yield identical results. These negative results cry out for a positive control</i>."

Furthermore, the EC50 (\u223c50 nM) of tannic acid for antagonizing the SMase C-catalyzed sphingomyelin hydrolysis in a biochemical reaction (involving no PC) is comparable to its EC50 (\u223c100 nM) for antagonizing SMase C suppression of CFTR activity in a biological membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and 3F</a>).\u201d"
