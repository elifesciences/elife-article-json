The hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neurons regulate sleep/wake states, feeding, stress, and reward. To elucidate the mechanism that enables these various functions and to identify sleep regulators, we combined fluorescence cell sorting and RNA-seq in <i>hcrt:EGFP</i> zebrafish. Dozens of Hcrt-neuron-specific transcripts were identified and comprehensive high-resolution imaging revealed gene-specific localization in all or subsets of Hcrt neurons. Clusters of Hcrt-neuron-specific genes are predicted to be regulated by shared transcription factors. These findings show that Hcrt neurons are heterogeneous and that integrative molecular mechanisms orchestrate their diverse functions. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kcnh4a, which is expressed in all Hcrt neurons, was silenced by the CRISPR-mediated gene inactivation system. The mutant <i>kcnh4a</i>(<i>kcnh4a</i>-/-) larvae showed reduced sleep time and consolidation, specifically during the night, suggesting that Kcnh4a regulates sleep."
