                    "text": "Regulation of translating ribosomes is a major component of gene expression control network. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, ribosome stalling by the C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway. Previous studies reported many residues of SecM peptide and ribosome exit tunnel are critical for stalling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clear at the atomic level. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3.3\u20133.7 \u00c5 resolution, which reveal two different stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle: one is due to the inactivation of ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA; the other is the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site which inhibits the full-scale tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate an elegant control of translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome."

In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, ribosome stalling by the C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway. Previous studies reported many residues of SecM peptide and ribosome exit tunnel are critical for stalling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clear at the atomic level. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3.3\u20133.7 \u00c5 resolution, which reveal two different stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle: one is due to the inactivation of ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA; the other is the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site which inhibits the full-scale tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate an elegant control of translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome."

The instructions in a gene are first copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA), and a molecular machine known as a ribosome reads the copied instructions in groups of three letters at a time (called codons). The ribosome translates the order of the codons into a sequence of amino acids; each amino acid is carried into the ribosome by a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. As it translates, the ribosome joins each new amino acid to the one before it, like the links in a chain. Finally, the newly built protein chain passes through a tunnel to exit the ribosome. Ribosomes do not build all proteins at a constant rate; there are many examples of proteins that stall when they are in the ribosome exit tunnel. It is thought that this stalling is an important way for cells to control the expression of proteins."

These interactions are strong and alter the configuration of both the A-site and P-site of the ribosome. This has two major consequences for translation. First, the tRNA cannot be stably accommodated in the A-site and secondly, its passage to the P-site is slowed down. Both these mechanisms contribute to stalling."

One such example is a variety of ribosome arrest peptides, often encoded by upstream open reading frames (uORF) or mRNA 5\u2019 leaders that are utilized to regulate the expression of co-transcribed genes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cruz-Vera et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ito and Chiba, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Morris and Geballe, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Wethmar, 2014</a>).

SecM is encoded by the 5\u2019-end half of a bicistronic mRNA, <i>secM-secA</i>. SecA is an ATPase-dependent molecular motor helping secretory and outer membrane proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bauer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Economou and Wickner, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lill et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">van der Wolk et al., 1997</a>). SecM is a secreted protein with 170 amino acids in length, including a 17-amino-acid stalling sequence <sup>150</sup>FSTPVWISQAQGIRAGP<sup>166</sup> near its C terminus, which alone is sufficient to induce stalling. The intergenic region of the mRNA between <i>secM</i> and <i>secA</i> can form a stem-loop secondary structure, which would mask the translation initiation Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of <i>secA</i> and therefore limits the synthesis of <i>secA</i> to a basal level. SecM-induced stalling could occur, as a consequence of impaired secretion pathways, and subsequently causes destabilization of the intergenic mRNA structure and increases the exposure of <i>secA</i> SD sequence to the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Butkus et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kiser and Schmidt, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">McNicholas et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sarker and Oliver, 2002</a>). Therefore, as a response to compromised secretion activity in the cell, the synthesis of SecA is upregulated. The stalling sequence of SecM could also induce ribosome stalling under normal conditions, but it is only temporary and quickly rescued by the functional Sec system through a simple pulling force by translocon (<a href=\"#bib13\">Butkus et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Goldman et al., 2015</a>). Thus, the regulatory peptide within SecM offers a feedback loop on the ribosome to ensure sufficient level of SecA in bacteria to regulate protein secretion."

In the arrest sequence, R163, G165, and P166 are essential, because mutation of any of these residues can completely abolish stalling (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yap and Bernstein, 2009</a>). Other five residues (F150, W155, I156, G161, and I162) are also important as mutations of them can abolish stalling partially (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yap and Bernstein, 2009</a>). A few ribosomal components lining the tunnel are also required for efficient stalling, for mutations of A2058G, A2062U, or A2503G, or insertion of one adenine nucleotide within the five consecutive adenine residues (A749-A753), as well as mutations or deletion of selected residues from uL22 and uL4 could all alleviate translational stalling to certain extents (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lawrence et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Vazquez-Laslop et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Woolhead et al., 2006</a>). Previous structural studies of the SecM-arrested ribosome\u00a0suggested that the interaction between the exit tunnel and the arrest peptide could change the conformation of the PTC (peptidyl-transferase center) to slow down the peptide bond formation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhushan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gumbart et al., 2012</a>). However, the previous structures were not in sufficient resolution for direct visualization of the atomic interactions between the tunnel components and the nascent peptide. Furthermore, a recent study employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor the real-time translation of SecM on the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tsai et al., 2014</a>), and revealed that the stalling is a dynamic process involving reduced elongation rates at a range of positions on the SecM mRNA, from G165 to 4\u20135 codons after the terminal P166 of the arrest sequence, including increased lifetime for both unrotated and rotated ribosomes at these codon positions. Nevertheless, although the stalling induced by SecM is not strictly a single-site event, G165 is the first predominant site of stalling (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tsai et al., 2014</a>)."

Our structural data of the two predominant forms of stalled ribosomes, one in post-state, and the other in hybrid rotated state, indicate that a collection of interactions between SecM and the exit tunnel cooperatively induce conformational changes of the PTC, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps, including peptide-bond formation and tRNA translocation."

To facilitate biochemical characterization and purification, two similar constructs were prepared: one encodes, from the N- to C-terminus, a 2xStrep-TEV-tag, the N-terminal 40 residues of OmpA, a Myc-tag, SecM stalling sequence (residues 150\u2013166) and tandem stop codons (SEC-STOP); the other contains an additional 6X-His-tag (SEC-HIS-STOP) after SecM stalling sequence&gt;\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014\u00a0figure supplement 1A</a>)\u00a0.\u00a0After incubation of the plasmids with the S30-T7-based in vitro translation system, the presence and the amount of arrested peptidyl-tRNA can be detected using Western blot with primary antibody against Myc-tag (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014\u00a0figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). We found that the peptidyl-tRNA in the reaction mixture started to accumulate after 5 min, peaked at 15 min and became diminished after 30 min. Therefore, we chose 15 min as the incubation time to purify SecM-stalled RNCs. The design of the SEC-HIS-STOP construct was to assess how frequent the ribosome would go beyond P166. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014\u00a0figure supplement 1B</a>, lower band corresponding to SecM-HIS peptide also existed in the reaction mixtures, in a comparable amount to the peptidyl-tRNA, indicating the ribosome was able to go beyond SecM coding sequence and reach the stop codon with increasing incubation time. However, after treatment of the samples with excessive RNase A, which destroys all RNAs and releases the peptide from the peptidyl-tRNA, only the band of SecM peptide, but not SecM-HIS, sharply increased, indicating that the peptidyl-tRNA in the reaction mixtures is indeed arrested on the very 3-end of SecM coding sequence. The construct of SEC-STOP was specifically used to further synchronize the RNCs on the terminal codon to provide a homogeneous complex for structural analysis. As designed, the peptidyl-tRNA in the reaction mixture of SEC-STOP displayed exactly the same motility on the gel as the one from SEC-HIS-STOP. The RNCs were isolated by a sucrose cushion followed by Strep-affinity chromatography, and further separated and enriched by a second round of sucrose cushion (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014\u00a0figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Similar as previous studies of ribosome stalling (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhushan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Frauenfeld et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Halic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yap and Bernstein, 2009</a>), chloramphenicol was added in the sucrose cushion buffer to stabilize the RNC and to minimize the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis during the lengthy purification. As expected, Western blotting indicates that a clean single band of the peptidyl-tRNA was detected in the purified RNCs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014\u00a0figure supplement 1D</a>), indicating the compositional homogeneity of the purified RNC. To identify nascent peptides in the purified RNCs, we further purified nascent peptides from SecM-stalled RNCs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014\u00a0figure supplement 2A,B</a>) and subjected them to mass spectrometry analysis. The C-terminal sequencing of nascent peptides using a tandem MS/MS (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014\u00a0figure supplement 2C\u2013F</a>) revealed two species, with their C-termini ending at G165 and P166, respectively."

                                "text": "Based on the information from mass spectrometry and structural modeling of the two density maps, the two structures were termed as SecM-Gly-RNC and SecM-Pro-RNC according to the identity of the peptidyl-tRNA (Gly or Pro) in the RNCs (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), following the same notion in the previous work (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhushan et al., 2011</a>). This assignment of the two maps was supported by two sets of structural observations. First, the local densities of the mRNA: tRNA duplex at the PTC in the two maps could be best explained by our assignment, because the anticodon of tRNA<sup>pro</sup> (GGA) is composed of purines exclusively, in contrast to that of tRNA<sup>gly</sup> (CCG). In our map of SecM-Pro-RNC, bases of the three A-site anti-codon residues indeed appears to be relatively larger (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5F</a>), compared with those in SecM-Gly-RNC (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5D</a>). Vice versa, analysis of local density in the A- and P-site codons of the mRNAs in the two maps also supports our assignment (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013C</a>). Second, two bulky residues (W155 and F150) within SecM arrest peptide could be readily located in the exit channel of the two density maps, and their positions are incompatible with other possible assignments. The peptidyl-tRNA in SecM-Gly-RNC is at the classical P site (P/P state) (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A,B</a>), while the two tRNA in SecM-Pro-RNC are at hybrid states (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6C\u2013G</a>). In SecM-Pro-RNC, the peptidyl-tRNA is at a position similar to previously reported A/P* hybrid state (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brilot et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6F,G</a>), and the other tRNA is at a position between P/E and pe/E hybrid states (<a href=\"#bib62\">Polikanov et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6E</a>), closer to the P/E configuration. In the dataset, the hybrid state of SecM-Pro-RNC accounts for 36% of total particles, with a ratio of 1:1.5 for SecM-Pro-RNC (rotated): SecM-Gly-RNC (unrotated). Also comparable to the previous observation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhushan et al., 2011</a>), a minor class of particles resulted in a low-resolution structure of a pre-state ribosome (unrotated with A/A and P/P-tRNAs), likely representing SecM-Gly-RNC with prolyl-tRNA at the A-site (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). It should be noted that during a normal cycle of elongation, the fraction of rotated ribosomes is much less (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fischer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Munro et al., 2007</a>), as it reflects a high-energy state and requires stabilization from translation factor (<a href=\"#bib27\">Frank et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, the increased lifetime of the A/P*, P/E intermediate states of tRNAs in SecM-Pro-RNC suggests this structure might represent a stalled form that is trapped in an intermediate translocational state."

                                "text": "In SecM-Gly-RNC, extensive interactions between the nascent chain and the tunnel could be readily identified (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The first region involves the PTC, the CCA end of the peptidyl-tRNA and R163 of SecM. The CCA-end of the P-tRNA forms canonical base\u00a0pairing with the P-loop (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>); the base of U2585 contacts the peptidyl bond linkage between G165 and A76 of the P-site tRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>); R163 is situated at a space confined by three nucleotides, U2506, A2451, and C2452 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These extensive interactions involving R163-G165 perfectly explain their critical roles in SecM-induced stalling (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yap and Bernstein, 2009</a>). Immediately below R163 along the tunnel, strong density connections can be observed between the carbonyl oxygen of I162 and the sugar ring of G2505, and between the sidechain of I162 and the base of C2610 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Further downstream, multiple interactions between Q160-Q158 and U2609, C2610, C2611, and A2062 could be identified (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), consistent with previous mutational data that perturbation of this interface either at the tunnel (A2062U) or the nascent peptide (Q160P) impairs translation stalling (<a href=\"#bib85\">Vazquez-Laslop et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Woolhead et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yap and Bernstein, 2009</a>). In the mid-tunnel region, the sidechain of W155 interacts with the side-chain of R61 of uL4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), and the backbone of I156-W155-S154 is also close to several tunnel components, including A751 and G91-R92 of uL22 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These observations could well explain the previous finding that mutations of either W155 or I156 into alanine can rescue the SecM-induced stalling (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</a>). In the lower region of the tunnel, a strong hydrophobic contact between F150 and A93 of uL22 is evident (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Again, the contribution of uL22 residues (G91 and A93) in this region to the stalling was previously demonstrated by mutational data (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lawrence et al., 2008</a>). Lastly, beyond F150, the last engineered residue of SecM, two sets of contacts between the Myc-tag and the tunnel could also be observed. One involves K84-I85 of uL22 and E7-I5 of the Myc sequence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), and the other one involves E1-K3 of the Myc sequence, A508 and A1321 of the 23S rRNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The N-terminal sequences of SecM beyond F150 are poorly conserved and not essential for stalling. However, previous data showed that SecM<sub>150-166</sub> is less efficient in stalling than SecM<sub>140-166</sub> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</a>), indicating that the interactions beyond F150 as we observed here, although might not be sequence-specific, also contributes to the stalling."

At the PTC, the CCA-end of the A/P*-tRNA is not orientated for canonical base pairing between C74-C75 of the peptidyl-tRNA and G2252-G2251 of the P-loop (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A strong density connection is seen between the base of U2585 and P166 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which might be responsible for the distorted conformation of the CCA-end of the A/P*-tRNA. Compared with SecM-Gly-RNC, with addition of one more amino acid, G165 moves into a pocket formed by the bases of U2506 and A2451 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), while R163 relocates its sidechain between the bases of U2586 and U2609 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In addition, strong density connections can be observed between the sidechain of I162 and the base of A2062 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Further downstream, Q160 and Q158, through their sidechains, form hydrogen bonds with the bases of U2609 and A752, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Within the mid-tunnel region, the sidechain of R61 of uL4, instead of interacting with W155 in SecM-Gly-RNC, is at a distance capable of hydrogen\u00a0bonding with the carbonyl oxygen of I156 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The sidechain of W155, in contrast to its location in SecM-Gly-RNC, flips \u223c90\u00b0 and stacks with the base of A751 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The pattern of interactions at F150 and beyond is very similar with slight variation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). F150 still maintains hydrophobic interaction with A93 of uL22 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), but the distance is significantly larger than that in SecM-Gly-RNC. The C- and N-terminal sequences of the Myc-tag interact similarly with K84-I85 of uL22 and A1321 of the 23S rRNA, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Actually, many of contacts observed in SecM-Pro-RNC have been previously predicted by a molecular dynamics simulation study (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gumbart et al., 2012</a>), indicating that SecM-Pro-RNC is likely a thermodynamically favored state. Through analysis of the two structures, there appears to be two common constrict sites on the tunnel wall, and the interactions at these locations in the two structures are highly residue-specific: one is formed by A751 of 23S rRNA and R61 of uL4, and the other by A93 and K84 of uL22. The presence of these specific constrict interactions in the two structures suggests that the bulky residues of SecM, W155, and F150 in particular, function to contain the peptide to slow down its passage within the tunnel to posit N-terminal R163, G165, and P166 at specific locations to induce stalling."

                                "text": "Peptide bond formation in the ribosome requires precise positioning of the peptidyl-tRNA and the A-tRNA (<a href=\"#bib62\">Polikanov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schmeing et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schmeing et al., 2005b</a>). Highly conserved rRNA residues in the PTC adopt specific conformations in different functional states to determine the catalytic kinetics of the peptide bond formation. To understand how the interactions between SecM and ribosomal components observed in our models contribute to the translation stalling, we analyzed conformational differences of the PTC in SecM-Gly-RNC and SecM-Pro-RNC from the previously characterized induced (PDB ID 1VQN) and uninduced states of PTC (PDB ID 1VQ6) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schmeing et al., 2005b</a>). These two states, obtained by structural determination of the active 50S subunit (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schmeing et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schmeing et al., 2005b</a>) or the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib62\">Polikanov et al., 2014</a>) with different A-site and P-site tRNAs or analogues, reflect two major states of the PTC, inactive and active for peptide bond formation. When the PTC transits from the uninduced state to induced state, U2585 and U2584 would shift away by 3\u20134 \u00c5 to allow the A-tRNA accommodation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and U2506 would rotate toward the P-tRNA (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schmeing et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Voorhees et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). By comparing the conformation of PTC in SecM-Gly-RNC with those of the uninduced and induced states, we found that both U2585 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and U2506 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) in SecM-Gly-RNC adopt positions similar as in the uninduced state (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Therefore, these interactions originated from G165-R163 are likely responsible for constricting the PTC of SecM-Gly-RNC, especially U2585 and U2506, into an uninduced state that disfavors A-tRNA accommodation and subsequent peptide bond formation. Moreover, the extent of U2585 shifting is even more toward the inactive form of the uninduced state, with a 70\u00b0 flip compared with that of the induced state (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similar observation is also true for U2506 in SecM-Gly-RNC (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

First, U2585 shifts slightly toward the direction of the induced state, but still in a state closer to the uninduced conformation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Local conformational difference at U2585 and U2586 is evidently due to the interactions with P166 and R163 of SecM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>). Second, In contrast to SecM-Gly-RNC, U2506 now assumes an induced state (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Third, the interaction between SecM-I162 and A2062 stabilizes the latter in a state different from the induced state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>). The most intriguing observation is that the base pairing between the CCA-end of A/P*-tRNA and the P-loop is disrupted (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5E</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). The base of C75 has a twist and is seen to extend toward the base of G2252 instead of G2251 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), and C74 also deviates from its optimal base-pairing position with G2252. The destabilization of the interaction between the A/P*-tRNA with the P-loop appears to result from a cascade of interactions described in the above.

                                "text": "The first one, SecM-Gly-RNC, contains a peptidyl-tRNA in classical P/P-site and therefore is expected to display an overall conformation similar to the classical PRE/POST states of the ribosome. However, compared with the cryo-EM solution structures of the pre-translocational ribosome (three tRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brilot et al., 2013</a>) or the 70S\u00b7EF-Tu complex (<a href=\"#bib81\">Villa et al., 2009</a>) from <i>E. coli</i>, an apparent mode of motion for the 30S subunit could be identified, featuring a rotational movement of the 30S body domain along its long axis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Notably, the specific conformation of the post-state ribosome was previously captured in <i>E. coli</i> crystal structures of the 70S-EF-G/GMPPCP complex (<a href=\"#bib63\">Pulk and Cate, 2013</a>). Moreover, compared with the <i>E. coli</i> crystal structure of the post-initiation ribosome (with one P/P-tRNA) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dunkle et al., 2011</a>), similar movement of the 30S subunit is also evident (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). This movement could result in a displacement of the peripheral parts of the 30S subunit up to \u223c5 \u00c5 distance, and increase the spacing between the two subunits to a certain extent. In contrast, the central part of the 30S subunit (platform domain) remains largely unchanged (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>). Furthermore, similar rotational movement of the 30S body also prevails (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), when compared with <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> crystal structures of the ribosome in pre-translocational state (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jenner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Selmer et al., 2006</a>), the post-translocationl state bound with EF-G (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gao et al., 2009</a>), or the 70S\u00b7EF-Tu complex (<a href=\"#bib83\">Voorhees et al., 2010</a>). Very interestingly, this observation is very similar to a recent finding that mammalian ribosomes possess a novel motion mode for the small subunit, named \u2018subunit rolling\u2019, to distinguish its POST and PRE state, and to regulate the elongation cycle (<a href=\"#bib12\">Budkevich et al., 2014</a>). However, due to the lack of reference structures (especially high-resolution cryo-EM solution structures of the ribosomes in the POST and PRE states), we were unable to determine whether the rolling is a consequence of the stalling, or a general feature intrinsic to the POST-state ribosome. Nevertheless, this suggests the \u2018subunit-rolling\u2019 is another common mode of motion for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes."

Interactions between the nascent chain and the tunnel in SecM-Pro-RNC are considerably different at atomic level from those in SecM-Gly-RNC. At the middle region, W155 and F150 interact with different components of the tunnel (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>); however, the movements of W155 and F150 are smaller than the length between two C\u03b1 atoms of the mainchain, which leads to a further compaction of the C-terminal half of the SecM peptide compared with that in the SecM-Gly-RNC. The more compact conformation of the C-terminal half alters the interaction network between SecM and the ribosome as exemplified by the extensive interactions between R163, I162, Q158, and Q160 with the tunnel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These interactions do not significantly change the conformation of the ribosome, but lead to a distortion on the CCA-end of the A/P*-tRNA and thereby disrupting the canonical base paring between the CCA-end and the ribosomal P-loop. As shown in previous FRET data, during translation of SecM peptide, the lifetime of the rotated state of the ribosome significantly increases between codons, requiring increased EF-G sampling without inhibiting EF-G binding (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tsai et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, the impaired accommodation of the A/P-tRNA into the ribosomal P-loop might be responsible for observed delay in tRNA translocation from hybrid A/P site into classical P/P site in the FRET data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In our structures, we could observed chloramphenicol density in the map of SecM-Pro-RNC, but not in SecM-Gly-RNC (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Notably, this is in contrast to the crystal structure where chloramphenicol binds to unrotated ribosome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dunkle et al., 2010</a>). Chloramphenicol is observed to interact with C2452/A2503/G2061 of the 23S rRNA in our structure (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7D</a>), instead of C2452/G2505/A2062 in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dunkle et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, critical residues of U2585, U2506, and A2602 in our structure show apparently different conformations from that in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

First, the crystal structure was docked by rigid body fitting into the Cryo-EM density maps of SecM-Gly-RNC and SecM-Pro-RNC using EMfit (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rossmann et al., 2001</a>) and UCSF Chimera (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). Nascent chains were manually built using COOT. The overall fitting of the crystal structure showed an excellent agreement with our map densities. Then minor adjustments of the side chains of uL4 and uL22, and nucleotides of 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, and tRNAs, were manually performed using COOT (<a href=\"#bib23\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>). Next, the models were further refined against the density maps with stereochemical and secondary structure restraints using Phenix.real_space_refine (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). At last, the refined models were subject to REFMAC (<a href=\"#bib54\">Murshudov et al., 1997</a>) for further refinement in Fourier space, according to methods previously described (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amunts et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fernandez et al., 2014</a>). To avoid overfitting, different weights for refinement were tested. For refinement of the atomic models of the 50S subunit (50S + tRNA + mRNA + SecM), the models were refined against the 50S-masked maps. After refinement, models of the 50S half were combined with fitted the 30S half to interpret the 70S maps. Final models were evaluated using MolProbity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2010</a>), and statistics of reconstruction and model refinement were provided in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. For cross-validation against overfitting, we followed the procedure previously described (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fernandez et al., 2014</a>). This procedure involved the use of both \u2018half maps\u2019 that were calculated from the same halves of the particles as used for the gold-standard FSC calculations. To remove potential model bias from the final model that was built based on the density map from all particles, the atoms coordinates were displaced randomly by up to a maximum of 0.5 \u00c5 using PHENIX. This displaced model was then refined against one of the half maps using REFMAC with secondary structure, base pair and planarity restraints applied. FSC curves were calculated between the resulting model and the map it was refined against (FSC<sub>work</sub>, red curves in <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>), and between the resulting model and the other half map (FSC<sub>test</sub>, blue curves in <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>).

However, at this resolution it can be difficult to distinguish between an additional residue and the chain adopting different conformations in each state (especially when the sequence consists of small residues [ala-gly-pro] that have considerable conformational flexibility). The authors use the positions of F150 and W155 to determine the register. However they also note that the movements of these two residues are smaller than the length between two mainchain C\u03b1 atoms. Given the importance of distinguishing the peptide termini, clear figures showing the density should be provided for the attachment of these residues to the P-site tRNAs. Can the authors use the tRNA density to discriminate a prolyl-tRNA from a glycyl-tRNA? In addition, it should be shown by mass spectrometry or high-resolution gels that there are two distinct peptides in the EM sample. Currently, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panels C and D suggest 'only one major band for the peptidyl-tRNA is present', whereas based on the EM classification there should be a 2:3 ratio of proline:glycine. If the assumption that two peptides are present is correct, does the ratio of unrotated state fall with longer incubation times (as proline-tRNA becomes incorporated)?"

However, at this resolution it can be difficult to distinguish between an additional residue and the chain adopting different conformations in each state (especially when the sequence consists of small residues [ala-gly-pro] that have considerable conformational flexibility). The authors use the positions of F150 and W155 to determine the register. However they also note that the movements of these two residues are smaller than the length between two mainchain C\u03b1 atoms. Given the importance of distinguishing the peptide termini, clear figures showing the density should be provided for the attachment of these residues to the P-site tRNAs. Can the authors use the tRNA density to discriminate a prolyl-tRNA from a glycyl-tRNA? In addition, it should be shown by mass spectrometry or high-resolution gels that there are two distinct peptides in the EM sample. Currently, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panels C and D suggest 'only one major band for the peptidyl-tRNA is present', whereas based on the EM classification there should be a 2:3 ratio of proline:glycine.</i> "

The codon of Gly (GGC) contains two purines at positions 1 and 2, while in contrast, the codon of Pro (CCU) is composed of pyrimidines exclusively (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013C</a>).

Our assignment and fitting are highly consistent with the density appearance. If we switch the tRNA identify in our map of SecM-Pro-RNC, an optimal fitting could not be obtained.

Consistent with our conclusion based on structural analysis, there are two species in the sample, with the C-terminus ending at a Gly or a Pro. The relative abundance of two species is ~1: 2 for SecM-Gly: SecM-Pro. Although the ratio of Gly: Pro from mass spectrometry is different from that derived from cryo-EM analysis, the difference can be justified by the following two major reasons: (A) the sample used for mass spectrometry (at the peptide level) has undergone additional purification and processing, and therefore does not represent the same sample space as that used for cryo-EM (at the RNC level); (B) Cryo-EM analysis includes biased particle selection procedures (initial particle picking, 2D classification, 3D classification), and thus does not necessarily reflect the true stoichiometry in the reaction mixture. For example, the assignment of those low-quality particles (with bad 2D averages and low-quality 3D map) to either SecM-Gly-RNC or SecM-Pro-RNC is not possible."

But based on our observation, once tRNA<sup>pro</sup> assumes a P/P position, the nascent peptide will be released by release factors present in the S30 extract. This is because in our plasmid constructs tandem stop-codons exist following the terminal Proline codon. On the other hand, with increasing incubation time, more proline-tRNA would be incorporated and arrested in hybrid A/P-site, resulting in rotated ribosomes. Therefore, it is hard to predict how the ratio would change, unless some sort of kinetic experiments were performed. Nevertheless, we have carefully chosen the incubation time of 15-min to purify the RNCs based on the maximal fraction of arrested peptidyl-tRNA present in the reaction mixture at this time point (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We had some preliminary structural results (5-6-\u00c5 resolution) on the factor-free Pre (three tRNA) and Post (P/P and E/E tRNAs) ribosomes. Comparison of them indicated that the intersubunit spacing of the Post ribosome is larger. It appeared to us that the 30S body rolling in prokaryotic ribosomes is another mode of motions during the normal translation cycle (highly similar to eukaryotic ribosomes as discovered in Budkevich et al., 2014).

Furthermore, the constructs used to generate RNC were different in the two cases. We had a short one (ending at P166 to synchronize the stalling), while they had a slight longer one (ending at 170).

Maps reconstructed from polished particles are slightly worse in terms of resolution, although no noticeable density difference were seen. This was also true in a few other ribosome-related projects in our lab. We suspect that the performance of particle polishing might relate to specific parameters used for data collection, e.g. the performance of the microscope/camera. In our case, the dose rate used for data collection on K2 is ~ 8.2 counts per second per \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, and the exposure time is 8 seconds for a total of 32 frames. On the frame level, the dose is ~ 1.5 electrons per \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. We noticed that in two papers by Scheres and Ramakrishnan (Amunts et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2014) particle polishing was used for ribosomal particles and improvement of resolutions were reported. Their data collection was done with Falcon II camera (17 frames, total dose 25 electrons per \u00c5<sup>2</sup>), which appears to be in a comparable dose at the frame level. But, it was not mentioned in their papers that how much particle polishing has improved the resolution. It should be noted that we used same parameters as in their papers (as well as a few other combinations) for particle polishing. At present, we are not sure about the reason why particle polishing did not work as expected in our cases."
