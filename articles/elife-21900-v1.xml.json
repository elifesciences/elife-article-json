                    "text": "Gene conversions resulting from meiotic recombination are critical in shaping genome diversification and evolution. How the extent of gene conversions is regulated is unknown. Here we show that the budding yeast mismatch repair related MutL\u03b2 complex, Mlh1-Mlh2, specifically interacts with the conserved meiotic Mer3 helicase, which recruits it to recombination hotspots, independently of mismatch recognition. This recruitment is essential to limit gene conversion tract lengths genome-wide, without affecting crossover formation. Contrary to expectations, Mer3 helicase activity, proposed to extend the displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, does not influence the length of gene conversion events, revealing non-catalytical roles of Mer3. In addition, both purified Mer3 and MutL\u03b2 preferentially recognize D-loops, providing a mechanism for limiting gene conversion in vivo. These findings show that MutL\u03b2 is an integral part of a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination, which has implications to prevent rapid allele fixation and hotspot erosion in populations."

How the extent of gene conversions is regulated is unknown. Here we show that the budding yeast mismatch repair related MutL\u03b2 complex, Mlh1-Mlh2, specifically interacts with the conserved meiotic Mer3 helicase, which recruits it to recombination hotspots, independently of mismatch recognition. This recruitment is essential to limit gene conversion tract lengths genome-wide, without affecting crossover formation. Contrary to expectations, Mer3 helicase activity, proposed to extend the displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, does not influence the length of gene conversion events, revealing non-catalytical roles of Mer3. In addition, both purified Mer3 and MutL\u03b2 preferentially recognize D-loops, providing a mechanism for limiting gene conversion in vivo. These findings show that MutL\u03b2 is an integral part of a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination, which has implications to prevent rapid allele fixation and hotspot erosion in populations."

Recombination shuffles parental genomes through genetic exchanges leading to crossovers (COs) or noncrossovers (NCOs). During meiotic prophase, repair of Spo11-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by recombination into COs is crucial for the formation of gametes with normal chromosome content. Indeed, COs ensure a physical link between homologs that allows them to properly segregate to opposite poles during meiosis I division (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hunter, 2015</a>). DSBs occur in excess over COs, so many DSBs repaired as noncrossovers (NCOs), without exchange of flanking sequences."

Gene conversions therefore result in non-Mendelian segregation and transmission distortion, and also largely contribute to the extinction of recombination-promoting sequences (hotspots) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib14\">Cole et al., 2012</a>). Despite the importance of gene conversion in promoting genetic diversity, the factors that regulate the extent of sequences converted at each recombination site are not known."

For this, after the initial strand invasion of a homologous DNA template by the 3\u2019 end of the resected DSB, the resulting D-loop intermediate is stabilized by a group of proteins called \u2018ZMM\u2019, that lead to the single-end invasion (SEI) intermediate (<a href=\"#bib10\">B\u00f6rner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hunter and Kleckner, 2001</a>). The ZMM proteins in budding yeast comprise Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, Zip4, Spo16, the Mer3 helicase, and the Msh4-Msh5 heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lynn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shinohara et al., 2008</a>).

These ZMM- stabilized intermediates then mature in double Holliday junctions, which are specifically resolved into COs at the pachytene stage, likely by MutL\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allers and Lichten, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hunter and Kleckner, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</a>)."

CO remaining in the absence of MutL\u03b3 likely result from cleavage of recombination intermediates by alternate structure-specific nucleases (Mus81, Yen1, Slx1-4) that normally play a minor role and are only activated late in the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib16\">De Muyt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Matos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</a>).

To obtain a functional tagged allele of Mlh1, we used the crystal structure of the yeast Mlh1-Pms1 C-terminal domain that we previously reported (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gueneau et al., 2013</a>), and chose a solvent accessible loop in the Mlh1 C-terminal domain remote from the endonuclease site and from the Exo1 binding site to insert internal tags and perform molecular studies of Mlh1 complexes during meiotic recombination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). The resulting Flag- and HA- <i>MLH1</i> tagged alleles were fully functional in mismatch repair (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). In addition, in meiosis, both alleles conferred full spore viability, contrary to <i>mlh1\u2206</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Finally, both His-Flag- and HA- internally tagged <i>MLH1</i> alleles produced wild-type frequencies of crossing over at the <i>HIS4LEU2</i> meiotic recombination hotspot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>).

In agreement, Mlh1-Mlh2 was deficient in an endonuclease assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). We next investigated whether the MutL\u03b2 complex binds various DNA structures. Mlh1-Mlh2 preferred binding to pre-Holliday junction (HJ) structures, namely D-loop and bubbled substrate, whereas the binding affinity to nicked HJ, Y-structure and HJ was lower (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Binding to dsDNA was\u00a0~8.5 times lower than to D-loops, while ssDNA was almost not bound. We next investigated the DNA binding specificity of Mer3. Previous studies indicated that Mer3 binds equally double-stranded DNA and Holliday Junctions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nakagawa and Kolodner, 2002a</a>). We determined that purified Mer3 showed a striking preference for binding D-loop structures over all other substrates, and efficiently unwinds D-loops, consistent with its proposed role on this intermediate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). The stronger affinity of Mer3 to D-loops compared to that of MutL\u03b2 is also consistent with our findings that Mer3 is required for the recruitment of MutL\u03b2 to these intermediates in vivo.

Strikingly, both the <i>mlh2\u2206</i> and the <i>mer3R893E</i> mutations improved the spore viability of the <i>zip4\u2206</i> and <i>msh4\u2206</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>), which had already been noticed for the <i>mlh2\u2206 msh4\u2206</i> mutant compared to <i>msh4\u2206</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdullah et al., 2004</a>). Increased spore viability may result from an increased capacity of these mutants to make crossovers. However, the deletion of <i>MLH2</i> did not lead to a detectable increase of CO frequency at the <i>HIS4LEU2</i> hotspot in <i>zip4\u2206</i> or <i>msh4</i>\u2206 mutants (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This indicates that either the spore viability increase is not related to an increase in CO, or that a subtle increase below the detection limit of our assay may be sufficient to increase spore viability. Noteworthy, our results show that the meiotic phenotypes of <i>mlh2\u2206</i> and <i>mer3R893E</i> mutants are identical, indicating that the meiotic functions of Mlh2 are exerted through its interaction with Mer3."

To get a precise genome-wide view of recombination intermediates, we sequenced all the eight DNA strands resulting from meioses of S288C*SK1 hybrid diploids. The <i>msh2\u2206</i> mutation present in this hybrid allows the detection of virtually all interhomolog recombination events, since most DNA heteroduplexes (hDNA) formed during recombination between polymorphic parental sequences are maintained due to MMR deficiency, whereas they would lead to gene conversions or restorations of the parental alleles in the <i>MSH2</i> background (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Martini et al., 2011</a>). For simplicity, we will refer to all the strand transfer events that we observed, either hDNA or gene conversions, as \u2018gene conversion tracts\u2019. In this hybrid diploid, CO frequency appeared reduced by about 25% in <i>mlh2\u2206</i> and in <i>mer3R893E</i>, although these measurements have to be taken with caution since they are issued from 2 (WT and <i>mlh2\u2206</i>) or 3 (<i>mer3R893E</i>) meioses of each genotype (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). COs promoted by the ZMM pathway exhibit interference, i.e. the tendency to be evenly spaced, whereas COs promoted in the absence of the ZMM pathway do not (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hunter, 2015</a>). We estimated CO interference from the distribution of the inter-CO distances measured in our genome-wide experiments, using a gamma distribution model as previously described (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Consistent with previous findings, we obtained a gamma value of 2.3 for wild-type. <i>mlh2\u2206</i> and <i>mer3R893E</i> cells showed gamma values of 2.5 and 1.9, respectively, indicating that CO interference still occurs, as opposed to values between 1.1 and 1.2 observed in true <i>zmm</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). This indicates that <i>mlh2\u2206</i> and <i>mer3R893E</i> mutants still use the ZMM pathway for CO formation as wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>)."

(3) Mer3 then exerts its later functions, involving its helicase activity in conjunctions with the other ZMM proteins to form crossovers.

This infers that Mer3 has a function on D-loop intermediates, irrespective of their fate. This Mer3 function is independent of its \u2018ZMM\u2019 and procrossover functions, since the <i>mer3R893E</i> mutation does not affect meiotic progression or CO frequencies.

Recruitment through mismatches does not restrain GC tract length as seen in the <i>mer3R893E</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>), and MutL\u03b2 efficiently restrains GC tract length in the absence of Msh2. This shows that MutL\u03b2 participates in two distinct processes at recombination sites. The novel structural rather than catalytical role of MutL\u03b2 that we described here is in contrast with its MutL\u03b1 and \u03b3 relatives, which require nuclease activities for their functions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kadyrov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nishant et al., 2008</a>). In addition, our findings provide a role for MutL\u03b2, which has been elusive for almost 30 years, and show that MutL\u03b2 is the only MutL complex that functions independently of a MutS-related heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib37\">Manhart and Alani, 2016</a>). Interestingly, a recent comparative genomics study revealed that Mlh2 is lost concomitantly with the ZMM proteins in the <i>Lachancea</i> budding yeast clade, consistent with the functional connection we describe here (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vakirlis et al., 2016</a>). It is also interesting that in vegetative budding yeast cells, <i>mlh2\u2206</i> mutants show higher resistance to DNA damaging drugs, which led to the proposal that MutL\u03b2 could inhibit Rad51-dependent recombination (<a href=\"#bib17\">Durant et al., 1999</a>). Perhaps a mechanism similar to the one we describe for meiosis is at play, in which MutL\u03b2 limits the formation of early recombination intermediates. Its deletion would favor the stabilization of early recombination intermediates and homologous recombination. It is worth noticing that in human cells, PMS1 (the Mlh2 homolog) interacts with several helicases (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannavo et al., 2007</a>). The functionality of these interactions has not been determined yet."

Mlh1 is classically used as a cytological marker of crossovers in several organisms such as mammals, where it forms foci on synapsed homologs, but given the conserved interaction between Mer3 and MutL\u03b2 in mammals, careful examination may reveal earlier Mlh1 foci on meiotic chromosomes, as early as in leptotene/zygotene stage."

Regarding the proposed role of extending the D-loop into a single-end intermediate for promoting COs, one could have expected <i>mlh2\u2206</i> or <i>mer3R893E</i> mutant to produce more COs, because a longer intermediate would be resistant to disruption by helicases (<a href=\"#bib16\">De Muyt et al., 2012</a>). However, CO number in budding yeast and other organisms is highly regulated, especially by CO interference, which limits crossovers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hunter, 2015</a>). Since interference is still fully active in the <i>mlh2\u2206</i> and <i>mer3R893E</i> mutants, we infer that the CO decision is made before or irrespective of the extension of joint molecules in the absence of Mlh2."

Strikingly, gene conversion tracts are much longer in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> somatic recombination than in meiosis (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yim et al., 2014</a>), consistent with the meiosis-specific nature of the negative regulation by Mer3-MutL\u03b2. Compared to somatic recombination, a specificity of meiosis is the simultaneous induction of high numbers of programmed DSBs, potentially very dangerous for genome integrity and that need to be controlled. It may be detrimental for pairing and/or chromosome disentangling to expose too long DNA sequences, or to run into functional elements such as centromeres or the sequences that attach chromatin loops to the meiotic chromosome axis. In <i>Sordaria</i> meiosis, Mlh1 mutants show an increased frequency of entanglements, suggesting a function at an earlier stage than crossover resolution (<a href=\"#bib58\">Storlazzi et al., 2010</a>). These may be related to the over-extension of D-loops that we see in the absence of MutL\u03b2 and its interaction with Mer3."

In addition, in human and mice, recombination is initiated at site-specific sequences, which could be frequently erased by conversion tracts, leading to the rapid extinction of hotspots, in the absence of a limiting mechanism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baudat et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cole et al., 2014</a>)."

We studied four wild-type octads, two <i>mlh2\u2206</i> meioses, two complete <i>mer3R893E</i> octads, one <i>mer3R893E</i> octad where the sequence of only seven cells was retrieved. We used the two complete octads for tracts lengths and interference, and the three octads for mean CO numbers. For <i>mer3K167A</i> and <i>mer3167A mlh2\u2206</i>, we studied two octads of each genotype. To infer recombination events from octad sequences, we first established a list of 74,911 SNPs by aligning the S288C chromosomes to the SK1 chromosomes using LAGAN (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brudno et al., 2003</a>). Indels were not considered, and all positions located in LTR, retrotransposons and telomeres were discarded. We used the sequences from SGD for S288C (S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203) and the sequence made by Scott Keeney\u2019s lab (<a href=\"http://cbio.mskcc.org/public/SK1_MvO/\">http://cbio.mskcc.org/public/SK1_MvO/</a>) for SK1. Next, sequencing reads from octad were aligned on the S288C and SK1 reference sequences using the BWA software (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>) to genotype SNPs and deduce recombination events. Only perfectly matching reads to the reference sequences were taken into account. The average sequencing depth was 70X. The SNP genotype was considered as valid when there was one type of reads only (S288C or SK1) and if the number of reads was comprised between 15 and 150, or when there was two types of reads if the most abundant was comprised between 40 and 150 and the less abundant was below 5. Deduction of strand transfers events were performed largely as in (<a href=\"#bib39\">Martini et al., 2011</a>). Events that were separated by less than 1.5 kb were considered to have arisen from the same DSB and were therefore combined."

It shows that Mlh1-Mlh2 interacts with Mer3, a meiosis-specific helicase previously implicated as having crossover-promoting function, and that the two work together to limit the length of heteroduplex tracts formed during meiotic recombination in a manner that appears to be largely independent of Mer3 helicase activity. Because all proteins in this study are conserved in many eukaryotes, including mammals, it is highly likely that these findings will be of general applicability."

This can be solved doing the following: 1) present graphs of MutL\u03b2 and Mer3 binding together in one figure, along with the cartoons of the model substrates, but move the actual gels to a supporting figure; 2) use either a log or split-X axis, so that data for 10nM can be clearly discerned; 3) don't assign Kd values to the interaction between MutL\u03b2 and the various substrates-the current data are just too sparse-instead describe binding in relative terms."
