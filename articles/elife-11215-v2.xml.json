Extensive phosphorylation of serine residues at the largest RNAPII subunit occurs at its structurally-disordered C-terminal domain (CTD), which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-S<sub>7</sub>. Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, whereas Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7, which can be acetylated (K7ac). Here, we describe mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lysine-7 residues (K7me1 and K7me2). K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels."

Extensive phosphorylation of serine residues at the largest RNAPII subunit occurs at its structurally-disordered C-terminal domain (CTD), which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-S<sub>7</sub>. Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, whereas Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7, which can be acetylated (K7ac). Here, we describe mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lysine-7 residues (K7me1 and K7me2). K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels."

Co-transcriptional recruitment of chromatin modifiers and RNA processing machinery is modulated through a complex array of post-translational modifications at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RPB1, the largest subunit of RNAPII. This unique domain constitutes a docking platform for protein complexes that cap, splice and polyadenylate newly-made RNAs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentley, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buratowski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Egloff et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eick and Geyer, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hsin and Manley, 2012</a>).

Extensive remodeling of the CTD occurs during distinct steps of the transcription cycle (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buratowski, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2009</a>). RNAPII binds to promoter regions in a hypophosphorylated state, before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at Serine-5 (S5p) and Serine-7 (S7p), marking the earliest stages of transcription (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhtar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chapman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tietjen et al., 2010</a>).

The most complex multicellular organisms, such as vertebrates, generally have longer CTDs (e.g. 52 heptad repeats in mammals), whereas <i>Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and unicellular yeast have 44, 42 and 26\u201329 copies, respectively. The mammalian CTD retains a core of 21 consensus repeats, but has accumulated a diversity of non-consensus repeats, particularly at its most C-terminal region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). In vertebrates, non-canonical amino-acid residues occur most frequently at the seventh position of the heptapeptide repeat, and the most frequent substitution replaces the canonical S7 residue with a lysine (K7; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). The number of non-canonical K7-containing repeats increases from zero in yeast to one, three and eight repeats in <i>C. elegans, D. melanogaster</i> and vertebrates, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>).

We produce new antibodies specific to CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2 and show that these novel modifications precede or accompany phosphorylation of S5 and S7, upstream of S2 phosphorylation. Using biochemical and genome-wide approaches, we show that CTD-K7 methylation is present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA, but defines the earliest stages of the transcription cycle. Through detailed analysis of abundance and distribution of different CTD modifications at gene promoters in embryonic stem (ES) cells, we show that gene expression levels depend on the balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation."

CTD-K7 residues were mutated into serine (S7) residues to restore the consensus sequence of the CTD heptapeptide.

Lysine acetylation has been extensively studied in the context of histone proteins, where it is often counter-balanced by methylation, with clear roles in regulation of gene expression and repression (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wozniak and Strahl, 2014</a>). To investigate whether K7 methylation could counteract K7 acetylation of RNAPII, we developed specific monoclonal antibodies using CTD peptides methylated on K7. With the aim of raising antibodies that could potentially detect methylation in several or all of the K7-containing CTD repeats, we chose the peptide sequence centered on the K7 residue in repeat 35 of the CTD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). This heptad has the most represented K7-repeat sequence (YSPTSPK), and is the K7 residue with most conserved distance to the C-terminal end of RPB1 in vertebrates and invertebrates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Peptides modified by mono-, di- and tri-methylation of K7 residues were used for immunization. The supernatants of hybridoma clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to test for specificity to CTD-K7 methylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). We identified several antibody clones specific for CTD-K7 mono- or di-methylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>).

However, it could also result from steric hindrance of K7me1 and K7me2 antibody binding by CTD phosphorylation. To test whether CTD phosphorylation interferes with immunodetection of K7 methylation, we performed western blots from total protein extracts obtained from mouse ES cells, and pre-treated the blots with alkaline phosphatase to remove phosphoepitopes prior to immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). We find that the detection of K7 methylation remains specific to the hypophosphorylated RPB1 after treatment of immunoblots with alkaline phosphatase, showing only a minor increase in the detection of K7me1 and K7me2 at intermediately phosphorylated forms, in conditions that fully abrogate detection of phosphorylated epitopes (e.g. S5p; see also <a href=\"#bib44\">Stock et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, immunodetection of K7me1 and K7me2 is only minimally affected by CTD phosphorylation, suggesting that K7me1 and K7me2 modifications are depleted from elongation-competent hyperphosphorylated RPB1 complexes. Interestingly, the association of K7me1 and K7me2 with hypophosphorylated form of RPB1 differs from K7ac, previously shown to occur at both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated RPB1 forms (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that K7 methylation may precede K7 acetylation during the transcription cycle."

We first identified all genomic regions positive for CTD-K7 marks, using a peak finder suited for both sharp and broader occupancy patterns (Bayesian change-point, BCP; <a href=\"#bib50\">Xing et al., 2012</a>). We then used these positive regions to classify gene promoters according to the presence of each modification (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). A total of 6962, 8265 and 8312 gene promoters were classified as positive for K7me1, K7me2 and K7ac, respectively. The vast majority of these genes are (i) positive for all three marks (n\u00a0=\u00a06398; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>), (ii) also marked by S5p, S7p, S2p and 8WG16 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), and (iii) transcriptionally active at the messenger\u00a0RNA (mRNA)\u00a0level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). As a further test of the specificity of K7me1 and K7me2 presence at productive RNAPII complexes, we evaluated their presence at polycomb\u00a0repressed\u00a0(PRCr) genes.

We also excluded overlapping genes and genes where the maximum peak of RNAPII (marked by unphosphorylated RNAPII using 8WG16 antibody) is not within 50 bp of the annotated TSS, yielding a group of 1564 active genes. We find that mRNA levels are most strongly correlated with S2p levels at TES of active genes (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient 0.62), followed by promoter K7ac (0.55) and S7p (0.49; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). In contrast, the enrichment levels of K7me1 and K7me2 at gene promoters (which are highly self-correlated, 0.93) poorly correlate with S2p or mRNA (0.31\u20130.45), but highly correlate with modifications associated with initiation and early elongation (unphosphorylated RNAPII, S5p and S7p; 0.72\u20130.86).

However, the most likely scenario is that several CTD modifications jointly contribute to expression levels. To further explore whether CTD modifications work together to promote productive transcription, we employed stepwise regression models to determine the CTD modifications that best predict elongation marked by S2p levels, for a given number of predictors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). These analyses confirm that S7p and K7ac are (i) the best predictors of S2p in single-variable models, (ii) the top combination of modifications in two-variable models, and (iii) always present in the top models when considering three, four and five modifications. Surprisingly, we also find that the promoter levels of K7me1 and K7me2 have significant negative contributions to the S2p elongation mark and mRNA expression, when considered together with the positively correlated variables S5p, S7p and/or K7ac. The dependencies identified were further tested using LASSO regression, which is more robust to artifacts (due to co-linearity in the predictors and over-fitting), in combination with a common cross-validation approach (minimum error plus one standard error criterion) to select the most parsimonious linear model in the LASSO path (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We confirmed major positive contributions of S7p and K7ac to the levels of S2p (and mRNA), together with smaller (non-redundant) positive contribution of S5p, and negative contribution of K7me1. LASSO regression also shows that the levels of K7me1 and K7me2 are redundant, as K7me2 has a similar negative contribution to the minimal linear model found by LASSO analysis, when K7me1 is excluded from the variable set (not shown). Taken together, these results reinforce the observation that K7me1 and K7me2 are early transcription marks that are present at actively transcribed genes, but have negative contribution to mRNA levels, and raise the possibility that a balance between K7 methylation and K7 acetylation might define the extent of productive elongation at active genes."

We observe that unmodified S2, marked by 8WG16, shows a major peak centered on the TSS, as well as a secondary peak 140 bp downstream, and is independent of the K7me2/K7ac ratio (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2a</a> for the full list of non-overlapping active genes).

In contrast, K7ac expands downstream of the TSS up to +500\u00a0bp, especially at genes with low K7me2/K7ac ratios, but without specific enrichment at the secondary 8WG16 peak. S2p, which is a broad elongation mark enriched mostly at the TES, does not peak at the TSS. Interestingly, genes with the highest K7me2/K7ac ratios exhibit the lowest mRNA or nascent transcript expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c and 7d</a>), and lowest S2p in the beginning of gene bodies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>) and after TES (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>).

In contrast, genes with low K7me2/K7ac ratios are associated with GO terms that relate with housekeeping functions in mouse ES cells such as <i>translation, DNA-dependent transcription, carbohydrate utilization</i> and <i>regulation of developmental process.</i> These results suggest that the balance between K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters is important to define the extent of productive transcription at groups of genes with different biological functions, namely in the transition between initiation and elongation, which can contribute to fine-tuning gene expression levels."

Larger CTDs are thought to accommodate larger protein complexes. Non-canonical CTD repeats have the potential to expand the diversity of post-translational modifications, resulting in more complex signaling through the CTD. Although there is increasing recognition that complex CTDs may have specific roles in the regulation of more complex developmental programs, gene structures or gene organization (<a href=\"#bib32\">Litingtung et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Simonti et al., 2015</a>), our understanding of CTD signaling remains extremely limited, particularly as we have not yet identified all CTD modifications."

Using murine cell lines with K7-to-S7 substitutions, we show that several CTD-K7 residues are simultaneously mono- and di-methylated, including a single K7 residue at repeat 35 of the murine CTD. Conservation of CTD-K7 methylation, and expansion of the number of methylated CTD-K7 residues from invertebrates to mammals, suggests functional relevance of this modification across taxa. Model systems characterized by K7 expansion (e.g. <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kishore et al., 2009</a>) further support the need for studying the extent of K7 modifications at RNAPII CTD."

We mapped the genome-wide occupancy of K7me1 and K7me2 in mouse ES\u00a0cells and find that they are highly enriched at the promoters of active genes. CTD-K7 methylation levels are highly correlated with promoter levels of unmodified S2, S7p, and S5p, but are uncoupled from mRNA expression and S2p abundance. In contrast, we find that CTD-K7 acetylation expands downstream of promoter regions into gene bodies, and highly correlates with S2p and mRNA levels."

We observed that the ratio between K7me2 and K7ac at active promoters is inversely related to gene expression. Genes with similar promoter occupancy of RNAPII but which have higher levels of K7me2 relative to K7ac are significantly less expressed than genes that have higher levels of K7ac relative to K7me2. This suggests that a balance between K7 modifications fine-tunes gene expression levels."

Typically, for a given number of predictor variables, we report the top five best models. Since CTD-S2p measured at 2\u00a0kb window after TES is the best predictor of mRNA amongst all CTD modifications and gene regions, we decided to study models that predict the levels of the S2p (instead of mRNA-seq) to avoid inclusion of another highly correlated variable.

Samples were DNAse I (Turbo DNAse, Ambion) treated according to manufacturer instructions. Total RNA (1 \u00b5g) was retrotranscribed using random primers (50 ng) and 200 U of reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II RT, Invitrogen) in a 20 \u00b5l reaction. The synthesized complementary\u00a0DNA was treated with 2 U of RNAse H (NEB), diluted 1:10 and 2.5 \u00b5l were used per RT-PCR reaction. Total RNA was measured using primers designed for the 5\u00b4end of genes and levels were normalized for <i>Actb</i> mRNA measured using primers for the exon1-exon2 junction (for primer sequence see <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

These lysine residues were previously shown to be subject to acetylation correlating with TSS associated pausing of EGF inducible genes. This study now shows that these same lysines can also be mono- or dimethylated based on the development of specific antibodies to these CTD modifications as well as the construction of variant CTDs with the 8 K7 reverted to consensus S7. Notably this S7 reverted mutant CTD still gives full cell viability using the \u03b1-amanitin resistant replacement construct in NIH-3T3 cells. This argues against a dominant function for the K7 heptads in these cells. Even so K7me1/2 clearly are present on promoters of active genes in ES cells based on ChIP-seq and this association is mainly unaffected by flavopiridol treatment arguing for their role in transcription initiation of many genes. Interestingly the K7acetyl CTD appears to also be involved in transcription elongation while K7me1/2 may be associated with the down-regulation of some genes. They also show that the K7me1/2 antibody isn't blocked by adjacent CTD serine phosphorylation, critical to allow the use of this antibody reagent."

We then analyzed global levels of CTD-K7 methylation by western blotting, and found a reproducible increase in CTD-K7me2 after inhibition of P300 (ranging between 1.2-2.5 fold across 2 biological and 6 technical replicates). This result combined with the observation that K7ac decreases (Schroeder et al., 2013) points to a dynamic balance between methylation and acetylation at CTD-K7 residues, which supports our interpretation of the genome-wide analyses of CTD marks."

Alternatively, P300 inhibition may have other confounding effects, such as preventing histone acetylation and thereby repressing gene expression irrespectively of the K7me/ac ratio.

This experiment was inspired by the observations from the partial correlation analyses and stepwise regression that these marks have independent contributions to productive elongation. Interestingly, we observe that S7p levels do not change upon P300 inhibition, reinforcing the view that S7 phosphorylation is independent of K7 acetylation or methylation. This observation is consistent with our suggestion that both K7ac and S7 phosphorylation contribute independently to drive S2p levels, and points to a complex regulatory cascade that integrates K7 modifications with phosphorylation of serine residues. We agree with the reviewers that further studies will be necessary to fully understand the functional roles of K7me2 and K7me1 in gene regulation, and feel that the revised manuscript provides the starting point for in-depth dissection of such mechanisms."

In agreement with the results obtained for mRNA-seq data (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), we find that the K7me2/K7ac ratio is also anti-correlated with the amount of nascent transcription (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient = \u2013 0.31, p-value &lt; 2.2x10-16). These results reinforce the finding that K7 methylation is an early transcription mark and that the balance between K7 modifications helps fine-tune transcription. The GRO-seq levels across K7me/K7ac ratios have been included in an extra panel in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>. Additionally, a boxplot summarizing GRO-seq values for the different K7 ratio quantiles and heatmaps of GRO-seq signal have been added to <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>."

As alluded in the Discussion of the first version of the manuscript, we attempted to identify potential readers of K7 methylation, by performing mass spectrometry after immunoprecipitation of YFP-tagged wild-type (8K) RPB1 versus 0K mutant. However, this approach did not yield reproducible protein identifications in biological replicates, probably due to the fact that K7 methylation might be associated with a very small pool of RNAPII complexes found at the earliest stages of transcription. The staining of only small and discrete dots by IF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) supports the notion that only a fraction of RNAPII complexes might be heavily marked by K7 methylation. Moreover, in such a global RNAPII pull-down, any differences in protein recruitment due to a specific CTD modification may be extensively diluted by all the proteins that bind to RNAPII abundant Serine modifications, irrespective of K7 modification."

We hypothesized that this step should clear up mouse ES cell extracts from proteins that bind to non-canonical CTD sequence in the absence of K7 modifications. After this pre-clearing step, we performed pull-downs using beads carrying dimethylated K7 peptides (3 heptapeptide repeats Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-K7me2). Proteins obtained after the first and second pull-downs (two biological replicates each) were analyzed by LS-MS/MS."

The second pull-down step with dimethylated K7 peptide did not reveal specific protein enrichment over mock background in two biological replicates. These results raise the possibility that CTDK7 methylation may act to prevent protein-protein interactions that occur in the earliest stages of transcription initiation (between transcription factors and RNAPII), which have to be disabled to allow CTD modifications that are compatible with productive elongation. Alternatively, it is possible that K7me1 and K7me2 act in concert with other CTD modifications, e.g. with S5p. In this light, more complex peptide pull-downs will be necessary where K7me2 presence/absence is combined with presence of S5p, S7p or other CTD modifications, to help understand what is the contribution of K7me2 to the ability of adjacent modifications to regulate co-transcriptional recruitment of machinery."

Alternative biochemical approaches such as CTD-K7 peptide pull down screens for methylases and/or isolation of CTD-K7 methylation activity from nuclear extracts might be needed for the identification of CTD-K7 methyltransferases.
