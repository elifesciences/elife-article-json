Several important principles have emerged from extensive studies of pheromone signaling in adult fruit flies, including an understanding of how pheromones are detected and how they can influence behavior in male and female flies in different ways. However, most of this work has focused on a pheromone called cis-vaccenyl acetate (<a href=\"#bib11\">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</a>). Now in <i>eLife,</i> Joshua Mast and colleagues from the Janelia Farm Research Campus, ETH Z\u00fcrich and the US Department of Agriculture have used the chemosensory system of fruit fly larvae to identify new pheromones and the neurons that detect them (<a href=\"#bib7\">Mast et al., 2014</a>)."

Taste neurons expressing these two ion channels are also known to detect sex pheromones in adult <i>D. melanogaster</i> flies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Toda et al., 2012</a>). The simplicity of the larval neural circuits allowed Mast et al. to narrow down the possible neurons that could detect pheromones to a single pair of neurons (R58F10+) in the terminal organ.

Generally, members of different <i>Drosophila</i> species will not court flies from other species because, it is thought, each species has a characteristic pheromone profile (<a href=\"#bib2\">Coyne et al., 1994</a>). This species-specific effect is also partially seen in response to the pheromones that cause the larvae to aggregate: <i>D. melanogaster</i> larvae will gather together to form aggregates, but the larvae of a closely related species, <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, will not (<a href=\"#bib3\">Durisko et al., 2014</a>)."

Tests revealed that the lack of aggregation in <i>D. simulans</i> larvae is likely the result of the reduced production of both of the attractive <i>D. melanogaster</i> pheromones detected by Mast et al., as well as the production of an additional unknown repellant compound."

The demonstration by Mast et al. that the larvae of different, closely related, fly species produce different pheromones suggests that pheromones are able to influence social behavior even at that early developmental stage. Exactly how these pheromones evolved along with their receptor systems and circuits, and how they participate in species-specific adaptations, remain open questions for future investigation."
