Although RNA interference (RNAi) is known to mediate antiviral immunity in plant and animal models, the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in rice and other economically important crops is poorly understood. Here, we report that rice resistance to evolutionarily diverse viruses requires Argonaute18 (AGO18). Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi. Expression of miR168-resistant <i>AGO1a</i> in <i>ago18</i> background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice. Our findings uncover a novel cooperative antiviral activity of two distinct AGO proteins and suggest a new strategy for the control of viral diseases in rice."

Although RNA interference (RNAi) is known to mediate antiviral immunity in plant and animal models, the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in rice and other economically important crops is poorly understood. Here, we report that rice resistance to evolutionarily diverse viruses requires Argonaute18 (AGO18). Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi. Expression of miR168-resistant <i>AGO1a</i> in <i>ago18</i> background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice. Our findings uncover a novel cooperative antiviral activity of two distinct AGO proteins and suggest a new strategy for the control of viral diseases in rice."

Many of the viruses that infect rice are transferred between plants by insects and many insects carry more than one virus at a time; this means it can be difficult to predict where a disease will next emerge. As a result, there is a pressing need to develop new and effective strategies that boost the ability of rice plants to fight off harmful viruses."

This process depends on the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins, although the roles of many of its members are not well understood. One of the better-studied AGO proteins is called AGO1 and is known to be important for defending plants against viruses. Unfortunately, a small RNA molecule called miR168 acts to limit the amount of AGO1 in a cell, and the levels of miR168 increase in virus-infected rice plants."

Rice plants infected with these viruses increased their levels of both AGO1 and another AGO protein called AGO18. Modifying the ability of rice plants to produce AGO18 revealed that the anti-viral activity of AGO1 is abolished in plants lacking AGO18. However, plants that over-produce AGO18 are better able to fight off viral infections. Wu, Yang et al. further showed that AGO18 binds to miR168 and so prevents this small RNA from reducing AGO1 levels. Therefore, AGO1 and AGO18 work together to defend rice plants from viruses."

The RNAi machinery contains many proteins involved in the biogenesis and function of specific types of small RNAs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hauptmann and Meister, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Meister, 2013</a>). Among these are two categories that act as the core of the RNA silencing machinery: DICER (DICER-LIKE or DCL in plants) and ARGONAUTE (AGO). DICER and DCL proteins mainly function to process double-stranded or folded stem-loop precursor RNAs into small RNA duplexes. AGO proteins incorporate one strand of an siRNA duplex to form an effector complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to regulate the stability/translatability of target RNAs or to mediate methylation of target DNA sequences (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baulcombe, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Meister, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pfaff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rogers and Chen, 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "In plants, the RNAi machinery has undergone extensive amplification and functional specialization during evolution. For instance, the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> encodes four DCLs that function indistinct and yet overlapping RNAi pathways to control diverse biological processes ranging from development, response to abiotic stresses, to defense against pathogens (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deleris et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chapman and Carrington, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Vazquez et al., 2010</a>). <i>Arabidopsis</i> encodes 10 AGOs whose functions are not all understood. Well-studied AGOs include AGO1 that mediates mRNA cleavage is critical for development, AGO4 that directs DNA methylation, and AGO2 that functions in DNA double strand break repair (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baumberger and Baulcombe, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mallory and Vaucheret, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ye et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). AGO1 is particularly notable in that its homeostasis is controlled at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. At the post-transcriptional level, the <i>AGO1</i> mRNA is a target of miR168. Therefore, miR168-guided cleavage of <i>AGO1</i> mRNA by AGO1 protein exerts auto-regulation. Moreover, <i>AGO1</i> is co-expressed with miR168 and AGO1 protein can stabilize miR168 post-transcriptionally (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vaucheret et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vaucheret, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mallory and Vaucheret, 2010</a>). At the post-translational level, the accumulation of AGO1 can be reduced by F-box proteins in a proteasome-independent manner through the autophagy pathway (<a href=\"#bib8\">Derrien et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rogers and Chen, 2013</a>). The auto-regulation of AGO1 indicates that its level within a cell can be dynamic and this dynamics may significantly impact the biological activities of a plant."

In plants, it is well known that AGO1 is a major effector of antiviral RNAi; AGO1 associates with virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) and mediates the degradation of viral RNAs. Furthermore, AGO2 and AGO7 are induced during viral infection, and both proteins can bind viral siRNAs. The antiviral function of AGO2 and AGO7 requires their slicing activity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Qu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). AGO2 is repressed by AGO1-associated miR403, and AGO1 and AGO2 appear to exert antiviral functions in a non-redundant and cooperative manner. Specifically, AGO1 functions in the first layer of antiviral RNAi; when AGO1's antiviral function is inhibited, a second layer is activated involving AGO2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harvey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jaubert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Scholthof et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carbonell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xia et al., 2014</a>). AGO2 also recruits miR393* to regulate plant immunity against bacterial infection (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). As a counter-defense strategy, some plant viruses have evolved silencing suppressors to target AGO1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burgy\u00e1n and Havelda, 2011</a>). Moreover, infection of many viruses can elevate the miR168 level to down-regulate AGO1, thereby nullifying this layer of host defense (<a href=\"#bib46\">V\u00e1rallyay et al., 2010</a>). Thus, regulation of AGO1 by both host and viral factors plays a critical role in determining host responses to viral infection. Whether a host has positive regulators to check the viral counter-defense activities is not understood. How different AGOs have evolved to regulate plant responses to pathogen infection also remains an outstanding question (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ding, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2010</a>)."

However, rice production and consequently food sustainability is under the constant threat of emerging and reemerging viral diseases. Rice viral pathogens are genetically diverse and many highly pathogenic viruses such as <i>Rice stripe Tenuivirus</i> (RSV, with a genome comprising 4 negative-stranded RNAs) and <i>Rice dwarf Phytoreovirus</i> (RDV, with a genome comprising 12 double-stranded RNAs) are transmitted persistently and solely by arthropod vectors (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hibino, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Du et al., 2011</a>). Because of the global circulation of these vectors and lack of virus resistance germplasms, the incidence and severity of rice viral diseases in many rice-growing regions are unpredictable. Infection by multiple viruses is also a common and severe challenge for other important crops. Therefore, developing new and effective strategies to control infection by multiple viruses for a crop, especially the prevalent food crops in the monocot group such as rice, maize, and wheat that have traditionally been under-investigated, is of paramount importance for human food sustainability. Successful development of such strategies requires a knowledge base of the mechanisms of viral infection and host defense responses."

In this study, we report a critical role of RNAi in antiviral defense in rice under natural infection conditions, when the plants were inoculated, as in the field, by viruliferous insect vectors brown planthopper (<i>Laodelphax striatellus</i>) and leafhopper (<i>Nephotettix cincticeps</i>) that transmit RSV and RDV, respectively. Intriguingly, we found that AGO18, a member of a new AGO clade that is conserved in monocots, is specifically induced by the infection of two taxonomically different viruses and is required for the antiviral function of AGO1. Loss-of-function <i>ago18</i> mutation abolishes, whereas over-expression of AGO18 increases, the AGO1 antiviral activity. We further demonstrated that AGO18 competes with AGO1 for binding miR168, resulting in elevated levels of AGO1 in the infected plants to enable antiviral defense. Expression of an miR168-resistant <i>AGO1a</i> variant in the <i>ago18</i> background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. The antiviral function of AGO18 requires its small RNA-binding, not slicing activity. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism AGO1 homeostasis regulation by AGO18 for antiviral defense and have significant implications in understanding the evolutionary amplification of RNA silencing mechanisms and in developing novel antiviral strategies."

We immunoprecipitated AGO18 complexes from RSV-infected WT rice plants using AGO18 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Northern blots using RSV RNA2 probes showed much weaker signals for vsiRNAs in AGO18 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), compared to those in AGO1a and AGO1b (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We further profiled small RNAs in AGO18 complexes prepared from RSV-infected plants using deep sequencing.

We generated two AGO18 mutants, AGO18<sup>Y537A/F538A</sup> (YF/AA) and AGO18<sup>D833A</sup> (D833A). YF/AA contains alanine substitutions at two conserved residues (Y537F538) that are known to be required for small RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ye et al., 2012</a>), whereas D833A contains an alanine substitution at the DDH catalytic triad (<a href=\"#bib44\">Song et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rivas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wee et al., 2012</a>).

Building upon the conserved core components of the RNA silencing machinery such as DCLs and AGOs, plants have evolved extensive variants of these components, especially AGOs. This evolutionary amplification of the machinery components implies amplification/diversification in regulatory mechanisms/functions. While the roles of some AGOs in specific functions of RNA silencing in gene regulation and innate immunity have been well studied, the roles of most AGOs remain unknown or poorly understood. Besides AGO1, only the slicing function of AGO2 appears to be also important for antiviral defense in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harvey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jaubert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Scholthof et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carbonell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xia et al., 2014</a>).

We showed that AGO18 does not have antiviral function by itself, but its presence is required for the antiviral function of AGO1. AGO18 accomplishes this not via its slicing function but through its competition with AGO1 for binding miR168. This binding inhibits miR168-mediated auto-regulation of AGO1, thereby boosting the accumulation levels of AGO1 to enable antiviral function. Thus, AGO18 has evolved as a novel and dedicated positive regulator of the plant surveillance/defense system. Our findings suggest that AGO18-bound miR168 is not competent in cleaving <i>AGO1</i> mRNA in RSV-infected rice plants, albeit AGO18 contains conserved DDH motif for slicing activity. Several possible mechanisms can be considered. First, the catalytic activity of AGO18 may not be as potent as that of AGO1 due to some sequence/structure differences between these two AGOs. Second, the slicing activity of AGO18 may be repressed by a yet-to-be-identified protein that specifically interacts with AGO18. Third, the cellular compartmentation of AGO18/miR168 complex may be distinct from that of AGO1/miR168 and prevent its access to <i>AGO1</i> mRNA. Finally, AGO18 binding of miR168 may subsequently induce the degradation of miR168. It will be highly interesting to test these possibilities in future studies."

                        "text": "There were previous examples of competitive binding of other miRNAs between other AGOs and AGO1 in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. miR168 can be incorporated into AGO10 to decrease the translation efficiency of <i>AGO1</i> mRNA in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mallory et al., 2009</a>). The <i>Arabidopsis</i> miR166/165 are significantly enriched in AGO10-bound miRNAs, preventing them from being loaded into AGO1 to fulfill their normal roles in development (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ji et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Manavella et al., 2011</a>). MiR390 is associated with AGO7 to mediated trans-acting siRNA biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Montgomery et al., 2008</a>), through cooperative activity of AGO1. In addition, miR408 associates with both AGO1 and AGO2 redundantly to regulate <i>Plantacyanin</i> mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib32\">Maunoury and Vaucheret, 2011</a>). This competition, however, does not affect AGO1 homeostasis. In contrast to these negative regulations of AGO1, binding of miR168 by AGO18 in infected rice plants boosts AGO1 accumulation. Thus, among mechanisms of AGO-regulation of AGO1 homeostasis or activity, the up-regulation of AGO1 via AGO18 binding of miR168 represents a novel type of mechanism. Whether other AGOs function similarly in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, rice, and other plants to up-regulate AGO1 or another AGO to impact developmental processes or defense responses is an outstanding question to be addressed in future studies. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to miR168, several miRNAs including miR528, miR159a, and miR159b were also recruited by AGO18 in RSV-infected rice plants (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). Thus, for AGO18, we cannot rule out the possibility that AGO18 plays regulatory roles in other capacities or has its own independent biological functions."

These studies often used viral delivery methods with much higher levels of inoculum than natural field conditions. How some of such manipulations would alter host responses remains an outstanding question. Here, we used insect vectors that carry the natural forms of viruses to inoculate plants, best reflecting what happens under field infection conditions with regard to the behavior of viruses and host responses. This is not only important to dissect the natural infection and defense mechanisms, but also important for developing effective technologies to combat viral infection under natural infection conditions. Recent studies indicated that natural infection in early stage of virus infection may trigger different host-defense reaction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garcia et al., 2014</a>)."

Whether it plays a similar role in antiviral defense in other monocots warrants further investigations. From a broader perspective, we expect that further studies on the extensive RNA silencing machinery components evolved in crop plants may lead to new discoveries about their functions in shaping plant diversity with regard to phenotypes and innate immunity mechanisms. Finally, sequestering miR168 by AGO18 to regulate AGO1 homeostasis represents an evolutionary novelty. It raises the question of whether small RNA competition-based regulations between other types of proteins have also evolved to regulate different biological processes in plants and other organisms. This mechanism functions against infection by two evolutionarily distinct viruses, and likely has broader significance in resistance against more viruses in a wide range of monocots. We propose that engineering rice and other cereals to over-express AGO18 may provide a new strategy for the control of diverse viral pathogens."

The AGO18 promoter is induced in infected plants and the mutants are hypersusceptible to virus infection. Conversely the overexpressing plants are less susceptible to infection than the control. However the AGO18 does not bind viral siRNA as effectively as AGO1 and a simple role of this unusual AGO in straightforward RNA silencing is ruled out. The AGO18 bound RNAs are instead enriched for miR168 relative to AGO1. The role of miR168 is to silence the mRNA for AGO1 and so the data are consistent with a model in which AGO18 is a negative regulator of a negative regulator of AGO1. Data to support this model are from: Competition experiments showing that overexpression of AGO18 competed with AGO1 for binding of overexpressed miR168 but not miR443 and from the findings that a mutant AGO18 with defective miRNA binding was not able to complement the mutant phenotype but the protein with inactivating mutations in the nuclease active site did."

The data also do not test the prediction that AGO18 induction in virus-infected plants would mediate overexpression of AGO1 and that the timing of the effect would precede the maximal rate of virus accumulation. The finding that the plant AGO-mediated antiviral silencing can be enhanced in virus-infected plants is not new and the decoy AGO mechanism is also not novel although it was described previously in a different context. Taking the sum of these considerations my view is that the paper in its present form is more suited to a specialist journal."

Specific questions would concern the role of insect vectors in the activation of this gene and the possibility (implied by <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) that there is a systemic signal associated with its induction. We know about signals induced in disease resistant plants but this would be a signal in susceptible plants. Is it an RNA or perhaps it is a JA response induced by the insect vectors of the virus?"

On the other hand, viruses encode viral suppressors to block different steps of posttranscriptional gene silencing pathway (i.e. destabilizing and inhibiting AGO proteins) to counter defense the host responses.

These RNA viruses infect rice by a planthopper vector and establish infection by overcoming the AGO1-mediated antiviral siRNA response in the plant. Nonetheless, the sRNA machinery is highly diversified in rice, encoding 5 DCL and 18 AGO proteins, most of which have still unknown functions. Importantly, the authors opted to use the natural insect vector of the viruses in the inoculation of the plants to mimic the natural infection conditions and be able to discern important effectors in the sRNA mediated antiviral defense. They found that one AGO protein, AGO18, is specifically upregulated by virus infection and also essential for antiviral immunity. They then tried to explore the mechanism underlying AGO18 function. They found that AGO18 bound less viral-derived siRNAs compared to canonical AGO1, leading to their proposal that AGO18 is unlikely an effector protein for viruses. Because they previously published a paper that the viral infection elevate the expression of both miR168 and AGO18, they hypothesized there might be come connection between the two events. They performed a deep-seq and found that AGO18 bound a large amount of miR168 (but not the largest group), and therefore proposed a model and evidence that Ago18 maintains AGO1 level by sequestering miR168 as an antiviral strategy."

Before we obtain these transgenic lines, we hope we can convince this reviewer that AGO18 plays its role in viral resistance through miR168 regulation of AGO1 by providing several lines of evidence: 1) AGO18 and AGO1 are both induced by RSV infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>); 2) AGO18 competes with AGO1 for binding miR168 both in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>) and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>); 3) upregulation of AGO1 by viral infection is compromised in <i>ago18</i> mutant; and 4) our new data showing that the expression of miR168-resistant <i>AGO1a</i> rescued the deficiency of <i>ago18</i> for viral resistance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A, B, C and D</a>)."

As the reviewer suggested, we have also measured the mRNA and protein levels of AGO18 in OE lines before and after RSV infection by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.
