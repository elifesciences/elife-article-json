However, principles relating gamma oscillations, synaptic strength and circuit computations are unclear. We address this in attractor network models that account for grid firing and theta-nested gamma oscillations in the medial entorhinal cortex. We show that moderate intrinsic noise massively increases the range of synaptic strengths supporting gamma oscillations and grid computation. With moderate noise, variation in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic strength tunes the amplitude and frequency of gamma activity without disrupting grid firing. This beneficial role for noise results from disruption of epileptic-like network states. Thus, moderate noise promotes independent control of multiplexed firing rate- and gamma-based computational mechanisms. Our results have implications for tuning of normal circuit function and for disorders associated with changes in gamma oscillations and synaptic strength."

Changing the strength of these connections had different effects on the ability of the MEC to produce gamma waves or spatial maps. However, adjusting the model to include random fluctuations in neuronal firing, or \u2018noise\u2019, was beneficial for both types of output. This is partly because noise prevented neuronal firing from becoming excessively synchronized, which would otherwise have caused seizures."

Specifically, the presence of noise enables relatively small changes in the strength of the connections between neurons to alter gamma waves\u2014and thus affect cognition\u2014without disrupting the neurons' ability to encode spatial locations. Given that noise reduces the likelihood of seizures, the results also raise the possibility that introducing noise into the brain in a controlled way could have therapeutic benefits for individuals with epilepsy."

Gamma activity and cognitive performance often co-vary within tasks and between individuals, while cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia are linked to altered gamma frequency network dynamics (<a href=\"#bib45\">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Spellman and Gordon, 2014</a>). Such disorders are also linked to changes in the efficacy of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lewis et al., 2012</a>). A critical and unresolved issue is the mechanistic relationship between gamma oscillations, the strength of excitation and inhibition, and circuit computations. On the one hand, neural codes based on firing rates may be sufficient for circuit computations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Histed and Maunsell, 2014</a>). In this scenario gamma oscillations might index circuit activation, but would not be required for computation. Evidence that rate coded computations and gamma oscillations arise from shared circuit mechanisms could be interpreted to support this view (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lundqvist et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>), which predicts that when synaptic properties of a circuit are altered then gamma activity and the output of the rate-coded computation will co-vary. Alternatively, gamma oscillations, while sharing cellular substrates with rate-coded computations, may nevertheless support independent or multiplexed computational modes. For example, according to the communication through coherence hypothesis, tuning of gamma frequency activity may facilitate selective interactions between distant brain regions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fries, 2009</a>). In this scenario independent control of rate coded computation and gamma activity would be beneficial, for example by allowing tuning of coherence without disrupting multiplexed rate-coded computations. However, it is unclear how this could be achieved in circuits where gamma and rate-coded computations share common synaptic mechanisms, as this would require variation in synaptic properties to differentially affect gamma activity and the rate coded computation."

During exploration of an environment individual grid cells are active at multiple locations that together follow a hexagonal grid-like organization. At the same time MEC circuits generate periods of activity in the high gamma frequency range (60\u2013120 Hz) nested within a slower theta (8\u201312 Hz) frequency network oscillation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chrobak and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1998</a>). Analysis of spatial correlations in grid firing, of manipulations to grid circuits, and recording of grid cell membrane potential in behaving animals, collectively point towards continuous two-dimensional network attractor states as explanations for grid firing (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonnevie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Domnisoru et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schmidt-Hieber and H\u00e4usser, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yoon et al., 2013</a>). In layer II of the MEC, which has the highest known density of grid cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sargolini et al., 2006</a>), stellate cells that project to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are the major population of excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gatome et al., 2010</a>). These excitatory (E) neurons do not appear to influence one another directly but instead interact via intermediate inhibitory (I) neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dhillon and Jones, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Couey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). Models that explicitly incorporate this recurrent E-I-E connectivity can account for grid firing through velocity-dependent update of network attractor states (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). When these models are implemented with excitable spiking neurons they also account for theta-nested gamma frequency network oscillations (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). The influence in these, or other classes of attractor network models, of the strength of E to I or I to E connections on gamma oscillations and grid firing, or other attractor computations, has not been systematically investigated."

                        "text": "We find that while gamma oscillations and grid firing are both sensitive to the strength of excitatory and inhibitory connections, their relationship differs. Although their underlying synaptic substrates are identical, gamma activity nevertheless provides little information about grid firing or the presence of underlying network attractor states. Thus, gamma activity is not a good predictor of rate-coded computation. Unexpectedly, we find the range of E- and I- synaptic strengths that support gamma and grid firing is massively increased by moderate intrinsic noise through a mechanism involving suppression of seizure-like events. In the presence of moderate noise differences in synaptic strength can tune the amplitude and frequency of gamma across a wide range with little effect on grid firing. We obtain similar results in implementations of E-I models in which connectivity is probabilistic and in models extended to include additional I to I and E to E connections. Our results suggest constraints for extrapolation of differences in gamma activity to mechanisms for cognition, identify noise as a critical factor for successful circuit computation, and suggest that tuning of excitatory or inhibitory synaptic strength could be used to control gamma-dependent processes multiplexed within circuits carrying out rate coded computations."

                        "text": "To systematically explore relationships between strengths of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, computations and gamma activity, we initially take advantage of models that account for both grid firing and theta-nested gamma oscillations through E-I-E interactions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). In these models a layer of E cells sends synaptic connections to a layer of I cells, which in turn feedback onto the E cell layer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). For attractor dynamics to emerge the strength of E and I connections are set to depend on the relative locations of neurons in network space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). While suitable connectivity could arise during development through spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</a>), here the connection profiles are fixed (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). To vary the strength of excitatory or inhibitory connections in the network as a whole we scale the strength of all connections relative to a maximum conductance value (g<sub>E</sub> or g<sub>I</sub> for excitation and inhibition respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We also consider networks in which the connection probability, rather than its strength, varies according to the relative position of neurons in the network (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Each E and I cell is implemented as an exponential integrate and fire neuron and so its membrane potential approximates the dynamics of a real neuron, as opposed to models in which synaptic input directly updates a spike rate parameter. Addition of noise to a single E or I cell increases variability in its membrane potential trajectory approximating that seen in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Domnisoru et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schmidt-Hieber and H\u00e4usser, 2013</a>). Given that all neurons in the model are implemented as exponential integrate-and-fire neurons and that in total the model contains &gt;1.5 million synaptic connections, we optimized a version of the model to enable relatively fast simulation and automated extraction and analysis of generated data (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In this way the effect on grid firing of 31 \u00d7 31 combinations of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> could be evaluated typically using &gt;50 nodes on a computer cluster in approximately 1 week."

To address this we first evaluated grid firing while simulating exploration within a circular environment with a network from which noise sources were absent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). When we reduce the strength of connections from I cells by threefold and increase the strength of connections from E cells by threefold we find that grid firing is abolished (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ab</a> vs <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Aa</a>).

Given that continuous attractor networks are often highly sensitive to noise (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Eliasmith, 2005</a>), we expected that intrinsic noise would reduce the parameter space in which computation is successful. In contrast, when we added noise with standard deviation of 150 pA to the intrinsic dynamics of each neuron, we found that both configurations from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Aa,b</a> now supported grid firing patterns (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ba,b</a>). When we considered the full space of E and I synaptic strengths in the presence of this moderate noise we now found a much larger region that supports grid firing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E\u2013H</a>). This region has a crescent-like shape, with arms of relatively high g<sub>I</sub> and low g<sub>E</sub>, and low g<sub>I</sub> and high g<sub>E</sub>. Thus, while tuning of g<sub>I</sub> and g<sub>E</sub> continues to be required for grid firing, moderate noise massively increases the range of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> over which grid fields are generated."

To systematically explore the range of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> over which the network is most sensitive to the beneficial effects of noise we subtracted grid scores for simulations with 150 pA noise from scores with deterministic simulations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This revealed that the unexpected beneficial effect of noise was primarily in the region of the parameter space where recurrent inhibition was strong. In this region, increasing noise above a threshold led to high grid scores, while further increases in noise progressively impaired grid firing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). In probabilistically connected networks, the range of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> supporting grid firing was reduced, but the shape of the parameter space and dependence on noise was similar to the standard networks (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the dependence of grid firing on g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub>, and the effects of noise, are independent of the detailed implementation of the E-I attractor networks."

                                "text": "How closely does the firing of I cells in the simulated networks correspond to inhibitory activity in behaving animals, and to what extent is the pattern of I cell firing affected by g<sub>E</sub>, g<sub>I</sub> and noise? While there is little data on the spatial firing of interneurons in the MEC, recent evidence indicates that the majority of parvalbumin positive interneurons have firing fields with significant spatial stability, but low spatial sparsity and grid scores compared to excitatory grid cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buetfering et al., 2014</a>). A possible interpretation of these data is that parvalbumin positive cells are unlikely to fulfill the roles of I cells predicted in E-I models. However, in networks that we evaluate here in which E cells have grid firing fields in the presence of moderate noise, I cell firing fields also have a much lower spatial information content and spatial sparsity than the corresponding E cell firing fields (E cells: spatial sparsity 0.788 \u00b1 0.061, spatial information: 1.749 \u00b1 0.32 bits/spike; I cells: spatial sparsity 0.239 \u00b1 0.018, spatial information 0.243 \u00b1 0.024 bits/spike; p &lt; 10<sup>\u221216</sup> for comparisons of both spatial sparsity and information; paired t-test; data range is indicated as mean \u00b1 standard deviation) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Spatial autocorrelograms of simulated I cell firing fields also do not contain the six hexagonally organized peaks that are characteristic of grid fields (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Nevertheless, I cell spatial autocorrelograms produce positive grid scores (0.39 \u00b1 0.16; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), although these are reduced compared to scores for the E cells in the same networks (E cells: 0.796 \u00b1 0.157; p &lt; 10<sup>\u221216</sup>; paired t-test; mean \u00b1 SD) and in many networks are below the threshold considered previously to qualify as grid like (cf. Figure 4B of <a href=\"#bib4\">Buetfering et al., 2014).</a> When we evaluated the dependence of I cell spatial firing on g<sub>E</sub>, g<sub>I</sub> and noise, it appeared to be similar to that of E cells <a href=\"#fig2s3\">(Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To assess whether grid scores of I cells can be reduced further in E-I networks while maintaining grid firing by E cells, we investigated networks in which uncorrelated spatial input is applied to each I cell (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In these simulations E cells had grid scores of 0.57 \u00b1 0.25, spatial sparsity of 0.78 \u00b1 0.03 and spatial information of 1.69 \u00b1 0.18 bits/spike, whereas I cells had grid scores of 0.16 \u00b1 0.2 (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, paired t-test), spatial sparsity of 0.21 \u00b1 0.01 (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, paired t-test) and spatial information of 0.2 \u00b1 0.01 bits/spike (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, paired t-test; range of all data sets is mean \u00b1 SD). Thus, spatial firing of I cells has a similar dependence on noise, g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> to grid cells, conventional indices of spatial firing are nevertheless much lower for I cells in E-I networks compared to E cells, and grid firing by E cells in E-I networks is relatively robust to disruption of the rotational symmetry of I cell firing fields."

In contrast, in the presence of noise with standard deviation 150 pA we observed nested gamma frequency synaptic activity with timing that was consistent between theta cycles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ba</a>). In this condition the frequency of the gamma oscillations was reduced and their amplitude increased by raising g<sub>I</sub> and lowering g<sub>E</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bb</a>).

In this scenario disrupted grid firing would reflect incorrect control of network activity by velocity signals.

For deterministic simulation of the points in parameter space considered in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Aa</a>, which are able to generate grid patterns, we found that a single stable bump of activity emerged over the first 2.5 s of simulated time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Aa</a>).

Quantification across the wider space of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> values (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) indicated that when g<sub>I</sub> is low there is a high probability of bump formation as well as grid firing, whereas when g<sub>I</sub> is high the probability of both is reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast to the deterministic condition, for circuits with intrinsically noisy neurons activity bumps emerged in the first 1.25 s following initialization of the network (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Ac\u2013e</a>) and the area of parameter space that supported bump formation was much larger than that supporting grid firing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Plotting gridness scores as a function of bump probability indicated that bump formation was necessary, although not sufficient for grid formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), while plotting the first autocorrelation peak as a function of bump probability supported our conclusion that grid computation and gamma activity are not closely related (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Together, these data indicate that noise promotes formation of attractor bumps in network activity and in deterministic simulations the failure of the circuit to generate attractor states largely accounts for disrupted grid firing."

We focus initially on the point in parameter space identified in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ab</a>, where grids are found in the presence of moderate noise, and bumps are found when noise is moderate or high. When we examined times of action potentials generated by all neurons in this circuit, we find that in the absence of noise the network generates hyper-synchronous seizure-like states at the start of each theta cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The number of E cells active on each theta cycle differs, but their activity is typically restricted to the rising phase of theta, and there is no consistent structure in the pattern of activated neurons. The number of simultaneously active I cells is also greatest at the start of each theta cycle. The I-cells continue to fire over the theta cycle, but their synchronization declines. When moderate noise is added to the circuit only a subset of E-cells are active on each theta cycle, forming an activity bump (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The I-cells are active at gamma frequency and the formation of an activity bump in the E-cell population is reflected by an inverted bump in the I-cell population activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). With increased noise there is a similar overall pattern of activity, but spike timing becomes more variable, causing the bumps to drift and reducing the degree of synchronization at gamma frequencies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

                                "text": "To determine whether these changes in network dynamics are seen across wider regions of parameter space we first quantified the presence of seizure like events from the maximum population firing rate in any 2 ms window over 10 s of simulation time (E-rate<sub>max</sub>). Strikingly, we found that in the absence of noise epochs with highly synchronized activity were found for almost all combinations of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub>, whereas these seizure-like events were absent in simulations where noise was present (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Interestingly, while grids emerge in deterministic networks in regions of E-I space where E-rate<sub>max</sub> is relatively low, there is a substantial region of parameter space in which E-rate<sub>max</sub> is &gt;400 Hz, but grids are nevertheless formed. It is possible that seizure-like states may be rare in this region of parameter space and so do not interfere sufficiently with attractor dynamics to prevent grid firing. To test this we calculated for each combination of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> the proportion of theta cycles having events with population-average rate &gt;300 Hz (P<sub>E-rate</sub> &gt; 300). For values of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> where grid fields are present P<sub>E-rate</sub> &gt; 300 was relatively low, indicating that seizure-like events are indeed rare (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Consistent with this, when we plotted grid score as a function of P<sub>E-rate</sub> &gt; 300, we found that P<sub>E-rate</sub> &gt; 300 was relatively informative about the gridness score in networks without noise (MIC = 0.624) and a low value of P<sub>E-rate</sub> &gt; 300 was necessary for grid firing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). In contrast, E-rate<sub>max</sub> was less informative of grid firing (0.392 \u2264 MIC \u22640.532) and a wide range of values were consistent with grid firing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Thus, while grid firing is compatible with occasional seizure-like events, when seizure-like events occur on the majority of theta cycles then grid firing is prevented."

                                "text": "Because seizure-like events tend to initiate early on the depolarizing phase of each theta cycle, we asked if synchronization by theta frequency drive plays a role in their initiation. When theta frequency input was replaced with a constant input with the same mean amplitude, the power of gamma oscillations was still dependent on the levels of noise and changes in g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in contrast to simulations with theta frequency input (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>), noise-free networks without theta exhibited hyper-synchronous firing only when g<sub>E</sub> was &lt;0.5 nS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and generated grid firing fields almost in the complete range of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,G</a>). Addition of noise in the absence of theta had mostly detrimental effects on grid firing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F,H,I</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, with intermediate levels of noise, the subregion with high gridness scores (&gt;0.5) retained its crescent-like shape (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,H</a>), but was smaller when compared to the networks with theta frequency inputs (size of regions with and without theta: 488/961 vs 438/961), while the range of gamma frequencies present was much lower than in networks containing theta drive. Together, these data indicate that moderate noise prevents emergence of seizure like states by disrupting synchronization of the attractor network by the shared theta frequency drive. In networks with moderate noise theta drive promotes grid firing and enables a wide range of gamma frequencies to be generated without disrupting grid firing."

However, we wanted to know if other factors might contribute to these beneficial roles of noise. Grid fields may also fail to form if overall activity levels are too low, in which case neurons with grid fields instead encode head direction (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonnevie et al., 2013</a>). This observation is unlikely to explain our results as the mean firing rate of E cells in networks that generated grid firing fields (grid score &gt;0.5, networks with g<sub>E</sub> or g<sub>I</sub> set to 0 excluded) was in fact lower than the firing rate of networks without grid fields (1.2; 1.0; 1.0 Hz grid fields vs 3.0; 2.7; 1.2 Hz no grid fields, in networks with \u03c3 = 0; 150; 300 pA respectively). There was also no systematic relationship between grid score and firing frequency (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We also wanted to know if other properties of grid fields vary as a function of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub>. Parameters used to calibrate velocity integration by the grid network varied very little with changes in g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), whereas drift increased with g<sub>I</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and place cell input was most effective in opposing attractor drift in noisy networks with high gridness scores (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These data are consistent with suppression of seizure like events as the mechanism by which noise promotes grid firing, while interactions between noise and theta frequency inputs profoundly influence the dynamics of attractor networks that generate grid fields."

                                "text": "Our analysis so far focuses on E-I attractor networks as simple models of grid firing that are compatible with the finding that synaptic interactions between stellate cells in layer 2 of the MEC are mediated via inhibitory interneurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dhillon and Jones, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Couey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). However, there is evidence that interneurons active during theta-nested gamma activity make connections to one another as well as to stellate cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). To establish whether this recurrent inhibition substantially modifies our conclusions from simpler E-I networks, we extended the E-I model to also include synapses between interneurons (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In the resulting E-I-I networks, in the absence of noise, grid firing emerges across a much larger region of parameter space compared to E-I networks (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>). However, as in E-I networks occasional seizure like activity was present across a wide range of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), and gamma frequency activity was largely absent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,G</a>). Following addition of noise with standard deviation of 150 pA to E-I-I networks, grid firing was maintained, seizure like activity was abolished, and gamma like activity emerged (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E,H</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Increasing the noise amplitude to 300 pA reduced grid firing and interfered with the emergence of gamma oscillations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,F,I</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1\u20135</a>). Importantly, just as in E-I networks, the presence of moderate noise in E-I-I networks enables tuning of gamma activity by varying g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> while maintaining the ability of the networks to generate grid firing fields. Gamma activity had a higher frequency in E-I-I compared to E-I networks, with a greater proportion of the parameter space supporting gamma frequencies &gt;80 Hz. This higher frequency gamma is similar to fast gamma observed experimentally in the MEC (cf. <a href=\"#bib6\">Chrobak and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). Thus, by including additional features of local circuits in layer 2 of the MEC, E-I-I models may more closely recapitulate experimental observations. Nevertheless, E-I-I networks maintain the ability, in the presence of moderate noise, for variation in g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> to tune gamma oscillations without interfering with grid firing."

While the E-I model is consistent with the connectivity between stellate cells in layer 2 of the MEC, adjacent pyramidal cells may also have grid firing properties. Unlike stellate cells, pyramidal cells interact with one another directly via excitatory connections and indirectly via inhibitory interneurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Couey et al., 2013</a>). To assess the impact of E-E connections, we first extended the E-I model to allow each E cell to excite other E cells that are nearby in neuron space. The dependence of grid firing, gamma oscillations, and bump formation on noise, g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> was similar to E-I networks (<a href=\"#fig7s6\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 6\u20139</a>). We also attempted to evaluate networks in which E-E connections were structured, but E-I and I-E connections were uniformly distributed. However, in these networks we were unable to identify parameters that support formation of stable activity bumps (<a href=\"#fig7s10\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). This is consistent with instability of simpler network attractors based on E-E connections (<a href=\"#bib35\">Seung et al., 2000</a>)."

While in the models we consider rate coding and gamma oscillations share the same neural substrate, that is projections from a population of E cells to an I cell population, which in turn projects back to the E cell population, we find that their sensitivity to variations in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strengths nevertheless differs. A moderate level of noise promotes generation of both grid fields and nested gamma oscillations, primarily by the disruption of epileptic-like firing of E and I cells in the network. When the strength of E or I connections is varied in the presence of moderate noise a wide range of gamma frequency and power can be obtained without affected grid firing. Thus, noise can be beneficial for computations performed by the nervous system, while the frequency and power of multiplexed gamma oscillations can be tuned independently of rate-coded grid computations, suggesting a mechanism for differential control of multiplexed neural codes."

In general noise in the nervous system is believed to distort the fidelity of transmitted signals (<a href=\"#bib13\">Faisal et al., 2008</a>). Exceptions are stochastic resonance phenomena in which noise promotes detection of small amplitude signals by individual neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Longtin et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Benzi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shu et al., 2003</a>), improvements in signal coding through desynchronization of neuronal populations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hunsberger et al., 2014</a>) and emergence of stochastic weak synchronization in interneuron networks (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tiesinga and Jose, 2000</a>). The beneficial role for noise that we identify here differs from these phenomena in that it emerges through interactions between populations of neurons and because the grid cell attractor network performs a computation\u2014generation of a spatial code from velocity inputs\u2014rather than propagating input signals. We find that by opposing emergence of hyper-sychronous seizure-like states noise allows the network to generate stable bump attractor states. Noise prevents the seizure-like states by desynchronizing neuronal responses to common theta input. We were able to identify this role for noise because spiking and synaptic dynamics are explicitly represented in the simulated network. These dynamics are absent from other attractor network models of grid firing (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fuhs and Touretzky, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Guanella et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burak and Fiete, 2009</a>). They are also absent from other models of theta-nested gamma oscillations that simulate two-dimensional dynamical systems of E and I populations with theta modulated inputs to the network (<a href=\"#bib29\">Onslow et al., 2014</a>). Thus, intrinsic cellular and synaptic dynamics in conjunction with noise sources may be important in accounting for computations and oscillatory activity in neural networks."

Current available experimental data appears to be insufficient to distinguish between these different models. For example, our analysis of interneuron firing indicates that while E-I models predict that interneurons will have spatial firing fields, they have lower spatial information content, spatial sparsity and grid scores than E cells and therefore may be difficult to detect in existing experimental datasets and with current analysis tools. Thus, evidence previously interpreted to argue against E-I based mechanisms for grid firing may in fact not distinguish these from other possible mechanisms. Indeed, we found that grid firing by E cells can be maintained during spatial input that distorts the spatial firing pattern of I cells (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). While these simulations establish in principle that E-I based attractor networks can generate grid outputs even when spatial firing of many E and I cells in the network is not clearly grid-like, the extent to which these networks can account for additional details of experimental observations, for example weak periodic patterns in the spatial autocorrelation of the firing fields of some PV interneurons (cf. <a href=\"#bib4\">Buetfering et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), is not yet clear. Our results are consistent with local synaptic connections, in addition to those between E cells and I cells, having important functional roles. For example addition of synapses between interneurons to E-I networks causes an overall increase in the frequency of gamma activity and in the stability of grid firing. Nevertheless, we find that in these modified networks moderate noise still enables variation in g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> to tune gamma oscillations independently from grid firing."

                        "text": "An intriguing aspect of our results is that they suggest novel approaches to suppressing seizures and to promoting normal cognitive function. Seizures have previously been suggested to result from deficits in inhibition or from alterations in intrinsic excitability of neurons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lerche et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Treiman, 2001</a>). We show that seizures can be induced when these properties are held constant simply by reducing levels of noise within a circuit. A future experimental challenge for dissecting the contribution of intrinsic noise to seizures will be to target biological noise sources. In the brain noise arises from ion channel gating and from background synaptic activity. It is therefore difficult to manipulate noise sources without also affecting intrinsic excitability or excitation-inhibition balance. However, it may be feasible to add noise to circuits through transcranial magnetic stimulation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ruzzoli et al., 2010</a>). In this case our simulations predict that addition of noise may restore epileptic circuits to normal activity. This mechanism may explain why focal electrical stimulation of the entorhinal cortex in patients with seizures leads to an enhancement of memory performance (<a href=\"#bib42\">Suthana et al., 2012</a>)."

We were able to address this issue directly by analyzing a circuit in which gamma oscillations and rate-coded computations arise from a shared mechanism. Rather than gamma serving as an index of rate-coded computation, we find instead that there is a substantial parameter space across which rate-coded computation is stable, while the amplitude and frequency of theta-nested gamma oscillations varies. Our analysis leads to several new and testable predictions. First, tuning of recurrent synaptic connections could be used to modify gamma oscillations without affecting rate-coded computation. If multiple networks of the kind we simulate here correspond to grid modules providing input to downstream neurons in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>), then adjusting g<sub>E</sub> or g<sub>I</sub> would alter gamma frequency with minimal effect on the grid firing pattern of each module. If the downstream neurons integrate input at the gamma time scale, then this should lead to re-mapping of their place representation in the absence of any change in either the strength of their synaptic inputs or the information they receive from upstream grid cells. Adjustment of g<sub>E</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> could be achieved dynamically through actions of neuromodulators (<a href=\"#bib26\">Marder, 2012</a>), or on slower developmental time scales (<a href=\"#bib47\">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</a>). Second, subtle differences in gamma could be a sensitive index of network pathology at stages before deficits in rate coded computation are apparent. If cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders reflect a failure of rate coded computation, then our analysis predicts that a change in noise within a circuit, in addition to synaptic modification, may be necessary for deficits to emerge. From this perspective it is intriguing that seizure phenotypes are often associated with disorders such as autism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deykin and MacMahon, 1979</a>). Alternatively, cognitive deficits may result from a failure to coordinate gamma frequency synchronization of circuits that converge on downstream targets. In this case we expect cognitive deficits to be phenocopied by manipulations that affect gamma frequency or power without influencing rate-coded computations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Spellman and Gordon, 2014</a>)."

Our results highlight the challenges in straightforward interpretation of experiments in which these parameters are correlated to one another, (cf. <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang and Krystal, 2014</a>). While there are parallels to investigations of pace-making activity in invertebrate circuits (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marder and Taylor, 2011</a>), which demonstrate that many parameter combinations can account for higher order behavior, there are also critical differences in that the models we describe account for multiplexing of rate-coded computation and oscillatory activity, while the number of neurons and connections in the simulated circuit is much larger. Future experimentation will be required to test our model predictions for unexpected beneficial roles of noise and for control of gamma oscillations independently from grid firing by modulating the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections."

The network investigated in the majority of simulations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1\u20136</a>) is modified from that in <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al. (2013)</a> and consists of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations of neurons that were arranged on a twisted torus with dimensions of 34 \u00d7 30 neurons. In networks where connection strengths were generated probabilistically instead of in an all-to-all way, the synaptic weights from E to I cells and vice versa were constant, while the probability of connection between the pre- and post-synaptic neuron was drawn according to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. In addition, some networks also included direct uniform recurrent inhibition between I cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>; referred to as E-I-I networks) or direct structured recurrent excitation between E cells (<a href=\"#fig7s10\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 6\u201310</a>). When recurrent excitation was present, synaptic weights between E cells followed the connectivity profile in which the strongest connection was between cells that were close to each other in network space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and the weights between E and I cells were generated either according to synaptic profiles from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> (<a href=\"#fig7s6\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 6\u20139</a>) or the E-I connectivity was uniform with a probability of connection of 0.1 (<a href=\"#fig7s10\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). E and I cells also received the theta current drive which was the sum of a constant amplitude positive current and a current with sinusoidal waveform (8 Hz). The constant component of the drive was required to activate the circuit, while the theta drive frequency was chosen to reflect the frequency of theta oscillations in behaving animals. The amplitude (cf. <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>) was chosen to produce theta modulation of I cell firing similar to that observed in behaving animals (cf. <a href=\"#bib6\">Chrobak and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1998</a>) and ex-vivo models of theta-nested gamma activity (cf. <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). In order to oppose drift of the activity bump in networks that simulated exploration of the arena E cells received input from cells with place-like firing fields simulated as Poisson spiking generators with their instantaneous firing rate modeled as a Gaussian function of the animal position.

Here, it is the slow kinetics of <i>g</i><sub>NMDA</sub> that is necessary to maintain the state of the network during consecutive theta cycles. NMDA receptors are known to be of several variants, depending on the types of the subunits the receptors are composed of (<a href=\"#bib7a\">Paoletti et al., 2013</a>). These several receptor variants have different kinetic time scales, and different sensitivity to the concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In <a href=\"#bib6a\">Jones and Buhl (1993)</a>, the authors do not report, quantitatively, to what extent the amplitude of the NMDA-mediated synaptic responses are dependent on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Therefore, we assume here that the slow kinetics of <i>g</i><sub>NMDA</sub> is sufficient to stabilise the activity of the network and do not include voltage-dependence of NMDA conductances."

The description of the parameters in the equations can be found in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Appendix table 2</a>. The theta current drive is the sum of a constant amplitude positive current (<i>I</i><sub>const</sub>) and a current with sinusoidal waveform (<i>I</i><sub><i>\u03b8</i></sub>). The constant component of the drive is required to activate the circuit. If it is removed then the circuit becomes silent. The sinusoidal waveform has a frequency of 8 Hz. This is chosen to reflect the frequency of theta oscillations in behaving animals. The amplitude is chosen to produce theta modulation of interneuron firing similar to that observed in behaving animals (cf. <a href=\"#bib6\">Chrobak and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1998</a>) and in ex-vivo models of theta-nested gamma activity (cf. <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). While <i>I</i><sub>const</sub> and <i>I</i><sub><i>\u03b8</i></sub> are simple functions of time, the velocity modulated current and place cell current are described separately. The velocity modulated current is described in \u2018Velocity modulated input current\u2019 and the place cell input current in \u2018Place cell input\u2019."

During this stage, the theta-modulated input is switched off and the network receives only the constant input source (see <a href=\"#equ14\">Equation 9</a>). The bump attractor might not form spontaneously, and instead the network could persist in a uniform firing rate regime (<a href=\"#bib4a\">Compte et al., 2000</a>). However, it might be possible that when forced into the attractor state, the network will persist (data not shown). Therefore, we used the place cell input as a spatially-tuned input that served (i) as an initialisation input in order to drive the network into an attractor state if this does not happen spontaneously and (ii) to initialise the bump attractor position so that the phase of grid firing fields matched the positions of place fields. The initialisation phase lasted for the first 500 ms of simulation time, during which the firing rate of place cells were doubled, and the strength of connections from place cells to grid cells was increased 10-fold."

Here, for each value of <i>g</i><sub>E</sub> and <i>g</i><sub>I</sub>, the main simulation run was preceded by a number of shorter simulations which determined how much current needs to be injected in order for the bump of activity to track the simulated movement of an animal (\u2018Estimating gain of the velocity-dependent inputs\u2019). This procedure calibrates the gain of the velocity input current in order to produce grid fields with a specified spacing between the peaks in the individual firing fields. The result is a single number in units of neurons/s/pA, which determines the speed of the bump as a function of injected velocity input. The spacing between the individual fields of the grid firing fields was set to 60 cm in all of the simulations."

Each of the runs was repeated four times for simulations in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and three times for simulations in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013I</a> and once for networks that contain additional recurrent synapses between E cells or I cells, as well as in networks with synapses generated probabilistically. These simulations use the estimated velocity response gain in order to calibrate the spacing between the grid firing fields. After the simulation was finished, a neuron in the bottom-left corner of the torus was selected for analysis. For this cell the gridness score of its firing field was computed. The reasoning behind choosing only a single cell to estimate the gridness score is as follows. The grid firing fields in the network are a result of coordination of activity of the network as a whole. If the network forms a bump attractor that is able to accurately track animal movement, all cells in the network will have grid-like firing fields that differ only in their phases. On the other hand, if the bump attractor does not form, is unstable, or does not accurately track the position of the animal, the gridness score of all cells will be low. Thus, the firing field of a single cell in the network represents grid field computation in the network as a whole. Moreover, this cell can be selected arbitrarily. This condition might not hold in simulations where I cells receive uncorrelated spatial inputs and therefore in these simulations firing fields of 100 randomly selected cells from both E and I populations were used to calculate the gridness scores (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In these experiments, instead of simulating animal movement, a shorter, 10 s simulation, was run. The velocity and place cell input were deactivated. Thus, the network is expected to only produce a static bump attractor and does not perform path integration. For each parameter setting (determined by <i>g</i><sub>E</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>I</sub>, and the noise level), five simulations were performed. For each simulation run, post-synaptic currents were recorded from 25 randomly selected excitatory cells in the model by clamping their membrane potential at \u221250 mV (this was done by simulating a separate process for each of the selected neurons, while simulating the original membrane potential according to <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). Thus, on each run, different cells could be picked up for analysis. It is in principle possible to record membrane currents from all the neurons. However, the amount of data generated by such simulations quickly becomes overwhelming (on the order of several terabytes per parameter exploration experiment). Thus the approach chosen here was to sample from the population of neurons and store the recorded state variables of only a subset of these. This allowed for unrestricted analysis and visualisation of the recorded state variables."

The positions of local maxima were calculated as those points in the autocorrelation function where the first difference of the signal changed sign from positive to negative and thus approximated points where the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is negative. The power and frequency of the underlying oscillation was then estimated from the correlation value and from the time lag of the first detected autocorrelation peak respectively. Both values were averaged over all 25 recorded neurons and then subsequently averaged over all simulation trials."

This was a problem for standard attractor model connectivity, so the authors conceived the E-I-E attractor model. I think this is great. But, it remains possible that layer II pyramidal cells do show recurrent connectivity, which would support the standard attractor models. There is now controversy which cell types correspond to grid cells, and thus far the published (recent Neuron paper from Brecht's lab) and unpublished (David Roland's poster at SfN from the Moser lab) data suggest that both cell types in layer II are grid cells. Since pyramidal cells might/probably show recurrent connectivity, I would like to know if the same principles about noise emphasized by this paper would also apply to more standard E\u2013E attractor models. I wouldn't ask the authors to explicitly model this, but do the authors have any insight about this that they could add to the Discussion? This is especially relevant to their very broad discussion about the beneficial role of noise in neural computation in general and the protective role of noise against seizures. Most cortical circuits have recurrent excitatory connectivity. Perhaps the authors could address more standard E\u2013E attracter that contains global inhibition in their discussion."

This criticism manifests from Buettfering et al., 2014 who report that PV interneurons do not show grid firing patterns. The authors have completed additional analyses and expanded their discussion to argue that these experimental data are no inconsistent with E-I models. (1) I cells in their model are weakly tuned grid cells (often below the gridness threshold used by Buettfering). (2) New simulations show that I cells show less grid-like activity when they are connected to uncorrelated grid cells. (3) The authors point out that <a href=\"#bib4\">Buetfering et al., 2014</a> only examine PV interneurons, and thus, other interneurons could exhibit grid firing fields. Overall I find these arguments convincing (especially #2), which fuel the debate about the structure of plausible E-I models and lead to new predictions (non-spatially correlated input to I cells, and/or other interneuron classes show grid properties). Close examination of experimental data show clear grids and not-so-clear grids (Krupic, Burgess, and O'Keefe, 2012) which may to correspond to firing on different theta phases (Newman and Hasselmo, 2014), similar to many interneuron classes in CA1 of the hippocampus."

Our new data demonstrate that this scenario has little impact on our main conclusions. Second, we evaluate scenarios in which only connections between excitatory neurons are structured. We find that in this scenario excitatory feedback causes circuits to become unstable and as a result we are unable to identify network configurations that support grid firing. This is consistent with previous theoretical work demonstrating instability of much simpler attractor networks based exclusively on structured excitation. As these new data suggest that structured connections between excitatory neurons are on their own unlikely to support grid firing in networks of spiking neurons, they further support our proposal that grid attractors are primarily generated through interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cells."

These observations were interpreted by Buetfering et al. as evidence against E-I models, which we showed previously to predict spatial firing by I cells (cf. <a href=\"#bib30\">Pastoll et al., 2013</a>). However, before reaching this conclusion it is important to first consider carefully the predictions of E-I models. We now report additional analysis which demonstrates that in E-I models that generate grid firing, the firing fields of I cells have substantially lower spatial sparsity, spatial information and grid scores than E cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2\u20133)</a>.

Importantly, in these simulations we find further reductions in the rotational symmetry of interneuron firing fields, and as a result a further reduction of their grid scores. We report this new data in Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 6. Together, these results establish that E-I networks can generate grid firing by E cells in conditions in which I cells have spatial firing that does not satisfy current metrics for gridness.

This was a problem for standard attractor model connectivity, so the authors conceived the E-I-E attractor model. I think this is great. But, it remains possible that layer II pyramidal cells do show recurrent connectivity, which would support the standard attractor models. There is now controversy which cell types correspond to grid cells, and thus far the published (recent Neuron paper from Brecht's lab) and unpublished (David Roland's poster at SfN from the Moser lab) data suggest that both cell types in layer II are grid cells. Since pyramidal cells might/probably show recurrent connectivity, I would like to know if the same principles about noise emphasized by this paper would also apply to more standard E\u2013E attractor models. I wouldn't ask the authors to explicitly model this, but do the authors have any insight about this that they could add to the Discussion? This is especially relevant to their very broad discussion about the beneficial role of noise in neural computation in general and the protective role of noise against seizures. Most cortical circuits have recurrent excitatory connectivity. Perhaps the authors could address more standard E\u2013E attracter that contains global inhibition in their discussion</i>."

There is evidence that pyramidal cells also interact via inhibitory interneurons (Varga et al., 2010) and therefore pure E\u2013E models are unlikely to be applicable. However, it is possible models in which E\u2013E coupling co-exists with E- &gt; I and I- &gt; E coupling might also be consistent with experimental data. We have therefore explored this issue with additional simulations. The results of these simulations of E-E-I networks are similar to our findings with E-I networks.
