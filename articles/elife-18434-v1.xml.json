The RNA methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 are components of a multisubunit m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex whose enzymatic activity is substantially higher than the activities of METTL3 or METTL14 alone. The molecular mechanism underpinning this synergistic effect is poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic core of the human m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex comprising METTL3 and METTL14. The structure reveals the heterodimeric architecture of the complex and donor substrate binding by METTL3. Structure-guided mutagenesis indicates that METTL3 is the catalytic subunit of the complex, whereas METTL14 has a degenerate active site and plays non-catalytic roles in maintaining complex integrity and substrate RNA binding. These studies illuminate the molecular mechanism and evolutionary history of eukaryotic m<sup>6</sup>A modification in post-transcriptional genome regulation."

As the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic messenger and long non-coding RNAs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dominissini et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>), m<sup>6</sup>A has been shown to regulate the processing (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alarc\u00f3n et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiao et al., 2016</a>), translation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2015</a>) and stability (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>) of cellular transcripts. In mRNAs, the modification is typically found clustered around the stop codon and within 3\u2019 untranslated regions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dominissini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>); the presence of m<sup>6</sup>A in 5\u2019 untranslated regions has in turn been shown to promote 5\u2019 cap-independent translation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Meyer et al., 2015</a>). m<sup>6</sup>A is implicated in controlling stem cell differentiation and embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib5\">Batista et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Geula et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2014b</a>), the mammalian circadian clock (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fustin et al., 2013</a>), as well as in stress responses such as heat shock (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). The modification is reversible due to the interplay of methyltransferase (MTase) \u2018writer\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2014</a>) and demethylase \u2018eraser\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>) enzymes. Transcripts containing m<sup>6</sup>A marks are specifically recognized and regulated by \u2018reader\u2019 proteins, in particular members of the YTH domain family (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stoilov et al., 2002</a>). The cytoplasmic protein YTHDF2 specifically recognizes and destabilizes m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs by promoting their localization to processing (P-) bodies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>), while YTHDF1 stimulates mRNA translation by interactions with translation initiation factors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2015</a>).

WTAP does not have MTase activity but is required for efficient RNA methylation in vivo and for localization of METTL3 and METTL14 to nuclear speckles (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ping et al., 2014</a>). The m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from the donor substrate S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the adenine nucleobases in acceptor RNA substrates (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bokar et al., 1997</a>). The complex preferentially modifies substrate RNAs conforming to the consensus sequence GGACU but otherwise appears to have little specificity for structural features in its RNA substrates (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Both METTL3 and METTL14 have been shown to have weak m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase activity in isolation. However, physical interaction between METTL3 and METTL14 results in substantially higher MTase activity than the sum of the activities of the individual methyltransferase subunits (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Despite recent advances in understanding the biological roles of m<sup>6</sup>A modification, the molecular architecture of the m6A writer complex and its mechanism of RNA methylation are poorly understood. In particular, the molecular basis for the synergistic enhancement of MTase activity within the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex is unknown."

                                "text": "The m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex contains two putative catalytic subunits - METTL3 and METTL14. Previous studies have shown that METTL3 and METTL14 physically interact with each other and that their association has a synergistic effect on the catalytic activity of the complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). To obtain structural insights into the molecular architecture and mechanism of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex, we sought to determine the crystal structure of the catalytic core of the complex comprising the two methyltransferase (MTase) subunits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To this end, we co-expressed human METTL3 and METTL14 in insect cells. The purified METTL3-METTL14 complex was catalytically active (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) but failed to crystallize. Both METTL3 and METTL14 polypeptides contain a central MTA-70 methyltransferase domain (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bujnicki et al., 2002</a>). METTL3 additionally contains an N-terminal region harboring two putative CCCH zinc finger motifs, whereas in METTL14, the MTA-70 domain is flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions containing low-complexity sequences (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iyer et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To identify protein constructs amenable to crystallization, the full-length METTL3-METTL14 complex was subjected to limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin and N-terminal sequencing. Based on these experiments, we engineered N- and C-terminally truncated forms of both METTL3 and METTL14, comprising residues 354\u2013580 and 107\u2013395, respectively. The MTase activity of the truncated METTL3-METTL14 dimer was reduced to background level, indicating that the terminal extensions are required for efficient substrate RNA binding or catalysis. Further experiments using complexes in which only METTL3 or METTL14 was truncated showed that the catalytic activity is contingent upon the presence of full-length METTL3, while the N- and C-terminal extensions flanking the central region comprising residues 107\u2013395 in METTL14 are dispensable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The truncated METTL3-METTL14 complex was crystallized and its structure solved by a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction approach utilizing the anomalous signal of native sulfur atoms. Experimentally-phased electron density maps revealed the presence of a single molecule of the donor product S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), serendipitously co-purified with the complex, in the METTL3 active site (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). High-resolution native data were subsequently measured from a METTL3-METTL14 crystal grown in the presence of SAH and a short m<sup>6</sup>A-containing oligonucleotide. However, the RNA oligonucleotide was not evident in electron density maps. The final atomic model, containing a single METTL3-METTL14 dimer in the asymmetric unit, was refined at a resolution of 1.85\u2009\u00c5 with an <i>R</i><sub>free</sub> of 19.0%, working <i>R</i> of 15.7%, and good stereochemistry (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We additionally co-crystallized the METTL3-METTL14 core complex in the presence of the donor substrate S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Using these crystals, a structure of the METTL3-METTL14 complex, in which the co-purified SAH product was exchanged by SAM, was determined at a resolution of 1.9\u2009\u00c5 and refined to an <i>R</i><sub>free</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>work</sub> values of 18.6% and 15.7%, respectively. No additional electron density attributable to SAM or SAH could be observed in the proximity of METTL14 in the two structures. Disulfide bridge formation was observed between Cys338<sup>METTL14</sup> and Cys388<sup>METTL14</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The MTase activity of the METTL3-14 complex has previously been reported to be sensitive to reducing agents (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2016</a>), suggesting that disulfide bond formation could play a role in regulating the catalytic activity of the complex. However, substitution of Cys338<sup>METTL14</sup> with alanine had little impact on MTase activity, indicating that disulfide bond formation in METTL14 is not required for the function of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

                                "text": "The structures of the METTL3-METTL14 complex reveal that the two methyltransferase subunits form a compact pseudosymmetric heterodimer with overall dimensions of 80 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 35\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Both METTL3 and METTL14 belong to the Group I clade of eukaryotic N<sup>6</sup>A-MTases (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iyer et al., 2016</a>). The core of each methyltransferase subunit is formed by a Rossman fold domain comprising a central, curved, eight-stranded beta sheet flanked by four alpha helices (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The METTL3 and METTL14 MTase domains dimerize through an extensive interface that buries 2055 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> of solvent-accessible surface area per subunit. The symmetric part of the dimerization interface is formed by strands \u03b24\u20135 and helix \u03b14 of each MTase domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and involves a network of hydrogen bonding interactions as well as hydrophobic contacts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The hydrophobic region of the METT3-METTL14 interface, centered on strands \u03b24\u20135, is capped by the side chain of Ile134<sup>METTL14</sup> from an N-terminal extension of METTL14 comprising residues Asn117-Asp136<sup>METTL14</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The METTL14\u2009N-terminal extension, which lacks secondary structure except for a short alpha-helical motif (Tyr119-Thr126<sup>METTL14</sup>), breaks the overall pseudo-C2 symmetry of the heterodimer and shields the hydrophobic dimerization interface from solvent exposure. Of note, we were unable to express soluble METTL3-METTL14 complexes lacking the N-terminal METTL14 extension. Unlike METTL14, METTL3 lacks equivalent amino acid residues in the region upstream of the methyltransferase domain. Finally, the dimerization interaction is reinforced by two partially disordered loops, one from each subunit (residues Arg468-Lys480<sup>METTL3</sup> and Lys266-Arg283<sup>METTL14</sup>), that reach over and insert an aromatic residue (Trp475<sup>METTL3</sup> and Phe281<sup>METTL14</sup>, respectively) into a hydrophobic pocket in the other subunit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

Both studies utilized a slightly different METTL3-METTL14 construct, yielding a different crystal form of the complex. Overall, all structures are in good agreement with one another, the major difference being the absence of an ordered polypeptide chain linking the N-terminal helical motif of METTL14 and the methyltransferase domain in the structure reported in this study (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Additionally, the structure reported in this study lacks a C-terminal helix in METTL14 due to a\u00a0different choice of METTL14 domain boundaries and instead contains the Cys338<sup>METTL14</sup>\u2013Cys388<sup>METTL14</sup> disulfide bridge. Further structural differences between the different crystal forms can be attributed to the intrinsic flexibility of loop regions and differences in crystal packing (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The SAM binding site is enclosed from opposite sides by partially disordered loop containing Asp395-Thr408<sup>METTL3</sup> (termed active site loop 1, ASL1) and a fully ordered loop comprising residues Arg508-Lys513<sup>METTL3</sup> (hereafter termed active site loop 2, ASL2). A conserved DPPW motif (Asp395-Pro398<sup>METTL3</sup>) in ASL1, characteristic of N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iyer et al., 2016</a>), is likely involved in coordinating the adenine group of the acceptor substrate.

However, neither SAM nor SAH were observed to be bound to METTL14 in the METTL3-14 complex structures. Modeling a molecule of SAM in the METTL14 active site reveals that the binding would be precluded by steric clashes between the adenine moiety and the side chains of Trp211<sup>METTL14</sup> and Pro362<sup>METTL14</sup> in the absence of compensatory structural changes in METTL14. Moreover, METTL14 lacks residues that could form hydrogen-bonding contacts to the ribose hydroxyls in SAM, as residues Asn549<sup>METTL3</sup> and Gln550<sup>METTL3</sup> correspond to Pro362<sup>METTL14</sup> and Thr363<sup>METTL14</sup>, respectively. Additionally, the putative acceptor binding site in METTL14 is occluded by the side chains of Tyr198<sup>METTL14</sup>, Tyr199<sup>METTL14</sup> and Ile324<sup>METTL14</sup> projecting from loops corresponding to ASL1 and ASL2 in METTL3 (Glu192-Cys210<sup>METTL14</sup> and Pro319-Lys326<sup>METTL14</sup>, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Collectively, these observations suggest that METTL14 contains a degenerate active site that is unable to accommodate donor and acceptor substrates, implying that METTL14 is catalytically inactive. To test this hypothesis, we targeted putative active site residues implicated in donor substrate binding and catalysis in METTL3 and METTL14 by site-directed mutagenesis, and assayed the methyltransferase activities of resulting complexes using an RNA oligonucleotide containing the consensus m<sup>6</sup>A methylation sequence GGACU. Substitutions of Asp395<sup>METTL3</sup> or Asn549<sup>/</sup>Gln550<sup>METTL3</sup> to alanine reduced the methyltransferase activity of the complex to background levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

With the acceptor adenine bound in the active site of METTL3, the ribose-phosphate backbone of the RNA substrate is placed over a positively charged groove located at the interface of the METTL3 and METTL14 subunits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). This groove is highly evolutionarily conserved and comprises residues Arg465<sup>METTL3</sup>, Arg468<sup>METTL3</sup>, His474<sup>METTL3</sup>, His478<sup>METTL3</sup> and Arg245<sup>METTL14</sup>, Arg249<sup>METTL14</sup>, Arg254<sup>METTL14</sup> and Arg255<sup>METTL14</sup>. The last four residues form a positively charged pocket occupied by a co-crystallized acetate ion, possibly mimicking RNA phosphate group binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These observations suggest that this surface mediates substrate RNA binding and are in good agreement with the presence of bound donor substrate and product in the METTL3 active site and lack of catalytic activity in active site mutants of METTL3. In contrast, the corresponding surface adjacent to the putative active site in METTL14 on the opposite face of the METTL3-14 dimer lacks evolutionary conservation and is mostly negatively charged (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This argues against substrate RNA binding by this surface and further underscores the notion that METTL14 is catalytically inactive. To test the hypothesis that the positively charged groove adjacent to the METTL3 active site at the METT3-METTL14 dimer interface is involved in substrate RNA binding, we substituted Arg254<sup>METTL14</sup> with alanine and assayed the resulting complex for MTase activity. The activity of the R254A<sup>METTL14</sup> mutant complex was substantially lower than in the wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). When Arg255<sup>METTL14</sup> was additionally mutated to alanine, the catalytic activity of resulting R254A/R255A<sup>METTL14</sup> double mutant complex was reduced to background levels, further suggesting that these residues are involved in substrate RNA binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). We additionally tested the involvement of the amino acid residues in the putative acceptor binding pockets in METTL3 and METTL14. Alanine substitution of Tyr406<sup>METTL3</sup> reduced the MTase activity of the complex to background level. In contrast, substitution of Tyr198<sup>METTL14</sup> had little effect on MTase activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

Despite rapid progress in understanding the biological functions of m<sup>6</sup>A, there have been only limited mechanistic insights into the basic molecular machinery that installs this epitranscriptomic mark. In this study, we have defined the catalytic core of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex and determined the structure of its complexes with methyl group donor substrates and products. Our findings are in good agreement with other recent structural studies of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2016a</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2016b</a>). The molecular architecture of the METTL3-METTL14 dimer is strikingly similar to that of homodimeric bacterial N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine DNA methyltransferases such as EcoP15I. This hints at an evolutionary scenario in which the m6A writer enzyme emerged by the\u00a0acquisition of a bacterial homodimeric DNA methyltransferase. Subsequent gene duplication and sequence divergence of the METTL3 and METTL14 subunits may have driven the specificity switch towards RNA."

Of note, we have not been able to express and purify soluble METTL14 in the absence of METTL3, suggesting that METTL3 is required to stabilize METTL14. Our observations are fully consistent with a recent genetic study showing that knockout of either METTL3 or METTL14 in mouse embryonic stem cells resulted in complete loss of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in mRNA (<a href=\"#bib15\">Geula et al., 2015</a>). Although both METTL3 and METTL14 have previously been reported to harbor weak m<sup>6</sup>A MTase activity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2014</a>), our structural and biochemical data indicate that METTL3 is the sole catalytic subunit within the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex. Neither SAM nor SAH was observed to bind to METTL14 in the structures. Moreover, the putative active site in METTL14 is sterically blocked and lacks specific amino acid residues that would facilitate donor and acceptor substrate binding. Consistently, engineered mutations in the active site of METTL3 compromise the MTase activity of the complex, while corresponding mutations in METTL14 have little or no effect. These observations suggest that METTL14 is not catalytically active and likely has a twofold function in maintaining the integrity of the complex and in facilitating RNA substrate binding, explaining the synergistic effect of the METTL3-METTL14 interaction on enzymatic activity of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex."

Consistent with the model, mutations of arginine residues at the METTL3-METTL14 interface substantially reduce the MTase activity of the complex. However, given that the truncated complex used for crystallographic analysis lacks catalytic activity in vitro compared to the complexes containing full-length METTL3, the N-terminal extension of METTL3 is also required for the MTase activity of the core m<sup>6</sup>A complex. It is tempting to speculate that the two N-terminal CCCH zinc finger motifs of METTL3 are essential for catalytic activity, perhaps by contributing to specific recognition of the consensus methylation sequence. Interestingly, despite the spatial proximity of the N-terminal extension of METTL14 to the active site of METTL3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), additional sequences in the N-terminal low complexity region of METTL14 are dispensable for catalytic activity."

Another structural analysis of the METTL3-METTL14 complex, published while this work was under revision (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2016a</a>), has corroborated our model and validated the requirement for the METTL3 zinc finger motifs for methyltransferase activity.

This modification is not only important for its role in regulation of stability, translation and processing of cellular transcripts but is also vital for stem cell differentiation and embryonic development. Its regulatory role is also signified by the discovery of demethylases that reverses this reaction. The forward reaction for m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is catalyzed by a complex composed of two proteins METTL3 and METTL14, which are actively under investigation in recent years. In this manuscript, the authors obtained high resolution crystal structures of a minimal domain constructs of METTL3-METTL14 complex in the presence of the methyl donor substrate (SAM) and the product (SAH). In essence, the structure shows that METTL3 -METTL14 forms a stable complex with extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The authors also point out that, although the catalytic site resides in the METTL3, the full length METLL14 is also an essential component for the catalytic activity. They also verified this observation by showing a structure superposition of METTL3-METTL14 complex with the structure of DNA methyltransferase EcoP15I bound to substrate DsDNA. The model suggests that the substrate RNA binds to a conserved positively charged interface of METTL3-METTL14 complex while positioning the acceptor adenine moiety in the catalytic pocket of METTL3.This observation was further investigated by point mutation at the proposed binding surface responsible for the RNA binding."

Moreover, the authors contradict the previous reports of presence of activity in the isolated METTL3 and METTL14 subunits. This lack of activity is also explained convincingly by the crystal structure of the complex. METTL3 has been shown to be the catalytic subunit while METTL14 has been shown to be mainly important for RNA recognition and binding. However, it is worth noting that the current work is very similar to the work recently been published by Wang et al. (Nature 2016), which dilutes the uniqueness of the current work.

This is because the construct METTL14 107-395 does not show any activity when complexed with either the full length or catalytic domain of METTL3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, to pin point the important region of METTL14 for the MTase activity, a few more plausible constructs should be designed. I propose to perform activity measurements of METTL3 (356-580) complexed with two more METTL14 constructs lacking either the C-terminal (res 1-395) or the N-terminal region (res 107-456). This could further reveal the substrate recognition and binding regions of the complex. Furthermore, a possible substrate recognition site (that detect the consensus sequence in RNA) should be referred to in Figure 10."

Moreover, the authors contradict the previous reports of presence of activity in the isolated METTL3 and METTL14 subunits. This lack of activity is also explained convincingly by the crystal structure of the complex. METTL3 has been shown to be the catalytic subunit while METTL14 has been shown to be mainly important for RNA recognition and binding. However, it is worth noting that the current work is very similar to the work recently been published by Wang et al. (Nature 2016), which dilutes the uniqueness of the current work. Therefore, I would leave it to the editor's discretion whether the work is deemed novel enough for publication in eLife.</i> "

This is because the construct METTL14 107-395 does not show any activity when complexed with either the full length or catalytic domain of METTL3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, to pin point the important region of METTL14 for the MTase activity, a few more plausible constructs should be designed. I propose to perform activity measurements of METTL3 (356-580) complexed with two more METTL14 constructs lacking either the C-terminal (res 1-395) or the N-terminal region (res 107-456). This could further reveal the substrate recognition and binding regions of the complex. Furthermore, a possible substrate recognition site (that detect the consensus sequence in RNA) should be referred to in Figure 10.</i> "

This indicates that the N-terminal region containing the two putative zing finger motifs is required for the catalytic activity of the complex, rather than the N- and C-terminal extensions in METTL14, as we previously stated in the original version of the manuscript.
