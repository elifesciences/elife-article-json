The vertebrate Dscams (DSCAM and DSCAML1) are cell adhesion molecules that support the development of this organization by promoting self-avoidance at the level of cell types, promoting normal developmental cell death, and directing vertical neurite stratification. To understand the molecular interactions required for these activities, we tested the functional significance of the interaction between the C-terminus of the Dscams and multi-PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins in mouse. We hypothesized that this PDZ-interacting domain would mediate a subset of the Dscams\u2019 functions. Instead, we found that in the absence of these interactions, some cell types developed almost normally, while others resembled complete loss of function. Thus, we show differential dependence on this domain for Dscams\u2019 functions in different cell types."

The vertebrate Dscams (DSCAM and DSCAML1) are cell adhesion molecules that support the development of this organization by promoting self-avoidance at the level of cell types, promoting normal developmental cell death, and directing vertical neurite stratification. To understand the molecular interactions required for these activities, we tested the functional significance of the interaction between the C-terminus of the Dscams and multi-PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins in mouse. We hypothesized that this PDZ-interacting domain would mediate a subset of the Dscams\u2019 functions. Instead, we found that in the absence of these interactions, some cell types developed almost normally, while others resembled complete loss of function. Thus, we show differential dependence on this domain for Dscams\u2019 functions in different cell types."

However, the experiments show that the mutant Dscam proteins had different effects on the neurons. Some types of neurons developed normally, while others experienced disruptions in all three of the processes that Dscams are normally involved in. Some other neurons were affected to a moderate extent. This indicates that Dscams use different mechanisms in different types of neurons to carry out the same activities. The next step is to find out what other proteins Dscams need to interact with in different types of neurons."

The ~100 neuronal cell types of the retina vertically organize into layers, with light-transducing photoreceptors in the outermost cellular layer (ONL, or outer nuclear layer) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) \u2013 responsible for the sole output from the retina \u2013 in the innermost layer (RGL, or retinal ganglion cell layer). Between these, both functionally and physically, are the interneuron cell types (horizontal, amacrine, and bipolar cells) in the inner nuclear layer (INL), which process and relay visual information from photoreceptors to RGCs. These three cellular layers are separated by two synaptic plexiform layers, where the neurites from these cell types mingle and form synaptic connections with specific partners in specific substrata. Additionally, many cell types are horizontally spaced in a mosaic pattern, such that there is a low probability of finding two neurons of the same subtype (i.e., homotypic) in close proximity. This pattern ensures that the information processing provided by each subtype is distributed across the retina (<a href=\"#bib20\">Masland, 2012</a>)."

Critical parts of this recognition code include Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) and the highly similar Dscam-like1 (DSCAML1), collectively referred to as Dscams. <i>Dscam</i> and <i>Dscaml1</i> encode homophilic members of the Ig-superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, and are expressed in non-overlapping neuronal subtypes in the retina (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwala et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Fuerst et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</a>). The Dscams promote self-avoidance at the cell type level: When either gene is mutated, the cell types that normally express the Dscam lose their mosaic spacing and often form clusters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fuerst et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2008</a>). The neurites fail to evenly cover their receptive fields, and instead form fascicles with neighboring homotypic cells. This clustering and fasciculation is, with few exceptions, homotypic \u2013 cells of one subtype rarely cluster with the\u00a0cells of another subtype. Self-avoidance requires homophilic Dscam interactions between cells, demonstrated in mosaic experiments where neurons lacking <i>Dscam</i> fasciculate with homotypic neurons with intact <i>Dscam</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fuerst et al., 2012</a>). This self-avoidance function is consistent with studies in <i>Drosophila,</i> which have four Dscam genes. Most notably, <i>Dscam1</i> promotes self-avoidance at the individual cell level by using alternative splicing to produce 19,008 distinctly homophilic isoforms, allowing each neuron to recognize and avoid 'self' while still interacting with 'non-self' during processes like dendrite arborization and axon branching (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib44\">Zipursky and Grueber, 2013</a>])."

Some cell types are expanded beyond even that seen in mutants for the pro-apoptotic <i>Bax</i> gene, while others are more modestly expanded compared to <i>Bax</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fuerst et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Keeley et al., 2012</a>)."

In chick, Dscams label-specific sublaminae of the IPL and can instruct neurite targeting to these layers (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</a>). DSCAM protein localization is punctate throughout the IPL in mouse, and is not confined to specific sublaminae (<a href=\"#bib3\">de Andrade et al., 2014</a>). Despite this, some neuronal types do have disorganized neurite stratification in <i>Dscam</i> mutants, although the disorganization varies with genetic background (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fuerst et al., 2010</a>). There are also indications that the synaptic connections that form do not mature normally. For instance, <i>Dscaml1</i> is expressed both in rod bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells, which connect at dyad ribbon synapses in the IPL. These synapses can still be found in <i>Dscaml1</i> mutants, but are morphologically abnormal, with indistinct, detached presynaptic ribbons, and functionally abnormal, with much slower decay of the synaptic current (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fuerst et al., 2009</a>)."

We measured cell spacing with three distinct tests: density recovery profiling (DRP), Voronoi tessellation domain analysis, and nearest neighbor analysis. Each of these tests provides a measure of spacing independent of overall density. DRP plots the density of cells at binned distances from each individual cell. When cells are randomly spaced, the density within each bin is equal to the overall density. When cells are mosaically spaced, there is an 'exclusion zone' where bins close to each reference cell have a lower density than the overall field. If cells are clustered then the near bins have a higher density than the overall field (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rodieck, 1991</a>). In addition to providing a visual representation of cell spacing, DRP also calculates a 'packing factor,' which we used for statistical comparison. A perfectly ordered array of cells has a packing factor of 1, while an array of cells with no exclusion zone has a packing factor of 0 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rodieck, 1991</a>). In Voronoi tessellation domain analysis, each point in the image is assigned to the domain of the nearest cell, creating a tessellation (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In images of mosaically spaced cells, the domains are relatively uniform in size, while images of more irregularly spaced cells display a greater variance of domain areas. Calculating the ratio of the variance to the mean of these areas controls for overall cell density (<a href=\"#bib16\">Khiripet et al., 2012</a>). Finally, nearest neighbor analysis measures the distance from each cell to its nearest neighbor. The nearest neighbor regularity index (NNRI) is calculated for each image by dividing the mean nearest neighbor distance by the standard deviation. To control for cell density, the measured NNRI is divided by the NNRI from a randomly generated array of an equal number of points (<a href=\"#bib14\">Keeley and Reese, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rodieck, 1991</a>). p-values from all pairwise comparisons are in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>."

M1 cells stratify their dendrites to the outermost lamina in the OFF region of the inner plexiform retina and stain the brightest for melanopsin. M2 cells stratify in the ON layer much closer to the RGC cell bodies. M3 cells are bistratified, but are much more rare than the M1 or M2 population. ipRGCs are among the most clustered and fasciculated cell types in <i>Dscam<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants; both M1 and M2 cells are severely clustered with tight dendritic fascicles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>, and [<a href=\"#bib7\">Fuerst et al., 2009</a>]). In <i>Dscam<sup>\u2206C/\u2206C</sup></i> mutants, cell bodies were clearly clustered, albeit not as severely as in <i>Dscam<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,E\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Cell density appeared to be modestly increased compared to controls, but the difference was not statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus, in general, ipRGCs were intermediately affected. The\u00a0Cdh3-GFP RGC cell number was increased in <i>Dscam<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants, and the cell bodies aggregated into clusters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,J</a>). In contrast, cell number was not significantly increased in <i>Dscam<sup>\u0394C/\u0394C</sup></i> retinas, and the cell body clustering observed in <i>Dscam<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants was not observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I,K\u2013N</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, in both amacrine and ganglion cells, some cell types require the PDZ-interacting C-terminus of DSCAM for its function, whereas in other cell types, this domain is largely dispensable. Furthermore, the functions of DSCAM in promoting cell death and self-avoidance change in parallel and are not separated by the perturbation of this intracellular interaction."

We used two methods to assess selective instability. First, we quantified the colocalization between DSCAM and melanopsin to see if there was a reduction in DSCAM specifically in ipRGCs. We did not find any difference in this colocalization between <i>Dscam<sup>+/+\u00a0</sup></i>and <i>Dscam<sup>\u2206C/\u2206C</sup></i> retinas (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Second, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of <i>Dscam</i> staining in cryosections along a 10\u00a0\u00b5m line perpendicular to the INL directly adjacent to this cellular layer. This region includes the S1 lamina in which DA cells stratify their neurites. No reduced fluorescence intensity was detectable in <i>Dscam<sup>\u2206C/\u2206C</sup> </i>retinas, whereas we could detect a trend towards reduced labeling in heterozygous <i>Dscam<sup>+/-\u00a0</sup></i>images relative to <i>Dscam<sup>+/+</sup></i> controls, (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013I</a>). Thus, neither immunofluorescence nor immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) provide any evidence supporting protein instability. It remains possible, however, that a subtle difference in cell-type specific protein stability or localization beyond the resolution of these experiments could contribute to the range of phenotypes we have observed. Similarly, the tag could be interfering with function in some cell types; however, we do not believe this to be the case as we performed similar experiments with DSCAML1 using a different tag and obtained similar results, as described below."

The functions we have defined, promoting developmental cell death, promoting self-avoidance in both processes and cell bodies to enable mosaic spacing and coverage factor, and promoting laminar specificity and synapse maturation in at least some cell types and genetic backgrounds, are based on the loss of function mutant phenotype. The deletion of the PDZ-binding C-termini of DSCAM and DSCAML1 had several possible outcomes in this context. It could have resulted in an unstable or mis-trafficked protein, causing a complete loss of function. Our data do not support this, as protein is found at normal levels by both immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry, is on the cell surface by live cell staining and surface biotinylation, and is in the correct topological orientation, although more subtle or specific defects may still have been missed by these analyses. The PDZ-interacting C-termini of DSCAM and DSCAML1 could also have been totally superfluous for its function. Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2010</a>), this also is not the case. A partial loss of function could have resulted in a subset of the phenotypically defined functions being present, and others being lost. Given the interaction with synaptic scaffolding proteins, a phenotype of impaired synapse maturation with normal developmental cell death and self-avoidance was a reasonable anticipated outcome. Interestingly, we instead found a partial loss of function at the level of cell types. Some cell types appear to almost completely require the C-termini, whereas in other cell types they are almost completely dispensable. In yet other cell types, the phenotype was intermediate, between wild type and the null, but all phenotypically defined functions changed roughly in parallel. An additional caveat is that the epitope tags used to replace the PDZ-binding motifs may contribute to these phenotypes. While this is formally possible, we believe that it is unlikely to be the case, as we used two different epitope tags (Myc and HA) with two different genes and found a similar range of phenotypes between different cell types. Thus, our main conclusion from these studies is that the requirement for a PDZ-interacting C-terminus in DSCAM or DSCAML1 is variable and depends on the cell type."

Each of these three exons encode regions of the protein essential for homophilic binding, resulting in 19,008 potential molecules that preferentially recognize other copies of the same isoform (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sawaya et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wu et al., 2012</a>).

When only one isoform was expressed in SACs, self-avoidance at the single cell level was preserved, but interactions between neighboring SACs were aberrant, resulting in circuit level dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</a>)."

Without extensive isoform diversity, vertebrate DSCAMs are not able to provide this fine level of self-recognition. Our conclusion that DSCAMs function through at least two molecular mechanisms, one that requires a C-terminal PDZ-interacting motif, and one that does not, fits a model in which DSCAMs interact with cell-type-specific adhesion mechanisms to serve their function. This is most easily discussed for self-avoidance, where the deletion of DSCAM or DSCAML1 results in the clumping and fasciculation of homotypic cells \u2013 phenotypes that could be described as excessive adhesion. Under this model, the DSCAMs serve a generic role, and the specificity and complexity of the system is conferred by the cell-type-specific adhesion mechanisms. Thus, in cell types in which the PDZ-interacting C-terminus is required, the predominant cell adhesion system may also interact with PDZ-scaffolded complexes. These systems could include Ig-superfamily CAMs such as L1-CAM or NRCAM, or possibly neurexins or neuroligins. Alternatively, the CAMs could interact with PDZ domains indirectly through mediator proteins. In cell types that do not require the C-terminus of DSCAM or DSCAML1, the predominant cell adhesion systems may not involve PDZ interactions, such as cadherins or protocadherins. In cell types with intermediate phenotypes, a mix of PDZ-dependent and \u2013independent mechanisms may be involved. This is not surprising, as each cell type is expected to express more than one class of cell adhesion molecule."

None of the analyzed PDZ proteins were clearly localized to specific laminae, but were punctate throughout the IPL.

                        "text": "As mentioned, we have thus far been generally unable to genetically separate functions such as developmental cell death and self-avoidance. Cell types with any phenotype in \u2206C mutants had multiple phenotypes, which changed roughly in parallel. For example, DA cells were more numerous with disrupted spacing and neurite fasciculation, while bNOS-positive amacrine cells and Cdh3-GFP RGCs both had a\u00a0relatively normal density, spacing, and neurite arborization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). In ipRGCs, cell density was variably increased and did not reach statistical significance, and cell spacing and dendrite fasciculation were both intermediate in severity between controls and null mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This covariation could suggest that there is one primary function and the other phenotypes are secondary to this. Keeley and colleagues tested if cell death was this primary function in DA cells and ipRGCs, and found that while increasing cell density by inhibiting developmental cell death could contribute to spacing defects, it was not sufficient to explain the loss of self-avoidance in <i>Dscam<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib15\">Keeley et al., 2012</a>). We confirmed those findings here, and extended them in three ways. (1) We added a third cell type, VGLUT3-positive amacrine cells, and found that their spacing was more disrupted in <i>Dscaml1<sup>\u2206C/\u2206C</sup></i> mutants than <i>Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants despite having a lower cell density (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2013L</a>). (2) In ipRGCs, cell clustering was more severe in <i>Dscam<sup>\u2206C/\u2206C</sup></i>mutants than in <i>Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants despite comparable cell densities (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). ipRGC density in <i>Dscam<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants is much higher than in <i>Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> retinas, complicating the correlation of density and spacing defects. (3) We quantified neurite fasciculation independently from the\u00a0cell body spacing, finding that cell density can contribute to fasciculation in ipRGCs, but does not significantly drive fasciculation in DA cells or bNOS cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, promotion of cell death is not the sole primary function of the Dscams. This is consistent with our previous finding that ipRGC clustering and fasciculation occurs in <i>Dscam<sup>-/-</sup></i>mutants even when cell density is severely reduced by <i>Pou4f</i>2 double mutation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fuerst et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "As we have not been able to induce clustering and fasciculation without an increase in cell density, it remains possible that the self-avoidance function of Dscams is primary and the clustering and fascicle formation is protective against cell death. It is also possible that the process through which the Dscams prevent fasciculation also promotes proper neurite stratification. We have now identified two examples of aberrant interaction between different cell types. DA cells co-fasciculate with M1 ipRGCs in <i>Dscam<sup>\u2206C/\u2206C\u00a0</sup></i>retinas (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) and VGLUT3-positive amacrine cells become directly adjacent to AII amacrine cells in <i>Dscaml1<sup>\u2206C/\u2206C\u00a0</sup></i>mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7P\u2013Q</a>). As DA and M1 ipRGCs normally co-stratify, this interaction does not result in any misprojection. VGLUT3-positve amacrine neurites, however, are normally confined in the ON-OFF strata between the ChAT layers, not in the ON region proximal to the RGL where AII projections reside. Improper interactions with AII amacrine cells could provide a mechanism for VGLUT3 misprojection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7O\u2013Q</a>)."

We hypothesize that this mechanistic diversity is based on the diverse adhesion systems masked by the DSCAMs. Determining how DSCAMs interact with other systems to mask their adhesivity for self-avoidance, and whether this is the primary function and developmental cell death and synapse maturation are secondary, will require additional studies. However, what these results clearly demonstrate is that the molecular mechanisms through which DSCAMs function will need to be defined on a cell type by cell type basis, and that a single molecular complex or pathway will not account for DSCAMs\u2019 function(s) in all cell types."

These coordinates were used to calculate the density recovery profile (DRP), nearest neighbor analysis, and overall cell density in WinDRP as described previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fuerst et al., 2008</a>). For each image, the DRPs were normalized so that the overall density was set at 1. This allowed for direct comparison of relative spacing across genotypes independent of the\u00a0overall cell number. The packing factor (PF) generated by WinDRP was used for statistical comparison (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rodieck, 1991</a>). For nearest neighbor analysis, the regularity index (NNRI) was computed by dividing the mean nearest neighbor distance by the standard deviation. The NNRI was also computed for an equal number of randomly distributed points. The ratio of the\u00a0measured NNRI to random NNRI was reported and used for statistical comparison. The same X-Y coordinates were also used for Voronoi domain analysis in Ka-me (<a href=\"#bib16\">Khiripet et al., 2012</a>). Values from 2\u20134 images per retina were averaged to find a retinal mean. These means were compared across genotype by ANOVA with pairwise Tukey post-hoc tests.

Users, blind to genotype, were instructed to choose which of two images was the least fasciculated (i.e., most like the wild type). Two random images were presented, and the user clicked on his or her choice. After choosing, a new pair of images was presented. All images began with a score of 0, and after each matchup their scores were updated. The winning image gained points while the other image lost the same number of points. The number of points exchanged was based on the scores of each image before the matchup. As a result, in an upset scenario (i.e., an image with a low score 'beat' an image with a higher score) more points were exchanged than if the originally higher scored image had won. This allows a group of images to sort into their true ranking without performing every head-to-head matchup. The trial was considered to have reached an endpoint when further matchups did not change the relative genotype rankings. Each image set was scored by 6\u20138 users. Scores from each individual retina were averaged (1\u20134 images per retina) and these retinal mean scores were used to compare across genotypes using a pairwise Wilcoxon ranked sum test."

By replacing the C-terminal 10 amino acids with an epitope, and knocking these alleles into the endogenous loci, they address the requirement for these terminal amino acids. Their findings are somewhat surprising, as they show differential dependence of these domains among several retinal cell types. As indicated by the Reviewers, their conclusions need additional data, as well as a more measured interpretation. The major difficulty in interpretation is pointed out by Reviewer 1, which derives from the design of their knock-in allele. By using only one allele, that of a deletion with an epitope substitution, they have not ruled out that the phenotype is due to the epitope. This ambiguity needs to be acknowledged and discussed. Further, in light of the caveats in interpretation, the authors should consider modifying their title. In addition, as both reviewers point out, there is not enough quantification and resolution of the level and location of the knock-in protein within the retina. Given the differential response of different cell types, this is an important point. The suggestions of Reviewer 2 regarding more accurate measurements of protein and localization need be carried out. In addition, the other suggestions of Reviewer 2 should be carried out. The caveats in the interpretation pointed out by Reviewer 1, as well as a more complete discussion of previous work of DsCAMs in <i>Drosophila</i>, and the model for protocadherins in self-avoidance in mouse, should also be included."

They have shown that DSCAM regulates self-avoidance, cell death and synapse formation. To begin to dissect these multiple functions they use knock-in technology to construct mutations in the cytoplasmic tails in which the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain was replaced with an epitope tag. The assumption was that different functions would be mediated by different signaling pathways downstream the cytoplasmic domains. That is, the lack of the PDZ domain would abrogate one function, perhaps cell death, and leave the others (e.g. synapse formation) intact. To their surprise, they discovered that rather than disrupting one pathway or another the loss of the PDZ-binding site in both proteins led to selective disruption of function in different cell types. The authors argue, based on these findings, that there are different signaling requirements in different cells for the same function."

A more careful control would have been to insert the tag towards the C-terminal with PDZ domain intact. If this rescues, the authors could include the same tag with a mutated PDZ domain binding site. If we were playing hardball, this would negate their data entirely. But it is a high bar and I think the paper has value and should be published."

The major finding is that the PDZ-interacting C-terminal motif of Dscam and Dscaml is important in some but not all retinal cell types in executing the proper function of these adhesion molecules. The authors convincingly show a differential requirement for the PDZ-binding motif in a subset of retinal neurons by examining cell density, mosaic organization and dendrite fasciculation of several amacrine and ganglion cell types. Quantification of these parameters are provided and by and large, the figures support the major conclusions. For some conclusions, the authors still need to provide quantitative data to support their statements (these are listed in the minor comments). The major finding is somewhat unexpected and thus the study does represent a significant addition to current knowledge of how Dscam and Dscaml proteins work."

By replacing the C-terminal 10 amino acids with an epitope, and knocking these alleles into the endogenous loci, they address the requirement for these terminal amino acids. Their findings are somewhat surprising, as they show differential dependence of these domain among several retinal cell types. As indicated by the Reviewers, their conclusions need additional data, as well as a more measured interpretation. The major difficulty in interpretation is pointed out by Reviewer 1, which derives from the design of their knock-in allele. By using only one allele, that of a deletion with an epitope substitution, they have not ruled out that the phenotype is due to the epitope. This ambiguity needs to be acknowledged and discussed. Further, in light of the caveats in interpretation, the authors should consider modifying their title. In addition, as both reviewers point out, there is not enough quantification and resolution of the level and location of the knock-in protein within the retina. Given the differential response of different cell types, this is an important point. The suggestions of Reviewer 2 regarding more accurate measurements of protein and localization need be carried out. In addition, the other suggestions of Reviewer 2 should be carried out. The caveats in the interpretation pointed out by Reviewer 1, as well as a more complete discussion of previous work of DsCAMs in Drosophila, and the model for protocadherins in self-avoidance in mouse, should also be included.</i>"

They have shown that DSCAM regulates self-avoidance, cell death and synapse formation. To begin to dissect these multiple functions they use knock-in technology to construct mutations in the cytoplasmic tails in which the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain was replaced with an epitope tag. The assumption was that different functions would be mediated by different signaling pathways downstream the cytoplasmic domains. That is, the lack of the PDZ domain would abrogate one function, perhaps cell death, and leave the others (e.g. synapse formation) intact. To their surprise, they discovered that rather than disrupting one pathway or another the loss of the PDZ-binding site in both proteins led to selective disruption of function in different cell types. The authors argue, based on these findings, that there are different signaling requirements in different cells for the same function.</i>"
