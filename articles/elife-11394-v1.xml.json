                    "text": "Heart of Glass (HEG1), a transmembrane receptor, and Rasip1, an endothelial-specific Rap1-binding protein, are both essential for cardiovascular development. Here we performed a proteomic screen for novel HEG1 interactors and report that HEG1 binds directly to Rasip1. Rasip1 localizes to forming endothelial cell (EC) cell-cell junctions and silencing HEG1 prevents this localization. Conversely, mitochondria-targeted HEG1 relocalizes Rasip1 to mitochondria in cells. The Rasip1-binding site in HEG1 contains a 9 residue sequence, deletion of which abrogates HEG1\u2019s ability to recruit Rasip1. HEG1 binds to a central region of Rasip1 and deletion of this domain eliminates Rasip1\u2019s ability to bind HEG1, to translocate to EC junctions, to inhibit ROCK activity, and to maintain EC junctional integrity. These studies establish that the binding of HEG1 to Rasip1 mediates Rap1-dependent recruitment of Rasip1 to and stabilization of EC cell-cell junctions."

Here we performed a proteomic screen for novel HEG1 interactors and report that HEG1 binds directly to Rasip1. Rasip1 localizes to forming endothelial cell (EC) cell-cell junctions and silencing HEG1 prevents this localization. Conversely, mitochondria-targeted HEG1 relocalizes Rasip1 to mitochondria in cells. The Rasip1-binding site in HEG1 contains a 9 residue sequence, deletion of which abrogates HEG1\u2019s ability to recruit Rasip1. HEG1 binds to a central region of Rasip1 and deletion of this domain eliminates Rasip1\u2019s ability to bind HEG1, to translocate to EC junctions, to inhibit ROCK activity, and to maintain EC junctional integrity. These studies establish that the binding of HEG1 to Rasip1 mediates Rap1-dependent recruitment of Rasip1 to and stabilization of EC cell-cell junctions."

This led de Kreuk, Gingras et al. to look for other proteins that interact with HEG1 and that might be important for controlling the development of the blood vessels.

In vascular endothelial cells (EC), cell-cell contacts formed by adherens and tight junctions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bazzoni, 2004</a>), control vascular patterning and provide a barrier to the passage of water and solutes. Weakening of this endothelial barrier contributes to diseases such as sepsis, atherosclerosis, and multiple sclerosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bazzoni, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Dejana et al., 2009</a>). The actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib22\">M\u00e8ge et al., 2006</a>) and its regulatory Rho GTPases have profound roles in the assembly and disassembly of cell-cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beckers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</a>). Rap1, a small GTPase, regulates epithelial and EC cell-cell adhesion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pannekoek et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kooistra et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Knox, 2002</a>). In EC, binding of activated Rap1 to KRIT1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gingras et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Li et al., 2012</a>), a scaffold that regulates RhoA signaling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Whitehead et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Stockton et al., 2010</a>), targets KRIT1 to cell-cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Glading et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00e9raud-Dufour et al., 2007</a>) where it directly interacts with Heart of Glass (HEG1) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gingras et al., 2012</a>), a transmembrane receptor essential for cardiovascular development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mably et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kleaveland et al., 2009</a>). The 111 amino acid HEG1 cytoplasmic domain is highly conserved (e.g. 76% identity between human and zebrafish) whereas KRIT1 binding requires only the C-terminal 10% of HEG1 tail (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gingras et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we suspected that other interactors of HEG1 might contribute to vascular function. Here, we report an unbiased proteomic screen for HEG1-binding endothelial-specific proteins that revealed that Rasip1, a second Rap1 binding protein essential for vascular integrity and development (<a href=\"#bib26\">Post et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Xu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>), directly interacts with the HEG1 cytoplasmic domain independent of KRIT1. Rasip1 recruitment to cell-cell junctions requires the presence of HEG1 and integrity of its HEG1 binding site. Moreover, targeting of HEG1 tail to mitochondria recruits Rasip1 to these organelles through the direct interaction of the proteins. We designed a structure-based Rasip1 RA-domain mutant (R182E) that failed to bind to Rap1 and did not associate with HEG1 in cells or maintain EC barrier integrity. Finally, the central region of Rasip1 interacts with HEG1 and deletion of this domain eliminates Rasip1\u2019s ability to translocate to EC junctions, to inhibit Rho Kinase (ROCK) activity, and to maintain EC junctional integrity. These studies reveal that HEG1 interacts with two different Rap1 effectors important in EC, indicating that this transmembrane receptor serves as a physical nexus for Rap1 signaling in vascular integrity and development."

                                "text": "To test the idea that interactors besides KRIT1 might be important for HEG1 function, we used wild-type (WT) HEG1 cytoplasmic tail and HEG1 lacking the C-terminal Tyr-Phe (\u2206YF) required for KRIT1 binding (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gingras et al., 2012</a>) as an affinity matrix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To discern potential endothelial-specific interactors, we analyzed the proteins bound to these matrices from lysates of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) or HeLa cells by mass spectrometry (MS; Raw data is deposited in the MassIVE repository housed at the Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry at UCSD. See Materials and methods section for more information). This analysis identified a Rap1 effector, Rasip1, among the proteins isolated from endothelial cells but not from HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), a result consistent with the endothelial-specific expression of Rasip1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mitin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Mitin et al., 2004</a>). In contrast KRIT1, and the known KRIT1 interactors CCM2 and ITGB1BP1 (ICAP1) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zawistowski, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Zawistowski, 2002</a>) were isolated from both lysates. All of these interactions were specific in that these proteins were detected at 35\u2013125 fold less abundance in a control affinity matrix generated from the \u03b1IIb integrin. These proteins were also statistically significant according to SAINTexpress, a method for scoring protein-protein interaction data from affinity purification MS experiments. Moreover, deletion of the last 2 residues of the HEG1 tail abolished binding of KRIT1 as expected, and of the KRIT1-binding proteins CCM2 and ITGB1P1. In sharp contrast, Rasip1 binding was not reduced by the absence of the YF motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Immunoblotting confirmed that endogenous Rasip1 interacts with both the HEG1 cytoplasmic tail and HEG1 \u2206YF (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To ask whether Rasip1 and HEG1 can interact in living cells, we transfected HUVEC with mCherry-HEG1 cytoplasmic tail, containing a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), and analyzed endogenous Rasip1 distribution. Targeting of mito-mCherry-HEG1, but not mito-mCherry alone, to mitochondria recruited Rasip1, demonstrating the interaction of HEG1 and Rasip1 in cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In addition, Rasip1 co-immunoprecipitated with full-length HEG1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Consistent with the mass spectrometry results, immunoblotting confirmed that Rasip1 bound to HEG1 \u2206YF (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), suggesting that the HEG1-Rasip1 interaction does not require KRIT1 binding to HEG1. To further test the KRIT1-dependence of the HEG1-Rasip interaction, we silenced KRIT1 expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; 70% reduction in expression was achieved) and found that it did not affect binding of GFP-Rasip1 to the HEG1 cytoplasmic tail affinity matrix (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) or Rasip1 recruitment to mito-mCherry-HEG1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Conversely, Rasip1 did not interact with the C-terminal 19 residues of HEG1, which are sufficient to bind KRIT1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Because HEG1 is found in these junctions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kleaveland et al., 2009</a>), we hypothesized that the HEG1-Rasip1 interaction might mediate Rasip1 recruitment. To test this idea, we induced junctional assembly by disrupting adherens junctions with EGTA, followed by recalcification in the presence of the Epac1-specific cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2\u2019-O-Me-cAMP (hereafter called '007') to activate Rap1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Enserink et al., 2002</a>). As expected, during junction assembly, Rasip1 was recruited to VE-cadherin-positive cell-cell contacts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In sharp contrast, when HEG1 was silenced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) Rasip1 recruitment to cell-cell contacts was prevented (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). To exclude off-target effects, silencing HEG1 expression with a second shRNA (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or an siRNA specific for HEG1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) also prevented Rasip1 recruitment to EC contacts. Previous studies have shown that loss of HEG1-KRIT1 interaction increases Rho-Kinase (ROCK) activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gingras et al., 2012</a>), however, a ROCK inhibitor, H-1152, did not restore Rasip1 recruitment in HEG1-silenced EC (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Moreover, silencing of KRIT1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) did not prevent Rasip1 recruitment to cell-cell contacts during junction formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus, HEG1 mediates Rasip1 recruitment to forming EC junctions."

To investigate whether HEG1 is involved in regulating \u03b21 integrin activation as well, we silenced HEG1 or Rasip1 expression in HUVEC and measured the binding of 9EG7 monoclonal antibody as a reporter of \u03b21 integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lenter et al., 1993</a>). As expected, silencing Rasip1 expression in HUVEC decreased 9EG7 binding. In contrast, silencing HEG1 expression did not affect levels of activated \u03b21 integrin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) suggesting that the effect of Rasip1 on \u03b21 integrin activation is independent of HEG1. Previous studies show that Rasip1 mediates Rap1 inhibition of RhoA activity and of the RhoA effector Rho kinase (ROCK). As a result, silencing Rasip1 expression in endothelial cells can increase phosphorylation of a ROCK substrate, myosin light chain 2 (MLC) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), resulting in increased actin stress fibers and reduced cortical actin (<a href=\"#bib26\">Post et al., 2013</a>). To test whether HEG1 is also involved in suppressing ROCK signaling we silenced HEG1 or Rasip1 expression in HUVEC and analyzed MLC phosphorylation. Similar to silencing Rasip1, silencing HEG1 expression in HUVEC by siRNA or shRNA increased phosphorylation of MLC and formation of stress fibers indicating increased ROCK signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). As both HEG1 and Rasip1 silencing resulted in increased MLC phosphorylation, we tested whether the interaction between HEG1 and Rasip1 is important for the regulation of RhoA/ROCK signaling. Silencing HEG1 expression in HUVEC increased MLC phosphorylation and formation of actin stress fibers, which was rescued by expressing shRNA-resistant murine HEG1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). However, expression of Rasip1-binding deficient murine HEG1(\u22061283-1291) (corresponding to aa 1327-1335 in human HEG1) failed to rescue the increase in MLC phosphorylation and actin stress fiber formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Flow cytometry analysis showed that both wild-type mHEG1 and mHEG1(\u22061283-1291) were equally expressed in HUVEC (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Conversely, silencing expression of Rasip1 increased MLC phosphorylation by ~40% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Expression of shRNA-resistant wild-type Rasip1 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) rescued increased MLC phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). In contrast, HEG1-binding deficient Rasip1(\u2206334-539) failed to rescue increased MLC phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>) Moreover, expression of Rasip1(\u2206334-539) induced increased MLC phosphorylation even in the absence of Rasip1 silencing, indicating that it could act in a dominant negative manner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

To test whether Rap1 binding to Rasip1 is required for Rasip1 function and to assess the role of Rap1 in regulating the interaction of Rasip1 with HEG1, we analyzed the Rasip1 Ras-association (RA) domain. Comparison of the Rasip1 RA domain sequence showed that it was similar to those found in RalGDS, Afadin6, and Radil. Sequence alignment of Rasip1 RA domain with Radil shows a highly conserved sequence (31% identical, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). A preliminary homology model of the Rasip1 RA domain closely resembles the structure of Radil RA domain (PDB ID 3EC8) (backbone rmsd 1.02\u00c5 for 126 a.a., <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The Radil crystal structure shows a dimer that is stabilized by an extensive interface burying 30% (2,324 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) of the total surface area of each monomer (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, highlighted in blue). Analysis of our model shows that the dimer interface is conserved in Rasip1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, magenta and yellow), suggesting that it could also form a dimer similar to Radil RA domain and therefore could bind two Rap1 molecules per dimer (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Indeed, purified recombinant Rasip1 RA domain (residues 134-285) eluted earlier than expected from its monomer mass (16.3kDa) in size exclusion chromatography (SEC), suggesting that it forms a dimer (~35kDa) in solution (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>; green).

Moreover, SEC showed that the Rasip1(R182E) mutant was well folded and exhibited the same elution pattern in SEC as the wild-type protein. Thus, we conclude that Rasip1 RA domain (R182E) remains well folded as a multimer but binds Rap1 with drastically reduced affinity. We examined the capacity of Rasip1(R182E) to localize with HEG1 in cells and found that this mutant was not targeted to mito-mCherry-HEG1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Thus, in living cells, Rasip1 recruitment to HEG1 is lost when a point mutant disrupts its capacity to bind Rap1.

Here, we report that Rasip1, a Rap1 binding protein required for vascular development, binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain (tail) of HEG1, independent of KRIT1. Silencing HEG1 prevented Rasip1 targeting to EC junctions, furthermore the HEG1 cytoplasmic domain could re-localize Rasip1 in living cells. We mapped the Rasip1 binding site in HEG1 to a 9 residue peptide that is highly conserved in vertebrates and found that deletion of this sequence blocks the capacity of HEG1 to bind to Rasip1 and to recruit Rasip1 in cells. Similarly, we mapped the HEG1 binding site in Rasip1 to its central region, containing an FHA domain, and found that deletion of this domain abolished the capacity of Rasip1 to translocate to cell-cell contacts, to inhibit ROCK activity, and to maintain EC junctional integrity. Rap1 activity regulates the function and localization of Rasip1; using molecular modeling we designed and validated a well-folded mutant, Rasip1(R182E), that failed to bind Rap1. Rasip1(R182E) also failed to associate with the HEG1 tail in cells and lost the capacity to inhibit ROCK and maintain EC junctional integrity. These studies establish that the interaction of HEG1 and Rasip1, two proteins involved in vascular development, is regulated by Rap1 binding to Rasip1 and enables Rasip1 to localize to EC cell-cell junctions and to maintain vascular integrity."

Rasip1 is recruited to assembling EC cell-cell junctions and we observed that HEG1 silencing blocked this recruitment and that targeting mito-mCherry-HEG1 to mitochondria re-localized endogenous Rasip1 to these organelles. Mapping studies identified HEG1(1327-1335) as the critical region and deleting this site abrogated the capacity of HEG1 to bind Rasip1 and to recruit it to mito-mCherry-HEG1(1327-1335). Rasip(266-550), which contains an FHA domain, was necessary and sufficient for the interaction with the HEG1 tail. In sum, our studies show that the direct physical interaction of a HEG1 with Rasip1 targets Rasip1 to assembling EC junctions."

In contrast to wild-type Rasip1, HEG1-binding deficient Rasip1(\u2206334-539) was not recruited to endothelial cell-cell contacts during junction formation/remodeling. Groundbreaking studies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Xu et al., 2011</a>) revealed that Rasip1 interacted with a RhoGAP (ARHGAP29) regulating RhoA and its effector ROCK1, the latter assayed by increased phospho-myosin light chain. More recent studies established that the Rasip1-ARHGAP29 axis also regulates endothelial permeability (<a href=\"#bib26\">Post et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>) in cooperation with Radil, which binds directly to the RhoGAP (<a href=\"#bib27\">Post et al., 2015</a>). Our finding that HEG1-binding defective Rasip1(\u2206334-539), which did not reach EC junctions, failed to rescue both increased phospho-myosin and vascular permeability caused by Rasip1 silencing, supports the idea (<a href=\"#bib27\">Post et al., 2015</a>) that the junctional localization of Rasip1 is important for regulation of RhoA/ROCK and vascular permeability. We noted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) that Rasip1(\u2206334-539) appears to accumulate on vesicles, suggesting that Rasip1(\u2206334-539) transport to the cell periphery is intact but that incorporation into cell-cell contacts depends on HEG1. In sum, our data show that Rasip1-HEG1 interaction is important for Rasip1 junctional localization and Rasip1-mediated regulation of ROCK signaling and endothelial barrier integrity."

We found that Rasip1 and KRIT1 bound to HEG1 at distinct binding sites. Rap1 binding regulates the capacity of both proteins to target to HEG1-containing junctions, inhibit ROCK activity, and maintain junctional integrity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Importantly, the <i>Rasip1</i> murine null phenotype is lethal by day E9.5 with much more profound vascular collapse (<a href=\"#bib33\">Xu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>) than is seen in the <i>Heg1</i> null (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kleaveland et al., 2009</a>) suggesting that Rasip1 has functions that do not depend on HEG1 binding or recruitment to EC junctions. One compelling possibility is that Rasip1 null mice exhibit profound detachment of EC from their basement membranes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), perhaps due to inhibition of integrin activation. Indeed we observed that silencing HEG1 did not impair \u03b21 integrin activation, whereas silencing Rasip1 did so. Thus, the Rap1-regulated interaction of HEG1 with Rasip1 localizes Rasip1 to those junctions and stabilizes them. Remarkably, Rap1 regulated association of KRIT1 with a second site in HEG1 also contributes to vascular development and integrity. Thus, HEG1 serves as physical nexus of Rap effectors that control both RhoA/ROCK signaling and vascular development."

The pellet was resuspended by pipetting up and down. 1\u00a0\u03bcl of benzonase was added per sample and the samples were sonicated for 30secs at amplitude 0.37 (10s pulse, 2s off).

Buffer A was water with 0.1% formic acid; buffer B was 100% ACN with 0.1% formic acid. A data dependent mode was used to acquire an MS scan (60,000 resolution) followed by 10 MS/MS CID scans at low resolution. Peptides were dynamically excluded for 15 sec after being selected for MS/MS. MS/MS spectra were queried against the RefSeq human database (version 53) using Mascot version 2.3.02 (Matrix Science). Methionine residues were searched with a variable modification of +15.9949 Da, and asparagine and glutamine with a variable modification of + 0.984016. Peptides were queried using tryptic cleavage constraints with a maximum of two missed cleavages sites. The mass tolerances were 12 ppm for parent masses and 0.6 Da for fragment masses. Experiments were performed in duplicate and significant interactors were determined using SAINTexpress (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lopez-Ramirez et al., 2012</a>).

Cells were further incubated with propidium iodide (1 \u03bcg/ml), then washed three times in Tyrode\u2019s buffer, and analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Level of 9EG7 (active \u03b21) and TS2/16 (total \u03b21) binding was corrected for background by substracting isotype control values. Results show 9EG7 binding relative to total \u03b21 expression."

In response to this comment, we tested if HEG1 could regulate the interaction between Rap1 and Rasip1. In <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C and D</a>, we tested the interaction of Rap1-V12 with Rasip1 in HEG1-silenced cells or by addition of the HEG1 cytoplasmic domain (5uM) peptide and show that neither of these conditions affects the interaction between Rasip1 and Rap1-V12.
