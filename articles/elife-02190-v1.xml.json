                    "text": "Pif1 family helicases are conserved from bacteria to humans. Here, we report a novel DNA patrolling activity which may underlie Pif1\u2019s diverse functions: a Pif1 monomer preferentially anchors itself to a 3\u2032-tailed DNA junction and periodically reel in the 3\u2032 tail with a step size of one nucleotide, extruding a loop. This periodic patrolling activity is used to unfold an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4) structure on every encounter, and is sufficient to unwind RNA-DNA heteroduplex but not duplex DNA. Instead of leaving after G4 unwinding, allowing it to refold, or going beyond to unwind duplex DNA, Pif1 repeatedly unwinds G4 DNA, keeping it unfolded. Pif1-induced unfolding of G4 occurs in three discrete steps, one strand at a time, and is powerful enough to overcome G4-stabilizing drugs. The periodic patrolling activity may keep Pif1 at its site of in vivo action in displacing telomerase, resolving R-loops, and keeping G4 unfolded during replication, recombination and repair."

Here, we report a novel DNA patrolling activity which may underlie Pif1\u2019s diverse functions: a Pif1 monomer preferentially anchors itself to a 3\u2032-tailed DNA junction and periodically reel in the 3\u2032 tail with a step size of one nucleotide, extruding a loop. This periodic patrolling activity is used to unfold an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4) structure on every encounter, and is sufficient to unwind RNA-DNA heteroduplex but not duplex DNA. Instead of leaving after G4 unwinding, allowing it to refold, or going beyond to unwind duplex DNA, Pif1 repeatedly unwinds G4 DNA, keeping it unfolded. Pif1-induced unfolding of G4 occurs in three discrete steps, one strand at a time, and is powerful enough to overcome G4-stabilizing drugs. The periodic patrolling activity may keep Pif1 at its site of in vivo action in displacing telomerase, resolving R-loops, and keeping G4 unfolded during replication, recombination and repair."

Although helicases were originally recognized as enzymes that catalyze the strand separation of double-stranded nucleic acids, it is now evident that helicases, as defined by a series of characteristic sequence motifs, may have additional functions aside from unwinding duplexes, including protein displacement from DNA and RNA, the unwinding of G-quadruplex (G4) structures, remodelling of chromatin and ribonucleoprotein complexes, promotion of Holliday junction branch migration and the catalysis of a range of nucleic acid conformational changes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Singleton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lohman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pyle, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Paeschke et al., 2013</a>)."

The <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Pif1 helicase (Pif1), the prototypical member of the Pif1 helicase family, plays critical roles in inhibiting telomerase activity at telomeres and double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), processing Okazaki fragments, promoting break-induced replication, maintaining mitochondrial DNA, and preventing replication pausing and DSBs at G-quadruplex (G4) motifs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boule and Zakian, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bochman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lopes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Paeschke et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>).

When we repositioned the fluorophores near the two ends of the (dT)<sub>40</sub> region (the construct is referred to as (dT)<sub>40</sub>), smFRET-time traces showed a periodic sawtooth-shaped pattern where FRET gradually increases until it abruptly drops to a low level and repeats the process many times (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Observation of the sawtooth pattern required both Pif1 and ATP (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and the sawtooth pattern was not observed with a 5\u2032 overhang (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We hypothesized that Pif1 remains anchored to the 3\u2032 ss-dsDNA junction while translocating on and reeling in the 3\u2032 overhang, extruding a ssDNA loop (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). To test this hypothesis, we used the fact that Cy3 gets brighter when a protein is in close proximity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fischer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hwang et al., 2011</a>). A sawtooth pattern was observed when Cy3 was placed at the 3\u2032 ssDNA end but not at the ss-dsDNA junction, supporting the model that Pif1 approaches the 3\u2032 end while remaining anchored to the junction (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To ascertain the monomeric state of Pif1, Pif1 was pulled down to the surface (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jain et al., 2011</a>) using an antibody against the Histidine<sub>6</sub>-tag (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Pif1 pulled-down in this way should maintain its monomeric state in solution (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lahaye et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barranco-Medina and Galletto, 2010</a>). The same sawtooth patterns were observed when 5 nM (dT)<sub>40</sub> was added with ATP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), indicating that a Pif1 monomer is responsible for the observed repetitive DNA looping that we term here as \u2018periodic patrolling\u2019. The presence of a 5\u2032 overhang in addition to the 3\u2032 overhang did not inhibit periodic patrolling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). The histograms of the patrolling period, \u0394<i>t</i>, were nearly identical among all three schemes (&gt;50 molecules each; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), yielding an average patrolling period \u03c4 = 2.1 \u00b1 0.1 s."

                                "text": "It has been proposed that Pif1 inhibits telomerase activity by unwinding the RNA\u2013DNA hybrid formed between telomerase RNA and the 3\u2032 end of telomeric DNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boule et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boule and Zakian, 2007</a>) and that Pif1 removes R-loops, that is, RNA\u2013DNA hybrids that occur naturally during replication and transcription (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boule and Zakian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse, 2012</a>). Whether a monomer or dimer of SF1/SF2 helicases is responsible for nucleic acid unwinding has been a subject of debate (<a href=\"#bib38\">Singleton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lohman et al., 2008</a>), so we asked if a patrolling Pif1 monomer can unwind dsDNA or RNA\u2013DNA hybrids. We designed gapped substrates by placing an additional 31-bp DNA\u2013DNA or RNA\u2013DNA duplex next to the 3\u2032 end of the (dT)<sub>40</sub> substrate (referred to as DD31 and RD31, respectively; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). If Pif1 fully unwinds the duplex during its periodic patrolling, the Cy3-labeled strand should be released from the surface, resulting in a decrease of the number of Cy3 spots over time. DD31 unwinding was not detectable under the monomer condition but was observed at 100 nM Pif1, likely due to multiple Pif1 proteins acting in concert (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, efficient unwinding of RD31 was detected under both conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Under the monomer condition, unwinding curves for RD31 can be fit to a single exponential function, yielding the unwinding times <i>t</i><sub>unwind</sub> = 6.3 \u00b1 0.9 and 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 min at 20 \u03bcM and 1 mM ATP, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). smFRET-time traces taken under the monomer condition showed that Pif1 performs periodic patrolling on both DD31 and RD31 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) with an average period of \u03c4 = 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 s at 20 \u03bcM ATP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Our data hence suggest that a Pif1 monomer takes about 200 cycles on average (= 6.3 min/2.4 s) to unwind the 31 bp RNA\u2013DNA hybrid, whereas dsDNA unwinding requires the cooperation of multiple Pif1 monomers or protein oligomerization on DNA. At 100 nM Pif1, FRET fluctuations became irregular (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), likely due to the binding of multiple Pif1 monomers to the gapped substrate at this Pif1 concentration. The dsDNA unwinding speed previously reported was much higher (\u223c0.3 s for unwinding 16 bp dsDNA) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., 2013</a>), either because they pre-assembled a functional helicase unit on the DNA before adding ATP to start the reaction or in that study, or due to a limited processivity of dsDNA unwinding by a Pif1 oligomer."

After incubating 10 nM Pif1 and flushing out unbound Pif1 (we refer to this condition as the Pif1 monomer condition), single molecule time traces were obtained at 20 \u03bcM ATP (top panel).

In contrast, in single molecule time traces obtained at 100 nM Pif1 and 20 \u03bcM ATP, the regular wave patterns were disrupted (bottom panel), likely due to the binding of multiple Pif1 monomers or protein oligomerization on the substrates at 100 nM Pif1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barranco-Medina and Galletto, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Galletto and Tomko, 2013</a>).

The highest FRET state was assigned to the folded G4 DNA and the lowest FRET state to the fully unfolded state.

Instead of resolving a G4 structure once and leaving the DNA, which would allow the intramolecular G4 structure to form again, Pif1 stays in proximity and continually resolves the G4 DNA using its periodic patrolling activity."

We discovered that monomeric Pif1 is preferentially recruited to 3\u2032-ss-dsDNA junctions and reels in ssDNA while staying at the junction, repeatedly looping out a ssDNA segment. This periodic behavior is ATP dependent and tightly coupled to Pif1\u2019s translocase activity. Previous single-molecule studies have shown that <i>B. stearothermophilus</i> PcrA and <i>Escherichia coli</i> UvrD, two bacterial SF 1A helicases, are both preferentially recruited to 5\u2032-ss-dsDNA junctions and exhibit similar activities with reverse translocation directionality (i.e., 3\u2032\u21925\u2032) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tomko et al., 2010</a>). In addition, we showed that Pif1\u2032s patrolling activity persists in forked and gapped DNA substrates containing a 3\u2032-ss-dsDNA junction, raising the possibility that it may happen when Pif1 binds to various types of DNA intermediates during DNA replication, repair, and recombination where a 3\u2032-ss-dsDNA junction is present."

                        "text": "<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> illustrates several possible biological contexts in which Pif1\u2032s periodic patrolling activity may play important roles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). First, the patrolling activity of a Pif1 monomer can be used to unwind \u2018R-loops\u2019 (RNA-DNA hybrids) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Growing evidence indicates that R-loops occur much more frequently during replication and transcription than previously foreseen, and persistent R-loop formation in cells is a potential source of genome instability including mutations, recombination, chromosomal rearrangements, and chromosome loss (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse, 2012</a>). We showed that a Pif1 monomer can utilize its patrolling activity to remove the RNA strand from 31-bp RNA\u2013DNA hybrids through \u223c200 cycles (and fewer cycles may be needed for shorter heteroduplexes). In contrast, dsDNA unwinding required the cooperation of multiple Pif1 monomers. Therefore, it is possible that Pif1\u2019s periodic patrolling activity contributes to the cell\u2019s ability to remove deleterious R-loops. Second, periodic patrolling may be responsible for Pif1\u2019s telomerase removal activity from 3\u2032 ssDNA ends found at telomeres or DSBs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boule et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Many previous studies show that the translocation activity of monomeric helicases can help displace proteins from DNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lohman et al., 2008</a>). In fact, PcrA utilizes periodic patrolling activity to dismantle potentially deleterious RecA filaments from 5\u2032 ssDNA ends (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park et al., 2010</a>). As it has been proposed that Pif1 inhibits telomerase by unwinding the RNA\u2013DNA hybrid formed between the telomerase RNA and the telomeric DNA end (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boule and Zakian, 2007</a>), Pif1\u2019s periodic patrolling activity, which is capable of unwinding RNA\u2013DNA heteroduplexes, may be responsible for the Pif1-mediated telomerase inhibition at 3\u2032 ssDNA ends. Third, periodic patrolling can be used to keep G4 DNA unfolded at transcription bubble (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), at DSBs or telomeres (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) or on the lagging and/or leading strand during replication (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). We showed that periodic patrolling by a Pif1 monomer can unwind intramolecular G4 DNA structures at every patrolling cycle. Because, as shown here, an unwound G4 DNA refolds immediately (\u223c0.2 s), the periodic patrolling activity of Pif1 due to its anchoring at the junction is critical to ensure that G4 structures are kept resolved. In gapped DNA substrates, the patrolling activity can keep G4 sequences unfolded in the ssDNA gap while leaving the flanking dsDNA regions intact. This intrinsic property of a Pif1 monomer would suppress G4 formation until other DNA metabolic enzymes take over without causing the side effect of uncontrolled dsDNA unwinding."

The three discrete steps observed are likely due to unraveling of G4 DNA one strand at a time (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), which indicates that the G4 unwinding by Pif1 is tightly coupled to its translocation activity. It has been shown that the stabilization energy of a Hoogsteen GG base pair is comparable to that of AT base pair (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mashimo and Sugiyama, 2007</a>), and that the lifetime of G-triplex and G-hairpin could be as long as 0.1\u20131 s, consistent with our observations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2013</a>). In addition, we also showed that a G4 stabilizing compound, BRACO19, cannot inhibit Pif1-mediated G4 unwinding."

The periodic patrolling activity by its monomeric form may keep the enzyme at its sites of in vivo action in displacing telomerase from 3\u2032 ssDNA ends, resolving biologically relevant \u2018R-loops\u2019, and keeping G4 DNA sequences unfolded during DNA replication, recombination and repair. The inability of a Pif1 monomer to display dsDNA unwinding activity might be important for preventing Pif1 monomers from unwinding dsDNA after the Pif1 monomer has displaced proteins, removed RNA strands or resolved G4 structures from within a ssDNA gap."

Cy3-Cy5 labeled pdDNA substrates (50\u2013100 pM) were immobilized on a quartz slide surface coated with polyethyleneglycol (mPEG-SC, Laysan Bio, Arab, AL) in order to eliminate nonspecific surface adsorption of proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ha et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Roy et al., 2008</a>). Surface immobilization was mediated by biotin\u2013Neutravidin interactions between biotinylated DNA, Neutravidin (Thermo Scientific, Newington, NH), and biotinylated polymer (Bio-PEG-SC, Laysan Bio, Arab, AL). To ensure no more than one Pif1 monomer is loaded per DNA (i.e., under monomer conditions), 10 nM Pif1 was incubated with the surface-immobilized DNA for 2 min, and excess unbound proteins were then flushed out from the sample chamber using five chamber volumes of imaging buffer. Next, imaging buffer devoid of proteins was added with 20 \u03bcM ATP (unless specified otherwise) into the chamber. Finally, the Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence intensities from single DNA molecules were recorded with 30-ms time resolution. For some experiments, ATP was added together with proteins into the chamber for data acquisition after immobilizing the DNA substrates. In the pull-down assays, Histidine<sub>6</sub>-tagged Pif1 was pulled down to the surface using an antibody against the Histidine<sub>6</sub>-tag following the procedure described previously (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jain et al., 2011</a>). To study the unwinding of dsDNA or RNA\u2013DNA hybrids, gapped substrates were immobilized on the PEG surface, and the mean Cy3 spot count per image (imaging area = \u223c2500 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>) was then determined from images taken from 5\u201310 different slide regions at different times after introducing ATP."

The background and the cross-talk between the donor and acceptor were considered as previously described (<a href=\"#bib35\">Roy et al., 2008</a>). Analysis of individual FRET-time traces was performed using Origin or programs written in Matlab. Single molecule FRET histograms were generated by averaging for the time period of 0.15 s from \u223c10,000 DNA molecules. The time period Pif1 takes for one cycle of looping, \u0394<i>t</i>, was determined by visually picking the moments when <i>E</i><sub>FRET</sub> reaches its maximum value (i.e., the peaks) in the single molecule FRET-time traces showing periodic sawtooth or wave patterns.

It was found that the stabilization energy of a Hoogsteen GG base pair was less than that of a GC base pair but is comparable to that of AT base pair (Mashimo et al. 2007 Nucleic Acids Symp Ser (Oxf) (51) 239-240. 2) The lifetime of G-triplex and G-hairpin could be as long as 0.1\u20131 seconds, according to previous experiments. For example, previous optical tweezers experiments have identified G-triplex as a stable intermediate <a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al. 2013</a> J Am Chem Soc 135(17):6423-6426: when 32 pN was applied to the two ends of a G4 sequence, the lifetimes of the fully folded state and the G-triplex state were 0.54 s and 0.52 s, respectively. Another example is the unwinding of a small DNA hairpin by a protein migrating along the DNA strand (<a href=\"#bib36\">Roy et al. 2009</a> Nature 461(7267):1092-1097).

In Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., 200 nM Pif1 was pre-incubated with 2 nM DNA before initiating the unwinding reaction by introducing ATP. In contrast, we added 10 or 100 nM Pif1 together with ATP to the DNA-immobilized sample chamber. There are two possible reasons that may lead to the apparent discrepancy: 1) It was not clear how many Pif1 monomers were loaded per DNA molecule in Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., and in fact it is quite likely that more than one Pif1 monomers were loaded per DNA molecule which would lead to efficient unwinding of DNA-DNA duplexes. Under our conditions, we know from the single molecule time traces that at 10 nM Pif1, only one Pif1 monomer is loaded (no unwinding observed) and 100 nM Pif1 results in multiple Pif1 loading per DNA (unwinding observed). 2) In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, the rate-limiting step there for unwinding reaction was the second Pif1 monomer binding to DNA. As a result, 100 nM Pif1 took several minutes to unwind DNA-DNA duplexes at 1 mM ATP. However, in Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., which pre-assembled the helicase on the DNA the 0.3 sec did not include the binding time of Pif1 at all. Another possibility is a limited processivity of DNA unwinding by Pif1 oligomer. It may unwind 16 bp rapidly whereas 31 bp may require multiple attempts, hence slower. We added the following sentence to the manuscript: \u201cThe dsDNA unwinding speed previously reported was much higher (\u223c 0.3 second for unwinding 16 bp dsDNA) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al. 2013</a>) either because the helicase was preassembled on the DNA before introducing ATP in that study, or due to a limited processivity of dsDNA unwinding by Pif1 oligomer.\u201d"

The presence of R-loops and G4 structures, if not resolved in a timely manner, would result in genome instability including replication pauses, mutations, recombination, chromosomal rearrangements and chromosome loss (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse 2012</a> Mol Cell 46(2):115-124, <a href=\"#bib31\">Paeschke et al. 2011</a> Cell 145(5):678-691, <a href=\"#bib30\">Paeschke et al., 2013</a> Nature 497:458-462)."

Pif1 initiates in all the experiments at the 3'-ss-dsDNA junction.

Therefore, the patrolling activity we report in this manuscript could take part in many scenarios where the 3\u2019-ss-dsDNA junctions are present."
