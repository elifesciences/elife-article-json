Now, in eLife, Alexander Fleischman and colleagues \u2013 including Benjamin Roland, Rebecca Jordan and Dara Sosulski as joint first authors \u2013 report on the neural mechanisms that allow information about \u2018minority\u2019 odors to be detected through the overwhelming haze of another smell (<a href=\"#bib7\">Roland et al., 2016</a>)."

Mice normally express about 1100 subtypes of odorant receptor and scatter these evenly over several million receptor neurons (with each receptor neuron having one odorant receptor subtype).

However, mice can still detect other \u2018minority\u2019 odors because the neurons in the olfactory bulb (which receive signals from the olfactory receptor neurons) become less sensitive to signals from the dominant M71 receptors, and more sensitive to signals from other receptors (shown here in yellow, green, black and blue). The heights of the sliders in the ovals represent the level of gain in that circuit: high gain leads to high sensitivity. This ultimately enables each odor to produce an equal-sized output from the olfactory bulb (represented by the width of the arrows at the bottom of the figure)."

The study involved a behavioral task in which the animals had to discriminate unscented air from air that contained various concentrations of odors. The M71 transgenic mice were capable of quite subtle discriminations for all the tested odors except acetophenone."

For example, they used multiphoton imaging to record the activity of populations of neurons called mitral cells that transmit information from the bulb to the other olfactory regions of the brain. They also used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to acquire detailed readouts from individual mitral cells in both anesthetized and awake mice. These measurements showed that the responses of the mitral cells in M71 transgenic mice are very similar to those of normal mice. The fraction of cells that respond to odors, including acetophenone, was indistinguishable from that seen in normal mice. The same was true for the time courses of the responses, and also\u00a0for\u00a0the dependence of odor-driven mitral cell activity on the mouse\u2019s breathing patterns. The only apparent difference was that the output responses were more variable in the transgenic mice, and were slightly weaker to non-acetophenone odors."

Not only does the olfactory system amplify responses to weak odorant inputs (that is, odors other than acetophenone) in the M71 transgenic mice, it also suppresses the massive sensory input (from acetophenone) that drives 95% of the sensory neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This normalization preserves much of the information about the detected odors despite the sensory input being hugely distorted."

These inputs increase in response to acetophenone, while there is less inhibition of other \u2018minority\u2019 odors than there is in normal mice. Based on the results of optical imaging, Roland et al. ascribe this change in the pattern of inhibition to cells called periglomerular cells that are found in the input layer of the olfactory bulb, but other explanations are also possible (<a href=\"#bib6\">Mori et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Boyd et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Kato et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Miyamichi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Banerjee et al., 2015</a>). Future work can build on the results of Roland et al. and isolate the contributions of the various olfactory circuit elements using modern genetic approaches and the large battery of tools that neuroscientists can use to manipulate neuronal activity."

The outcome of such filtering (as seen in M71 transgenic mice) is exactly what one sees in an electronic circuit forced to find a small signal on a huge background. The circuit and bulb both become a little less sensitive and a little noisier. However, a typical electronic circuit has to do this for just one signal. The remarkable accomplishment of the olfactory bulb, as highlighted by Roland, Jordan, Sosulski, Fleischman and colleagues, is to do this for a variety of different signals."
