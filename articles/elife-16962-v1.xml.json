The shortest sensory pathway to any muscle connects via three synapses, although most pathways involve more. The left and right sides of the brain differ in the types of neurons they contain and the connections these form, even though both sides have the same number of cells."

Even predominantly symmetrical bilaterians exhibit various forms of sidedness, in both protostomes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grande and Patel, 2009</a>) and deuterostomes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hamada et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Duboc et al., 2005</a>). In large, complex brains, these anatomical asymmetries are often structurally cryptic, and gene expression has been used as a proxy to examine the evolution of sidedness. As a sister group to vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cameron et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Satoh et al., 2014</a>), ascidians have larvae that are chordate in body plan and mode of development, with a dorsal central nervous system (CNS). In the\u00a0~1 mm tadpole larva of <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> neurons are distributed rostrocaudally in three main centres, a brain vesicle, motor ganglion and caudal nerve cord (<a href=\"#bib43\">Katz, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nicol and Meinertzhagen, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Meinertzhagen et al., 2004</a>). The CNS forms from a neural tube, yet exhibits left/right differences, and so provides a useful model to study many aspects of brain asymmetry. This issue is important because brain laterality has been associated with increased fitness for animal life (<a href=\"#bib21\">Duboc et al., 2015</a>)."

Gametes undergo fertilization, cleavage, development, and then hatch into non-feeding lecithotrophic larvae in the water column. Initially after hatching, larvae swim up toward the surface of the water by negative geotaxis using the otolith cell (<a href=\"#bib92\">Tsuda et al., 2003</a>) a behaviour retained in ocellus-ablated larvae. Later in larval life, larvae exhibit negative phototaxis, swimming down to find appropriate substrates for settlement (<a href=\"#bib92\">Tsuda et al., 2003</a>). The swimming period exhibits three characterized behaviours: tail flicks (~10 Hz), \u2018spontaneous\u2019 swimming (~33 Hz), and shadow response (~32 Hz; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zega et al., 2006</a>). Larvae swim more frequently and for longer periods earlier in life up to 2 hr post hatching (hph). Of the reported behaviors, the shadow response, in which a dimming of light results in symmetrical swimming, is the best studied, developing at 1.5 hph and increasing in tailbeat\u00a0frequency after 2 hph (<a href=\"#bib98\">Zega et al., 2006</a>). In addition to phototactic and geotactic behavior, there is evidence of chemotactic behavior just before settlement (<a href=\"#bib87\">Svane and Young, 1989</a>) and of some mechanosensory responses in swimming larvae (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bone, 1992</a>). Because larvae do not feed, their main biological imperative is survival and successful settlement to undergo metamorphosis into a sessile adult, in an environment with appropriate food and reproductive resources. Thus, entering the water current and avoiding predation by filter feeders may be the foundation for the larva\u2019s many behavioral networks, especially in early life before settlement."

Sensory neurons of the CNS and their interneurons reside in the BV, which has an expanded neural canal and the most complex neuropil. The relay neurons of the posterior brain vesicle extend axons through the neck to the motor ganglion, which overlies the anterior portion of the notochord, and contains neurons of the motor system. At the trunk-tail border, muscle cells of the tail flank the notochord and CNS, and these extend down through the tail alongside the narrow, simple CNC. In addition to the CNS several sensory epidermal neurons (ENs) of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) populate the dorsal and ventral axes of the larva in a rostrocaudal sequence, with axons running beneath the epidermis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Imai and Meinertzhagen, 2007b</a>)."

Photoreceptor neurons associated with the ocellus are of the ciliary type, with outer segment lamellae orientated parallel to the cilium (<a href=\"#bib24\">Eakin and Kuda, 1971</a>), in contrast to the perpendicular arrangement found in vertebrate rods (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lamb and Collin, 2007</a>). The photoreceptor cells of the ocellus on the right of the brain vesicle, which number 20 cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Horie et al., 2008</a>), 17 and 18 of which had been reported by <a href=\"#bib59\">Nicol and Meinertzhagen (1991)</a>, are twinned with 17 to 19 structurally different coronet cells (previously claimed hydrostatic pressure receptor cells: <a href=\"#bib24\">Eakin and Kuda, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nicol and Meinertzhagen, 1991</a>) on the left. This sidedness may also correspond to larval behavior because ascidian larvae pursue a helical trajectory when swimming (<a href=\"#bib50\">McHenry and Strother, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">McHenry, 2005</a>) and ascidian larvae are thought to use klinotaxis to respond to visual cues by modulating the symmetry of tail kinematics (<a href=\"#bib50\">McHenry and Strother, 2003</a>). The pattern of helical swimming arises from bilateral contractions of the\u00a0tiered muscle bands on either side of the notochord. On each side, gap junctions connect all 18 uninucleate muscle cells, arranged in three rows, dorsal medial and ventral (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bone, 1992</a>). Muscle activity along the tail is thus not segmental, and instead propagates posteriorly in a wave from innervated anterior dorsal and medial muscle cells at the trunk-tail border without the requirement for additional neuronal input along the tail (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bone, 1992</a>)."

These obstacles are resolved in the CNS of the tadpole larva of <i>Ciona</i>, in which not only is the asymmetrical organization obvious, but the possibility exists to uncover the larva\u2019s complete network of neuronal synaptic connections, or its connectome (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lichtman and Sanes, 2008</a>). That possibility rests on the tiny size of the brain, the small number of its constituent cells, approximately 330 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Nicol and Meinertzhagen, 1991</a>), and the morphological simplicity of its neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Imai and Meinertzhagen, 2007a</a>). The apparent symmetry of the characteristic swimming pattern of chordate-like tail undulations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bone, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) stands in marked contrast to the asymmetries in the CNS that generates them.

Most neurons are monopolar,\u00a0&lt;25% only having dendrites, and their axons usually form a clear terminal. Axons fasciculate in bundles but braid their positions within their bundle or sometimes defasciculate. Brain vesicle (BV) intrinsic interneurons have approximately equal numbers of presynaptic sites over their axons as their terminals, each constituting approximately 40% of their total. In contrast, axo-axonal synapses are the predominant synapses involving relay and motor ganglion (MG) interneurons, comprising\u00a0&gt;50% for both ascending and descending MG interneurons and\u00a0&gt;35% for BV relay neurons. The abundance of <i>en passant</i> synaptic contacts in the larval CNS of <i>Ciona</i> is particularly apparent when examining the proportional distribution of postsynaptic sites. Synapses formed by BV relay neurons at their terminals form <i>en passant</i> onto the axons and terminals of both relay and MG neuron targets, which together constitute\u00a0&gt;20% of all BV relay neurons\u2019 presynaptic contacts. Likewise,\u00a0&gt;50% of BV intrinsic interneuron synapses form <i>en passant</i> from their axons or terminals onto the axons or terminals of their targets. Synapses from terminal to terminal also constitute the greatest proportion of photoreceptor synapses (43%), and <i>en passant</i> synapses constitute over 60% of their contacts."

The brain vesicle has unequal numbers of neurons and pigment cells, however, with more sensory neurons and pigment cells on the right side and more interneurons on the left (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Many of these left-side interneurons were previously identified as ciliated ependymal cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Nicol and Meinertzhagen, 1991</a>), but have been seen here to possess axons and synapses that were not visible by light microscopy, and are thus to be considered neurons. Excluding ependymal cells, each brain region has approximately equal numbers of cells\u00a0on both sides (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Despite this near equal distribution in their overall numbers, however, examples of asymmetries in the numbers of identified neuron types, or numbers of neurons of each type, were nevertheless also found amongst specific interneuron classes in the brain vesicle. In the ventral motor ganglion most neurons are paired, including five pairs of motor neurons and four pairs of interneurons, whereas caudally among the ascending contralateral interneurons, ACINs, there were two representatives on the left and one on the right, as well as two descending posterior motor ganglion neurons (PMGNs) found only on the right (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

Additional synapses are formed at close range onto other interneurons, including relay neurons (pr-corRN and ant-corRN), or onto neighbouring coronet cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

In addition to the Group I photoreceptors of the ocellus, two anterior rows of Group II photoreceptors adjacent to the ocellus have ciliary outer segments that extend into the neural canal, with smaller terminals extending a short distance into the posterior brain vesicle neuropil. The number and arrangement of photoreceptor neurons confirms the presence of the additional class of photoreceptors identified using Ci-opsin immunolabeling, with outer segments outside the ocellus pigment (<a href=\"#bib36\">Horie et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2008</a>). These photoreceptors, along with those of the ocellus, total 30, as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib36\">Horie et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2008</a>). We identify 23 with outer segments that projected into the ocellus pigment, and 7 into the neural canal (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The 17\u201318 photoreceptors reported by <a href=\"#bib59\">Nicol and Meinertzhagen (1991)</a> appear to represent just some of the rows of nuclei from the five fans of ocellus photoreceptors, those that were visible in semithin sections and that lay close to the opaque pigment. In addition to the 30 photoreceptors, three anterior sensory interneurons, unique in having axons within the sensory axon tract, lie on the right side in the anterior brain vesicle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We also identify a further group of seven Group III (<a href=\"#bib37\">Horie et al., 2008</a>) right-side photoreceptors which lie posterior and ventral to the 30 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), are vacuolated, and have outer segments that are less well organized."

Unlike their right-side counterparts PR-AMGRN(R) (cells 108, 116, 127, 157, 123, and 130), the left-side photoreceptor relay neurons PRRN(L) (cells 74, 94, 80, 86, 96, 100, 121, and 126) receive photoreceptor input exclusively from Type I ocellus photoreceptors (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Two ventral antenna neurons (Ant1 and Ant2), which are proposed to signal input from otolith position (<a href=\"#bib91\">Torrence, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Tsuda et al., 2003</a>), lack obvious sidedness in their cell body positions, and extend collateral axons toward the posterior brain vesicle (BV). The terminals of these antenna cells, however, differ in their synaptic input to sides of the posterior BV: Antenna cell 1 to both sides, and Antenna cell 2 predominantly to right-side relay neurons (AntRN). One right-side antenna relay neuron, located more ventrally (Ant-corRN; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), is also postsynaptic to coronet cells."

These synapses are as a result not formed directly onto contralateral motor neurons, as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib35\">Horie et al., 2010</a>), but instead onto interneurons (cells MGIN1R, MGIN2R and MGIN3R) of the right side (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15A</a>).

These include the wide range and combination of cells that share synaptic contacts, the poorly segregated distribution of synapses over the neuron surface; synapses onto non-neuronal cells and basal lamina; unpolarized and mixed vesicle synapses resembling those in cnidarians (<a href=\"#bib94\">Westfall, 1996</a>); and the apparent general redundancy in the connectome. Unpolarized synapses have been previously reported between coelenterate (<a href=\"#bib38\">Horridge and Mackay, 1962</a>) and pulmonate mollusc (<a href=\"#bib49\">McCarrager and Chase, 1985</a>) neurons, while synapses onto the basal lamina have been reported in muscle after removing the underlying myofibres (<a href=\"#bib75\">Sanes et al., 1978</a>). Synaptic sites that occur onto the basal lamina, and that therefore lack postsynaptic partners, resemble other presynaptic sites in the CNS, and resemble neuromuscular junctions, where neurotransmitter must cross the basal lamina to act on adjacent muscle cells. Some presumed sites of synaptic release across the basal lamina lie opposite non-neuronal cells, including epidermal cells or cells of the notochord. Neurotransmitter receptor expression studies are critical to our understanding of the roles these special sites of synaptic vesicle release may play. Sites that lack adjacent cells may be sites of neuromodulator release. This is particularly likely in the case of coronet cells, which express reporters for dopamine and have exclusively dense-core vesicles at their synapses onto the basal lamina. Synaptic reciprocity and serial networks are commonplace in many nervous systems (e.g. <a href=\"#bib20\">Dowling and Boycott, 1966</a>). Aided by the numerical simplicity of the <i>Ciona</i> CNS, we are also able to detect features such as cilia that may lie undetected in highly populated vertebrate brains, and confirm that many neurons in <i>Ciona</i> are ciliated (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The small number of its component neurons is reflected in turn in the relatively small numbers of synapses formed by each, conforming to an overall relationship between neuron number and synapse number per neuron seen in nervous systems generally. In contrast to both is the richness of cell types. Among the 177 larval neurons we can distinguish at least 25 different types and 52 subtypes identified on the basis of morphological and connectivity differences. <i>C. elegans</i> has a numerically comparable richness, with 118 cell types among its 302 neurons (<a href=\"#bib95\">White et al., 1986</a>)."

The pattern of cell lineage is left/right symmetrical until the 11th cleavage, with ventral divisions becoming desynchronized after the 10th cleavage (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cole and Meinertzhagen, 2004</a>).

Thus the fate choice, for example between neuron and ependymal cell type, generates the sidedness in the numbers of cells comprising the same class. A striking example is provided by the ACIN neurons in the rostral caudal nerve cord. Thus A11.116 undergoes two divisions, first to yield A12.231 and A12.232 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Nishitsuji et al., 2012</a>: their <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and a further round of divisions, yielding a total of four 13th-generation cells that become two ACIN and two ependymal cells. The fate decision to generate ependymal and ACIN cells is then proposed to occur after this final division, based on the expression of extracellular signals and transcription factors. The total number of ACINs varies between larvae (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nishino et al., 2010</a>), and in the larva we report, this variation manifests itself as an asymmetry, in which we observe two progeny of the left side as ACINs, with only a single ACIN present on the right, the other site being occupied by ependymal cell tail 4. Thus variation in cell fate decision is, we propose, the basis for the left/right asymmetry in ACIN neurons. We also find neurons on the right side (PMGN1 and PMGN2) of a hitherto unreported type that are located anterior to the single ACIN (ACIN2L) of that side, but posterior to motor neuron pair MN5. Their asymmetrical location suggests they may represent similar late choices between neuronal and ependymal cell fate."

Additional features of the network\u2019s right side also support this asymmetry: the lack of ACIN1 on the right side, and the two additional right-side interneurons with neurites that remain ipsilateral, and the lack of inhibitory feedback to the first interneuron on the right from the ipsilateral ACIN. An additional left-right asymmetry is provided by the input from the first interneurons MG1 L and R to the second interneurons MG2 L and R, which is far greater on the left than on the right side, and supported by an asymmetrical distribution of gap junctions. The latter is endorsing, and unusual because putative pathways formed by gap junctions are in general more symmetrical than those formed by chemical synapses."

The\u00a0animals were then post-fixed in 0.2M phosphate buffer containing 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C. Prior to fixation newly hatched larvae received light from a dissecting microscope fibre optic illuminator only briefly to check that they were swimming, and to pipette them into the fixative. Fixed specimens were dehydrated in an ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, for 10 min each, followed by 90% 95%, 100% then propylene oxide for 5 min each). After dehydration, specimens were placed overnight at 23\u00b0C in a dish containing propylene oxide and Poly/Bed 812 resin 1:1. Sibling larvae, the products of a single cross, were next transferred to 100% resin for 3 hr and then placed in 100% resin and polymerized at 60\u00b0C for 48 hr.

Images were imported into either a high magnification or low magnification series in Reconstruct (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fiala, 2005</a>), and sections manually aligned using this software. All profiles in every third section, somata in the low-magnification series and all profiles in the high-magnification series, were then traced completely. Fewer than five neurites were candidate orphans that lacked synapses, and thus did not contribute to the CNS connectome. Skeletonization of neurite projections was accomplished using the function Z-Trace in Reconstruct, which connects the mid-point of each traced profile. In the high magnification series, traces were hidden and all sections then blindly annotated for synapses, putative gap junctions, dense-core vesicles and cilia. After each block of sections was annotated, the traces were then made visible and annotated elements assigned to specific pre- and postsynaptic elements. Blind annotation was duplicated in 100 section blocks by an independent annotator (Ms Carlie Langille). Most annotations of each viewer duplicated existing synaptic contacts seen by the other, but neither viewer annotated a synapse between two partners that did not replicate a synapse formed elsewhere by the same two cells. Of the differences observed, 95% were simply those between the numbers of sections in which a synapse was observed."

Synapses were identified based on the criteria established in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib95\">White et al., 1986</a>) of a cluster of vesicles at a presynaptic membrane. Although postsynaptic densities were observed at some synapses (<a href=\"#bib68\">Peters and Palay, 1996</a>), these were either not clear or not present at all sites with a presynaptic vesicle cluster. Putative gap junctions were annotated at sites with juxtaposed membranes and densities on the membranes of both sides, except where such contacts were directly adjacent to the neural canal, which are candidate desmosomes and were not studied further. The numbers of synapses and the numbers of sections in which a synaptic profile, a single imaged cross-section of a synapse, was observed from each were both measures used to quantify synaptic strength, as was their product, the total depth of synaptic profiles. The cumulative depth of synaptic contact was calculated by multiplying the number of sections in which a synapse was observed by the section thickness. These values for each presynaptic neuron were linearly proportional (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); the relationship remained unchanged for the numbers of synapses per neuron when small synapses \u2013 those containing only a single section -- were removed. This depth in \u00b5m was used for network diagrams as a putative proxy for synaptic strength."

Nuclear x/y positions are reported in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> Partitioning the parts of each neuron (cell body/soma, axon, terminal, or dendrite) was determined by examining the reconstructed neuron and identifying the sections at the boundaries between these parts. Axons were distinguished from their somata of origin by the reduction in profile diameter, and terminals were distinguished from axons where we observed branching or expansions with presynaptic sites near their final termination. Many terminals had but small swellings, and their synapses occurred onto collateral terminals or axons, so were considered en passant. Dendrites were those regions proximal to the cell body in which short neurites extended, with or without branching. Some relay neurons contain expanded branched regions near their axon hillock, which we classified as \u2018BVterm\u2019 and these were included in the\u00a0analysis of dendritic synapse. Exclusively postsynaptic dendrites were lacking in the CNS. Despite our attempts to partition them in this way, neurons were characterized by a lack of segregation of pre- and postsynaptic sites along their length and a general absence of defining features for each region."

Moreover, Ciona is a chordate, having a notochord and dorsal nerve cord. Therefore, the features of the connectome are of particular interest as a point of comparison to the previously available connectome of <i>C. elegans</i>. When there was only a single connectome available, and that of a tiny, potentially highly-derived invertebrate, it was difficult to know what to make of it and whether one could generalize its characteristics to other animals.

Similar features include similar overall cell numbers but a rather large number of cell types, largely unbranched neurons making en passant synapses, similar numbers of chemical and gap junction synapses, many polyadic synapses, and little segregation of neurons into separated axonal and dendritic regions, indicating graded potential neurons. In the beginning of the Discussion the authors claim that many features of the connectome are basal. These may indeed be, but there really is little support for this claim. As there are no other connectomes to compare to apart from <i>C. elegans</i>, how can we know, for example, that \"the apparent general lack of precision\" is basal? The only support mentioned for one feature being basal is that unpolarized synapses are seen in coelenterates. But they are also seen in a pulmonate mollusc.

Apparently the issue of l/r asymmetry has been well-studied in ascidians and results from asymmetric nodal expression during embryogenesis as it is in vertebrates. Most of the Discussion is devoted to this issue. Since we know many morphological features of the body are asymmetric, we can expect this will be true for the nervous system as well; it's not clear why so much is made of this here."

Many neurons generally considered to be interneurons because of the large number of synapses they make with other neurons also make nmj's, while many neurons considered to be motor neurons also have lots of synapses onto other neurons. \"Motor neurons\" can have stretch receptors, and \"sensory neurons\" can have synapses onto muscle. Careful examination reveals that where the cut-offs should in fact be among these broadest classes is unclear and may be somewhat arbitrary. When the manuscript first refers to different neuron types (subsection \u201cNeurons\u201d: brain vesicle intrinsic interneurons, MG interneurons, BV relay interneurons), the reader does not know what these neuron types are.
