The mechanism in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> has been elusive due to improperly annotated transcription start sites (TSSs). Here we define TSSs and the distribution of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide in wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective animals to dissect this regulatory mechanism. Our TSS-mapping strategy integrates GRO-seq, which tracks nascent transcription, with a new derivative of this method, called GRO-cap, which recovers nascent RNAs with 5\u2032 caps prior to their removal by co-transcriptional processing. Our analyses reveal that promoter-proximal pausing is rare, unlike in other metazoans, and promoters are unexpectedly far upstream from the 5\u2032 ends of mature mRNAs. We find that <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> equalizes X-chromosome expression between the sexes, to a level equivalent to autosomes, by reducing Pol II recruitment to promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes using a chromosome-restructuring condensin complex."

The mechanism in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> has been elusive due to improperly annotated transcription start sites (TSSs). Here we define TSSs and the distribution of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide in wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective animals to dissect this regulatory mechanism. Our TSS-mapping strategy integrates GRO-seq, which tracks nascent transcription, with a new derivative of this method, called GRO-cap, which recovers nascent RNAs with 5\u2032 caps prior to their removal by co-transcriptional processing. Our analyses reveal that promoter-proximal pausing is rare, unlike in other metazoans, and promoters are unexpectedly far upstream from the 5\u2032 ends of mature mRNAs. We find that <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> equalizes X-chromosome expression between the sexes, to a level equivalent to autosomes, by reducing Pol II recruitment to promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes using a chromosome-restructuring condensin complex."

The failure to dosage compensate is lethal. Dosage compensation strategies differ across species, but invariably a regulatory complex is targeted to the X chromosomes of one sex to modulate transcription along the entire X. The molecular mechanisms by which these complexes regulate gene expression remain elusive. Here we analyzed X-chromosome dosage compensation in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to determine the step of transcription controlled by its dosage compensation complex (DCC). The DCC binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to reduce transcription by half (<a href=\"#bib50\">Meyer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</a>). Sequence-specific DNA binding sites recruit the DCC to X and facilitate its spreading along X (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ercan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jans et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</a>). The DCC shares subunits with condensin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Csankovszki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mets and Meyer, 2009</a>), a protein complex required for the compaction, resolution, and segregation of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wood et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that DCC-dependent changes in chromosome structure facilitate transcription regulation. In principle, the DCC could control any step of transcription: recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the gene promoter, initiation of transcription, escape of Pol II from the promoter or proximal pause sites, elongation of RNA transcripts, or termination of transcription."

Nascent RNA transcripts from approximately 70% of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> genes undergo a rapid co-transcriptional processing event in which the 5\u2032 end is replaced by a common 22-nucleotide leader RNA (SL1) through a trans-splicing mechanism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blumenthal, 2012</a>). Because trans-splicing removes information about Pol II initiation from nascent RNAs, TSSs have been difficult to identify from accumulated mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Morton and Blumenthal, 2011</a>). The paucity of annotated promoters has made transcription regulation a challenge to study in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>.

(<b>A</b>) <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al. (2013)</a> analyzed scRNA sequencing data from mixed-stage embryos to annotate transcription start sites (TSSs). They required that clusters of scRNA signal (labeled as \u2018TICs\u2019 and shown in red or blue) be within 200 bp of the WormBase (WB) start to be annotated as a new TSS. They then classified as enhancers (shown in yellow) the scRNA clusters that are not associated with a gene, have specific chromatin modifications not associated with promoters, and overlap with transcription factor binding sites. Shown is a panel from their Figure 6A (\u00a9 Genome Research, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Our GRO-seq and GRO-cap (TAP+ minus TAP\u2212) data from mixed-stage embryos are shown for the same genomic region upstream of the <i>tol-1</i> gene as in Figure 6A. Our data and their data are precisely aligned. In this example, spikes of GRO-cap signal correspond with TICs, and several GRO-cap spikes correspond to their newly annotated enhancers. Continuous ChIP-chip signal for hypo-phosphorylated Pol II (8WG16 antibody, modENCODE_3545) and continuous GRO-seq signal occur from the most upstream enhancer to the WB start. The GRO-seq signal increases in intensity as it passes GRO-cap spikes and TICs, suggesting that each transcription initiation event contributes to the cumulative Pol II signal, which stops increasing in intensity once it reaches the WB start. In addition, no 3\u2032 UTRs or polyA sites were found in this <i>tol-1</i> upstream region from the data sets of <a href=\"#bib34\">Jan et al. (2011)</a> and <a href=\"#bib47\">Mangone et al. (2010)</a>, implying no <i>tol-1-</i>independent polyadenylated transcription units in the upstream region. This analysis suggests that for this region some enhancers are likely to be TSSs that give rise to full-length transcripts.

The distance between the TSS and both the WB start and the trans-splice acceptor site is 2534 bp. This example further supports the proposal that a proportion of the enhancers are outron TSSs.

ChIP-chip data from modENCODE for hypo-phosphorylated Pol II antibody and the lack of 3\u2032 UTRs support the TSS call. The distance between the TSS and the WB start is 2878 bp, while the distance from the TSS to the trans-splice acceptor site is 2875 bp. This example further supports the proposal that a proportion of the enhancers are outron TSSs. The ChIP-chip signal 3\u2032 of the <i>pat-2</i> 3\u2032 UTR is from the genes on the opposite strand.

Of particular importance to this study, GRO-cap permits analysis of RNAs prior to their co-transcriptional processing, which replaces true transcription start sites (TSSs) with trans-spliced leader RNAs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. GRO-seq run-ons have been tuned to extend the length of nascent RNAs by only 100 nucleotides on average, thus minimizing any possibility that independent transcription units might been artifactually linked. In GRO-cap, nuclei are isolated and RNA polymerases are allowed to transcribe briefly in a run-on reaction in the presence of Br-UTP, as in GRO-seq. RNA is isolated but the base-hydrolysis step of GRO-seq is omitted to increase the probability of capturing nascent RNA molecules with a 5\u2032 7-methyl-GTP cap. BrU-RNAs made during the run-on reaction are enriched by selection with anti-BrdU beads to ensure the identification of true TSSs from capped nascent RNAs rather than 5\u2032 ends from RNAs that received post-transcriptional capping (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fejes-Toth et al., 2009</a>). A 3\u2032 RNA adapter (red) is ligated to the RNAs, followed by another round of bead enrichment. Selection against 5\u2032 mono-phosphate RNAs that do not represent capped RNAs (and any carry-through 5\u2032 RNA adapters) is achieved by sequential enzymatic treatment with Terminator exonuclease to degrade 5\u2032 mono-phosphate RNAs and then alkaline phosphatase to remove 5\u2032 phosphates from 5\u2032 mono-phosphate RNAs resistant to the exonuclease. Half of the nuclear run-on (NRO) RNA pool is treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP+) to remove the 5\u2032 cap from the RNA, thereby exposing a 5\u2032 mono-phosphate. The other half is left untreated (TAP\u2212) to provide a control population of residual 5\u2032 mono-phosphate RNAs that never had 5\u2032 caps. The 5\u2032 mono-phosphate RNAs are ligated to 5\u2032 RNA adapters (blue). The TAP+ and TAP\u2212 samples are prepared for Illumina sequencing as in GRO-seq by reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and then amplification of DNA from 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 adapter regions. We note that transcripts &lt;500 bp are captured most efficiently on Illumina sequencing platforms. The enriched TSS regions are identified by mapping the 5\u2032 ends of the sequence reads back to the genome and comparing the TAP+ and TAP\u2212 sites to eliminate false TSSs. Comparing the GRO-cap candidate TSSs to the 5\u2032 ends of transcription units defined by GRO-seq permits reliable assignment of TSSs to transcription units."

First, 3\u2032 UTRs or polyA signals are rare in outrons of &gt;1 kb in length, indicating the engaged Pol II is not from independent polyadenylated transcripts. From 565 such outrons, only 1.4% had an identified 3\u2032 UTR in the <a href=\"#bib34\">Jan et al. (2011)</a> study, and 0.7% had a 3\u2032 UTR in the <a href=\"#bib47\">Mangone et al. (2010)</a> study. Furthermore, only 3.5% had a polyA site (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mangone et al., 2010</a>). Second, regions corresponding to long outrons have a continuous ChIP-chip signal from antibodies enriched for either the ser2 phosphorylated form of Pol II or the hypo-phosphorylated form of Pol II (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8A\u2013C</a>). These results and the restricted run-on length of \u223c100 nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib16\">Core et al., 2008</a>) indicate that the GRO-seq signal corresponds to bound Pol II in vivo and is not an artifact of the nuclear run-on (NRO) reactions in vitro extending beyond the 3\u2019 ends defined in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Third, a heat map of individual genes showing the GRO-cap signal relative to TSSs reveals that a dominant TSS contributes the majority of the vast GRO-cap signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Together these observations strongly support the argument that the GRO-cap signal paired with the continuous GRO-seq signal from WB starts defines true TSSs. Recently published studies of TSSs in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> that used cutoffs for TSS calls of either 1 kb upstream (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gu et al., 2012</a>) or 200 bp upstream (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) of WB starts identified some outron TSSs but could not identify TSSs for a large class of genes with longer outrons (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

The prevalence in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> of polycistronic operons requiring extensive RNA processing to produce monocistronic mRNAs caused us to ask whether 3\u2032 Pol II accumulation was positively correlated with the gene\u2019s position in an operon and hence the level of RNA processing. First and middle genes in an operon require two forms of co-transcriptional RNA processing at the 3\u2032 end to generate monocistronic mRNAs, polyadenylation of the upstream gene, and trans-splicing of the downstream gene, while the terminal gene requires only polyadenylation at the 3\u2032 end. First and middle genes showed more 3\u2032 accumulation than terminal genes or genes not in operons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). In other words, 3\u2032 pausing is longer at genes with another gene to process just downstream. The 3\u2032 Pol II accumulation at terminal genes and genes not in operons was equivalent, yet greater than in <i>Drosophila</i> genes. Lastly, 3\u2032 accumulation was similar between terminal genes of operons and monocistronic genes undergoing trans-splicing, and both gene sets had greater 3\u2032 accumulation than monocistronic genes lacking trans-splicing, which nonetheless had more 3\u2032 accumulation than <i>Drosophila</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Cues triggering trans-splicing, particularly operon-specific trans-splicing, appear to facilitate 3\u2032 accumulation and perhaps predispose <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> Pol II to greater 3\u2032 pausing genome-wide, whether or not a gene resides in an operon. It should be noted that Pol II accumulation at 3\u2032 ends does not overlap with U-rich regions at 3\u2032 ends. Therefore, the high GRO-seq signal is not due to selective enrichment of U-rich RNAs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>)."

The DCC contains not only the X loaders (red, orange) but also five homologs of the mitotic condensin complex (yellow, blue, green). The DCC binds to the X chromosomes of only XX animals to reduce transcription by half, thereby equalizing X-chromosome gene expression between males (XO) and hermaphrodites (XX).

Shown are the total number of genes, the median <i>sdc-2</i> mutant/control RNAi expression ratio, the average <i>sdc-2</i> mutant/control RNAi expression ratio together with the standard error of the mean, and the number of genes in each set that are more highly expressed in each condition. Across numerous protein-coding gene sets, the X chromosome is more highly expressed and the autosomes are slightly less expressed in the <i>sdc-2</i> mutant. Furthermore, when X-linked genes are significantly changed in expression, they are almost exclusively increased in expression. Each gene set is separated into two sets, one containing all genes and the other containing genes that are significantly changed in expression as determined by analysis with DESeq (p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>). For the first two lists (labeled with \u2018\u2265250 bp\u2019), average GRO-seq gene expression was calculated from the beginning to the end of either the WormBase (WB) model or the newly annotated transcription start site (TSS) gene model. WB genes had to be expressed at greater than 1 RPKM (reads per kilobase per million), and have at least 250 uniquely mappable bases in both sets. For the next set (labeled with \u2018WormBase WS230 Genes \u22651.1 kb\u2019), average GRO-seq expression was calculated for genes greater than 1.1 kb, with the first and last 300 bp of the gene excluded. The level of expression had to be \u22651 RPKM for WB genes, and have at least 250 uniquely mappable bases for a gene to be included. For the final two sets of genes (labeled with \u2018\u22651.1 kb\u2019 and \u2018\u22651.5 kb\u2019), expression was calculated for genes of the indicated length that have a newly annotated TSS, with the first and last 300 bp of the gene excluded. A gene had to have at least 250 uniquely mappable bases for it to be included. RNA polymerase II transcribed microRNAs are controlled by dosage compensation, while RNA polymerase III transcribed tRNAs are not. Average GRO-seq gene expression from <i>sdc-2</i> mutant and control RNAi embryos was compared across ncRNAs. For microRNAs, expression values were calculated from the full length of the WB \u2018primary transcript\u2019 or re-annotated TSS gene models. For tRNAs, expression values were calculated from the beginning of the \u2018mature transcript\u2019 to 50 bp downstream of the stop. Because tRNAs are highly repetitive and transcription of highly transcribed tRNAs continues downstream of the stop, the extra 50 bp was included to increase the unique mappability of each tRNA. For a gene to be considered for analysis, it had to have at least 25 bp of uniquely mappable DNA, and to have an average expression of at least 1 RPKM in both control RNAi and <i>sdc-2</i> mutant embryos. The median and mean <i>sdc-2</i>/control expression levels show that X-linked microRNAs are more susceptible to dosage compensation than autosomal microRNAs. X-linked tRNAs are decreased slightly in expression in the <i>sdc-2</i> mutant, suggesting that its expression is not controlled by dosage compensation."

Furthermore, an increase in transcription initiation by bound polymerases cannot account for these results, but an increase in Pol II recruitment can.

The answer to this question has been controversial, although evidence has mounted in favor of a mechanism to balance total expression between X chromosomes and the two sets of autosomes based on measurements of accumulated transcripts (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Deng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Disteche, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Deng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jue et al., 2013</a>). Our GRO-seq experiments have addressed this question in the most definitive way to date by measuring the levels of nascent transcripts prior to co-transcriptional processing. We show that in wild-type <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> embryos, X and autosomes have nearly equivalent levels of total gene expression, and that levels of transcribing Pol II are uniform across X and autosomal genes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). In dosage-compensation-defective mutants, the level of X expression and engaged Pol II exceeds that of autosomes by 1.7-fold, from the TSSs to the 3\u2032 ends (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). These results demonstrate the existence of a separate mechanism in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> to elevate the intrinsic rate of transcription from the X chromosomes of both sexes, so that after dosage compensation, X chromosomes and the two sets of autosomes have equivalent expression. Our experiments provide evidence that it, like dosage compensation, works at the level of controlling Pol II recruitment."

A major obstacle towards attaining this goal for <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> had been the lack of properly annotated transcription start sites for the majority of its genes. We therefore initiated our studies by developing a general and efficient strategy to map TSSs for Pol II-regulated genes with nucleotide resolution. This method, called GRO-cap, utilized purified nascent transcripts from the NRO reactions developed for GRO-seq and employed redundant enzymatic steps to capture RNAs with 5\u2032 caps. GRO-cap tracks RNAs prior to their co-transcriptional processing. This approach was critical for our analysis because co-transcriptional processing removes TSSs from the transcripts of most nematode genes, including protein-coding genes and small non-coding RNA genes."

We found 5\u2032 promoter-proximal pausing to be rare, unlike in other metazoans, and not likely to be the target of dosage compensation. Instead, dosage compensation reduces recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes, thereby decreasing transcription from the two X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to the level of transcription from the single X chromosome of males. A separate regulatory mechanism elevates the intrinsic level of transcription from X chromosomes of both sexes so that after dosage compensation total expression from X chromosomes and autosomes is equivalent."

Our current and prior (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jans et al., 2009</a>) studies showed that DCC binding to the promoter of a gene is neither necessary nor sufficient to elicit repression of the gene. Hence, the DCC influences gene expression over long distance, likely by imposing changes in higher-order chromosome structure. Clues to such a DCC function were suggested originally by the simultaneous discovery of the DCC and condensin\u2019s biochemical properties in vitro as an ATPase that alters DNA topology (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chuang et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kimura and Hirano, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hagstrom et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hirano, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Piazza et al., 2013</a>) and its canonical roles in vivo of compacting and resolving mitotic and meiotic chromosomes for proper chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hagstrom et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hirano, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Piazza et al., 2013</a>).

Condensin II in <i>Drosophila</i> induces axial compaction of interphase chromosomes, globally disrupts inter-chromosomal interactions, and promotes dispersal of peri-centric heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bauer et al., 2012</a>). These activities serve to compartmentalize the interphase nucleus into discrete chromosomal territories. Furthermore, nematodes carrying mutations that disrupt condensin I, which shares four subunits with the DCC, display elongated chromosomal axes during meiotic prophase and exhibit chromosome-wide changes in the distribution of double strand breaks and crossovers (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mets and Meyer, 2009</a>), providing strong evidence that DCC subunits control intra-chromosomal structure."

Compaction of interphase chromosomal territories could reduce the local concentration of bound transcription activators and hence bound Pol II. Changes in intra-chromosomal interactions could alter the relationships between distal regulatory regions and their target promoters, thereby limiting Pol II recruitment.

The complex contains two long non-coding RNAs and five proteins, including the H4K16 histone acetyltransferase MOF (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hilfiker et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Conrad et al., 2012a</a>) and the H2BK34 ubiquitin ligase MSL2 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wu et al., 2011</a>).

While a recent study analyzing genome-wide Pol II occupancy in males and females by ChIP-seq experiments suggested an alternative view that fly dosage compensation operates at the level of Pol II recruitment or initiation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Conrad et al., 2012b</a>), a mathematical computation error discovered in this study (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ferrari et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Straub and Becker, 2013</a>) rendered the results insufficient to distinguish between the competing models. The elongation model received recent further support from the discovery that dosage compensation is disrupted by impairing the function of SPT5, a transcription elongation factor that co-localizes with the MSL complex on male X chromosomes and interacts physically with the MSL complex (<a href=\"#bib55\">Prabhakaran and Kelley, 2012</a>).

Together, these results reinforce the evolutionary importance of balancing gene expression across all chromosomes of a genome."

This new analysis evaluated the original normalization strategy. Because expression of genes on the X chromosome is elevated in <i>sdc-2</i> mutants, it is difficult to determine whether the autosomes are changed in expression in the <i>sdc-2</i> mutant. The proportion of autosomal reads relative to total reads per experiment is lower in the <i>sdc-2</i> mutant (75.9%) than in the control RNAi (85.7%). To normalize the autosomal expression between the two conditions, we divided the average expression of all genes in the <i>sdc-2</i> mutant by the scaling factor of this difference (75.9%/84.715% = 0.885). We then investigated changes in the <i>sdc-2</i> mutant compared to the control for our most inclusive gene set: WB WS230 genes that are &gt;250 bp in length (see <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). With this alternative normalization, the median <i>sdc-2</i>/control gene expression ratios increase for both X (1.67 becomes 1.88) and autosomes (0.81 becomes 0.91). This procedure changed the proportion of X-linked genes that are more highly expressed in the mutant (genes increased in expression by 1.5-fold or greater) from 64.9% to 78.4%. The original normalization showed that fewer autosomal genes increase by 1.5-fold than decrease by 1.5-fold (5.2% compared to 26.7%, respectively), and the alternative normalization shows the same trend (8.4% compared to 16.5%). Therefore, the same conclusions about X and autosomal gene expression can be made with either normalization strategy."

We calculated TSSs in wild-type embryos, starved L1s, L3s, and <i>sdc-2</i> mutant embryos independently. To do this, we utilized both our GRO-cap and GRO-seq data with the assumption that a true TSS would be supported by a continuous GRO-seq signal extending upstream from the WB start to the newly annotated TSS. To correct for background noise in the TAP+ GRO-cap signal, we subtracted the TAP\u2212 control GRO-cap signal from the TAP+ GRO-cap signal. The Z-score was calculated at each position on a chromosome using the standard deviation and mean calculated for that individual chromosome, ignoring the top 0.005% of scores as outliers. Removing these outliers was required so that the locations with the strongest GRO-seq signal did not markedly affect the standard deviation and Z-score.

To identify a worm TATA-box, we searched for strand-specific motifs within a region 15\u201345 bp upstream of the TSS. To identify a worm Inr, we searched for strand-specific motifs within 10 bp of the TSS in either direction. These searches identified a TATA consensus of TATAWAWR, compared to TATAWAWR for yeast (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>), and an Inr consensus of YCAYTY, compared to YYANWYY in humans and TCAYTY in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</a>). To determine where these motifs lie, we calculated their distance from the TSS. For TATA, we calculated how far upstream the most 5\u2032 base lies. For the Inr, we calculated how far the adenine lies from the TSS. In other organisms the adenine has been shown to be the +1 nucleotide in transcription; the location of the worm Inr relative to the TSS suggests that this is true in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>."

We found strong overlap between the regions they called enhancers and our TSS calls. That gene was particularly complex for such a comparison because it appears by our analysis to have multiple, alternative TSSs. The interpretation of multiple TSSs rather than independent upstream transcription units has subsequently been supported by finding no evidence of 3\u2019 UTRs or polyA sites from the data of Jan et al.

Particularly informative are genes for which Chen et al. call a single upstream enhancer and we called a single strong TSS at exactly the same position as the enhancer. An example is in the new <a href=\"#fig1s12\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 12B</a>. It shows a gene with a single called TSS (2534 bp upstream of WB start) that corresponds with the single called enhancer. Continuous ChIP signal of hyper-phosphorylated Pol II was found between the TSS and the WB start, and no 3\u2019 UTRs or polyA signals were found. This and other similar examples strongly support the view that (1) some regions called enhancers by Chen et al. are actual TSSs and (2) GRO-cap signal paired with continuous GRO-seq signal from WB starts defines authentic TSSs. That said, many of the enhancers they mapped do not correspond to outron TSSs, and we are not dismissing the general enhancer mapping performed by Chen et al. A relevant example illustrating this point is in <a href=\"#fig1s12\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 12C</a>, which shows a strong TSS overlapping one of the two called enhancers. On balance, though, we do think the enhancer mapping of Chen et al. needs to be corrected in light of our TSS mapping. The revised text now reflects a more balanced assessment of the Chen et al. analysis as it relates to our TSS mapping based on the newly available data."

These results and the restricted run-on length of \u223c100 nucleotides that is typical of GRO-seq reactions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Core et al., 2008</a>) indicate that GRO-seq signal corresponds to bound Pol II in vivo and is not an artifact of the nuclear run-on reactions in vitro extending beyond the 3\u2019 ends defined in vivo<i>.</i> We now emphasize in the protocol (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) that GRO-seq run-ons have been tuned to only extend the length of nascent RNAs by 100 bases on average, thus minimizing the concern that independent transcription units have been artifactually linked."
