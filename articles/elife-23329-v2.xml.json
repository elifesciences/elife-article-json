Changes of white matter structure contribute to learning, and are often assumed to reflect an altered number of myelin wraps. We now show that, in rat optic nerve and cerebral cortical axons, the node of Ranvier length varies over a 4.4-fold and 8.7-fold range respectively and that variation of the node length is much less along axons than between axons. Modelling predicts that these node length differences will alter conduction speed by ~20%, similar to the changes produced by altering the number of myelin wraps or the internode length. For a given change of conduction speed, the membrane area change needed at the node is &gt;270-fold less than that needed in the myelin sheath. Thus, axon-specific adjustment of node of Ranvier length is potentially an energy-efficient and rapid mechanism for tuning the arrival time of information in the CNS."

Changes of white matter structure contribute to learning, and are often assumed to reflect an altered number of myelin wraps. We now show that, in rat optic nerve and cerebral cortical axons, the node of Ranvier length varies over a 4.4-fold and 8.7-fold range respectively and that variation of the node length is much less along axons than between axons. Modelling predicts that these node length differences will alter conduction speed by ~20%, similar to the changes produced by altering the number of myelin wraps or the internode length. For a given change of conduction speed, the membrane area change needed at the node is &gt;270-fold less than that needed in the myelin sheath. Thus, axon-specific adjustment of node of Ranvier length is potentially an energy-efficient and rapid mechanism for tuning the arrival time of information in the CNS."

Increasing the length of the node will increase the node capacitance and the axial resistance for current flow into the internode, which will both decrease conduction speed. On the other hand, a greater length could increase the number of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels at the node (if the channel density is constant), which may increase conduction speed. Given the potential influence of node length on conduction speed, we quantified heterogeneity of the length of the node of Ranvier in the white matter of the rat optic nerve and corpus callosum, and in the grey matter of rat cerebral cortex. Computer modelling was then used to explore the effects on conduction speed of the range of node lengths observed."

In addition, given that oligodendrogenesis and myelination continues well into adulthood (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dimou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Young et al., 2013</a>), confocal microscopy of antibody-labelled nodes allowed us to distinguish developing nodes from mature nodes, ensuring that any differences in size observed were not due to different developmental stages. Mature nodes of Ranvier were identified from their Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 staining (a marker of mature nodes: <a href=\"#bib6\">Boiko et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kaplan et al., 2001</a>) flanked by Caspr-labelled paranodes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and node length was measured from the Caspr intensity profile across the node (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, see Materials and methods). We first assessed whether, using confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), we could observe variability of node lengths in the rat optic nerve similar to that found when using EM. We again found node length variability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E,F,H</a>), the mean node length was not significantly different (p=0.06) from that obtained with EM (1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 \u03bcm, standard deviation 0.29 \u00b5m, n\u00a0=\u00a0164, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and there was again no significant dependence on either node diameter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, p=0.14) or axon diameter at the paranode (measured as the diameter of the Caspr labelling: p=0.89). However, the node length range was slightly broader, covering a 4.4-fold range (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,H</a>), perhaps due to the\u00a0~4 fold greater number of nodes quantified."

We found that there is a linear correlation between summed Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 staining and node length (p=1.2\u00d710<sup>\u221215</sup>) indicating that the number of sodium channels at nodes is approximately proportional to node length (cf. <a href=\"#bib32\">Rios et al., 2003</a>), consistent with larger nodes being generated by the insertion of more Na<sub>V</sub>-containing membrane. However, at any given sodium channel labelling intensity there was still a large variation in node lengths, suggesting that sodium channel density is not absolutely constant, and that it may be possible to vary node length in a manner independent of sodium channel number."

This was taken up into axons and diffused along them, allowing us to measure the lengths of up to 13 successive nodes (mean 6.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 nodes in 18 axons) along single fluorescently labelled axons in the corpus callosum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

This occurs for two reasons: the increase in node length increases the nodal capacitance (so each node takes longer to charge), and the intracellular axial resistance to current flow from the node into the internode is increased. The changes in conduction speed for the optic nerve are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> (the range of measured node lengths is shown for comparison). Increasing the node length from its mean value of 1.02 \u00b5m to the largest value observed (2.2 \u00b5m) is predicted to decrease the conduction speed by 6.5%, while decreasing the node length to the smallest value measured (0.5 \u00b5m) increases the speed by 3.2% (giving a speed that is 10.3% larger than at a length of 2.2 \u00b5m). For cortical axons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) the predicted changes are larger, partly because, with a 1.5-fold longer node and a 1.7-fold shorter internode length, the nodal membrane contributes a larger fraction of the total membrane capacitance (14% in cortical axons versus 8% in optic nerve axons). The node length variation observed in rat cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013H</a> and 0.43 \u00b5m to 3.7 \u00b5m) results in conduction speeds that are 11.6% slower (for the longest node) and 7% faster (for the shortest node) than the speed for the mean node length of 1.5 \u00b5m.

Consequently, the plot of speed against node length shows a maximum (solid curves in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>: note that, above this maximum, increasing node length decreases speed for the reasons stated above, despite the increase in number of sodium channels at the node). Decreasing the optic nerve node length from its mean value of 1.02 \u00b5m to the lowest length observed (0.5 \u00b5m) is predicted to decrease conduction speed by 14.1%, while increasing node length to the value generating the maximum conduction speed (1.7 \u00b5m) increases the speed by 3.3% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), to a value that is 20.2% higher than at a length of 0.5 \u00b5m.

For example, for a mean node length of 1.0 \u00b5m, alternate nodes had lengths of 0.75 \u00b5m and 1.25 \u00b5m. When the number of channels was held constant at each node, the approximately linear relationship between conduction velocity and node length (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) resulted in a slightly faster propagation through shorter nodes and a slightly slower propagation through longer nodes, the effects of which cancel out with no overall effect on conduction velocity. When the nodal ion channel density was kept constant, the concave-downwards dependence of speed on node length in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a> resulted in marginally slower conduction speeds (&lt;2% reduced) with variable length nodes, compared to when all the nodes along a particular axon had exactly the same length."

We measured internode lengths in dye-filled axons in rat layer V cortex by measuring the distance between Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 positive nodes. Similar to previous studies we found a large variability in the length of 30 internodes, the shortest being 27 \u00b5m and the largest 154 \u00b5m, with a mean value of 82.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3 \u00b5m. Given this large variation, we examined how internode length (assumed, for simplicity, to be the same for all internodes along an axon) affects the tuning of conduction speed by changes of node length (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>). For cortical axons (with a constant nodal sodium channel density), the peak of the dependence of conduction speed on node length is displaced to longer node lengths when the internode length is increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and in an axon with internode lengths of 154 \u00b5m the range of node lengths measured could generate changes in conduction speed of up to 42%. When the number of channels was held constant at each node, the dependence of conduction speed on node length was greater in axons with short internodes (27 \u00b5m), resulting in changes in conduction speed of up to 38% over the range of measured node lengths (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Changes of node length also affect the predicted dependence of conduction speed on internode length (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). This relationship rises with internode length at low values of internode length, because more of the axon is myelinated, but decreases at large internode lengths as the spread of depolarization between nodes becomes less efficient. This relationship shows a sharper peak for shorter node lengths (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>)."

With the node length and internode length set at the mean values observed and the nodal conductances constant, if the number of wraps of myelin is decreased by 1 (from the normal 7 to 6 for the optic nerve and from the normal 5 to 4 for the cortex), the conduction speed is predicted to decrease by 8.6% for the optic nerve and 10.5% for the cortex (for simplicity no change of paranode length was assumed for these simulations, although the paranode may be shorter with less myelin wraps). For comparison, a similar speed decrease is predicted (with no change of wrap number) if the nodal Na<sub>V</sub> density is reduced by 26% in the optic nerve or 34% in the cortex, or if the internode length is increased by 36% in the optic nerve or 74% in the cortex. These same speed decreases can be achieved with no change of myelin wrapping or ion channel density by decreasing the node length from 1.02 \u00b5m to 0.625 \u00b5m in the optic nerve, or decreasing it from 1.5 \u00b5m to 0.635 \u00b5m in cortical axons. (Whether the internode needs to be lengthened by the same amount, to maintain axon length, and the consequences of this, are considered in the Simulations section of the Materials and methods). Strikingly, to produce these speed changes, the change of membrane area needed (shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) when altering node length is 1006-fold less in the optic nerve, and 273-fold less in the cortex, than that needed when altering the myelin sheath. Thus, tuning conduction speed by altering node length is far more efficient than altering myelination when considering the amount of lipid and protein synthesis or breakdown needed, and would probably also be faster."

Even at constant axon diameter, we found that node length displayed a surprising variability, both in the optic nerve and in the grey matter of the cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Remarkably, this node length variation was largely between different axons, while the nodes on any given axon tended to have similar lengths (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The range of node lengths observed is sufficient to produce large variations in action potential conduction speed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), comparable to those produced by adding or removing a wrap of myelin. These data suggest that axons may be able to adjust their node lengths in order to tune their conduction speed, and thus the arrival time of the information that they transmit."

The node length was approximately proportional to the amount of sodium channel labelling at the node (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), suggesting that node length may mainly be adjusted by the insertion or removal of membrane containing sodium channels (although conceivably it is possible to vary node length in a manner independent of sodium channel trafficking by endo- or exocytosis of vesicles lacking sodium channels in their membrane)."

First, when the node length is set to a different mean value in different axons, by what mechanism is the nodal ion channel density controlled (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)? Second, what signal regulates node length, in order to adjust the arrival time of action potentials at the end of the axon? Conceivably a signal could be passed back along the axon from a postsynaptic cell by dynein-based motors, as occurs for BMP signalling from postsynaptic cells to the nuclei of presynaptic neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2012</a>). Third, what local molecular mechanism regulates the length of each node, how accurately can this be controlled, and is the internode length shortened when the node is elongated (to preserve overall axon length)? Node length regulation may involve modifying the paranodal cell adhesion between the myelin and the axon, mediated by the molecules Caspr, neurofascin 155 and contactin, as well as altering ankyrin G mediated scaffolding within the axon that locates voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels at the node (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell, 2014</a>). Interestingly, nodal amyloid precursor protein has been proposed as a regulator of node length (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2014</a>), prompting the speculation that changes in the processing of this molecule could alter node length in Alzheimer\u2019s disease."

For an intercortical callosal axon of length 1 cm (in rat) or 6 cm (in human), with the properties that we assume for our simulations, a 20% decrease of axon conduction speed (from the value occurring for the mean observed node length) would increase the time needed to propagate information between the cortices from 3.8 to 4.8 ms in rat and from 23 to 29 ms in humans. Such modulation has been suggested to occur during chronic stress and major depression (<a href=\"#bib27\">Miyata et al., 2016</a>) which shorten the node, as well as high frequency action potential activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Huff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Trigo and Smith, 2015</a>), acoustic over-exposure (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tagoe et al., 2014</a>), pathological release of glutamate (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fu et al., 2009</a>) and hypoxic conditions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Reimer et al., 2011</a>), all of which lengthen the node. Altering node length offers the advantage that very small changes of membrane area, which could easily be produced rapidly by exocytosis or endocytosis at the node, produce large changes of conduction speed. In comparison, to produce the same speed changes by altering the number of myelin wraps requires the energetically expensive (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harris and Attwell, 2012</a>), and probably more time consuming, synthesis or disassembly of a membrane area that is 273\u20131006 fold larger.

Images were background subtracted and only nodes that lay approximately parallel to the plane of section (i.e. displayed nodal Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 labelling with flanking Caspr-labelled paranodes all within a single 0.8 \u00b5m optical slice) were selected. Measuring the angle of the axon to the plane of the slice for a subset of 10 randomly chosen axons showed that the apparent node length measured in this way underestimated the actual node length by only 1.7% \u00b1 0.6%. A maximum intensity projection was generated of the sections in which Caspr labelling was present for a particular node (up to five interleaved confocal slices at 0.38 \u00b5m intervals, with a maximum stack thickness of 2.32 \u00b5m), and a line intensity profile (the thickness of which was slightly less than the Caspr labelling thickness) was drawn spanning both Caspr-labelled paranodes. The size of the node was then calculated using a MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) script which measures the distance between the half maximum intensity for each paranode. Node diameter, paranode length and axon diameter were measured using the line tool in ImageJ over Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 staining (for node diameter) and over the Caspr staining (for axon diameter and paranode length). Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 staining was summed over the nodal area to obtain a parameter assumed to be proportional to sodium channel number. Internode length was measured in three dimensions in FIJI using the simple neurite tracer plugin (<a href=\"#bib23\">Longair et al., 2011</a>).

(2011)</a> except that the periaxonal space under the myelin was included (51 nodes were simulated and conduction speed was measured between nodes 20 and 30). This model includes fast and persistent Na<sup>+</sup>, and slow K<sup>+</sup>, voltage-gated channels at the node, but omits voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels at the juxtaparanode (which are little activated because the 100 mV voltage change of the action potential is distributed across the 11\u201315 membranes of the 5\u20137 myelin wraps and the axon, implying only a 7\u20139 mV voltage change across the axonal membrane). For simplicity, the node length was usually assumed to be the same at all nodes on the axon, i.e. we ignored the variability in node length along the same axon described in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. The node diameter was set to the mean value measured experimentally, i.e. 0.73 \u00b5m (in 164 nodes) for the optic nerve, and 0.64 \u00b5m (in 158 nodes) for cortex. The region between two nodes, 139.3 \u00b5m long for the optic nerve (<a href=\"#bib7\">Butt et al., 1994</a>) and 81.7 \u00b5m long for the cortical axons (the mean value measured in layer V from 30 internodes, see main text), was kept constant when node length was varied (both for simplicity, and because there was no correlation of node length and internode length: <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This internodal region was divided (along its length) into 66 and 86 compartments for the optic nerve and the cortex, respectively, the end 2.11 and 1.90 \u00b5m parts of which represent the paranode where the myelin attaches to the axon (values measured in 164 and 158 nodes, respectively, from the length of the Caspr labelling; the number of compartments used has to be large for the simulation to be accurate, and needs to be chosen so that an integral number of compartments can represent the paranodal junction; the number was adjusted appropriately when simulating different internode lengths). The internodal axon diameter is larger than the diameter at the node (<a href=\"#bib16\">Halter and Clark, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berthold and Rydmark, 1983</a>), although this difference is a much smaller percentage for small than for large axons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rydmark and Berthold, 1983</a>). The internodal and paranodal axon diameters were set to 0.82 \u00b5m and 0.73 \u00b5m for the optic nerve and cortex, respectively (mean values obtained from 164 axons in optic nerve and 158 cortical axons from the diameter of the paranodal Caspr labelling), so that the node diameters were 88% and 86% of the internodal axon diameters respectively. Apart from at the paranodes, the internodal axon was assumed to be surrounded by a periaxonal space of thickness 15 nm (<a href=\"#bib33\">Robertson, 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mierzwa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">M\u00f6bius et al., 2016</a>), and to have a g ratio (axon diameter/myelin diameter) of 0.79 in the optic nerve and 0.8 in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sugimoto et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Oorschot et al., 2013</a>; to obtain an integral number of myelin wraps these values were adjusted slightly, to 0.78 and 0.81 respectively). This led to the optic nerve and cortical axons having 7 and 5 myelin wraps, respectively assuming a myelin wrap periodicity of 15.6 nm (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agrawal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Harris and Attwell, 2012</a>). The periaxonal space at the paranode, because of the structure of the attachment of the myelin to the axon at the paranode, is thought to comprise (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mierzwa et al., 2010</a>) a pathway of cross sectional area A\u00a0=\u00a0170 nm<sup>2</sup>, which spirals around the axon (from the node to the periaxonal space of the internode) for a total distance of approximately D = \u03c0.d.N<sub>wraps</sub> where N<sub>wraps</sub> is the number of myelin wraps and d is the axon diameter. A periaxonal space of width w, along a paranode of length L, would have the same resistance as this pathway if"

                                "text": "In the main text we present calculations showing that a given change of conduction speed can be produced far more efficiently (in terms of the change of membrane area needed) by shortening of the node than by adding another wrap of myelin. Those calculations ignore the possibility that, when the node is shortened, the internode needs to be lengthened by the same amount in order to maintain the axon length. It is unclear whether the sub-micron node length changes postulated in our calculation would actually require remodelling of the adjacent myelin sheath \u2013 conceivably slackness in the somewhat non-straight internode would allow the change of node length to be accommodated without a change of internode length, and furthermore node length might change by an eversion of the paranodal loops closest to the node without any other significant change to the myelin sheath (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib2\">Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell, 2014</a>). Thus, small changes in nodal length might well occur without major remodelling of the myelin sheath. Nevertheless, if one assumes that node shortening by X \u00b5m absolutely does require an X \u00b5m elongation of the myelin sheath, then more membrane changes are needed than are accounted for in our simple calculation. One can show mathematically that the sheath membrane area increase is larger than the area decrease at the node by a factor of 2x(number of myelin wraps)x(mean radius of wraps)/(node radius), which is roughly 18.4 for the optic nerve and 13 for the cortex. Accounting for these area changes (and noting that, in this situation, there is no change of total axon length) would reduce the ratio of the membrane area changes needed to produce a given speed change (when adding a layer of myelin to the sheath versus changing the node length) from 1006-fold to 55-fold for the optic nerve and from 273-fold to 21-fold for the cortex, but these ratios remain impressively large, and so the energetic argument favouring speed tuning by alteration of the node length still holds."

The extent and character of myelin is regulated by neuronal activity during development, and there has is renewed interest in the possibility that myelination may be modified throughout life. The effects of altered myelination could be exerted at many levels \u2013 myelinated versus unmyelinated, thickness of myelin, length of internodes, and length of nodes, not to mention changes in NaV and Kv densities along axons. However, little is known about the variations in these parameters in the adult CNS. Defining these variations, exploring how they are affected by life experience and determining their effects on information processing are important goals. Here the authors show that there is greater variation in node length along myelinated axons in brain than in optic nerve, and through modeling show that this variation in brain would be expected to have substantial effects on conduction velocity."

Numerous recent studies have indicated that myelin in the central nervous system can be generated and modulated well in to adult life. The manuscript by Arancibia-Carcamo et al., serves as a timely reminder that modulation of myelin is not the only way in which the functional output of myelinated axons can be modulated and fine-tuned. The study is primarily a modeling based study built on the observations that nodes of Ranvier vary in length (independently of axon/ node diameter) in both the optic nerve, and to a greater extent, the cerebral cortex. The main predictions of the model are that relatively subtle changes in node of Ranvier length can profoundly affect conduction speed, and that such nodal changes are likely very energy efficient compared to the changes in myelin thickness that would be required to elicit similar effects on speed. This core conclusion/prediction is certainly provocative and interesting, and provides a simple hypothesis that will require experimental investigation in future experiments out-with the scope of this manuscript. However, the manuscript itself needs significantly more detail in parts before it is ready for publication, and could some additional considerations could be integrated into the model to provide more depth. The study is, in my opinion, of sufficient general interest to the readership of <i>eLife</i>."

If, for example, an average myelin sheath length in the cortex is say 29um+ 1um for the node and the axon is 3mm long then there would be 100 myelin sheaths along its length. If a 1um node were to increase in length to 3um then 200um of space along the axon would be required to accommodate the longer nodes. This would still require significant remodelling of myelin along the axon, either through small changes in many sheaths or the removal of a small number of sheaths and subsequent readjustment."

Little correlation is seen between nodal length and width, which is taken as evidence that nodal length can be regulated at an axon-specific level independently of axonal diameter. Computer modeling predicts that the range of nodal lengths observed will have a biologically significant effect on conduction (in the order of ~20-38%). The authors therefore propose that regulation of nodal length is a viable method for fine-tuning conduction velocity. They make a compelling case for it being a less energy/resource demanding form of plasticity than others currently under investigation (e.g., myelin thickness, de novo myelination). The paper is thought-provoking and of sufficient interest for the readership of e<i>Life</i>."

Nevertheless, I feel that the language of the manuscript sometimes goes beyond what is demonstrated (e.g., \"Thus, axon-specific adjustment of node of Ranvier length is an energy-efficient and potentially rapid mechanism for tuning the arrival time of information in the CNS\"). It is not shown that nodal length is modified during plasticity, or even that it varies between relevant axons in naturally occurring systems where adaptations need to be made to ensure synchrony (such as in auditory brainstem circuits, where the authors have previously studied internode length and axonal diameter). In the absence of such data, it should be made very clear in the Abstract that this paper identifies regulation of nodal length as a potential mechanism for neuroplasticity only. Indeed, the authors must make sure that also the superficial reader will not confuse fact and fiction. \"Fact\" and well documented is the observation that nodes are more similar in size along an individual axon than the nodes of different but otherwise comparable axons. Still \"fiction\" is the idea that nodes can change in size (with predictable consequences on axonal conduction velocity) as a physiological mechanism, by which neurons adapt axonal conduction to the demands of a larger neuronal network. For comparison, had the authors been the first to discover that axons differ in caliber \u2013 which of course is well known \u2013 we could have the same discussion. In fact, it might be easier for neurons to fine-tune their axonal calibers (e.g. by Akt/mTOR signaling) than to remodel nodal domains individually in a concerted effort with oligodendrocytes. Thus, there was consensus of all reviewers that the language needs to make much clearer (also in title and Abstract) that the main conclusions that make the paper so interesting are hypothetical/ theoretical."

Thus, small changes in nodal length might well occur without major remodelling of the myelin sheath."

One can show mathematically that the sheath membrane area increase is larger than the area decrease at the node by a factor of 2x(number of myelin wraps)x(mean radius of wraps)/(node radius), which is roughly 18.4 for the optic nerve and 13 for the cortex. Accounting for these area changes (and noting that, in this situation, there is no change of total axon length) would reduce the ratio of the membrane area changes needed to produce a given speed change (when adding a layer of myelin to the sheath versus changing the node length) from 1006-fold to 55-fold for the optic nerve and from 273-fold to 21-fold for the cortex, but these ratios remain impressively large, and so the energetic argument favouring speed tuning by alteration of the node length still holds. We have now discussed all this in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cSimulations\u201d, and flagged that discussion in the first paragraph of the Discussion section."

Nevertheless, I feel that the language of the manuscript sometimes goes beyond what is demonstrated (e.g., \"Thus, axon-specific adjustment of node of Ranvier length is an energy-efficient and potentially rapid mechanism for tuning the arrival time of information in the CNS\"). It is not shown that nodal length is modified during plasticity, or even that it varies between relevant axons in naturally occurring systems where adaptations need to be made to ensure synchrony (such as in auditory brainstem circuits, where the authors have previously studied internode length and axonal diameter). In the absence of such data, it should be made very clear in the Abstract that this paper identifies regulation of nodal length as a potential mechanism for neuroplasticity only. Indeed, the authors must make sure that also the superficial reader will not confuse fact and fiction. \"Fact\" and well documented is the observation that nodes are more similar in size along an individual axon than the nodes of different but otherwise comparable axons. Still \"fiction\" is the idea that nodes can change in size (with predictable consequences on axonal conduction velocity) as a physiological mechanism, by which neurons adapt axonal conduction to the demands of a larger neuronal network. For comparison, had the authors been the first to discover that axons differ in caliber \u2013 which of course is well known \u2013 we could have the same discussion. In fact, it might be easier for neurons to fine-tune their axonal calibers (e.g. by Akt/mTOR signaling) than to remodel nodal domains individually in a concerted effort with oligodendrocytes. Thus, there was consensus of all reviewers that the language needs to make much clearer (also in title and Abstract) that the main conclusions that make the paper so interesting are hypothetical/ theoretical.</i> "

Perhaps the authors can simply address this comment without further information, but the presentation and annotation/ explanation of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> is difficult to interpret. If the removal of the two axons with the larger nodes removes the differences between versus within axons then it would be reassuring to see a slightly larger number of axons such that one didn't worry about any outlier or sampling artifacts. How representative are the 3 axons shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>?

The 3 axons shown were chosen to illustrate different mean node lengths. As the reviewer points out, the majority of axons had nodes that fell within the 0.5-2 \u00b5m range, which is consistent with the distribution of node lengths shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. We found 2 axons in which the nodes were of longer lengths (2-3.5 \u00b5m), which is at the frequency expected from the probability distribution in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> where ~10% of nodes fall into this bracket. Thus, these 2 axons are not necessarily \u201coutliers\u201d or developing nodes (see below) but just what would be expected from the variation in node length across axons reported here. Nonetheless, following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have calculated the coefficient of variation excluding these 2 axons. We find that, even with these two axons excluded, the mean coefficient of variation for the node length along single axons is 38.8 \u00b1 4.7% lower than that across all axons (highly significantly different, with a p value of 6.6x10<sup>-7</sup>) which strongly reinforces our original conclusion that node length variability is far greater across axons than within axons. This has now been reported in the Results section (subsection \u201cNode lengths vary far more between axons than along axons\u201d, first paragraph)."
