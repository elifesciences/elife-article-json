The evolutionary conserved AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are well-known metabolic master regulators in the low-energy response in animals, yeast and plants. They act at two different levels: by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes, and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. While the first part is well established, the latter function is only partially understood in animals and not at all in plants. Here we identified the <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcription factor bZIP63 as key regulator of the starvation response and direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changed its dimerization preference, thereby affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A <i>bzip63</i> knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites."

The evolutionary conserved AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are well-known metabolic master regulators in the low-energy response in animals, yeast and plants. They act at two different levels: by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes, and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. While the first part is well established, the latter function is only partially understood in animals and not at all in plants. Here we identified the <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcription factor bZIP63 as key regulator of the starvation response and direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changed its dimerization preference, thereby affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A <i>bzip63</i> knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites."

In plants, an enzyme called SnRK1 plays a crucial role in responses to starvation in two ways: by altering the activities of enzymes involved in metabolism and by regulating the expression of genes. To perform the second job, SnRK1 is thought to control the activity of proteins called transcription factors\u2014which alter the expression of genes by binding to DNA\u2014but it is not known which ones."

Particularly under stress, available energy resources need to be balanced between defense and growth. The SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) in plants and its orthologs, the sucrose-non-fermenting 1 (Snf1) kinase in yeast and the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in mammals, are well-known and crucial master regulators of energy homeostasis. SnRK1 is involved in the regulation of plant metabolism, development, and stress response (<a href=\"#bib41\">Polge and Thomas, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez and Sheen, 2008</a>), Snf1 is required for the switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism in the absence of glucose (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hedbacker and Carlson, 2008</a>), and AMPK regulates glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and feeding behavior in animals (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hardie et al., 2012</a>). They are generally activated under energy starvation conditions and trigger metabolic reprograming to slow down energy-consuming processes and turn on pathways for alternative energy production in order to survive the stress conditions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hardie, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tome et al., 2014</a>). This happens, in two ways: by direct phosphorylation and modulation of the activity of key enzymes in nitrogen, carbon, or fatty acid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sugden et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kulma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Harthill et al., 2006</a>), and by massive transcriptional reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib41\">Polge and Thomas, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez and Sheen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">McGee and Hargreaves, 2008</a>). Especially in plants, the latter aspect, the regulation of transcription, is still poorly understood. In <i>Arabidopsis</i> protoplasts, transient overexpression of AKIN10, a catalytic subunit of the SnRK1 complex, resulted in a transcriptional profile reminiscent of various starvation conditions and led to the identification of 1021 putative SnRK1 target genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007</a>). However, the transcription factors mediating the transcriptional response of SnRK1 to energy starvation are still unknown. Based on reporter gene activation assays in protoplasts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007</a>) and modelling of microarray data (<a href=\"#bib57\">Usadel et al., 2008</a>), some members of the C/S1 group of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs)\u2014foremost bZIP11 and bZIP1 from the S1 group\u2014were speculated to be involved in this process. Yet, a direct regulation of these bZIPs by SnRK1 has never been shown."

                        "text": "bZIP proteins form a large and highly conserved group of eukaryotic TFs. They bind the DNA as dimers and are characterized by a basic region for specific DNA binding and a leucine zipper for dimerization (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deppmann et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Reinke et al., 2013</a>). They are involved in a multitude of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, stress response, and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jakoby et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Motohashi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rodrigues-Pousada et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tsukada et al., 2011</a>). The diversity and flexibility of transcriptional regulation by bZIP TFs can at least partially be attributed to their potential to form variable dimer combinations, which bind to different consensus target sites (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deppmann et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tsukada et al., 2011</a>). While the leucine zipper determines the possible dimer combinations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deppmann et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Reinke et al., 2013</a>), the actual in vivo dimer composition is further influenced by factors such as protein availability, binding of regulatory proteins, or post-translational modifications (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schuetze et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Since the initial discovery that the mammalian bZIP cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, many bZIP TFs were reported to be phosphorylated (<a href=\"#bib19\">Holmberg et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schuetze et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tsukada et al., 2011</a>). However, particularly in plants, the functional consequences of these phosphorylation events often remained unclear. For example, it has been known for several years that abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent phosphorylation of some ABA-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs) by SnRK2 kinases increases their transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Furihata et al., 2006</a>), yet the underlying mechanism of this activation is still unknown. It is also surprising that, while many examples for phosphorylation-dependent regulation of bZIP activity, DNA-binding, subcellular localization, stability, and interaction with regulatory proteins are known (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schuetze et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tsukada et al., 2011</a>), reports on the regulation of dimerization are scarce. So far, only three publications (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2010</a>) showed compelling evidence for phosphorylation-dependent changes in bZIP dimerization in animals. Still, even in these cases it is often not entirely clear whether bZIP phosphorylation affects dimerization directly or indirectly by enhancing DNA binding."

Its transcriptional profile indicates that bZIP63 could be involved in the (energy) starvation response, as transcription and mRNA stability are repressed by sugars and ABA and mRNA levels increase in the night and even more during extended night treatments (<a href=\"#bib33\">Matiolli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kunz et al., 2014</a>). A small set of potential target genes for bZIP63 has been identified, including genes involved in amino acid metabolism (<i>ASN1</i>/<i>DIN6</i> = ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 1, <i>ProDH</i> = PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE), energy starvation response (<i>DIN10</i> = RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE 6), and senescence (<i>SEN1</i> = SENESCENCE 1) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Matiolli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Veerabagu et al., 2014</a>).

Three of its dimerization partners from the S1-group\u2014bZIP1, bZIP11, and bZIP53\u2014were shown to be important metabolic regulators, especially under energy starvation conditions, and to regulate the expression of <i>ASN1</i> and <i>ProDH</i> as well (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, bZIP1 was recently confirmed as a transcriptional master regulator of the rapid response to nutrient signals controlling mainly genes involved in amino acid metabolism and cell death/phosphorus metabolism as primary targets (<a href=\"#bib40\">Para et al., 2014</a>). In that study the authors also speculate about a posttranslational modification of bZIP1 or its binding partners."

Moreover, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in planta and propose a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming."

Prolonged darkness was shown to induce increased chlorophyll loss in plants overexpressing bZIP1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we incubated a bZIP63 knock-out (ko), two independent overexpressor (ox) lines (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and their respective wild types (wt) in the dark and determined the percentage of the green leaf area as a measure for chlorophyll content (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This method was preferred over direct chlorophyll measurements (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) as it is not affected by the water loss in senescing leaves. While no differences were observed before dark treatment, significant differences were visible after 9 days in darkness (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>). Similar to the bZIP1 ox, the bZIP63 ox lines (ox#2 and ox#3) had a significantly higher percentage of yellow leaf area than the wt. In contrast, <i>bzip63</i> plants displayed a stay-green phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). RT-qPCRs of different senescence marker genes confirmed that the phenotype is due to dark-induced and not to natural senescence (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Transcriptional responses in dark-induced senescence show clear similarities to starvation-induced senescence in cell suspension culture, which likely results from carbon depletion in both systems (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005</a>). We therefore tested whether addition of sugar could rescue this phenotype by performing the dark-induced senescence experiment with seedlings grown on agar plates with and without addition of sugar. Indeed, we found that the phenotype could be rescued by the addition of glucose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a> <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), supporting the suggested role of bZIP63 in energy/carbon starvation response."

Leaves of 5 week-old plants were harvested after 6 hr of light and extended night and analyzed for changes in the primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>).

Comparison of protein extracts from seedling cultures after 6 hr extended night in the presence or absence of sucrose or leaves harvested after 6 hr of light or extended night revealed strong differences in the phosphorylation patterns of bZIP63 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Compared to the recombinantly expressed (not phosphorylated) bZIP63-YFP, the majority of plant-expressed bZIP63-GFP appeared in several slower migrating forms, thus indicating multiple and differentially phosphorylated forms. In total, we were able to distinguish eight different forms on the Phos-tag gels, depending on the conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, it is important to note, that not every phosphorylation event results in an equal shift. In the light, two strong bands were visible, possibly reflecting the two spots on the 2D gel (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, labelled as band 6 and band 7, respectively). Under extended night conditions, an additional band appeared (labelled as band 8), indicating increased phosphorylation of bZIP63. Notably, the ratio of the most phosphorylated form of bZIP63 (band 8) to the two less phosphorylated forms (band 6 and 7) was different between the ox (ox#3) and a genomic complementation line of <i>bzip63</i> (GY11, detailed description follows later). In the genomic complementation line, the most phosphorylated form of bZIP63 was the strongest band under extended night conditions, which might be a result of the different bZIP63 amounts in relation to the endogenous kinase(s), and likely better reflects the phosphorylation state of the endogenous protein. Interestingly, in seedlings grown in liquid culture, the extended night-triggered phosphorylation of bZIP63 could be abolished by the addition of 1% of sucrose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In fact, phosphorylation was even lower here than in the light. These data indicate that bZIP63 has a basal level of phosphorylation in the plant and undergoes hyper-phosphorylation under starvation conditions. In contrast, addition of external sugars leads to a reduced phosphorylation status of bZIP63."

To achieve maximum sequence coverage of the protein we combined proteolytic digests from four proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, LysC, and subtilisin). This approach resulted in a total sequence coverage of 93.6% and the identification of several phospho-peptides, indicating that bZIP63 is phosphorylated at up to seven serines (S29, S59, S102, S160, S261, S294, and S300) in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Two of these sites\u2014S29 and S300\u2014were also found in a recent phospho-proteomics study (<a href=\"#bib56\">Umezawa et al., 2013</a>).

Root material was chosen because in leaf extracts the large amount of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) interfered with some of the kinase signals and poses a considerable problem during MS-based protein identification. Three strong bands of about 40, 50, and 55 kDa, respectively, were visible on the autoradiogram (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), indicating that at least three kinases can phosphorylate bZIP63 in vitro. These bands were not visible on a gel without substrate, excluding the possibility that they originate from kinase auto-phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To reduce the sample complexity and to enrich low abundant bZIP63-binding proteins before kinase identification, we affinity purified plant protein extracts on immobilized bZIP63. The eluted fractions were tested in an in-gel kinase assay for kinase activity towards bZIP63 and loaded on a normal SDS-PAGE gel without substrate for kinase identification. Bands corresponding in molecular weight (MW) to the signal from the in-gel kinase assay were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). In total, 27 protein kinases and kinase complex subunits were identified in four independent experiments (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). From those, proteins which did not match the expected MW or for which it had been shown experimentally that they are not localized in the nucleus were excluded. Only proteins which were identified in more than one sample with at least one proteotypic peptide were considered to be high confidence candidates, resulting in six protein kinases and two kinase regulatory subunits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). We identified the two main catalytic subunits of SnRK1, AKIN10 and AKIN11, as well as the regulatory subunit SNF4. Several members of the calcium dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family were found, but only CPK3 was identified with high confidence. In addition, two catalytic (CKA1 and CKA2) and one regulatory subunit (CKB1) of casein kinase II (CKII) were found, as well as Casein kinase 1-like protein 2 (CKL2). The SnRK1 kinases, CDPKs, and CKL2, correspond in MW to the two upper bands, while the lower band corresponds to the CKII kinase subunits. As SnRK1 was previously reported to enhance the activity of several C/S1 group bZIPs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007</a>) and was suggested to be activated under energy starvation conditions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez and Sheen, 2008</a>)\u2014which could explain the observed hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63 in extended night\u2014we focused our further analysis on AKIN10 and AKIN11."

                                "text": "To confirm that AKIN10 and AKIN11 phosphorylate bZIP63, we first performed an in-gel kinase assay with protein extracts of wt and <i>akin10</i> seedlings in the presence of EGTA, to reduce the signal from CDPKs of the same MW (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In both root and leaf extracts of <i>akin10</i> plants one band at the expected MW of AKIN10 nearly disappeared (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a> for characterization of the <i>akin10</i> line). As AKIN11 has approximately the same MW as AKIN10, the remaining signal likely originates from AKIN11. In vitro kinase assays, with equal amounts of both kinases, showed that both kinases can phosphorylate bZIP63. However, AKIN10 phosphorylates bZIP63 much stronger than AKIN11 does (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Addition of the SnRK1 upstream kinase SnAK2 increased the activity of AKIN10 and AKIN11 about sevenfold (see also <a href=\"#bib7\">Crozet et al., 2010</a>), but had no effect on the ratio between the signal intensities (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In vivo interaction assays with the identified SnRK1 complex subunits supported the findings of the kinase assays. In both yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) AKIN10 and the regulatory subunit SNF4 interacted strongly with bZIP63, to a comparable level as measured for the bZIP63 homo-dimer, which was used as positive control (<a href=\"#bib61\">Walter et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, AKIN11 and the two regulatory subunits AKIN\u03b21 and AKIN\u03b22 showed almost no interaction with bZIP63 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). However, it has to be considered that AKIN10 and AKIN11 are part of a trimeric complex including SNF4 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Emanuelle et al., 2015</a>), which is neglected in these two assays. It is therefore still possible that AKIN11 interacts indirectly with bZIP63 via the regulatory subunit of the SnRK1 complex and plays a minor role in bZIP63 phosphorylation in the plant."

As SnRK1 has been suggested to act as a major regulator in the energy deprivation response, we again compared leaf protein extracts after 6 hr light and extended night and found that the hyper-phosphorylated form (band 8) of bZIP63, observed in the wt in extended night, was much weaker in the <i>akin10</i> background (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The same effect was observed in seedling cultures after 6 hr of extended night (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). To see whether the weak phosphorylation remaining in the <i>akin10</i> mutant would be further reduced in an <i>akin10/11</i> double mutant, we employed virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to knock down AKIN10 and AKIN11 in a genomic <i>bzip63</i> complementation line (GY9). Resulting plants showed strongly reduced growth and accumulation of anthocyanins (<a href=\"#fig5s7\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), as previously described in <a href=\"#bib2\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2007)</a>. Like in the <i>akin10</i> line, there was no difference in bZIP63 phosphorylation between <i>akin10/11</i> and control plants in light, but the hyper-phosphorylated form of bZIP63 (band 8) in the extended night was now almost completely gone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This shows clearly, that AKIN10 and\u2014to a lower extent\u2014AKIN11 are the major kinases responsible for bZIP63 hyper-phosphorylation under starvation conditions."

Differences in phosphorylation were observed for proteins with mutations in S29, S294, and S300. In detail, the signal from S29A was strongly decreased in full length bZIP63 and completely gone in the N-terminal peptides that appeared as lower MW degradation products in these assays. The S300A mutation led to an even stronger decrease of the signal, comparable to the S294/300A double mutant. Even though the S294A single mutant showed a similar signal as the wt, all three serines had to be mutated to completely abolish phosphorylation, suggesting that all of them are in vitro targets for AKIN10, with S294 being the weakest. Importantly, all three sites match the SnRK1 consensus sequence (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang and Huber, 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

                                "text": "A comparison of <i>Arabidopsis</i> bZIP63 with orthologs from eight other plant species, ranging from mosses to higher plants, showed that the three putative AKIN10 target sites are highly conserved throughout evolution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). As the origin of SnRK1 dates back even further, to the common ancestor of plants and animals (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bayer et al., 2014</a>), it is likely that phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 poses an ancient and important regulatory mechanism. We therefore set out to test the functional relevance of AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation of bZIP63. To this end, we tested the transcriptional activity of bZIP63 in protoplast-based promoter activation assays using the <i>ASN1</i> or <i>ProDH</i> promoter fused to the beta galactosidase (GUS) reporter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In both cases, co-transformation of wt bZIP63 and AKIN10 strongly induced reporter gene expression, while transformation of bZIP63 alone was not sufficient for significant induction. Transformation of AKIN10 alone also led to a weak induction of the reporters, which could be explained by the action of endogenous bZIPs. Mutation of S29 or all three AKIN10 target sites on bZIP63 to alanine reduced the reporter activation almost to background level. In contrast, mutation of the two C-terminal serines, S294 and S300, had only a weak negative effect on <i>ASN1</i> and no significant effect on <i>ProDH</i> activation. Taken together, our data suggest that AKIN10 phosphorylates bZIP63 at up to three conserved sites, namely S29, S294, and S300 and phosphorylation by AKIN10, especially at S29, is crucial for bZIP63 TF activity."

The wt construct showed strong phosphorylation in the light (bands 6 and 7) and an even stronger phosphorylation in extended night (band 8), as well as reduced phosphorylation in the presence of sucrose (bands 1, 2, and 4) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In contrast, the S/A construct showed only weak phosphorylation (only bands 1 and 3 visible) and most importantly no difference between all tested conditions.

As we did not observe any changes in localization in the bZIP63 mutants and also no change in DNA-binding activity (of the bZIP63 homodimer) towards a C-box motif (GACGTC) as canonical bZIP target site (data not shown), we suspected that the observed effect on transcription would be due to changes in dimerization preferences of bZIP63. Therefore, we tested the effect of AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation on bZIP63 homo- and hetero-dimerization with bZIP1 and bZIP11. Both bZIP1 and bZIP11 are metabolic regulators and mediate transcription of <i>ASN1</i> and <i>ProDH</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al., 2011</a>). In protoplast two-hybrid (P2H) assays, the addition of exogenous AKIN10 resulted in a clear enhancement of dimerization in all cases\u2014homo-dimerization as well as hetero-dimerization with bZIP1 and bZIP11 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Note, that the very strong effect observed with bZIP11 in these assays is misleading because bZIP11 is a much stronger activator of transcription as compared to bZIP1 and 63 (see also \u2018Discussion\u2019). From that we concluded that the phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 is required for dimerization and set out to test the effect of S/A mutations of the AKIN10 target sites on bZIP63 homo- and hetero-dimerization with bZIP11 where we had observed the strongest effect before (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In both cases, the signal was reduced to about 30\u201340% of the signal obtained from dimerization with wt bZIP63 when S29 or all three serines were mutated to alanine. Mutation of one or two of the C-terminal sites decreased bZIP63 homo-dimerization weakly but had no visible effect on bZIP63-11 dimerization, indicating that these sites play, at most, a minor role in regulation of dimer formation."

For this, we expressed all three bZIPs (1, 11, and 63) from the same plasmid and co-transformed AKIN10 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). bZIP11 was fused to CFP<sub>N</sub>, bZIP1 to VENUS<sub>N</sub>, and bZIP63 to CFP<sub>C</sub>. Accordingly, the bZIP63-11 hetero-dimer generates a blue (cyan) signal and the bZIP63-1 hetero-dimer a yellow signal, whereas the bZIP63 homo-dimer cannot be detected. To compare the dimerization preference of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated bZIP63 we used wt and a S29/294/300A mutant of bZIP63. Quantification of the ratio of the VENUS/CFP signal in more than 100 nuclei clearly showed a shift towards the VENUS emission when wt bZIP63 was compared to the S/A mutant.

Notably, there is a strong correlation between the amino acid profiles of the bZIP63 and the bZIP1 ox lines (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al., 2011</a>). A similar accumulation of amino acids during dark-induced senescence has frequently been observed and was attributed to enhanced protein degradation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Ara\u00fajo et al., 2011</a>). Particularly under low carbon conditions or during senescence, alternative energy sources need to be used in plant cells, and the important role of proline and branched-chain amino acids in this process has been highlighted in a number of studies (reviewed in: <a href=\"#bib51\">Szabados and Savour\u00e9, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Szal and Podg\u00f3rska, 2012</a>).

By applying different proteolytic digests we were able to identify seven in vivo phosphorylated serine residues, distributed all over the protein. While exogenous sucrose decreased the global phosphorylation level of bZIP63, extended night treatment further increased its phosphorylation, thus supporting the idea that bZIP63 plays a role in energy signaling. Moreover, we found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10, which was proposed to be a central regulator of transcription in starvation response (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez and Sheen, 2008</a>), is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. Therefore, bZIP63 presents the first TF acting as direct target of SnRK1 in the transcriptional energy deprivation response. In vitro, AKIN10 phosphorylated three highly conserved and functionally important residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63\u2014S29, S294, and S300, respectively. Reporter activation assays in protoplasts revealed that these sites\u2014especially S29\u2014are essential for AKIN10-dependent induction of <i>ASN1</i> and <i>ProDH</i> by bZIP63. Remarkably, the phosphorylation patterns of different bZIP63 mutants on Phos-tag gels pointed towards S29 as the main target site for AKIN10 under extended night conditions. The importance of bZIP63 phosphorylation at the SnRK1 target sites for its in planta function was further underlined by complementation of the <i>bzip63</i> mutant with genomic bZIP63 constructs. Wt, but not a S29/S294/S300A mutant of bZIP63, could complement the metabolic and senescence phenotypes. Likewise, also the strong delay in extended night-triggered induction of <i>ASN1</i>, <i>DIN10</i>, and <i>ProDH</i> in <i>bzip63</i> plants was complemented with wt bZIP63, but not the (triple) S/A mutant. The relatively small difference in <i>ProDH</i> expression in plants, as compared to the protoplast assay, is probably due to redundancy within the C/S1 group bZIPs, as it was shown by <a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al. (2011)</a>, that only ko of multiple members of the C/S1 group leads to a strong reduction in <i>ProDH</i> and <i>ASN1</i> expression."

The notion that different C/S1 dimers have different target genes is further supported by a recent transcriptomics study in protoplasts. Overexpression of four C/S1 group bZIPs (bZIP1, bZIP10, bZIP11, and bZIP63), individually or in combination of two, revealed overlapping but distinct gene expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ma, 2012</a>).

In general, the dimerization of bZIP63 with bZIP1, bZIP11, and bZIP63, was boosted by AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation. Like in the promoter activation assays, the main influence on dimerization came from S29 phosphorylation, while phosphorylation of S294 and S300 showed a mild effect at most. Incidentally, this enhanced dimerization with bZIP63 would explain why AKIN10 was found to activate the S1 group bZIPs (bZIP1, 2, 11, and 53) in protoplast assays (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baena-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007</a>), although they do not present direct targets of AKIN10."

However, it has to be considered that bZIP11 is a very strong activator of transcription as it harbors an activation domain (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ehlert et al., 2006</a>) and was recently also shown to recruit the histone acetylation machinery (<a href=\"#bib62\">Weiste and Droege-Laser, 2014</a>). The same is not the case for bZIP1 and bZIP63. As the readout of the protoplast two-hybrid interaction assay is transcription-based it is therefore not possible to quantitatively compare the effect of phosphorylation on the formation of different dimers and to draw conclusions about the in vivo dimerization preference. Therefore we used a multi-color BiFC assay with bZIP1 and bZIP11 as alternative partners for bZIP63 to test the effect of bZIP63 phosphorylation by AKIN10 on its dimerization preference. The three bZIPs were co-expressed with AKIN10 in <i>N. tabacum</i> leaves and the formation of bZIP63-1 and bZIP63-11 dimers was quantified. Comparison of wt and S/A mutated bZIP63 revealed that, phosphorylation of bZIP63 shifts the dimerization preference from bZIP11 towards bZIP1. This trend fits well to the observation that both TFs are strongly upregulated in the night and extended night, while bZIP11 is downregulated under these conditions (see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Furthermore, increased expression of bZIP63 and bZIP1 under conditions when bZIP63 is phosphorylated might further enhance the observed shift in the dimerization towards bZIP63-1 dimers."

When bZIP63 is not phosphorylated, its capacity to dimerize with other bZIPs is rather low. Under starvation conditions, bZIP63 is phosphorylated at S29 by AKIN10, favoring the formation of bZIP63 homo- and specific hetero-dimers, particularly of bZIP63-1 dimers. This ultimately results in the induction of a different set of target genes and thereby mediates the transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism. However, it is clear that in the plant additional factors like bZIP expression, stability and interaction with other components add more complexity to the situation."

Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first time that phosphorylation outside the bZIP domain was shown to affect dimerization with different partners in a distinct way. While there are numerous reports on phosphorylation-mediated changes in bZIP activity in animals, plants, and yeast, in many cases the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We therefore believe that this novel mechanism of phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP dimerization partners could play a substantial role in the regulation of bZIP TF activity in all higher organisms, and should be further addressed in future studies."

Metabolites were measured in splitless mode (2 and 7) and alternatively also in split mode with a split ratio of 5 (7). In the MS step the data acquisition rate was set to 20 spectra/s, the detector voltage to 1550 V and the mass range to 40\u2013600 m/z. Raw data were processed with the LECO Chroma-TOF software (LECO, USA). Peak areas were normalized to the area of the internal standard and to the fresh weight before statistical analysis. Outliers, as determined by Grubb's test, were removed from the dataset. For Hierarchical clustering, log-2 transformed fold change values were imported into MeV (MultiExperimentViewer, version 4.9.0, <a href=\"#bib46\">Saeed et al., 2003</a>) and clustering was done using the standard settings with gene tree optimization, Pearson correlation, and average linkage clustering. For the PCA plot, normalized data were imported into R (RStudio, version 0.98.507), missing values were replaced with the k nearest neighbor (knn) method using the \u2018impute.knn()\u2019 function and data were Z-transformed.

Disulfide bonds were reduced by incubating in 200 \u00b5l of 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 56\u00b0C. DTT was washed off and cysteines were alkylated by incubation with 100 \u00b5l of 54 mM iodoacetamide for 20 min at RT in the dark. Gel pieces were dried with ACN, then swollen in 10 ng/\u00b5l trypsin (recombinant, proteomics grade, Roche, Vienna, Austria) in 50 mM ABC and incubated over night at 37\u00b0C. For higher sequence coverage of bZIP63 alternative proteases were used: LysC (MS grade, WAKO, Neuss, Germany) at 37\u00b0C overnight, subtilisin (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) at 37\u00b0C for 0.5\u20132 hr, chymotrypsin (sequencing grade, Roche, Vienna, Austria) at 25\u00b0C for 4 hr. Digestion was stopped by adding formic acid to a final concentration of approximately 1% and peptides were extracted by sonication. Peptides were separated on an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system or on a U3000 nano HPLC (both Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Digests were loaded on a trapping column (PepMap C18, 5 \u00b5m particle size, 300 \u03bcm i.d. \u00d7 5 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and separated on an analytical column (PepMap C18, 3 \u03bcm, 75 \u03bcm i.d. \u00d7 150 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by applying a 60 min linear gradient from 2.5% up to 40% ACN with 0.1% formic acid, followed by a washing step with 80% ACN and 10% trifluoroethanol (TFE) on the U3000 HPLC. The UltiMate 3000 HPLC was directly coupled to a linear ion trap (LTQ, Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was operated in a data-dependent MS3 method for the phosphorylation analysis. One full scan (m/z: 450\u20131600) was followed by maximal 4 MS/MS scans. If in the MS/MS scan a fragment corresponding to a neutral loss from the precursor of 98, 49, or 32 Th was observed among the top 8 peaks, a MS3 scan was triggered. Fragmentation energy was set at 35%, Q-value at 0.25, and the activation time at 30 ms. High resolution measurements were acquired on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Proxeon, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The electrospray voltage was set to 1500 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode: 1 full scan (m/z: 350\u20131800, resolution 60,000) with lock mass enabled was followed by maximal 12 MS/MS scans. The lock mass was set at the signal of polydimethylcyclosiloxane at m/z 445.120025. Monoisotopic precursor selection was on, precursors with charge state 1 were excluded from fragmentation.

The fluorescence was detected at 461\u2013495 nm, 520\u2013550 nm, and 600\u2013615 nm, respectively. To avoid bleed-through of the CFP signal into the VENUS channel CFP and VENUS were excited and detected separately. Pictures were taken with a 20\u00d7 air objective and the same settings for both combinations (wt bZIP63 and S29/294/300A). The pinhole was set to 1.5. To determine the relative VENUS/CFP signal ratio, images were processed in the LasX software from Leica. Nuclei showing a CFP/VENUS as well as mCherry signal were selected and the signal intensity was determined with the histogram tool. For each nucleus a ratio of the background corrected pixel sum from VENUS and CFP was built. All values for one leaf were divided by the median of the ratio from the bZIP63 S29/294/300A construct to allow comparison between experiments. In total, six leaves from two infiltrations were analyzed with similar results."

Silencing of AKIN10 and AKIN11 in these plants was confirmed by western blotting with an antibody against phosphorylated AMPK alpha (Anti-AMPKalpha-pT172) before use in Phos-tag gels (see <a href=\"#fig5s7\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). The VIGS experiments were repeated 4 times and 3 biological replicates were analyzed in each experiment with consistent results."

The aqueous phase was extracted twice with an equal volume of PCI (Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamylalcohol (25:24:21), Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) by vortexing for 30 s and 2 min centrifugation, and twice with chloroform. Then, the RNA was precipitated by adding \u2153 volume 10 M LiCl and incubating at 4\u00b0C for at least 2 hr, followed by 15 min centrifugation at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was washed once with 2.5 M LiCl and then with 70% EtOH, dried and resuspended in 50 \u00b5l RNAse free H<sub>2</sub>O. 6.5 \u00b5g RNA were treated with 2u of RQ1 DNAse (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions and precipitated again for at least 2 hr with \u2153 volume of 10 M LiCl to remove the DNAse from the solution.

If AKIN10 is a central regulator of starvation responses, and shows an order of magnitude higher activity compared to AKIN11 in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, based on the published striking AKIN10 RNAi senescence phenotype by Bhaena-Gonzalez et al., one would expect a dramatic growth phenotype. Consequently, it is absolutely necessary to show the phenotype of the <i>akin10</i> mutant both in the light and dark that we can compare that to that of the <i>bzip63</i> mutant."

This new band 7 is barely detectable in the EN samples from the <i>akin10</i> mutant. This might be considered as a small difference but these data should be seen in the overall context. In the genomic complementation, lines bZIP63 are almost exclusively detected in bands 5 and 6 in the light (so the same as before), and now most of the bZIP63 protein is shifted to the most phosphorylated form in band 7 in the extended night (EN). Strikingly, in the line complemented with the version of bZIP63 in which all three AKIN10 target sites are mutated to an alanine (S/A), ZIP63 is detected only in the bands 1 and 2 (so almost non\u2010phosphorylated) under all conditions.

One possible explanation for this is that, as the reviewer stated above, interactions between a kinase and its substrate are mostly not very strong and often not very long lived. We can therefore expect that only a fraction of bZIP63 is bound to AKIN10 at any given time and that there is not enough bound AKIN10 to be detected in the western blot. This analysis is furthermore complicated because bZIP63 is expressed at very low levels and very hard to detect (already in plant extracts), therefore it is again not surprising that we could not detect it in a co-IP where most likely only a fraction will bind very transiently to the kinase."

Unfortunately, we do not know yet any target gene, which would be specific for only one of the different bZIP dimers. Microarray data are available for bZIP1 and bZIP11, but not for bZIP63. Moreover, also from these data, such genes cannot be deduced as the other different dimerization partners are still present. Maybe ChIP experiments would be a solution here, but that would clearly be beyond the scope of this study."

In this line, S29 can be phosphorylated, but none of the other potential AKIN10 target sites. Due to the short time we had for the revision, this plant line is still heterozygous and cannot be used for phenotypic analysis at this point. However, we could use the line for Phos-tag gels and we here we saw indeed a striking effect: Compared to the triple mutant, that did not show any change in the phosphorylation pattern in response to starvation, the S294/S300 double mutant did still show a strong shift in the extended night. As S29 is the only AKIN10 target site left in this version, it must indeed be S29 that is phosphorylated by AKIN10 under starvation conditions. We think therefore we did add really significant novel information, and more is simply not possible in the few months we had for the revision."
