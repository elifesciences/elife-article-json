                    "text": "The majority of adult hippocampal newborn cells die during early differentiation from intermediate progenitors (IPCs) to immature neurons. Neural stem cells in vivo are located in a relative hypoxic environment, and hypoxia enhances their survival, proliferation and stemness in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that migration of IPCs away from hypoxic zones within the SGZ might result in oxidative damage, thus triggering cell death. Hypoxic niches were observed along the SGZ, composed of adult NSCs and early IPCs, and oxidative byproducts were present in adjacent late IPCs and neuroblasts. Stabilizing hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 with dimethyloxallyl glycine increased early survival, but not proliferation or differentiation, in neurospheres in vitro and in newly born SGZ cells in vivo. Rescue experiments in <i>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>mutants supported these results. We propose that localized hypoxia within the SGZ contributes to the neurogenic microenvironment and determines the early, activity-independent survival of adult hippocampal newborn cells."

Neural stem cells in vivo are located in a relative hypoxic environment, and hypoxia enhances their survival, proliferation and stemness in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that migration of IPCs away from hypoxic zones within the SGZ might result in oxidative damage, thus triggering cell death. Hypoxic niches were observed along the SGZ, composed of adult NSCs and early IPCs, and oxidative byproducts were present in adjacent late IPCs and neuroblasts. Stabilizing hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 with dimethyloxallyl glycine increased early survival, but not proliferation or differentiation, in neurospheres in vitro and in newly born SGZ cells in vivo. Rescue experiments in <i>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>mutants supported these results. We propose that localized hypoxia within the SGZ contributes to the neurogenic microenvironment and determines the early, activity-independent survival of adult hippocampal newborn cells."

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a highly dynamic and regulated process that evolves slowly over several weeks (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Adult neural stem/ radial glia-like cells (Type I cells) reside at the interface between the SGZ and the hilus, and give rise to rapidly dividing intermediate progenitors (Type 2 cells). These cells migrate a short distance into the SGZ and progressively (via Type 2a and Type 2b intermediate progenitors) differentiate into neuroblasts (Type 3 cells) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fuentealba et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bonaguidi et al., 2012</a>).

This data is summarized in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>. Specifically, at 3 dpi. BrdU+ cells consisted mainly of late intermediate progenitors (Tbr2+/DCX+) and neuroblasts (Tbr2-/DCX+), and a small number of early intermediate progenitors (Tbr2+/DCX-). At 7 dpi., the proportion of BrdU+ cells colabeled with Tbr2+/DCX+ decreased, whereas the proportion expressing only DCX+ increased, reflecting a shift towards immature neurons. By 14 dpi. Tbr2+ cells were not detected in either group with the majority of the BrdU+ cells expressing DCX. In the subsequent two weeks there was a significant decrease in the number of BrdU+/DCX+ cells consistent with lineage progression to mature neurons. DMOG had no effect on the total volume of the dentate gyrus (Control: 0.61\u00a0mm<sup>3</sup> \u00b1 0.02, n = 3 animals, DMOG: 0.59 \u00b1 0.04, n = animals, p = 0.89), indicating that there were no macroscopic changes in the tissue."

DMOG resulted in an increase of BrdU labeled nuclei in the SGZ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Quantitative analysis of the BrdU+ cells showed a significant effect of DMOG on survival of newborn cells in the SGZ (2-way ANOVA, p = 0.0002, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). One day of DMOG treatment did not alter the number of BrdU+ cells, consistent with no effect on proliferation (p = 0.49, n = 6 animals, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, DMOG significantly increased the survival of BrdU+ cells by 3 days post-mitosis (p &lt;0.0001, n = 12 animals). Interestingly, the relative increase in BrdU-labelled cells in DMOG persisted at later time points (7 dpi., p = 0.0017, n = 8 animals; 14 dpi., p = 0.003, n = 6; 21 dpi., p = 0.007, n = 6; 28 dpi., p = 0.01, n = 6), as assessed by the rate of BrdU+ cell loss between 3 and 28 dpi. (Comparison of fits, p = 0.5, F = 0.7). To delineate the effective time window for the action on adult newborn granule cell survival by 28 dpi., dividing cells were labeled with BrdU at day zero, then exposed to DMOG from 0\u20133, 0\u20137 or 7\u201314 days (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Exposure to DMOG for the first three day post-mitosis resulted in a 33% increase in survival (p = 0.023, n = 3), whereas exposure for 7 days did not yield a significant further increase (p = 0.23, n = 3). However, DMOG administration from day 7\u201314, a critical period during which the newborn cells begin to integrate into the hippocampal network, had no effect on their survival (p = 0.76, n = 3). The differentiation of BrdU+ cells into mature neurons (NeuN+) by 28 dpi. was not affected by exposure to DMOG for either the first 3 or 7 days post mitosis (BrdU+NeuN+/BrdU+: 0\u20133 days, Vehicle: 96 \u00b1 4%, DMOG: 95 \u00b1 2%, n = 3; 0\u20137 days, Vehicle: 98 \u00b1 3%, DMOG: 96 \u00b1 2%, n = 3, 2-way ANOVA p = 0.8). The above results indicate that the hypoxia mimetic agent DMOG does not alter the proliferation or differentiation of newborn cells in the adult DG, but rather specifically promotes their survival during the first few days post-mitosis, during their transition from intermediate progenitors to neuroblasts."

Because the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bax</i> mediates programmed cell death of adult-generated hippocampal cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sun, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sahay et al., 2011</a>), we hypothesized that DMOG treatment should not affect the survival of cells lacking <i>Bax</i>. To test this idea, the dentate gyrus of wildtype and <i>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice was co-injected with a nuclear-Cre-GFP encoding retrovirus together with a control retrovirus encoding mCherry (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These MMLV-based retroviral constructs selectively target the same population of adult-born granule cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">van Praag et al., 2002</a>), and could be used to count the numbers of labeled adult-born cells and selectively inhibit Bax expression from Cre-retrovirus infected cells. The ratio of nuclear-Cre-GFP expressing cells to the mCherry-expressing cells in <i>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> animals as early as 7 dpi., provides a measure of survival of newborn cells, independent of possible variation in injection sites and viral titers. The ratio of Cre-GFP/ mCherry cells was increased in vehicle treated <i>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> compared to WT animals at 7 dpi. (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>, 31.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.3%, p = 0.002), indicating that loss of Bax augments the survival of adult-born cells at one week post-mitosis.

DMOG treatment also did not affect neuronal activity in the hilus as assayed by double immunohistochemistry with c-Fos and the GABAergic neuronal marker glutamic acid decarboxylase-64 (Gad-67). We detected only sparse activation of hilar mossy cells (Fos+ only) or hilar interneurons (Fos+/GAD67+) under basal conditions, which was unaffected by DMOG (Vehicle, Fos+: 144 \u00b1 55 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, Fos+/GAD67+: 14 \u00b1 16 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, n = 4; DMOG, Fos only+: 116 \u00b1 14 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, n = 4, Fos+/GAD67+: 13 \u00b1 14 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, n = 4, p = 0.4) These results indicate that stabilization and activation of HIF-1a signaling by DMOG rescues early survival of newborn cells in an activity-independent manner."

Adult DG neurospheres were generated and cultured for 7 days at ambient oxygen tension (21% O<sub>2</sub>), in the presence of DMOG (100 \u03bcM) or in hypoxic conditions (2.5% O<sub>2</sub>). Neurospheres under all three conditions exhibited normal morphology, each containing committed progenitors that co-expressed nestin and doublecortin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Treatment with DMOG or reducing O<sub>2</sub> levels to 2.5% increased the number of neurospheres, a measure of cell survival (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively), but had no effect on the size of the neurospheres, a measure of cells\u2019 proliferation (p = 0.98, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Consistent with enhanced survival DMOG or hypoxia reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells in neurospheres as measured by caspase-3 immunoreactivity (normoxia: 28.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7%; DMOG: 17.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6%, p = 0.01; hypoxia: 11.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3%, p &lt;0.0001, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013G</a>). The neurosphere assay also enabled us to test the sensitivity of the hypoxic marker pimonidazole hydrochloride (PH), which labeled groups of cells in the SGZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). No pimonidazole binding was detected in neurospheres cultured in standard atmospheric culture conditions or in the presence of DMOG, whereas only a small percentage of PH+ cells (10.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4%), were detected in neurospheres cultured in 2.5% O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H\u2013K</a>), indicating that PH labeling occurs at O<sub>2\u00a0</sub>\u22642.5%.

In rat hippocampus the pO<sub>2</sub> has been estimated to be 20.3 mmHg (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ereci\u0144ska and Silver, 2001</a>), whereas even more hypoxic regions have been detected in the SGZ of the adult mouse DG (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mazumdar et al., 2010</a>). Using the hypoxia marker, pimonidazole hydrochloride, which labels cells with oxygen levels &lt;10 mm Hg (1.3%), we found that SGZ stem-cell like-radial glia and early intermediate progenitors lie within hypoxic zones. Interestingly, not all cells in the SGZ were labeled, but were localized to narrow zones of a few cell diameters wide along the hilar border of the SGZ. Only a fraction of GFAP+ or Tbr2+ cells were pimonidazole-positive whereas the hypoxic cell did not label with the proliferating marker Ki67 (data not shown).

Stem cells exhibit different metabolic properties than their differentiated progeny that may promote \u2018stemness\u2019. However, whether anaerobic metabolism is an adaptation to low oxygen levels in the specific niches in vivo or is an intrinsic stem cell property is still unclear. In either case, our results are consistent with two-photon phosphorescence direct in vivo measurements of local oxygen tension in the bone marrow, which revealed a hypoxic adult stem cell niche with high heterogeneity in local pO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Spencer et al., 2014</a>).

Interestingly, we detected oxidative byproducts in intermediate progenitors and neuroblasts located adjacent to the hypoxic niches. This correlation suggests that migration of intermediate progenitors away from hypoxic zones leads to oxidative damage, and thus triggers an early phase of apoptosis. In vitro, hypoxic conditions (defined as &lt;5% O<sub>2</sub>) reduces apoptosis, promotes proliferation, and increases cultured embryonic, adult neural stem cells and neuronal progenitors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sierra et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shingo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Studer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Felling, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gustafsson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clarke and van der Kooy, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00fcrgers et al., 2008</a>).

Additionally, conditional ablation of HIF1-\u03b1 in adult mouse brain resulted in hydrocephalus, decreased neurogenesis (partly due to an increase in apoptosis) and deficits in spatial memory (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tomita et al., 2003</a>). In our experiments, DMOG, an agent that stabilizes HIF1-\u03b1 under normoxic conditions, reversed the early phase of cell death of newborn cells in the adult dentate gyrus.

Our results show that at 3 days post-mitosis, adult-born cells demonstrate no detectable neural activity. Rather, we propose that the metabolic milieu of the adult SGZ, a previously underexplored variable of this highly specialized neurogenic niche, plays a critical role in the early survival of adult generated hippocampal granule cells."

Most of these comments relate to the hypoxic condition, which was primarily deduced from the use of molecular markers. One example is the title, which states \"oxygen tensions within the SGZ[\u2026]\" yet, oxygen tensions were not really measured, but are suggested by the use of a molecular marker. I don't doubt the study, but the statement \"Oxygen tensions\" somehow implies that those oxygen tensions were measured. It is for example conceivable that these cells are just functioning anaerobically, i.e. they are metabolically hypoxic, but the tension may be normal? Changing the title would solve this issue. But, it is a recurrent issue, and the authors have to double check their statements: In the second section of Results, the authors state e.g. \"Mimicking hypoxia\". But, really what they (DMOG) do is stabilize Hif1-\u03b1. This, however, is only one aspect of hypoxia \u2013 hypoxia will also affect other regulators such as HIF2. Indeed, the balance between the regulation of oxidants and anti-oxidants is one of the aspects that would differentiate chronic versus intermittent hypoxia. Stabilizing HIF1a is not addressing this important aspect of hypoxia or the regulation of the Redox state, just to name one example. In short hypoxia will cause many additional biochemical changes throughout the cellular and local niche environments, which are not accounted for by Hif1-\u03b1 stabilization. Again, this is easily fixed by changing the heading, and other statements that imply that the authors \"mimicked hypoxia\" \u2013 e.g. at the end of subsection \u201cDMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation\u201d."

Most of these comments relate to the hypoxic condition, which was primarily deduced from the use of molecular markers. One example is the title, which states \"oxygen tensions within the SGZ[\u2026]\" yet, oxygen tensions were not really measured, but are suggested by the use of a molecular marker. I don't doubt the study, but the statement \"Oxygen tensions\" somehow implies that those oxygen tensions were measured. It is for example conceivable that these cells are just functioning anaerobically, i.e. they are metabolically hypoxic, but the tension may be normal? Changing the title would solve this issue. But, it is a recurrent issue, and the authors have to double check their statements: In the second section of Results, the authors state e.g. \"Mimicking hypoxia\". But, really what they (DMOG) do is stabilize Hif1-\u03b1. This, however, is only one aspect of hypoxia \u2013 hypoxia will also affect other regulators such as HIF2. Indeed, the balance between the regulation of oxidants and anti-oxidants is one of the aspects that would differentiate chronic versus intermittent hypoxia. Stabilizing HIF1a is not addressing this important aspect of hypoxia or the regulation of the Redox state, just to name one example. In short hypoxia will cause many additional biochemical changes throughout the cellular and local niche environments, which are not accounted for by Hif1-\u03b1 stabilization. Again, this is easily fixed by changing the heading, and other statements that imply that the authors \"mimicked hypoxia\" \u2013 e.g. at the end of subsection \u201cDMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation\u201d</i>."

Reviewer 3 suggests that stimulation within the middle molecular layer (MML) could have missed possible synaptic connections arising from hilar cells (interneurons or mossy cells). However, hilar basket cells and hilar mossy cells are driven by excitatory feed-forward inputs from the perforant path (which we stimulated directly) as well as inputs from dentate granule cell mossy fiber axons (see Ribak, CE and Shapiro, LA (2007) Ultrastucture and connectivity of cell types in the adult dentate gyrus. in Scharfman, H.E (ed) The Dentate Gyrus, 157-160). To prove explicitly that our stimulation activates hilar cells, we stimulated the MML using the same stimulating electrode position, intensity, and train duration/frequency as shown in the manuscript and assayed hilar neurons with cell-attached and current-clamp recordings (n=4 cells). In every cell, we elicited depolarization, and in 3 of 4 cells, the cells showed repetitive spiking (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a>). Thus hilar cells were activated in the protocol shown in the manuscript, yet no neural activity in the 3 day-old cells was observed. We think this evidence is unequivocal that the cells at 3 d.p.i show no neural activity, thus justifying the conclusions in our manuscript.
