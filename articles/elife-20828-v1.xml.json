Although, the non-muscle myosin II holoenzyme (myosin) is a molecular motor that powers contraction of actin cytoskeleton networks, recent studies have questioned the importance of myosin motor activity cell and tissue shape changes. Here, combining the biochemical analysis of enzymatic and motile properties for purified myosin mutants with in vivo measurements of apical constriction for the same mutants, we show that in vivo constriction rate scales with myosin motor activity. We show that so-called phosphomimetic mutants of the <i>Drosophila</i> regulatory light chain (RLC) do not mimic the phosphorylated RLC state in vitro. The defect in the myosin motor activity in these mutants is evident in developing <i>Drosophila</i> embryos where tissue recoil following laser ablation is decreased compared to wild-type tissue. Overall, our data highlights that myosin activity is required for rapid cell contraction and tissue folding in developing <i>Drosophila</i> embryos."

Here, combining the biochemical analysis of enzymatic and motile properties for purified myosin mutants with in vivo measurements of apical constriction for the same mutants, we show that in vivo constriction rate scales with myosin motor activity. We show that so-called phosphomimetic mutants of the <i>Drosophila</i> regulatory light chain (RLC) do not mimic the phosphorylated RLC state in vitro. The defect in the myosin motor activity in these mutants is evident in developing <i>Drosophila</i> embryos where tissue recoil following laser ablation is decreased compared to wild-type tissue. Overall, our data highlights that myosin activity is required for rapid cell contraction and tissue folding in developing <i>Drosophila</i> embryos."

The motor domain at the N-terminus of the myosin heavy chain binds actin filaments in an ATP-dependent manner. The motor domain catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to power the translocation of actin filaments, a function referred to as motor activity. The light chains bind to the central neck domain of the myosin heavy chain and have structural and regulatory functions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heissler and Sellers, 2014</a>). The C-terminal tail of the myosin heavy chain associates with the tails of other myosin heavy chains and promotes the assembly into bipolar filaments. Work done using smooth muscle myosin and mammalian non-muscle myosin have demonstrated that phosphorylation of the RLC at conserved Serine and Threonine sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, Serine-19 and Threonine-18) activates myosin motor activity, enhances the affinity of myosin for actin, and promotes myosin filament assembly (<a href=\"#bib23\">Heissler and Sellers, 2016</a>). The bipolar myosin filaments promote the sliding of antiparallel actin filaments relative to one another resulting in contraction of an actin network. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), and Citron kinase are known to activate myosin through direct phosphorylation of the RLC, primarily on Serine-19 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amano et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Heissler and Sellers, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pearson et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yamashiro et al., 2003</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, the importance of myosin light chain phosphorylation has been shown through genetic studies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jordan and Karess, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee and Treisman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mizuno et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Winter et al., 2001</a>). However, it has not been biochemically demonstrated that <i>Drosophila</i> myosin motor activity and filament assembly is regulated by RLC phosphorylation or whether the extent of activation is similar to that of mammalian systems."

The top panel shows the myosin hexamer composed of two myosin heavy chains (green), two ELCs (light blue) and two RLCs (gray). The myosin motor domain, the light chain binding neck and the tail domain of the heavy chain are indicated. The bottom panel shows the double headed HMM fragment. The rational for the different myosin fragments lies in the different biochemical properties: Full-length myosin forms filaments, sediments at high speed and can be used in the in vitro motility assay. The HMM fragment is soluble under physiological salt concentrations and suitable to study kinetic properties, the interaction with actin, and regulatory properties including RLC phosphorylation. (<b>B</b>) Multiple sequence alignment of RLCs from different model organisms and RLC mutants. (Top) Sequence alignment showing the high degree of conservation between RLCs from different model organisms. Identical amino acids are colored brown. The primary phosphorylation site of MLCK corresponds to Serine-21 (orange), the secondary phosphorylation site to Threonine-20 (yellow) of the <i>Drosophila</i> RLC. (Bottom) Alignment showing the mutant RLCs used in this study and the respective amino acid substitutions at the sites corresponding to Threonine-20 and Serine-21 of the <i>Drosophila</i> RLC. Alanine replacements are shown in blue, Glutamate replacements in red. Alanine replacement in RLC-AA is expected to mimic the unphosphorylated RLC state, Glutamate replacement in RLC-EE the di-phosphorylated RLC state. RLC-AE is expected to mimic the mono-phosphorylated RLC state that is independent from upstream regulation, whereas RLC-AS and RLC-TA are phosphorylatable and coupled to upstream signaling in vitro and in vivo.

(<b>C</b>) Actin-activated ATP hydrolysis rate of RLC-TS and RLC mutants. Gray bars indicate the ATP hydrolysis rate at an actin concentration of 100 \u00b5M in the absence of RLC phosphorylation. Orange bars indicate the ATP hydrolysis rate at an actin concentration of 100 \u00b5M after RLC phosphorylation with MLCK, also indicated by a lowercase p. Note that the myosin activity in these assays are even lower than shown since direct actin-mediated hydrolysis of ATP likely accounts for a substantial portion of the ATPase of the unphosphorylated and mutant samples. (<b>D</b>) In vitro motility assay using RLC-TS and RLC mutants. No significant movement was observed for RLC-TS in the absence of MLCK phosphorylation and RLC-AA. n\u00a0=\u00a047\u2013227 tracked filaments per RLC mutant. The data were corrected for the stage drift. (<b>E</b>) Actin cosedimentation assays of RLC-TS and RLC-AE, supernatants (S) and pellets (P) from mixtures of myosin, actin, and ATP as indicated. In the absence of actin, RLC-TS and RLC-AE remain in the supernatant. Binding of RLC-TS and RLC-AE to actin in the absence of ATP results in pelleting of the actomyosin complex. The presence of ATP disassembles the actomyosin complex and myosin mostly remains in the supernatant. The sedimentation of actin is independent of ATP. Soluble HMM fragments were used in this assay since myosin filaments sediment under the assay conditions. Red numbers indicate lanes."

Actin filament crosslinking could drive contraction in the absence of motor activity, if linked to actin network disassembly (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sun et al., 2010</a>). It was suggested that myosin motor activity is not required for apical constriction in epithelial cells of the neural tube, but that instead actin depolymerization was required for epithelial folding (<a href=\"#bib12\">Escuin et al., 2015</a>). In addition, it was recently suggested that apical constriction during <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal closure results from cell volume reduction as opposed to myosin motor activity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Saias et al., 2015</a>). Thus, an important question is whether myosin motor activity has a role during apical constriction and tissue folding."

The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Uehata et al., 1997</a>) disrupts myosin filament assembly, motor activity, and prevents the motor domain from transitioning to the strong actin binding state by blocking RLC phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sellers et al., 1982</a>). Furthermore, treatment with a\u00a0ROCK inhibitor often disrupts myosin localization (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hirose et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Royou et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Totsukawa et al., 2004</a>). The myosin inhibitor blebbistatin locks the motor domain in a weak actin binding state, a state with similar affinity to actin as that of myosin bound to an unphosphorylated RLC (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ramamurthy et al., 2004</a>). While RLC mutants thought to mimic the activated state of myosin have been observed to enable some <i>rock</i> mutant flies to survive to adulthood (<a href=\"#bib63\">Winter et al., 2001</a>), studies directly visualizing cell contractility determined that RLC mutants fail to suppress ROCK mutants (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aranjuez et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>) or ROCK inhibition (<a href=\"#bib43\">Munjal et al., 2015</a>), questioning whether these mutants truly mimic the phosphorylated state. Overexpression of a myosin heavy chain mutant that lacks the motor domain demonstrated the importance of myosin for force generation during morphogenesis; however, this approach would disrupt both motor and crosslinking functions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Franke et al., 2005</a>).

Here we show for the first time that <i>Drosophila</i> myosin motor activity and myosin filament assembly are regulated by phosphorylation of the RLC. Additionally, we show that so-called phosphomimetic alleles of the RLC do not fully mimic the behavior of myosins associated with phosphorylated RLCs. Rather, they have graded and measurable motor activity defects compared to myosins with phosphorylated RLC, providing us with an allelic series of myosin motor mutants. We find that decreased motor activity is associated with slower cellular contractions and slower folding of epithelial tissue. Our results show that the reduction in the rate of apical constriction scales with the extent of the deficit in myosin motor activity."

Rationale for the design of these mutants, which are routinely used in the <i>Drosophila</i> system, is that they have been assumed to represent the unphosphorylated, mono- or di-phosphorylated RLC states (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jordan and Karess, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Munjal et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rauskolb et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Royou et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Winter et al., 2001</a>). We tested the ability of MLCK to phosphorylate RLC mutants. We found that RLC-AS and RLC-TA can each be phosphorylated by MLCK at only one site, either Serine-21 or Threonine-20, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). RLC-AA, RLC-AE, and RLC-EE were all unresponsive to MLCK treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>). Thus, these mutants create a systematic series of myosins with motor activities that are either coupled (RLC-TA and RLC-AS) or uncoupled (RLC-AA, RLC-AE, and RLC-EE) from upstream signaling. This set of mutants also allowed us to individually determine the importance of phosphorylation of Threonine-20 and Serine-21 on myosin motor function."

Actin marginally activated the ATP hydrolysis rate of all RLC mutants to a similar extent (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). MLCK phosphorylation of RLC-AS increased its ATP hydrolysis rate to the same extent as that of the wild type RLC-TS (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In contrast, phosphorylation of RLC-TA activated the ATP hydrolysis rate to a reduced extent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The virtually identical steady-state ATP hydrolysis rates for RLC-TS and RLC-AS at 100 \u00b5M actin, but reduced activity of RLC-TA indicate that Serine-21 is the primary RLC phosphorylation site and that Threonine-20 is the secondary phosphorylation site. However, it is important to note that there is a slight reduction in the ATP hydrolysis rate of RLC-AS at lower actin concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

The direct comparison of the ATP hydrolysis rates of RLC-TS and RLC mutants at 100 \u00b5M actin (k<sub>100</sub>), the highest actin concentration used in the assay, shows that phosphorylation results in a\u00a0~6\u20137 fold activation for RLC-TS and RLC-AS versus a\u00a0~3 fold activation for RLC-TA, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

No significant movement was detected for RLC-TS in the absence of phosphorylation, consistent with myosin being in an inactive, weak actin-binding state. Phosphorylation of RLC-TS by MLCK resulted in movement of actin filaments at\u00a0~250 nm s<sup>\u22121</sup>, which is slightly higher than that of human myosin IIA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cuda et al., 1997</a>). No obvious directed actin filament movement was observed for RLC-AA, consistent with this mutant mimicking the unphosphorylated RLC state. Phosphorylated RLC-AS moved actin filaments at 50% of the rate of phosphorylated RLC-TS and phosphorylated RLC-TA moved actin filaments at only 10% of the rate of phosphorylated RLC-TS. These results are consistent with Serine-21 being the primary phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Both, RLC-AE and RLC-EE translocated actin filaments, demonstrating that these mutants exhibit some level of constitutive functional activity; however, translocation speeds of actin filaments by RLC-AE and RLC-EE were only about 30% of that of phosphorylated RLC-TS, indicating a functional deficit for these mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Though neither unphosphorylated RLC-TS nor RLC-AA translocated actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay, both motors tethered actin filaments to the surface indicating that unphosphorylated <i>Drosophila</i> myosin still binds actin weakly as occurs with mammalian unphosphorylated myosins, suggesting that bipolar filaments containing these myosins could cross-link or tether actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cuda et al., 1997</a>)."

Actin is sedimented by high centrifugal forces regardless of the ATP concentration (lanes 13\u201316). Neither RLC-TS nor RLC-AE alone sediment without actin (lanes 1,2 and 7,8). When mixed with actin both RLC-TS and RLC-AE bind and sediment in the absence, but not the presence of ATP (lanes 3\u20136, 9\u201312). This suggests that RLC-TS and RLC-AE still cycle through strongly- and weakly-actin bound states during the kinetic cycle. Together, these results indicate that RLC-TS and RLC mutants likely use the same kinetic pathway, but that RLC-AE and RLC-EE do not fully recapitulate the behavior of myosin bearing wild type RLC. The RLC-AA mutant mimics the known functions of unphosphorylated RLC-TS in that it does not move actin in the in vitro motility assay, but does tether actin to the surface."

The equilibrium is shifted from the filamentous form to the 10S conformation in the presence of ATP when the RLC is not phosphorylated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Similar to RLC-TS, all RLC mutants form filaments in the absence of ATP and disassemble into the 10S conformation in the presence of ATP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). As occurs with mammalian myosin II paralogs, phosphorylated RLC-TS remains predominantly filamentous in the presence of ATP demonstrating a dual effect of phosphorylation; activation of the ATPase activity and stabilization of the\u00a0filament structure (28). Phosphorylation also stabilizes filaments of RLC-AS and RLC-TA in the presence of ATP. If RLC-AE and RLC-EE were faithfully mimicking the phosphorylated RLC state, they should also remain predominantly filamentous in ATP in vitro at these protein concentrations; instead, addition of ATP to RLC-AA, RLC-AE and RLC-EE results in depolymerization of the myosin filaments. These results demonstrate that the RLC-AS and the RLC-TA mutants exhibit phosphoregulation by upstream kinases similar to RLC-TS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The concentration of myosin in <i>Drosophila</i> cells is on the order of 0.5 \u00b5M, which favors the filamentous form and thus making it likely that all RLC mutants form filaments in vivo (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kiehart and Feghali, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>). However, the assembly of RLC-AE and RLC-EE mutants in cells would not be governed by kinases. Thus, these RLC phosphomutants are not only uncoupled from the control of signal transduction pathways that regulate myosin phosphorylation, but also display motor defects. These properties together prohibit RLC-AE and RLC-EE from being good models for phosphorylated myosin."

In our in vivo studies, we focused our analysis on the <i>RLC-AE</i> mutant, because the <i>RLC-EE</i> mutant often results in altered embryo shape, likely due to defects in oogenesis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>). Laser-cutting techniques have been used to infer the levels of tension in epithelial tissues (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fischer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hutson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mayer et al., 2010</a>). In response to a laser cut, the tissue adjacent to the incision will exhibit quick recoil away from the cut, followed by slower movement away from the cut site before the wound begins to heal and close. The initial rapid displacement of surrounding tissue, the initial recoil velocity, is proportional to the tension in the tissue just prior to the cut, assuming constant tissue viscosity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2009</a>) (see Materials and methods). Therefore, we compared the initial recoil velocity after tissue cutting in wild-type (<i>RLC-TS</i>) and RLC mutant embryos."

To infer tension in various RLC mutants, we made 8.5 \u03bcm long cuts across the width of the furrow at equivalently staged embryos and tracked the displacement of the wound edge along the anterior-posterior axis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). We calculated the initial recoil velocity (see Materials and methods) and found that tissues expressing either <i>RLC-TA</i> or <i>RLC-AE</i> display lower initial recoil velocities than <i>RLC-TS</i> tissues, suggesting that RLC mutant tissues generate less tension than <i>RLC-TS</i> tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Note that this interpretation assumes that viscous drag is not different between tissues of mutant and <i>RLC-TS</i> embryos. Previously, altering the level of myosin phosphorylation was proposed to alter the viscoelastic properties of a tissue, as measured by a change in the exponent used when fitting the data to a power law (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fischer et al., 2014</a>). We found that the mean power law exponent values for <i>RLC-TS, RLC-TA</i> and <i>RLC-AE</i> were 0.3, 0.3 and 0.4, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Differences between the power law exponents of <i>RLC-TS</i>, <i>RLC-TA</i>, and <i>RLC-AE</i> embryos were not significant (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, we determined the time decay constants calculated from fitting recoil distance to a Kelvin-Voigt model, which are proportional to the ratio of the viscosity coefficient of the tissue to its stiffness. In agreement with power law exponents, differences between time decay constants of RLC-TS, RLC-TA, and RLC-AE embryos were not significant (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We suggest that the 3-fold decrease in initial recoil velocity in the <i>RLC-AE</i> mutant reflects decreased tension for the following reasons: (I) The power law exponent and time decay constant are similar between <i>RLC-TS</i> and <i>RLC-AE</i>, suggesting similar viscoelastic properties; (II) Myosin levels are similar between <i>RLC-TS</i> and <i>RLC-AE</i>; (III) The <i>RLC-AE</i> mutant can still interact with actin, suggesting that there is not necessarily a difference in the amount of actomyosin present in the tissue; and (IV) <i>RLC-AE</i> exhibited a reduced maximal recoil distance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), which is also consistent with decreased tissue tension. We conclude that myosin motor activity is important to generate epithelial tension during ventral furrow formation."

Furthermore, inhibition of ROCK, a kinase that phosphorylates the RLC, completely disrupts myosin localization and does not distinguish between myosin motor and crosslinking functions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Royou et al., 2002</a>). Although RLC-EE enables some <i>rock</i> mutant flies to survive to adulthood (<a href=\"#bib63\">Winter et al., 2001</a>), apical constriction, tissue extension, and collective cell migration defects of <i>rock</i> mutants or ROCK inhibition are not suppressed by expressing the <i>RLC-EE</i> allele, suggesting that ROCK could have other important functional targets besides myosin or that RLC-EE does not mimic the phosphorylated state (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aranjuez et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Munjal et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>).

These mutants have defects in cellularization, which precedes tissue folding (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xue and Sokac, 2016</a>). It is likely that the RLC-AA mutant is not able to oligomerize at all, in contrast to RLC-AE and RLC-EE, which form aggregates with heavy chain in vivo (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>). In addition, because we demonstrated that RLC-AS, RLC-TA, and RLC-AE have variable deficits in motor activity that define an allelic series in vitro, these mutants were ideal to assess the in vivo roles of myosin motor activity during apical constriction."

Because (I) there is great heterogeneity in the timing and rate of myosin accumulation between different cells and (II) the rate of myosin accumulation, as measured with apical RLC::GFP intensity, is correlated with the degree of constriction (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xie and Martin, 2015</a>), the direct comparison of different RLC alleles required normalization for differences in myosin accumulation rates. To identify instances of rapid cellular constriction, we first smoothed signals for apical area and mean myosin intensity and calculated instantaneous rates for each time point. To normalize for differences in myosin accumulation rates, we identified times of rapid myosin intensity increase and selected time periods where myosin accumulated at a given rate (i.e. one to two standard deviations above the mean rate for <i>RLC-TS</i> cells). We calculated and compared constriction rates at these instances. Thus, we determined whether the same rate of apical myosin accumulation results in equivalent constriction rates in embryos expressing RLC mutants when compared to <i>RLC-TS</i>. We found that the mean constriction rate for cells in <i>RLC-AS</i> was 74% of that of <i>RLC-TS</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This defect was consistent with the lower RLC-AS ATPase activity at intermediate actin concentrations and the lower actin gliding velocity of the RLC-AS mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We found that cells expressing <i>RLC-TA</i> or <i>RLC-AE</i> constricted with mean rates that were 60% and 47% of RLC-TS cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The greater defect of the <i>RLC-TA</i> mutant, compared to <i>RLC-AS</i> was consistent with the Serine-21 site being the primary site responsible for myosin motor activation in <i>Drosophila</i> myosin, similar to mammalian myosins (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bresnick et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Heissler and Manstein, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ikebe, 1989</a>). Furthermore, on average, cells expressing <i>RLC-AE</i> constricted slower than those expressing <i>RLC-TA</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taking our in vivo and in vitro measurements of myosin activity, there is a relationship between myosin motor activity and constriction rate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). On the tissue-scale, the slower constriction is associated with a delay in tissue folding and sealing. The <i>RLC-AE</i> mutant, which had the greatest defect in motor activity, exhibited the slowest tissue folding behavior, with minimal folding occurring even 9 min after myosin first appeared (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The <i>RLC-AS</i> and <i>RLC-TA</i> mutants exhibited tissue folding at intermediate rates, folding over, but failing to seal after 9 min, a time in which <i>RLC-TS</i> is fully sealed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, the amount of time it takes the mean apical area to decrease to 50% of the starting apical area recapitulates the previously observed pattern: the <i>RLC-AE</i> mutant takes longest time (10.4 min) to reach 50% of the initial mean apical area, while the <i>RLC-AS</i> and <i>RLC-TA</i> mutants take an intermediate amounts of time (7.0 min and 7.4 min, respectively) relative to the wild-type <i>RLC-TS</i> (6.8 min) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overall, our results show that the apical constriction rate and tissue folding rate scales with the myosin motor activity."

A major advantage of our approach is that we have characterized the enzymatic properties of wild-type and mutant motors and quantified the in vivo effects of these motors within a single species, <i>Drosophila</i>. Such a systematic approach was essential to show that myosin motor activity is required for cellular contraction and to generate tension to fold epithelial tissues during <i>Drosophila</i> morphogenesis."

One significant advantage of <i>Drosophila</i> over mammalian systems is that <i>Drosophila</i> only has one gene encoding the myosin heavy chain, unlike the case with mammals where multiple myosin paralogs are expressed from three genes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Golomb et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ketchum et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Simons et al., 1991</a>). So far, it was assumed that <i>Drosophila</i> myosin is regulated identically to mammalian myosins by RLC phosphorylation although this cannot necessarily be assumed because striated muscle myosins from different species respond differently to RLC phosphorylation. For example, phosphorylation of the equivalent Serine residue in mammalian striated muscle myosin only slightly modulates the enzymatic and mechanical properties of the motor whereas in some invertebrates muscles, such as <i>Limulus</i> and <i>Tarantula</i>, phosphorylation of this site is an on/off switch as is found in mammalian non-muscle myosins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Craig et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Morgan et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sellers, 1981</a>). Here, we show for the first time that recombinant <i>Drosophila</i> myosin is regulated in an on/off manner by RLC phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the RLC at Threonine-20 or Serine-21 activates myosin motor activity in addition to promoting the formation of bipolar filaments composed of 12.8 myosins under physiological conditions in vitro. Our study also shows that RLC phosphorylation at Threonine-20 results in different mechanoenzymatic properties than phosphorylation at Serine-21, in agreement with Serine-21 being the primary phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bresnick et al., 1995</a>). The similarity in regulatory properties between <i>Drosophila</i> myosin and vertebrate myosins qualifies <i>Drosophila</i> as an excellent model organism to study the underlying principles of myosin function and regulation in complex processes such as cell contraction and tissue folding."

Mutants of the RLC phosphorylation sites in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian cells have been used to test the role of RLC phosphorylation and its upstream regulation by signal transduction pathways in controlling myosin\u2019s activity and spatial distribution. Mutation of both Threonine-20 and Serine-21 to Alanines results in a myosin with properties similar to that of unphosphorylated mammalian myosin; the ATPase activity is low, there is no detectable movement of actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay and the myosin does not form filaments in the presence of ATP. In contrast and consistent with interpretations of past in vitro studies of smooth muscle myosin, we systematically show that substitution of phosphorylation sites of <i>Drosophila</i> RLC with negatively charged residues (RLC-AE and RLC-EE) does not fully mimic the effects of phosphorylation of Serine-21 and Threonine-20 with respect to both the enzymatic and motile properties of the myosin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bresnick et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Espinoza-Fonseca et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kamisoyama et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sweeney et al., 1994</a>). In addition, these mutants do not exhibit stable filament formation in vitro in the presence of ATP as occurs with phosphorylated wild type myosin. Furthermore these mutations would uncouple myosin activity from regulation by upstream kinases in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</a>). The constitutive activity of these so-called phosphomimetic mutants was significantly lower than that of phosphorylated RLC-TS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), demonstrating that acidic residues are not sufficient to mimic the effect of phosphate moieties on Threonine-20 or Serine-21 of the RLC. This inadequacy is most likely due to substantial chemical differences between the phosphorylated amino acid side chain and the surrogate side chain, including size and formal charge at physiological pH. Reasons for the inability of negatively charged amino acids to recapitulate the phosphorylated RLC state include an allosteric communication pathway that involves the RLC, the ELC and the myosin motor domain and structurally requires the presence of a phosphate moiety (<a href=\"#bib13\">Espinoza-Fonseca et al., 2014</a>). The results from the Glutamate replacements (RLC-AE and RLC-EE) in the current study together with results from recent molecular dynamic simulation study (<a href=\"#bib13\">Espinoza-Fonseca et al., 2014</a>) lead us to hypothesize that mutant RLCs in which Aspartate is used as a replacement to mimic phosphorylation would also fail to faithfully mimic the phosphorylated RLC state (<a href=\"#bib13\">Espinoza-Fonseca et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kamisoyama et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tang et al., 2011</a>). Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data strongly suggests that caution should be used when interpreting the phenotype of so-called phosphomimetic RLC mutants in <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian systems."

Drosophila</i> myosin is insensitive to the pharmacological inhibitor blebbistatin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heissler et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Straight et al., 2003</a>) and, until now, biochemically defined myosin mutants were unavailable. The <i>RLC-AS</i> mutant exhibited the smallest decrease in ATP hydrolysis rate at intermediate actin concentrations and also exhibited a marginal decrease in the in vivo constriction rate. The phosphorylation conditions of our in vitro biochemical experiments should result in phosphorylation primarily or exclusively at Serine-21. The results of our paper show that although Serine-21 is clearly the primary phosphorylation site, phosphorylation at Threonine-20 alone results in reduced actin-activated ATPase activity and a slower rate of actin filament sliding. Substituting an Alanine for Threonine-20 lowered the rate of actin filament sliding and had lower ATPase activity if assayed at low actin concentrations since the K<sub>app</sub> for this mutant was higher than for RLC-TS. This mutation (<i>RLC-AS</i>), when made in vivo also resulted in a reduced apical constriction rate, consistent with motor activity driving constriction. The <i>RLC-TA</i> mutant exhibited an intermediate defect in both in vitro and measured in vivo activities. Finally, the <i>RLC-AE</i> mutant had the most severe defect in the ATP hydrolysis rate and correspondingly had the most significant defect in constriction rate and tissue folding. Past work has suggested that <i>RLC-EE</i> can promote contraction (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aldaz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Escudero et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>). However, this result is only obtained when the <i>RLC-EE</i> is expressed in a background where wild-type <i>RLC-TS</i> is also present. Myosin molecules can form mixed filaments (i.e. hetero-oligomers) with other myosins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beach et al., 2014</a>). Thus, <i>RLC-EE</i> is likely forming mixed filaments with phosphorylated wild-type <i>RLC-TS</i> and recruiting the entire complex to an abnormal location to result in the excessive constriction. Importantly, <i>RLC-EE</i> is incapable of contraction without ROCK (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Munjal et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasquez et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that the wild-type phosphorylatable <i>RLC</i> is responsible for excessive cellular contraction in these experiments. Importantly, our in vitro motility assay results demonstrate that the phosphomutants RLC-AA, RLC-AE, and RLC-EE are clearly not mimicking phosphorylation, but can still bind F-actin. This is important because it suggests that these mutants can function as cross-linkers, if they oligomerize, but translocate actin more slowly when compared with the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated RLC-TS. In summary, motor activity scaled with in vivo contractile activity. Given this relationship, we propose that myosin motor activity determines the contraction rate during apical constriction and tissue folding. In the future, it will be important to determine whether other properties of myosin, like actin crosslinking, serve other roles during tissue morphogenesis."

The conditions favor phosphorylation of both Threonine-20 and Serine-21 on RLC-TS whereas shorter incubation times favor phosphorylation of only Serine-21. MLCK was omitted for the unphosphorylated controls. A volume of 5\u20138 \u00b5l of the proteins was injected into a reverse phase HPLC (Agilent 1100 series HPLC, Agilent Technologies) with a Zorbax 300 SB-C18 (2.1\u00d750 mm, 3.5\u00a0M, Agilent Technologies) and introduced into the mass spectrometer as described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Apffel et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Taggart et al., 2000</a>).

Segmented cell membranes were\u00a0~1 \u00b5m below the myosin signal. Embryos were aligned in time using the mean apical area signals of each embryo and choosing the time when the tissue begins to constrict. The myosin signal was pre-processed to remove cytoplasmic myosin by only using the maximum intensity z-projection for the two highest myosin intensity values that were greater than 2.5 standard deviations above the mean cytoplasmic myosin intensity. A Gaussian filter (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.5) was applied to this signal. To identify instances of rapid cellular constriction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), we first smoothed signals for apical area and mean myosin intensity and calculated instantaneous rates for each time point. Instances of rapid myosin intensity increases were identified as instances where the myosin accumulation rate was between one and two standard deviations above the mean rate for all control cells (<i>RLC-TS</i>). The constriction rate was calculated at these instances. To identify the amount of time it took the mean apical area of an embryo to decrease to 50% its starting area, we first aligned the mean apical areas of the embryos to each other by matching when the mean area starts to decrease. The initial apical area (A<sub>0</sub>) is defined as the mean area 2 min before this rapid decrease, 0 min in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> for all representative embryos. We then determined the amount of time it took for the mean apical area to decrease to 50% of A<sub>0</sub>."

These discrepancies don't really fit with the idea of an allelic series of motor activities.

In the images shown here (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, B</a>), it seems that the fluorescence levels are saturated in the case of RLC-TA and RLC-AE. The authors could compare images with lower intensity levels. Also, the RLC-AE embryo seems to be at a different stage than the others (the cells at the left of the ventral furrow look very much stretched). Because the authors are measuring the fluorescence intensity levels from maximum intensity projections (of how many slices?), I wonder whether changes in the apico-basal localization of Myosin could be interfering with the fluorescence intensity measurement. Showing the fluorescence intensity per cell at the apical cortex could support their observations."

To show that the mechanical properties do not change, they do a power-law fit and find no differences between the phosphomutants and the wild-type. However, the maximal displacement looks different between RLC-TA and RLC-AE, with RLC-TA showing a similar maximal displacement to the wild-type. This would suggest that the stiffness could be changing in the RLC-AE. The authors could look at the time decay constant, which represents the ratio of viscosity to stiffness, and also analyse whether there are significant differences in the maximal displacement. This would shed light into whether the mechanical properties of the cells and tissue are changing in the phosphomutants, since this could also be an explanation of the lower cell and tissue constriction rate."

Previously, the authors have shown that RLC-AE embryos do complete tissue invagination (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in Vasquez et al., 2014), so it would be good to quantify the rate of tissue invagination, and to have an idea of the variability between embryos of the same genotype."

In the images shown here (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, B</a>), it seems that the fluorescence levels are saturated in the case of RLC-TA and RLC-AE. The authors could compare images with lower intensity levels. Also, the RLC-AE embryo seems to be at a different stage than the others (the cells at the left of the ventral furrow look very much stretched). Because the authors are measuring the fluorescence intensity levels from maximum intensity projections (of how many slices?), I wonder whether changes in the apico-basal localization of Myosin could be interfering with the fluorescence intensity measurement. Showing the fluorescence intensity per cell at the apical cortex could support their observations.</i> "

In addition, myosin molecules can form mixed filaments (i.e. hetero-oligomers) with other myosins (Beach et al., Curr Biol, 2014). Thus, overexpression of <i>sqhEE</i> is likely to form mixed filaments with phosphorylated wild-type <i>sqh</i> (for evidence for this, see Vasquez et al., JCB, 2014)and result in more wild-type myosins being polymerized into bipolar filaments. Because <i>sqhEE</i> is incapable of contraction without Rho Kinase (Vasquez et al., JCB, 2014; Kasza et al., PNAS,2014) it is the wild-type phosphorylatable <i>sqh</i> that is most likely promoting the excessive contractile activity."
