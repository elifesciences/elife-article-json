Here we show that Thrombospondin-4 (Thbs4) regulates skeletal muscle integrity and its susceptibility to muscular dystrophy through organization of membrane attachment complexes. Loss of the <i>Thbs4</i> gene causes spontaneous dystrophic changes with aging and accelerates disease in 2 mouse models of muscular dystrophy, while overexpression of mouse Thbs4 is protective and mitigates dystrophic disease. In the myofiber, Thbs4 selectively enhances vesicular trafficking of dystrophin-glycoprotein and integrin attachment complexes to stabilize the sarcolemma. In agreement, muscle-specific overexpression of <i>Drosophila</i> Tsp or mouse Thbs4 rescues a <i>Drosophila</i> model of muscular dystrophy with augmented membrane residence of \u03b2PS integrin. This functional conservation emphasizes the fundamental importance of Thbs\u2019 as regulators of cellular attachment and membrane stability and identifies Thbs4 as a potential therapeutic target for muscular dystrophy."

Here we show that Thrombospondin-4 (Thbs4) regulates skeletal muscle integrity and its susceptibility to muscular dystrophy through organization of membrane attachment complexes. Loss of the <i>Thbs4</i> gene causes spontaneous dystrophic changes with aging and accelerates disease in 2 mouse models of muscular dystrophy, while overexpression of mouse Thbs4 is protective and mitigates dystrophic disease. In the myofiber, Thbs4 selectively enhances vesicular trafficking of dystrophin-glycoprotein and integrin attachment complexes to stabilize the sarcolemma. In agreement, muscle-specific overexpression of <i>Drosophila</i> Tsp or mouse Thbs4 rescues a <i>Drosophila</i> model of muscular dystrophy with augmented membrane residence of \u03b2PS integrin. This functional conservation emphasizes the fundamental importance of Thbs\u2019 as regulators of cellular attachment and membrane stability and identifies Thbs4 as a potential therapeutic target for muscular dystrophy."

As a result, the cell surface membrane that surrounds myofibers is more strongly anchored to its surroundings than that of other cells. Muscular dystrophies are a group of muscle-wasting disorders that usually arise when this surface membrane becomes less stable. For example, mutations that affect a protein called dystrophin-glycoprotein or integrin protein complexes can cause muscular dystrophy since these proteins normally keep the membrane anchored and stable when the muscle contracts and relaxes."

This worsened the muscle wasting in the mutant mice, and furthermore, deleting the gene for thrombospondin-4 also caused otherwise normal mice to develop muscular dystrophy in their old age. Conversely, when Vanhoutte et al. artificially increased the levels of thrombospondin-4 in the myofibers, it protected the mice against muscular dystrophy. Additional experiments conducted in fruit flies demonstrated that the protective effects of thrombospondin are conserved or similar in insects too. Lastly, biochemical experiments in mouse and rat cells showed that thrombospondin-4 aids dystrophin-glycoproteins and integrins in getting to the cell surface membrane, increasing its stability."

In addition, proper post-translational processing and trafficking of these complexes to the sarcolemma are essential to form\u00a0a molecular attachment network between the myofilament proteins within the myofibers and the basal lamina and extracellular matrix (ECM) outside the cell (<a href=\"#bib27\">Goddeeris et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xu et al., 2009</a>).

The thrombospondin family consists of two subgroups based on their sequence conservation and oligomeric structure. Thbs3, Thbs4 and Thbs5 form pentamers and are the most similar to Thbs genes found in lower organisms (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Lawler, 2011</a>).

For example, Thbs4 was recently shown to have a critical cardioprotective function from within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it mediates an adaptive ER stress response (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brody et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>). The traditional ER stress response involves sensing of calcium and unfolded or damaged proteins within the ER through the calcium binding chaperone protein BiP (GRP78), which binds/regulates at least 3 distinct stress response pathways initiated by either PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), each resident within the ER membrane (<a href=\"#bib26\">Glembotski, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mori, 2009</a>). These 3 ER stress response mediators initiate a cascade of signaling that alters protein synthesis and other features of cellular adaptation to stress or protein unfolding and aggregation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Glembotski, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mori, 2009</a>). Here, Thbs4 directly binds the ER luminal domain of ATF6\u03b1 to promote its shuttling to the Golgi and then nucleus, thereby inducing genes underlying adaptive aspects of the ER stress response (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brody et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>)."

Thbs proteins are also recycled back into the cell through the low-density receptor-related protein (LRP) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2004</a>). One critical feature of the Thbs family is that each member is induced following injury events or in response to processes requiring tissue growth, healing and remodeling. Interestingly, Thbs4 is largely restricted to cardiac and skeletal muscle where its expression is induced with injury or disease (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Lawler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Frolova et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hauser et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Schellings et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">S\u00f6dersten et al., 2006</a>).

High levels of Thbs4 protein overexpression were observed in fast-twitch containing muscles such as the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, with intermediate levels in the diaphragm and very low levels in the soleus, while the heart lacked expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Tissue Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that Thbs4 protein was undetectable in uninjured skeletal muscle while the transgene produced abundant expression that co-localized with calreticulin to a vesicular network on the periphery of the myofibers of paraffin-embedded quadriceps and was also clearly inside of collagen I staining that marks the ECM of cryo-embedded quadriceps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Furthermore, although Thbs4 protein localization appeared slightly different between paraffin- and cryo-embedded skeletal muscle of the <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse, induction of endogenous Thbs4 again showed localization within the vesicular network inside the myofibers, and only within limited regions outside of myofibers where fibrotic tissue deposition was prominent\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Interestingly, in-depth in vitro\u00a0analysis demonstrated that extracellular Thbs4 is rapidly internalized by both cultured C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes and at least in the case of myoblasts is transported to rab7-positive late endosomes, potentially explaining why Thbs4 protein is low or undectable in the ECM of healthy Thbs4 Tg muscles (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Similar to the results observed with collagen I, co-labeling with another ECM/matricellular protein periostin again showed that Thbs4 could co-localize to the ECM region in <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></i> diseased myofibers, although under non-diseased conditions overexpressed Thbs4 was again only appreciably observed intracellularly under the sarcolemma within a peripheral vesicular pattern (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Hence, although our observations do not exclude the possibility that non-muscle cells might also express Thbs4, our data collectively identify the myofiber as an important cellular source of Thbs4 expression, secretion and re-uptake."

Remarkably, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold detection revealed that Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle caused a dramatic induction of sub-sarcolemmal and intramyofibrillar ER and post-ER vesicles that contained Thbs4 protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>).

Littermates injected with an eGFP expressing AAV9 were used as a control.

Remarkably, overexpression of Thbs4 significantly protected against lengthening-contraction injuries over all 3 bouts compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As anticipated, the TA from <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice showed much greater loss of functional recovery compared to WT after lengthening-contraction injury, but the presence of the Thbs4 Tg provided significant protection, achieving a recovery response now similar to WT levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Moreover, loss of Thbs4 resulted in greater injury with all 3 cycles of lengthening-contraction injury, similar to <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Interestingly, the passive force of the muscle after simple stretching was greater with the Thbs4 Tg, while it was reduced in <i>Thbs4<sup>-/-</sup></i> muscle, although the twitch force itself was not significantly different between any of the groups (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

Two important clues that directed our investigation were the known augmentation in the adaptive ER stress response pathway and the dramatic increase in sub-sarcolemmal vesicles observed in skeletal muscle with Thbs4 overexpression. Hence, we instituted two in vitro assays to assess ER-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-sarcolemma vesicular trafficking in response to Thbs4 activity in primary neonatal rat ventricular\u00a0myocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, technical issues prevented such studies in myotubes or myofibers). To assess ER-to-Golgi trafficking a red fluorescent protein (RFP)-labeled Golgi resident enzyme, GalNacT2-RFP, was used\u00a0with and without Thbs4 overexpression by fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In parallel, ATF6\u03b1 activity was also modulated since Thbs4 is known to directly regulate this ER-stress transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brody et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>). Here, Thbs4 overexpression significantly accelerated ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking, which was fully inhibited by co-overexpression of a dominant negative (dn) ATF6\u03b1 construct (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Similarly, Golgi-to-sarcolemmal trafficking rates, measured with VSVG-enhanced green floursecent protein (eGFP) after inverse (i) FRAP, were significantly accelerated upon Thbs4 overexpression, which was again inhibited with ATF6\u03b1-dn (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, accelerated trafficking with Thbs4 was mimicked by overexpression of a constitutively nuclear (cn) ATF6\u03b1 construct (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>)."

Like Thbs4, Nell2 contains an N-terminal laminin-G like (LamG) domain and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat domain but lacks the ATF6\u03b1 interacting Type III repeat (T3R) and TSP-C domains from Thbs4. Importantly, unlike full-length Thbs4, overexpression of Nell2 or the LamG domain of Thbs4 did not increase ER-to-Golgi or post-Golgi trafficking rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F,I,J</a>). However, overexpression of just the T3R domain of Thbs4, which functions as the ATF6\u03b1 interacting region, was sufficient to accelerate ER to Golgi and post-Golgi trafficking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle also augmented the levels of trafficking regulatory proteins such as Sar1, Rab24, Rab6, Rab3 and Rab8, which control ER-to-Golgi and post-Golgi vesicular trafficking (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Stenmark, 2009</a>).

Interestingly, Thbs4 Tg alone displayed increased sarcolemmal levels of \u03b2-dystroglycan, dystrophin and \u03b21D-integrin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). More importantly, the Thbs4 Tg in the <i>Sgcd</i> deficient background resulted in greater membrane localization of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-sarcoglycan and \u03b2-dystroglycan, as well as in dystrophin, utrophin and \u03b21D-integrin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). More quantitative assessment of this effect by Western blotting of membrane-specific protein extracts showed that even the Thbs4 Tg alone gave increased membrane levels of utrophin, \u03b1- and \u03b2-dystroglycan, as well as \u03b21D-, \u03b17 and \u03b15-integrins compared to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; red boxes), which likely explains our earlier observations whereby Thbs4 Tg skeletal muscle was protected from lengthening-contraction injury and laser injury in isolated myofibers versus WT. The Thbs4 Tg also augmented the membrane residency of these same proteins in the <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>mdx</i> background, as well as increased membrane levels of \u03b1-sarcoglycan and \u03b2-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle of <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure\u00a06\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, for replicate samples). Importantly, previous work has shown that overexpression of DGC components augment the assembly of the entire complex and are inherently protective to MD (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allikian et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Grounds et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gumerson and Michele, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tinsley et al., 1998</a>). Furthermore, we observed that expression of \u03b21- and \u03b17-integrin from total cytoplasmic protein extracts was not increased, suggesting that Thbs4 overexpression directly augmented membrane trafficking and localization of these critical attachment proteins to the surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, lower panel). Finally, we also observed that loss of Thbs4 in skeletal muscle partially reduced membrane residency of \u03b1- and \u03b2-dystroglycan, \u03b21D- and \u03b17-integrins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, burgundy boxes). Collectively, these observations solidify a mechanism whereby Thbs4 regulates membrane stability in skeletal muscle by augmenting the trafficking of membrane attachment protein complexes to the sarcolemma."

Indeed, ATF6\u03b1 was previously shown to expand the ER and post-ER vesicular compartment when activated or overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brody et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>). Thus, to directly test this hypothesis we generated skeletal muscle-specific Tg mice overexpressing ATF6\u03b1, which showed high levels of nuclear ATF6\u03b1 protein and induction of BiP, PDI and calreticulin as compared to WT levels, all without influencing Thbs4 protein expression levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, except for PDI we noted significantly higher levels of these ATF6\u03b1-dependent ER stress responsive factors in ATF6\u03b1 Tg quadriceps as compared to our Thbs4 Tg (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Similar to Thbs4 Tg mice, ultrastructural analysis of skeletal muscle from ATF6\u03b1 Tg mice showed a remarkable expansion of ER and the sub-sarcolemmal vesicular compartment, although these ATF6\u03b1-dependent vesicles appeared less dense in comparison to those observed in Thbs4 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> versus <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>)."

However, ATF6\u03b1 overexpression in the <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></i> or <i>mdx</i> dystrophic background provided no protection whatsoever (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013J</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). There was no reduction in histopathology or serum CK levels or membrane rupture as assessed with EBD, nor was treadmill running improved by the ATF6\u03b1 Tg in either the <i>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></i> or <i>mdx</i> backgrounds. More importantly, ATF6\u03b1 overexpression did not increase the sarcolemmal localization of any of the membrane attachment proteins observed with Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>). Thus, while ATF6\u03b1 overexpression activated an adaptive ER stress response in skeletal muscle with a dramatic induction of intracellular and sub-sarcolemmal vesicles to an even higher level than observed in our Thbs4 overexpressing mice, it did not augment the membrane residency of membrane stabilizing proteins in muscle. Hence, our data indicate that ATF6\u03b1 is only one part of a more integrated mechanism whereby Thbs4 regulates membrane stability of skeletal muscle."

To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a previously established adenoviral construct encoding a Thbs4 calcium-binding containing mutant that is retained in the ER (Ad-Thbs4-mCa<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brody et al., 2016</a>). Importantly, the mutant still induces an ATF6\u03b1 mediated ER-stress response, both in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and when expressed in the gastrocnemius muscle of early postnatal rat pups (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brody et al., 2016</a>). Utilizing an identical in vivo\u00a0approach with adenoviral gene transfer into the gastrocnemius of early neonatal rat pups, we compared \u03b2gal control with full-length Thbs4 versus the Thbs4-mCa<sup>2+</sup> for effects on \u03b21 Integrin membrane levels. The data showed that only the secretion competent full-length Thbs4, but not the full-length ER-retained Thbs4 mutant, promoted greater \u03b21 integrin membrane occupancy (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Moreover, Tsp in <i>Drosophila</i> was also shown to interact with \u03b1PS2/\u03b2PS integrin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chanana et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Subramanian et al., 2007</a>). Thus to investigate a potential conservation of Thbs4\u2019s function, we generated Tg <i>Drosophila</i> in which the mouse Thbs4 cDNA or the <i>Drosophila</i> Tsp cDNA were driven with a muscle-specific myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) regulatory region to achieve overexpression of either protein in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle. These lines were subsequently crossed with a <i>Drosophila</i> model of MD that lacks the \u03b4-sarcoglycan-like gene (Sgcd<sup>840</sup>), a line that is marked by muscle disease with shortened life-span, loss of muscle function and overt rupture of the muscles due to structural weakness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allikian et al., 2007</a>). Remarkably, both Thbs4 and Tsp rescued the reduced life span in the Sgcd<sup>840</sup> MD <i>Drosophila</i> line, and normalized muscle function as assessed with a negative geotaxis assay (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The rupture of the dorsal median indirect flight muscles and their loss of proper ectoskeletal attachment were also rescued by muscle-specific overexpression of either mouse Thbs4 or <i>Drosophila</i> Tsp (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

Here, we identify a fundamental yet previously unrecognized intracellular role for Thbs4 in skeletal muscle, where it directly augments selective vesicular trafficking and chaperones DGC and integrin attachment complexes to the membrane, leading to greater stability and levels of select complexes at the sarcolemma, and thereby enhancing the mechanical stability of the myofiber (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In fact, our findings identify Thbs4 as a crucial component to maintain muscle fiber integrity as loss of <i>Thbs4</i> results in sarcolemma weakness that causes spontaneous dystrophic changes with aging.

Thbs4 can then reside within the extracellular matrix (ECM) or be actively endocytosed and returned to the intracellular compartment by a recycling receptor. In addition to its established extracellular functions, combined studies in the heart and skeletal muscle now reveal that while in the ER, Thbs4 can compete with BiP (GRP78) for binding to the ER-resident transcription factor ATF6\u03b1, thereby facilitating ATF6\u03b1 translocation to the Golgi for processing and subsequent shuttling to the nucleus where it regulates expression of ER stress responsive genes that are also part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). ATF6\u03b1 induction in cardiac and skeletal muscle, or by overexpression in Tg mice (lower panel) causes a dramatic expansion of the ER and post-ER vesicles, as well as increased vesicular trafficking to the membrane. The ability of Thbs4 to induce ATF6\u03b1 processing and nuclear trafficking also causes this same ER expansion and augmentation of intracellular vesicular trafficking to the membrane. However, Thbs4 uniquely regulates trafficking of selected integrins and dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complexes (DGC) members to the sarcolemma, thereby enhancing the mechanical stability of the myofiber, such as observed in Thbs4 Tg muscle (middle panel)."

Interestingly, we observed that skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of Thbs4 did not result in accumulation within the ECM, but predominantly produced an intracellular protein localization pattern within the ER and post-ER vesicular network. In fact, we have also since generated cardiac-specific Tg mice overexpressing Thbs1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the heart ([<a href=\"#bib43\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>] and data not shown). In these hearts all five Thbs\u2019 reside mainly within the intracellular vesicular network and ER with only limited detectable protein accumulation outside cardiomyocytes. This is in dramatic contrast to the overexpression of an array of other matricellular proteins, such as periostin, which saturates the ECM when overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib50\">Oka et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, dystrophic skeletal muscle did reveal occasional Thbs4 protein accumulation in fibrotic regions around myofibers, confirming that this protein can reside for a period of time in the ECM. These dynamic localization differences at baseline versus during fibrotic disease could be attributed to Thbs recycling at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Lawler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2004</a>). Indeed, we observed rapid up take of recombinant Thbs4 when given exogenously to cultured C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes. It is possible that extracellular Thbs4 reuptake could occur through its designated receptor or through the integrin and DGC complexes. Indeed, other matricellular proteins such as SPARC were shown to be actively taken up back into myofibers through such a process with integrin associated endocytosis, sorting and recycling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chlenski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">De Franceschi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nakamura et al., 2014</a>)."

Importantly, although enhancement of the ATF6\u03b1-mediated adaptive ER stress pathway was sufficient to drive the dramatic expansion of the ER and post-ER vesicular content and increase vesicular trafficking to the membrane, it did not augment membrane residency of DGC and integrin attachment complexes at the sarcolemma, nor was it sufficient to protect against MD. Thus, ATF6\u03b1 is only part of a more complex intracellular mechanism whereby Thbs4 regulates mechanical stability of the muscle fiber and its sarcolemma, in coordination with greater vesicle formation and trafficking (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

In addition, vertebrate <i>Thbs1</i> and <i>Thbs2</i> genes have evolved domains that are tailored to affecting processes outside the cell, such as altering transforming growth factor-\u03b2 activity and the angiogenic response (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Lawler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bornstein, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carlson et al., 2008</a>). Hence, the simplest interpretation of our data and that reported in the literature is that Thbs proteins are complex, multifactorial proteins that function both inside and outside the cell. However, our working hypothesis is that Thbs4 appears more tailored to intracellular functionality in cardiac and skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), and this same paradigm appears to hold true for the other Thbs family members in other tissues. For example, Thbs1 was previously shown to localize to the intracellular side of membrane attachment sites by immunogold-electron microscopy in endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hiscott et al., 1997</a>). Furthermore, Thbs proteins are known to strongly interact with many different integrin heterodimers, and singular proteomic analysis of the \u03b15\u03b21 integrin complex identified Thbs2 as a core element of its 'interactome' (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Lawler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bouvard et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">De Franceschi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Plow et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schiller et al., 2013</a>). Our ultrastructural and biochemical analyses showed that the Thbs-integrin complex resides within the lumen of vesicles. Although further, in-depth analyses will suggest whether Thbs4 co-regulates the signaling competence of this integrin complex and the exact preassembly stage that is influenced by Thbs4 on the way to the cell surface. Finally, Thbs1 silencing or overexpression in human cancer cells was shown to decrease or enhance integrin protein levels, respectively, in the intracellular and plasma membrane compartment and thereby modulate cellular adhesion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Duquette et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">John et al., 2010</a>)."

Importantly, this observation holds true in both mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> skeletal muscle where integrin protein content at the cell membrane was increased with Thbs4 overexpression, yet very little Thbs protein was observed outside the cell in either species at baseline. While previously published data showed a large concentration of <i>Drosophila</i> Tsp protein to the myotendinous junction in stage 16 embryos, this is also the very same region where the integrins are highly concentrated in identical foci and the data do not distinguish if Tsp in inside or outside the cell (<a href=\"#bib61\">Subramanian et al., 2007</a>). At earlier embryonic stages (stage 12\u201313) however, the Tsp protein is intracellular with a diffuse pattern similar to that of integrins that have yet to be deposited at the cell membrane (<a href=\"#bib61\">Subramanian et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, in later stage <i>Drosophila</i> larvae Tsp is no longer detected in the myotendinous junctions or in tendons. Rather, a network of Tsp positive staining is observed within the muscle of larvae (<i>unpublished observations</i>, Talila Volk). However, in mammals Thbs4 can oligomerize with Thbs5 and be deposited in the tendon (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hauser et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">S\u00f6dersten et al., 2006</a>), loss of <i>Thbs4<sup>-/-</sup></i> in mice showed altered ECM composition and weakened muscle-tendons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Frolova et al., 2014</a>), and altered inflammatory responses associated with arteriogenesis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Frolova et al., 2010</a>), whereas Thbs1 and Thbs2 were shown to function from outside the cell in augmenting developmental synaptogenesis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Christopherson et al., 2005</a>).

Thus, the ability of Thbs proteins to activate ATF6\u03b1 to augment ER protein production and secretory pathway activity is a later evolutionary adaptation beyond just stabilizing membrane attachment complexes, which in higher organisms more effectively coordinates tissue remodeling and healing through the Thbs proteins."

This new model for Thbs protein function has many disease ramifications, especially in skeletal muscle, a tissue that is highly sensitive to mutations in genes that cause weaknesses in cellular attachment and membrane stability. Indeed, there is a lack of therapeutic strategies to effectively treat MD and our study suggests that this protein may provide a universal approach to strengthen the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle if employed in a gene therapy approach. Importantly, this protein is already present in muscle and it would not be perceived as a neo-antigen by viral-mediated overexpression, hence it should be well tolerated and best used in patients where the genetic basis of their MD disease is due to a loss of structural support of the sarcolemma (majority of cases)."

A midline incision running from the ankle to the thigh was created and the skin and fascia was gently removed leaving the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle exposed. The leg was immobilized by securing it in a custom jig (Aurora Scientific) with thumbscrews at the distal femur. A 4\u20130 nylon suture was tied to the distal TA securing it with a small plastic ring at the muscle tendon junction. The distal tendon was transected and the TA elevated to remove its contact with the tibia, and the muscle was mounted to a servomotor (Aurora Scientific, 305C) using the plastic ring. Two intramuscular electrodes were placed on either side of the peroneal nerve and stimulation voltages and optimal muscle length (L<sub>0</sub>) were determined and then adjusted to produce maximal isometric force (P<sub>0</sub>) at a stimulation frequency of 200\u2009Hz. Five consecutive isometric contractions were averaged as a measure of the maximal specific tension. An additional lengthening contraction injury protocol was added in which an isometric contraction was performed to determine baseline force generation, followed by 2 consecutive 20% L<sub>0</sub> lengthening contractions, and finally another isometric contraction performed at L<sub>0.</sub> The force deficit was calculated between the first isometric contraction and those following the lengthening injury cycles (See <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> for schematic representation). This contraction injury protocol was repeated 2 more times and the force deficit was calculated relative to the pre-injury isometric contraction. In a subset of experiments passive tension was measured prior to the lengthening contraction protocol. Here the TA was set to L<sub>0</sub> and passively stretched to 5, 10, 15, and 20% of L<sub>0</sub>. Each stretch was held for 2 min before the length was returned to its starting position. Maximal passive tension was recorded at the peak of the stretch. A 2-min rest period occurred between each contraction for all experiments and force values were normalized to the muscle\u2019s physiologic cross-sectional area. In some cases we observed tendon breaks during the lengthening contraction protocol. Percentage of tendon breaks, assessed by complete physical rupture of the tendon at the muscle aponeurosis, was recorded."

The sections were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C (Thbs4: Santa Cruz, Sc-7657-R, 1:50 dilution in PBTB; Tsp, 1/50 [<a href=\"#bib61\">Subramanian et al., 2007</a>]; calreticulin: Abcam, ab2907; 1:100 dilution in PBTB), rinsed with PBT and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor-488, Invitrogen; 1:400 in PBTB) for 2\u2009hr at RT along with counterstains. Counterstains included membrane marker WGA conjugated to Alexa Fluor-647 (Invitrogen, W32466; 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Far Red) and/or a nuclear marker DAPI (Invitrogen, D3571; 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml in H<sub>2</sub>O). For <i>Drosophila</i> integrin subunit \u03b2PS immunostaining, cryosections were post-fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10\u2009min, washed in PBT, blocked for one hour at room temperature with PBTB and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C (DSHB: CF.6G11; 1:50 in PBTB). Then, tissue was then washed in PBS and subsequently incubated with rabbit-anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor-488 (1:300 in PBTB; Invitrogen) for 2\u2009hr. For each immunostain, consecutive sections were incubated with secondary antibodies alone as a control for specificity (not shown). Images were obtained using a Nikon A1 confocal laser microscope system equipped with 40x H<sub>2</sub>O immersion objective (NA =\u00a01.1) and NIS Elements Advanced Research (AR) microscope imaging software (Nikon Instruments Inc.)."

WT muscle fibers do not show any intracellular Thbs4 staining or localization to vesicles suggesting that the intracellular role and protective effects may only occur with Thbs4 overexpression. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, staining for Thbs4 in wildtype muscle is not apparent, and it is impossible to tell if the protein is exclusively intracellular or not in Thbs4-Tg or <i>Scgd<sup>-/-</sup></i>, contrary to comments in the text (subsection \u201cThbs4 augments adaptive ER stress signaling in skeletal muscle and mitigates MD\u201d, second paragraph). Likewise, co-IPs with Thbs4 and \u03b21D-Itg only detect Thbs4/\u03b21D-Itg complexes within vesicles with Thbs4-Tg overexpression, not in WT (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). As such, the manuscript over-interprets results that are based solely on Thbs4 overexpression, and does not acknowledge that these may not apply to normal muscles. The authors should add additional evidence supporting their interpretations, or, if not possible, they should tone down their conclusions and present their discussion in a more balanced manner to highlight this consideration."

While the intracellular role reported here is interesting and potentially therapeutic, the ECM localization and functions of Thbs have been well established through numerous meticulous studies. This should be acknowledged and the results here presented more accurately as a novel mechanism for ECM proteins inside the cell. The last sentence of the first paragraph in the Discussion, \"a growing body of data uniformly suggests that Thbs proteins are not dedicated matricellular or ECM proteins\" overstates the case and should be removed. The second paragraph of the Discussion cites a selected set of references without acknowledging many additional papers convincingly showing Thbs4 and other Thbs in ECM (Hauser et al., 1995; Frolova et al. 1995; 2010; 2012; 2014; Christopherson et al., 2005; Sodersten and Ekman, 2006).

Are they secreted outside where Thbs4 can localize to the ECM? Is Thbs4 secretion essential for its intracellular functions? Also, if Thbs4 is actively recycled as suggested, then ectopic Thbs4 injected into the ECM should be actively internalized. This should be easily tested."

The protective role appears to be specific to Thbs4's interaction with ATF-6. However, ATF-6 levels are not limiting since increasing Thbs4 expression alone can rescue and protect wild-type cells. The early part of the manuscript appears to argue for an important role for ATF6\u03b1 in Thbs4's functions but data in the latter half of the paper do not support this idea so strongly. Ultimately, the authors conclude that the situation is \"complex\", and while this is undoubtedly true, and they should be congratulated for including the full complement of their data, even if it cannot be easily explained, the paper would benefit from a more extensive discussion about this and inclusion of possible models that could explain the complexity of the data available thus far. Related to this, a comparison of Thbs4 levels in non-transgenic mice, Thbs4 overexpressors and ATF6\u03b1 overexpressors could be informative, as the results may reflect a dosage effect for Thbs4."

ATF6 Tg, as well as a Thbs4 mutant unable to interact with ATF6, both fail to rescue. The authors interpret these and other experiments (e.g. Thbs4-mCa) to mean that the Thbs4 mutant cannot be secreted and is retained in vesicles or in their words that \"only the fully membrane-trafficked and secretion competent Thbs4, but not the ER-retained mutant, promoted greater \u03921-Itg membrane occupancy\" (Response to Reviewers). This would suggest that Thbs4 must be secreted to rescue, potentially supporting an extracellular protective role rather than intracellular.

However, it does induce an ATF6\u03b1 mediated ER-stress, both in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and when expressed in the gastrocnemius muscle of early postnatal rat pups (Brody et al., 2016). Utilizing an identical in vivoapproach with adenoviral gene transfer into the gastrocnemius of early neonatal rat pups, we compared full-length Thbs4 versus the Thbs4-mCa<sup>2</sup> for effects on \u03b21-Itg membrane levels, as compared to \u03b2gal control infection.

To directly test this, we now performed comparative immunoblot analysis and semi-quantitative analysis of these events (See <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We now show that skeletal muscle-specific Tg mice overexpressing ATF6\u03b1 display high levels of nuclear ATF6\u03b1 protein and induction of BiP, PDI and calreticulin compared to WT mice, all without influencing Thbs4 protein expression levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Taken together, this indicates that Thbs4-induced ATF6\u03b1 dependent ER stress itself is not sufficient to produce the membrane stabilizing effect we observed in the Thbs4 Tg mice, even when induced at higher levels than those observed in the Thbs4 Tg itself. However, that Thbs4 itself and its trafficking through the secretory pathway plays a pivotal role in the membrane stabilizing effect of Thbs4 is now better supported in our revised manuscript as discussed above in point #3, where we discuss how Thbs4 must indeed move through the secretory pathway to the membrane to chaperone at least \u03b21 (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Overexpression of Thbs4 with the Thbs4 Tg rescues mdx and a-Sgcd mutants, and this requires Thbs4's interaction with ATF6. ATF6 Tg, as well as a Thbs4 mutant unable to interact with ATF6, both fail to rescue. The authors interpret these and other experiments (e.g. Thbs4-mCa) to mean that the Thbs4 mutant cannot be secreted and is retained in vesicles or in their words that \"only the fully membrane-trafficked and secretion competent Thbs4, but not the ER-retained mutant, promoted greater \u03921-Itg membrane occupancy\" (Response to Reviewers). This would suggest that Thbs4 must be secreted to rescue, potentially supporting an extracellular protective role rather than intracellular. Instead, their interpretation is that it \"selectively enhances vesicular trafficking of dystrophin-glycoprotein and Itg attachment complexes to the sarcolemma\" or, as stated in the title, that it \"mediates an intracellular vesicular attachment network that stabilizes muscle membranes\".
