                    "text": "Cytosolic Ric-8A has guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and is a chaperone for several classes of heterotrimeric G protein \u03b1 subunits in vertebrates. Using Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange-Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) we show that Ric-8A disrupts the secondary structure of the G\u03b1 Ras-like domain that girds the guanine nucleotide-binding site, and destabilizes the interface between the G\u03b1i1 Ras and helical domains, allowing domain separation and nucleotide release. These changes are largely reversed upon binding GTP and dissociation of Ric-8A. HDX-MS identifies a potential G\u03b1 interaction site in Ric-8A. Alanine scanning reveals residues crucial for GEF activity within that sequence. HDX confirms that, like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Ric-8A binds the C-terminus of G\u03b1. In contrast to GPCRs, Ric-8A interacts with Switches I and II of G\u03b1 and possibly at the G\u03b1 domain interface. These extensive interactions provide both allosteric and direct catalysis of GDP unbinding and release and GTP binding."

Using Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange-Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) we show that Ric-8A disrupts the secondary structure of the G\u03b1 Ras-like domain that girds the guanine nucleotide-binding site, and destabilizes the interface between the G\u03b1i1 Ras and helical domains, allowing domain separation and nucleotide release. These changes are largely reversed upon binding GTP and dissociation of Ric-8A. HDX-MS identifies a potential G\u03b1 interaction site in Ric-8A. Alanine scanning reveals residues crucial for GEF activity within that sequence. HDX confirms that, like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Ric-8A binds the C-terminus of G\u03b1. In contrast to GPCRs, Ric-8A interacts with Switches I and II of G\u03b1 and possibly at the G\u03b1 domain interface. These extensive interactions provide both allosteric and direct catalysis of GDP unbinding and release and GTP binding."

In that capacity, Ric-8A is the best characterized of the family of cytosolic proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) activity at G\u03b1 subunits. Unlike G protein-coupled receptors, which act upon heterotrimeric complexes of G\u03b1 and G protein beta-gamma heterodimers (G\u03b2\u03b3), Ric-8A acts exclusively at GDP-bound G\u03b1. GEF activity is unidirectional; Ric-8A does not interact with G\u03b1\u2022GTP, nor does the G\u03b1\u2022Ric-8A complex dissociate in the presence of GDP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tall et al., 2003</a>). Ric-8A is structurally unrelated to GPCRs. The circular dichroic spectrum of mammalian Ric-8A indicates that it is a predominantly alpha-helical protein (<a href=\"#bib15\">Figueroa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thomas et al., 2011</a>) and amino acid sequence analysis suggests that Ric-8A adopts an armadillo-repeat fold similar to that of \u03b2-catenin and its structural analogs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Figueroa et al., 2009</a>). Among the latter are nuclear import proteins that are regulated by the Ras family G protein Ran (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vetter et al., 1999</a>), and smgGDS, a GEF for certain Rho-family G proteins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hamel et al., 2011</a>)."

There is no direct evidence that Ric-8A is a physiological GEF. However the observation of Ric-8A-enhanced G\u03b2\u03b3-dependent signaling after peptide-induced disruption of G protein heterotrimers is consistent with in vivo GEF activity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malik et al., 2005</a>), as is its presence in the mitotic spindle-associated complexes described above."

Characteristic of the superfamily, G\u03b1 bear polypeptide segments called Switch I and Switch II that flank the GTP binding site. These segments are observed to undergo conformational transitions upon GTP hydrolysis that are typically coupled to the loss of affinity for effectors and an increase in affinity for G\u03b2\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lambright et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mixon et al., 1995</a>). Other characteristic structural features are a P-loop that encompasses the \u03b1 and \u03b2 phosphates of the guanine nucleotide and two loop segments that form conserved contacts with the purine ring (<a href=\"#bib36\">Noel et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Coleman et al., 1994</a>). G\u03b1 subunits are also distinctive among Ras superfamily members in the insertion of a\u00a0~110 residue alpha helical domain at the N-terminus of Switch I. The helical domain blocks egress of nucleotide from the Ras domain. G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR), as exemplified by the complex of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (\u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR) with the Gs heterotrimer, grasp the C-terminus of G\u03b1 and the N-terminus of its \u03b21 strand.

At near neutral pH, in the seconds-to-hours time regime, continuous exchange experiments report HDX from peptide amide groups. HDX is suppressed by involvement of backbone amide hydrogen atoms in hydrogen bonds, but enhanced when such interactions are broken and amide groups become accessible to solvent. Further, protein \u2018breathing\u2019 motions that expose amide protons to solvent result in a steady increase in HDX over time (<a href=\"#bib13\">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Englander and Kallenbach, 1983</a>). Protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions may induce changes in amide solvent accessibility, protein flexibility and hydrogen bonding, and these are manifest in changes in HDX processes. Here, we show that in the complex with Ric-8A, the peptide amide hydrogen atoms of nucleotide-free G\u03b1i1 become accessible to exchange, not only in amino acids that contact the nucleotide, but also in the scaffold of secondary structure elements that encompass and support the nucleotide-binding site. The direction of these changes is essentially the reverse of those observed in the transition from G\u03b1i1\u2022GDP to G\u03b1i1 bound to Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the slowly hydrolysable GTP analog GTP\u03b3S, although greater in magnitude. Moreover, HDX measurements reveal a potential G\u03b1 binding site in Ric-8A, which we show by mutagenesis, contributes substantially to Ric-8A GEF activity."

Ric-8A binding and GDP release result in structural changes manifested by up to a 40% increase in deuteration (deprotection) of some peptides and a decrease in deuteration exceeding 25% (protection) in others. In contrast, Ric-8A binding does not induce striking changes in slow protein dynamics (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) as measured by the slope of HDX with time. Most of the peptide segments that directly contact the nucleotide-binding scaffold of G\u03b1i1 are deprotected in the Ric-8A-bound state. The P-loop, which enfolds the \u03b1 and \u03b2 phosphates of bound guanine nucleotides, and the \u03b25-\u03b1G loop, which harbors the NPXY motif that determines guanine- specificity at the purine binding sub-site, show high levels of deprotection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4a</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Backbone amide deprotection extends to the \u03b1-helical (\u03b1G and a segment of \u03b14) and \u03b2-sheet scaffolds (\u03b21, \u03b24 and \u03b25) that support these nucleotide-contacting regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

Increased deuteration of these segments indicates that this main-chain hydrogen bonding network is destablized in the G\u03b1i1:Ric-8A complex. van der Waals interactions within the cluster could in turn be disrupted, resulting in the loss of tertiary structural integrity of the nucleotide-binding site and the surrounding structure. In contrast, the segment extending from the C-terminus of \u03b14 though \u03b26 is protected by Ric-8A, as is the C-terminus of \u03b15 (see below)."

Other evidence implicates these regions as possible loci of direct interaction between G\u03b1i1 and Ric-8A. Specifically, EPR studies show that G\u03b1i1 residues R209 and K180 in Switch I and Switch II, respectively, become partially immobilized upon binding to Ric-8A (<a href=\"#bib54\">Van Eps et al., 2015</a>). The possibility that Switch II is a Ric-8A binding site is also suggested by the observation that a chimera of G\u03b1s that harbors the Switch II sequence of G\u03b1i1 is not protected from ubiquitination by Ric-8B, a G\u03b1s-specific ortholog of Ric-8A (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nagai et al., 2010</a>). The C-terminus of G\u03b1i1, including residues of \u03b15, is strongly protected from HDX by Ric-8A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This finding is consistent with other studies that implicate the C-terminus of G\u03b1i1 as a Ric-8A interaction site, including the observation that a peptide encompassing this sequence is a competitive inhibitor of G\u03b1i1 for Ric-8A GEF activity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Papasergi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thomas et al., 2011</a>).

Nevertheless, an N-terminal truncation mutant of G\u03b1i1 remains a Ric-8A substrate (<a href=\"#bib49\">Thomas et al., 2011</a>). From the HDX protection data, we infer a broad interaction surface for G\u03b1i1 that encompasses structural elements of the helical domain near its interface with the Ras domain, extends to Switch I and Switch II, and includes the C-terminus, which may make the most intimate contacts with Ric-8A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

In the P-loop and \u03b11 at the nucleotide-binding site, changes in the magnitude of HDX are the opposite of those observed in the transition from G\u03b1\u2022GDP to G\u03b1\u2022Ric-8A.

Notably, Switch III and \u03b13 are consensus effector binding sites of GTP-activated G\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sprang et al., 2007</a>) and protection from HDX could reflect a structural stiffening of these elements in the GTP-bound state.

Experiments were performed with myristoylated G\u03b1i1 harboring a hexahistidine tag in the helical domain (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mumby and Linder, 1994</a>). Mutation of any of the five hotspot residues (V455, T456, R458, P466 and G469) resulted in a diminution in the initial rate of GTP\u03b3S incorporation to 12\u201320% that of WT Ric-8A. Using differential scanning fluorimetry, we found that most of the mutants were slightly destabilized, with thermal unfolding transitions (Tm) ranging from 38\u00b0C to 47\u00b0C, relative to WT Ric-8A, which transitions at 47\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). There is no apparent correlation between thermal melting temperature and GEF activity for these mutants. Comparable loss of GEF activity is achieved by C-terminal truncation of Ric-8A at residue 452, which entirely eliminates the protected sequence. Alanine mutants at residues 454 and 468 exhibited significantly slower rates for the overall exchange reaction than for exchange from the G\u03b1i1:Ric-8A intermediate (p&lt;0.001, P454A and p&lt;0.02, R458A). Mutation of these residues appears to facilitate binding of GTP\u03b3S to, or release of Ric-8A from, the G\u03b1i1:Ric-8A intermediate. We propose that residues at the N- and C-termini of the protected sequence in Ric-8A interact directly or through an allosteric interaction with the empty nucleotide-binding site of G\u03b1i1 to increase its affinity for GTP."

In its interaction with GPCRs, as exemplified by the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR:Gs complex and the rhodopsin:transducin C-terminal peptide complex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rasmussen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Scheerer et al., 2008</a>), the C-terminus of G\u03b1 is accommodated by an extensive interface within a cavity formed by the trans-membrane helices of the receptor. A more limited contact surface is formed by interaction of the second cytoplasmic loop of \u03b22R with the junction between the N-terminal helix and \u03b21 of G\u03b1s. Together these interactions induce structural changes in the \u03b26-\u03b15 loop that forms part of the purine binding site, and the P-loop that enfolds the nucleotide phosphates, thus weakening interactions between GDP and the Ras domain of Ga (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rasmussen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dror et al., 2015</a>). As observed also by DEER spectroscopy in Gi:rhodopsin (<a href=\"#bib53\">Van Eps et al., 2011</a>), the interface between the helical and Ras domains is destabilized, allowing the domains to separate, providing an exit path for the nucleotide. Accordingly, HDX studies of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR:Gs showed strong protection of the C-terminus of G\u03b1s (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chung et al., 2011</a>). Interaction with the receptor induces strong deprotection of the P-loop and the preceding the \u03b21 strand as well as the purine binding \u03b26-\u03b15 and \u03b25-\u03b1G loops. Secondary structure elements at the interface of the Ras and helical domains, including \u03b11 and \u03b1F, are accessible to HDX. The crystal structure of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR:Gs shows that Switch II retains its interactions with G\u03b2\u03b3 as does the N-terminus of G\u03b1. Consequently, the heterotrimer remains intact. While, in the latter complex, G\u03b1s appears to be relatively well-ordered, earlier NMR studies of nucleotide-free <sup>15</sup>N-labeled transducin \u03b1 bound as a complex with G\u03b2\u03b3 to detergent-solubilized, light-activated rhodopsin showed severe broadening of amide resonances, suggestive of structure that is dynamic in the millisecond-microsecond time scale\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdulaev et al., 2006</a>). Crystal structures may not exhibit the range of dynamic motion that is accessible to the G\u03b1i1:GPCR complex in a lipid environment."

However, the HDX data suggest that the extent of structural perturbation induced in G\u03b1i1 by Ric-8A is at least comparable to, and possibly more extensive than those resulting from the action of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR on the G\u03b1s, as revealed by HDX studies of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR:Gs complex (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chung et al., 2011</a>). Within the Ras domain we see evidence of secondary structure conformational changes in a significant portion of the parallel \u03b2 sheet scaffold that abuts and supports the nucleotide-binding site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4a</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>), encompassing the hydrogen-bonded network from \u03b21 to \u03b24 and \u03b25. The nucleotide phosphate-binding P loop and the \u03b25-\u03b1G loop - which harbors the canonical NPXY motif responsible for guanine base recognition in the Ras superfamily \u2013 are strongly deprotected. Modest deprotection is observed at the \u03b26-\u03b15 loop that forms van der Waals contacts with the purine ring. The deprotected region extends to the interface between the Ras and helical domains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) consistent with structural destabilization that facilitates domain separation, as discussed in detail above."

Binding to Ric-8A would likely require the disruption of this energetically favorable interaction. For the same reason, G\u03b2\u03b3, which forms an extensive interface with Switch II, also binds weakly to G\u03b1\u2022GTP (<a href=\"#bib23\">Higashijima et al., 1987b</a>). In contrast, Switch II is disordered in crystal structures of G\u03b1i1\u2022GDP (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mixon et al., 1995</a>) and in solution (<a href=\"#bib52\">Van Eps et al., 2006</a>). Hence, binding of Ric-8A or G\u03b2\u03b3 to G\u03b1i1\u2022GDP is facilitated because Switch II is not otherwise engaged in strong interactions. Sharing a common Switch II binding site, Ric-8A and G\u03b2\u03b3 bind competitively to G\u03b1\u2022GDP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tall et al., 2003</a>). However, it is likely that they also recognize different conformations of Switch II, since Ric-8A has GEF activity, while G\u03b2\u03b3 inhibits GDP release. In aggregate, the HDX data presented here permit the inference that Ric-8A forms a large interaction surface with G\u03b1i1. Clasping the C-terminus of G\u03b1, and buttressed by Switch II, interaction with Ric-8A results in protection of the G\u03b1 N-terminus, parts of the \u03b13 and \u03b14 helices and \u03b26 of the Ras domain, regions within the helical domain and its interface with the Ras domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). We suggest that an extensive Ric-8A:G\u03b1i1 interface confers stability to the dynamic and structurally heterogeneous nucleotide-free G\u03b1. In this respect the mechanism of Ric-8A as a GEF is consistent also with its role as a G\u03b1 chaperone (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chan et al., 2013</a>), in which a partially unstructured state of the G\u03b1 substrate is an intermediate in an enzyme-mediated catalytic event. Thus, the efficiency of Ric-8A-catalyzed GEF activity is limited by the rate at which G\u03b1 is able to make the transition to a partly unfolded state during GDP release and is restored to a fully folded state upon GTP binding. It is therefore not surprising that, in comparison to GPCRs, Ric-8A is a relatively inefficient GEF."

Ric-8A is cytoplasmic molecular chaperone for the G-\u03b1 proteins, and also has non-canonical guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) activity for the G proteins (although much weaker than that of GPCRs). Activation of the G-proteins results from stabilization of G-\u03b1 in the nucleotide free state, facilitating GTP binding. In this manuscript, Kant et al. describe the interaction between Ric-8A and G-\u03b1, and propose a mechanism that underlies the accelerated exchange activity. From past work, although much functional evidence concerning this interaction had been resolved, very little knowledge had been gained on the structural constraints on G-\u03b1 that underlies the exchange activity of Ric-8A. This dearth of structural information is due to the relatively dynamic nature of the interaction."

By monitoring changes in rates of deuteration, one can generate a map of which regions are involved in the interface (as these are less exposed to solvent) or that are linked to binding allosterically. Interpretation of the data depends on having good atomic models for the two interacting proteins and a solid molecular understanding of roles and dynamic range of their flexible/functional elements. In this study, however, only G-\u03b1 is known at that level of structural detail because there is no atomic structure of Ric-8A. Thus, a weakness of this work is that although multiple sites of interaction are identified, and the central hypothesis that Ric-8A stabilizes a poorly ordered nucleotide G protein subunit (consistent with chaperone function) is well supported, one still cannot construct a reasonable model of how the C-terminus and switch regions of G \u03b1 interact with Ric-8A, in particular because the key region of Ric8A itself is thought to be intrinsically disordered. Nevertheless, despite this limitation, the work is of high technical quality, and the data are interpreted in a reasonable light. On balance, given that Ric-8A has proven to be a tough structural target and is thought to be highly dynamic on its own, this kind of study may be the highest resolution information, when used in combination with previously published DEER studies, that can be obtained for this biologically important and interesting complex."

But there are some key differences too. The first is that there are broad increases in flexibility across more of the Ras-like domain upon complex formation (a loosening of the tertiary structure) and interactions also appear to be formed between Ric-8A and two of the switch regions of the \u03b1 subunit. The authors go on to show that a region predicted to be disordered at the C-terminus of Ric-8A is highly protected from exchange upon complex formation. The authors hypothesize that this is an important G protein binding site, an idea they support via site-directed mutagenesis and truncation. These Ric-8A variants display significantly reduced nucleotide exchange on G\u03b1i."

In this structure the G-\u03b1 subunit remains bound to GDP, despite engaging the C-terminus in a similar manner as in the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-G protein complex. More importantly, not only was the 5-6 loop disordered (or not modelled) in the structure but the N-terminus of G-\u03b1 was absent. In light of these recent data the authors should modify their discussion."

This reviewer recalls that the Ridge lab generated results about the partially unfolded state of the Ras-like domain that bear some resemblance to the results of this study. With this in mind, the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR-Gs complex study seems like a bit of an outlier in how little unfolding there is in the \u03b1 subunit in its nucleotide free state. It also argues that G-\u03b2-\u03b3 isn't necessarily responsible for the stability of Gs in the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR over that observed for Gi in the Ric-8A complex. Or does this just reflect that there will be a spectrum of relative unfolding given the identity of the GEF and the \u03b1 subunit?"

Could an attempt be made to distinguish the deuterium exchange on G-\u03b1 from the ric8 protein-protein interaction from the difference in exchange rates simply because the G protein is nucleotide-free. Would it be possible, for example, to study the kinetics of ric8 interaction with G-\u03b1 by DXMS? Would it also be possible to study the kinetics of exchange in the G-\u03b1-Ric8 complex following high concentrations of GDP? A similar argument could be made about the previously reported EPR study on the G-\u03b1-Ric8 complex (van Eps et al. 2015). This is relevant since it is not quite clear whether Ric8 truly stabilizes the 'open' conformation of the G\u03b1, or simply the nucleotide-free form, which happens to be in the 'open' conformation."

We would contend that relevance of this finding is open to question. The G\u03b1s Ras domain used to form the complex with A2AR (Mini-Gs395) contains eight mutations, including a deletion within switch III and is N-terminally truncated (Carpenter and Tate, Protein Eng Des Sel, 29:1-11, 2016). The mutations were designed, and subsequently shown, to increase the thermostability of the domain. However, these mutations also compromise nucleotide release, to the extent that the A2AR:mini-GS395 complex does not dissociate in the presence of GTP. The crystal structure of the complex shows that the contacts between the mini-Ras domain and GDP are largely intact in the complex with A2AR. Although residues in the G\u03b1s \u03b26-\u03b15 loop are not modeled (coordinates for a three-residue sequence in the loop are not present in the PDB file submitted with the paper), inspection of the 2mFo-DFc map show that the loop is well ordered and residues within the loop make contact with the purine ring in a fashion similar to that observed in typical G\u03b1\u2022GDP complexes. For these reasons, we do not feel that the structure of the A2AR-miniGs395 complex informs our understanding of the HDX results presented in the manuscript."

Would it be possible, for example, to study the kinetics of ric8 interaction with G-\u03b1 by DXMS? Would it also be possible to study the kinetics of exchange in the G-\u03b1-Ric8 complex following high concentrations of GDP? A similar argument could be made about the previously reported EPR study on the G-\u03b1-Ric8 complex (van Eps et al. 2015).

However, the two HSQC studies demonstrate that the nucleotide-free \u201capo\u201d structures show considerably less amide broadening than the complexes with GPCRs.

The others show deuteration in the range of 55%-60% for G\u03b1i1\u2022GDP and 45%-55% for G\u03b1i1:Ric-8A.
