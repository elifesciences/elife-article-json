Although OCRL, a direct clathrin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits, clinical manifestations have been primarily attributed to intracellular sorting defects. Here we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which we found to bind OCRL directly, remains associated with such vesicles. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations."

Although OCRL, a direct clathrin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits, clinical manifestations have been primarily attributed to intracellular sorting defects. Here we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which we found to bind OCRL directly, remains associated with such vesicles. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations."

In one type of endocytosis, this process is mediated by a basket-like coat primarily made up from the protein clathrin that assembles at the membrane patch to be internalized.

These cells lack OCRL, and so allow the effect of OCRL's absence on cell function to be deduced. OCRL destroys the membrane lipid that helps to connect the clathrin coat to the membrane, and N\u00e1ndez et al. show that without OCRL the newly formed vesicle moves into the cell but fails to efficiently shed its clathrin coat. Thus, a large fraction of clathrin coat components remain trapped on the vesicles, reducing the amount of such components available to help new pits develop into vesicles. As a consequence, the cell has difficulty internalizing molecules."

Conversely, coat shedding (uncoating) after the endocytic reaction requires PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation, as first revealed by studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in axon terminals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cremona et al., 1999</a>). Absence of synaptojanin 1, the most abundant 5-phosphatase in the synapse, results in a striking accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cremona et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Harris et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Verstreken et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Milosevic et al., 2011</a>).

Such an analysis corroborated evidence for a primary role of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits as it confirmed clathrin and other endocytic adaptors as OCRL binding partners. In addition, it revealed that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. Prompted by these findings, we examined the contribution of OCRL to clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts. We found that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to loose their coat. Such vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells (<a href=\"#bib70\">Suchy and Nussbaum, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hayes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cui et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dambournet et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vicinanza et al., 2011</a>). Our findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis. Defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease."

Towards an improved understanding of the function of OCRL, we carried out a global analysis of its protein interactome. OCRL immunoprecipitates were analyzed through quantitative label-free interaction proteomics by mass spectrometry. This technique, in contrast to other methods such as yeast two-hybrids or pull-downs with purified proteins, allows the preferential capture of physiologically occurring protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib77\">Vermeulen et al., 2008</a>). To this aim, HeLa M cell lines stably expressing either GFP-OCRL or GFP alone were generated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>) so that OCRL specific interactions could be identified by analysis of proteins selectively recovered in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from cells expressing GFP-OCRL. While GFP alone had a diffuse cytosolic distribution, GFP-OCRL had a punctate localization characteristic of endogeneous OCRL immunoreactivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>), thus validating GFP-OCRL expressing cells as an appropriate model for our experiments. Two cell lines were used for further analysis, which expressed GFP-OCRL at near endogenous levels (1X) or at about five times the endogenous level (5X), as revealed by western blotting against OCRL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

These included known binding partners of OCRL, such as subunits of the endocytic clathrin adaptor AP-2, Rab proteins and Ses1/2 but, surprisingly, not APPL1.

In addition to clathrin, interactors such as AP-2, EpsinR (CLINT1), SNX9 and PI3KcII\u03b1 showed the highest enrichment by western blotting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), a cargo protein for clathrin-coated pits whose transport was previously shown to be affected by OCRL knockdown (<a href=\"#bib80\">Vicinanza et al., 2011</a>), was also confirmed by western blotting, but was not as enriched (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Clathrin and AP-2 are known to bind OCRL directly, while EpsinR, SNX9 and PI3KcII\u03b1 are all known clathrin interactors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gaidarov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mills et al., 2003</a>). These findings raised the possibility that at least some of these proteins may bind OCRL indirectly through clathrin. In fact, a substantial overlap was observed between major OCRL interactors revealed by our experiments and proteins previously identified in a similar mass spectrometry analysis of clathrin binding partners (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hubner et al., 2010</a>) as well as in a global analysis of clathrin-coated vesicles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blondeau et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Borner et al., 2006</a>). Thus, to determine the contribution of clathrin to the interactions of OCRL, anti-GFP immunoprecipitations were repeated with cells expressing a GFP-OCRL construct lacking clathrin-binding sites."

Anti-GFP immunoprecipitation of cell extracts expressing GFP-OCRL<sup>WT</sup> co-enriched endogenous SNX9, while a GFP-OCRL mutant in which three prolines (P177, 178, and 181) of the PxxP motif were mutated to alanine (GFP-OCRL<sup>P3</sup>), failed to co-precipitate SNX9 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Based on a systematic analysis of the peak of endocytic protein recruitment at pits relative to the closure of their neck, <a href=\"#bib73\">Taylor et al. (2011)</a> further reported that OCRL peaks slightly after SNX9. To directly compare the spatiotemporal relationship between two proteins at clathrin-coated pits, time-lapse confocal microscopy was performed on human wild type fibroblasts co-expressing GFP-SNX9 and mCherry-OCRL. Inspection of these cells revealed rapidly turning over puncta of both OCRL and SNX9 uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane, as expected for late stage clathrin-coated pits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In the great majority of cases (93.18 \u00b1 1.25%; n = 150 events, 3 independent experiments), the peak of OCRL fluorescence lagged slightly behind that of SNX9, suggesting a very late function of OCRL in clathrin-mediated budding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

Delayed turnover in patient cells resulted in an increase in the number of clathrin puncta (mRFP-tagged CLC) that were positive for GFP-OCRL<sup>D523G</sup> at any given time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

This analysis confirmed the global increase in the number of clathrin-coated endocytic profiles and, in particular, a prominent increase of wide-neck (primarily U-shaped) pits and of free clathrin-coated vesicles in the cortical region of the cell (less than 500 nm from the plasma membrane, that is clathrin-coated vesicles most likely of endocytic origin) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). These results suggest that the loss of OCRL impairs uncoating, a finding consistent with its very late recruitment at pits. Its absence also delays late steps in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, possibly as a result of sequestration of endocytic factors on uncoated vesicles. Such findings prompted us to assess the potential occurrence in patient cells of a defect in the internalization of transferrin, a well established cargo of clathrin-mediated endocytosis."

In addition, biotin labeling of the endogenous surface pool of the transferrin receptor showed its accumulation at the plasma membrane in patient cells compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>).

Knockdown of SNX9 followed by immunostaining with phalloidin revealed a decrease in the number of endogenous comets observed in patient cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). There was noticeable cell-to-cell variability however, roughly correlating with residual SNX9 levels in knockdown cells (generally higher in patient cells given the elevated basal level of this protein). Importantly, most of the remaining SNX9 puncta observed in cells after knockdown associated with the tips of the comets (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). These results suggest that the interaction between SNX9 and OCRL may help coordinate actin polymerization at late stage clathrin-coated pits with the turnover of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The recruitment of OCRL to clathrin-coated pits was not dependent on its interaction with SNX9, however. This was evidenced by the expression of an SNX9-binding mutant construct of OCRL (GFP-OCRL<sup>P3</sup>) that still localized to clathrin-coated pits in patient cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Given the interactions of OCRL with several prominent endocytic factors such as clathrin and AP-2, it is highly likely that multiple binding partners regulate its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits."

Data concerning the action of OCRL in membrane traffic, and the impact of its loss in patient cells, pointed primarily to a post-endocytic role, including intracellular clathrin-dependent transport reactions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dressman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Ungewickell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Choudhury et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hyvola et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Swan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vicinanza et al., 2011</a>).

Subsequent work in a variety of model systems supported this idea but also suggested a role of this phosphoinositide in the late stages of endocytosis. Dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the membranes of the budding vesicles was proposed to act as a mechanism to generate a line tension at the vesicle neck (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stefan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rusk et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sun et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chang-Ileto et al., 2011</a>).

This defect is characterized by an accumulation of late-stage (primarily U-shaped) endocytic clathrin-coated pits and by a delay in the internalization of transferrin, a clathrin-coated pit cargo. Our results also point to a defect in clathrin uncoating, as in the case of synaptojanin 1 KO synapses. More specifically, electron microscopy demonstrated a robust increase in the number of clathrin-coated vesicles in patient cells relative to control fibroblasts. Additionally, immunofluorescence and live microscopy analysis revealed an abundance of intracellular vesicles positive for both coat and cargo proteins of endocytic origin including, besides clathrin, the adaptor complex AP-2, SNX9, PI3KcII\u03b1 and transferrin. These vesicles were at the tips of actin comets, which are known to be nucleated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-positive organelles. The dramatic decrease in the number of these comets upon the selective, pharmacologically-induced depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane demonstrates that at least a large cohort of these comets are nucleated by endocytic vesicles. The prominent impact of the lack of OCRL on total cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in patient cells is reminiscent of the robust increase in brain levels of this phosphoinositide observed in the absence of synaptojanin 1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cremona et al., 1999</a>). We suggest that synaptojanin 1 and OCRL have partially overlapping functions, but with predominant roles at synapses and in non-neuronal cells, respectively."

Interestingly, SNX9 also binds synaptojanin 1 and 2, consistent with a partial overlap in the function of these 5-phosphatases (<a href=\"#bib84\">Yeow-Fong et al., 2005</a>). SNX9 is a member of a family of BAR domain-containing endocytic adaptors that help coordinate changes in bilayer curvature with reactions that occur as membranes progress along the endocytic pathway. Specifically, SNX9 is thought to have an important role in coupling clathrin coat maturation to actin nucleation (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yarar et al., 2007</a>). Our observation that the knockdown of SNX9 decreases comet formation in patient cells supports a role for this protein in actin nucleation at clathrin-coated pits. It also suggests a functional link between SNX9-regulated actin polymerization and the turnover of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> controlled by OCRL. The modular structure of SNX9 is ideally suited to mediate this coordination. SNX9 binds the plasma membrane with a PX-BAR domain module, which exhibits a preference for curved membranes enriched in PI(4,5)P2 and 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gallop et al., 2013</a>), clathrin via a \u2018clathrin-box\u2019 motif and AP-2 via an \u03b1-adaptin-binding motif (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</a>). Through its SH3 domain, SNX9 binds and thus helps to activate both N-WASP to trigger actin nucleation, and dynamin to mediate fission (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yarar et al., 2007</a>). The SH3 domain of SNX9 binds synaptojanin and also OCRL, as we have demonstrated in this study. Given that SNX9 is a protein dimer that is present in multiple copies at endocytic sites, SNX9 is an attractive candidate to help bring together all these factors."

In principle, 5-phosphatases such as OCRL and synaptojanin could directly contribute to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> production by dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, or indirectly by generating PI4P, the PI3KcII\u03b1 substrate, from PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Posor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schmid and Mettlen, 2013</a>). These models would place OCRL upstream of SNX9. However, SNX9 is recruited to coated pits prior to OCRL, and also in its absence. Instead, the recruitment of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits coincides with the temporal recruitment signature of GAK (<a href=\"#bib73\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>), which, like its homologue auxilin, is a cofactor for Hsc70 and thus a key player in the disassembly of the clathrin lattice after fission (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fotin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Massol et al., 2006</a>). Both OCRL and GAK peak after the clathrin fluorescence has started to diminish, as expected for proteins that mediate the shedding of the clathrin coat (GAK) and its adaptors (OCRL). Interestingly, the lack of GAK or auxilin results in endocytic defects in addition to the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and empty clathrin cages (<a href=\"#bib89\">Lee et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib85\">Yim et al., 2005</a>). This impairment of endocytosis is thought to result from the sequestration of coat components on assembled lattices. Similarly, a defect in uncoating in the absence of OCRL may impair the recycling of endocytic factors and affect the maturation of clathrin-coated pits. As OCRL binds multiple proteins present in endocytic clathrin coats, an important question for future studies will be to determine the precise mechanisms responsible for the timing of OCRL recruitment."

The 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL is required to complete endocytosis and to prevent the ectopic accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on endosomes and membranes in the Golgi complex area (this work; <a href=\"#bib15\">Choudhury et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dressman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Erdmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hyvola et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Swan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Ungewickell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vicinanza et al., 2011</a>). This multiplicity of actions is supported by its numerous interactors, which comprise proteins implicated in membrane traffic, signaling and actin regulation in a variety of cellular compartments (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pirruccello and De Camilli, 2012</a>). As shown here, proteins implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis are prominently featured in the OCRL \u2018interactome\u2019, which also comprises numerous proteins that participate in the clathrin-dependent traffic between endosomes and the Golgi complex. These include the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) and the clathrin adaptor EpsinR, implicating OCRL in these trafficking stations as well. It remains unclear whether the function of OCRL at these intracellular sites is to prevent the buildup of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or to control small yet physiologically relevant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> pools."

The presence of clathrin, AP-2 and actin nucleating proteins on intracellular vesicles, however, strongly suggests the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on these vesicles. Sequestration of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on such vesicles by clathrin adaptors and actin nucleating factors may be one reason explaining absent or inefficient PH<sup>PLC\u03b4</sup> labeling, as we have shown that transient depolymerization of actin results in the appearance of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reporter on intracellular vesicles."

INPP5B however, does not contain either clathrin or AP-2 binding sites (<a href=\"#bib76\">Ungewickell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Choudhury et al., 2005</a>). Correspondingly, OCRL and INPP5B share similar localizations on endosomes and in the Golgi complex area but INPP5B is not present at endocytic clathrin-coated pits (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erdmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Williams et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mao et al., 2009</a>). Thus, a major functional difference between OCRL and INPP5B seems to be the involvement of OCRL, but not of INPP5B, in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. One important open question is why the lack of OCRL produces major phenotypes in humans but not in mice, in spite of the conservation of all known properties of OCRL in mice and humans, including the SNX9 binding site reported here. As INPP5B does not participate in endocytic clathrin-coated dynamics, differences in the expression or splicing of INPP5B in mice and humans cannot fully account for this difference. Elucidating mechanisms underlying this difference represents an important goal of future studies."

Our findings suggest that endocytosis itself may also be affected, as shown previously for CLC5 mutations that produce Dent's disease (<a href=\"#bib58\">Novarino et al., 2010</a>) although they do not exclude the previously suggested intracellular sorting abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib90\">Lowe, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vicinanza et al., 2011</a>). Rather, they suggest that defects in endocytosis and in the fate of newly formed endocytic vesicles ultimately contribute to abnormal cargo sorting, as exemplified by the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the tip of actin comets. Impairments in endocytosis may also contribute to the cognitive deficiencies observed in Lowe syndrome patients. While synaptojanin 1 is the key player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at synapses, OCRL may function at clathrin-coated pits that participate in a housekeeping form of endocytosis in neurons."

To examine the sequential recruitment of proteins at the pit, raw images were analyzed with ImageJ to generate intensity plots of areas of interest and to quantitate particles as described previously (<a href=\"#bib92\">Perera et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zoncu et al., 2007</a>). Briefly, average fluorescence/time plots were generated from individual fluorescent spots, which were subsequently time\u2010aligned by the conversion of one fluorescent marker to another. For each time point, the fluorescence intensity was normalized to the peak fluorescence intensity of that pit. For these analyses, clathrin-coated pits were manually selected at random. Statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed Student's <i>t</i> test."

Briefly, control and patient cells were starved for 1.5 hs, then chilled on ice for 30 min and finally incubated with biotinylated transferrin (10 \u00b5g/ml) in ice-cold DMEM on ice for 45 min. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and incubated with pre-warmed culture media at 37\u00b0C for the times indicated. Internalization was stopped by placing the cells on ice and washing them three times with cold PBS. Cells were then incubated on ice with avidin (0.05 mg/ml) for 1 hr followed by incubation with biocytin (0.05 mg/ml) for 15 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and lysed (1% TX-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% BSA, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Tris, pH 7.4). Cell lysates were then added to ELISA plates coated with anti-human transferrin antibody (Abcam) and assayed for detectable biotinylated transferrin using chromogen-conjugated streptavidin as indicated in the manufacturer's protocol. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a> internalized biotinylated transferrin was expressed as the percent of total surface-bound at 4\u00b0C, which was not incubated with avidin or biocytin. Uptake of fluorescently label transferrin was performed in a very similar fashion, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib93\">Ritter et al., 2013</a>). Cells were incubated with transferrin-Alex 594 instead, placed on ice after internalization, washed three times with cold PBS, and surface bound transferrin was removed by a quick acid wash (0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl). Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA and imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy."

Using cells from patients with Lowe's syndrome, the authors find accumulations of clathrin and adaptor proteins and Vps9 under the plasma membrane. These structures nucleate actin comets not seen in wild type cells. The findings reported here potentially fill an important conceptual gap in the endocytosis field as it has remained unclear how and at which point in the pathway PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis occurs in non-neuronal cells that express very low levels of synaptojanin 5-phosphatases. The work will be of broad interest with modifications as described here."

Please clarify. What is the fraction of actin comets harboring clathrin at their tips? Is this seen for endogenous proteins; i.e. could the clathrin-coated tips observed at actin comets be resulting from clathrin light chain overexpression used to visualize these structures?"

The evidence in favor of this model is by TIRF imaging that OCRL appears to be recruited late to endocytic structures, in fact, at a time point when clathrin uncoating sets in. However, it is also possible as the authors state, that a fraction of OCRL acts early in the pathway. Is the primary role of OCRL is in CCP maturation or in uncoating? The authors seem to prefer a model in which SNX9 acts prior to OCRL and potentially recruits OCRL to late-stage CCPs but do not provide data to support this. If OCRL is recruited to CCPs after the peak of clathrin recruitment then the majority of CCPs should lack detectable OCRL signals when imaged by confocal microscopy. Please quantify this. Conversely, substantial colocalization of OCRL with plasma membrane CCPs might be considered a sign of an early role of OCRL in addition to the late pool observed in TIRF imaging."

If KD of SNX9 in OCRL mutants would abolish actin comets this would be a strong indication for a close functional and physical link between OCRL-mediated PI(4,5)P2 turnover and SNX9 regulation of actin polymerization."

We have modified <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a> to reflect our newest analysis. For both the original figure and the new figure we have only analyzed CCVs in proximity of the plasma membrane (within 500 nm), as CCVs located more deeply into cells may also represent Golgi-derived vesicles. Since CCVs rapidly disperse throughout the cell upon fission, our data may actually represent an underestimate of the total number of endocytic CCVs that accumulate in Lowe syndrome patient cells."

The evidence in favor of this model is by TIRF imaging that OCRL appears to be recruited late to endocytic structures, in fact, at a time point when clathrin uncoating sets in. However, it is also possible as the authors state, that a fraction of OCRL acts early in the pathway. Is the primary role of OCRL is in CCP maturation or in uncoating? The authors seem to prefer a model in which SNX9 acts prior to OCRL and potentially recruits OCRL to late-stage CCPs but do not provide data to support this. If OCRL is recruited to CCPs after the peak of clathrin recruitment then the majority of CCPs should lack detectable OCRL signals when imaged by confocal microscopy. Please quantify this. Conversely, substantial colocalization of OCRL with plasma membrane CCPs might be considered a sign of an early role of OCRL in addition to the late pool observed in TIRF imaging</i>."

As we show in this manuscript and as we have previously shown (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erdmann et al. 2007</a>), OCRL is recruited only at very late stages at CCPs. Additionally, as we mention in the discussion of the manuscript, a previous study by Taylor et al. had also shown a sharp recruitment of OCRL at the very end of the CCP lifetime. Interestingly, this study also showed that the OCRL recruitment profile precisely coincided with that of GAK, a key clathrin uncoating factor (<a href=\"#bib73\">Taylor et al. 2011</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We note that, similar to our current results, lack of GAK results in an impairment of endocytosis due to sequestration of clathrin in assembled coats (Lee <i>et al.</i>, 2005, Yim <i>et al.</i>, 2010). In response to this comment of the referee, we have modified the text by emphasizing how the partial stalling of clathrin coated pit maturation at mid-stage (U-shaped pits) may only be an indirect effect of the sequestration of endocytic factors on uncoated vesicles. We have calculated the fraction of CCPs positive for OCRL at any given time and found that such fraction is below 25 % in control fibroblasts."

Microscopy observations suggested a decrease in the number of comets but with variability from cell to cell, which roughly correlated with remaining levels of SNX9 immunoreactivity.

These results are consistent with a role of SNX9 in the actin polymerization leading to actin tails. These data are now shown in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2</a>. We note however, that interaction of OCRL with SNX9 is not required for its recruitment to clathrin coated pits, as an OCRL mutant harboring a mutation in the SNX9 binding site, but still capable of binding clathrin and AP-2, was still recruited to very late stage clathrin coated pits (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2</a>)."
