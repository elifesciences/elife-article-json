                    "text": "Synaptic transmission between midbrain dopamine neurons and target neurons in the striatum is essential for the selection and reinforcement of movements. Recent evidence indicates that nigrostriatal dopamine neurons inhibit striatal projection neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that activates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon extends to mesolimbic afferents, and confirm that the released neurotransmitter is GABA. However, the GABA synthetic enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 are not detected in midbrain dopamine neurons. Instead, these cells express the membrane GABA transporters mGAT1 (Slc6a1) and mGAT4 (Slc6a11) and inhibition of these transporters prevents GABA co-release. These findings therefore indicate that GABA co-release is a general feature of midbrain dopaminergic neurons that relies on GABA uptake from the extracellular milieu as opposed to de novo synthesis. This atypical mechanism may confer dopaminergic neurons the flexibility to differentially control GABAergic transmission in a target-dependent manner across their extensive axonal arbors."

Recent evidence indicates that nigrostriatal dopamine neurons inhibit striatal projection neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that activates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon extends to mesolimbic afferents, and confirm that the released neurotransmitter is GABA. However, the GABA synthetic enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 are not detected in midbrain dopamine neurons. Instead, these cells express the membrane GABA transporters mGAT1 (Slc6a1) and mGAT4 (Slc6a11) and inhibition of these transporters prevents GABA co-release. These findings therefore indicate that GABA co-release is a general feature of midbrain dopaminergic neurons that relies on GABA uptake from the extracellular milieu as opposed to de novo synthesis. This atypical mechanism may confer dopaminergic neurons the flexibility to differentially control GABAergic transmission in a target-dependent manner across their extensive axonal arbors."

The major target of midbrain DA neurons is the striatum, a large subcortical structure implicated in the selection and reinforcement of motor actions. DA neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) project mainly to the dorsal striatum (also known as the caudate and putamen, CPu), whereas those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) innervate the ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens, NAc), forming the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways, respectively. The striatum controls motor behavior through two parallel output streams with opposing effects; the so-called \u2018direct\u2019 and \u2018indirect\u2019 pathways. Each pathway arises from distinct groups of GABAergic striatal projection neurons (SPNs) that differ, amongst other things, in their response to DA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</a>). By providing DA to the striatum, SNc and VTA neurons are believed to play a pivotal role in balancing the activity of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs. However, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms employed by DA neurons to modulate striatal function remains incomplete."

                        "text": "Although the activation of metabotropic receptors following the release of DA from SNc/VTA neurons is undoubtedly central to their function, DA neurons also co-release several other transmitters that shape striatal output (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hnasko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Stuber et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Tecuapetla et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>). In particular, we recently showed that DA neurons in SNc potently inhibit action potential firing in SPNs by releasing a transmitter that activates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>). Release of this neurotransmitter requires activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter Slc18a2 (VMAT2), which can be replaced by exogenous expression of the vesicular GABA transporter Slc32a1 (also known as VGAT or VIAAT). In addition, VMAT2 expression in SPNs lacking VGAT is sufficient to sustain GABAergic transmission. Collectively, these findings suggest that SNc neurons co-release GABA using VMAT2 for vesicular loading. However, this study raises several important questions. First, does GABAergic transmission generalize to DA neurons in the VTA, or is it limited to nigrostriatal afferents? Second, what is the identity of the transmitter released by DA neurons? GABA exists as a zwitterion at neutral pH and lacks the characteristic molecular structure of VMAT2 substrates, which typically feature an aromatic ring and a positive charge (<a href=\"#bib94\">Yelin and Schuldiner, 1995</a>). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can be activated by several naturally-occurring agonists and allosteric modulators, including \u03b2-alanine, taurine, imidazole-4-acetic acid and neurosteroids (<a href=\"#bib42\">Johnston, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Belelli and Lambert, 2005</a>). Although none of these molecules constitute ideal candidates for VMAT2-dependent vesicular transport based on their structure, charge, or both, they nonetheless raise the possibility that DA neurons liberate a transmitter other than GABA to inhibit SPNs. Third, do all DA neurons contribute to GABAergic signaling, or is it reserved to a subpopulation of cells, similar to glutamate co-release from DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hnasko and Edwards, 2011</a>). Finally, how is inhibitory synaptic transmission sustained in DA neurons? Addressing this point will help identify molecules required for GABAergic transmission by DA neurons and will permit the development of genetic tools to determine the relative contribution of SPN inhibition by DA neurons in vivo under normal and pathological conditions."

Moreover, we reveal that DA neurons rely on GABA uptake through the plasma membrane\u2014but not on de novo GABA synthesis\u2014to sustain GABAergic transmission."

To determine whether this GABAergic signaling extends to DA neurons projecting to ventral striatum, we expressed channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) in the VTA using one of two approaches (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We either injected <i>Slc6a3-ires-Cre</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib6\">Backman et al., 2006</a>) stereotaxically with an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinase-dependent ChR2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or drove ChR2 expression genetically by crossing <i>Slc6a3-ires-Cre</i> mice to transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib55\">Madisen et al., 2012</a>) containing a conditional allele of ChR2 in the <i>Rosa26</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Mice also harbored <i>Drd2-Egfp</i> or <i>Drd1a-tdTomato</i> bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenes to permit distinction between direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ade et al., 2011</a>). We performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from SPNs in sagittal brain slices of NAc in the presence of inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NBQX and R-CPP) and metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (CGP55845) to prevent excitatory synaptic transmission by dopaminergic axons, as well as modulatory effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, respectively. Under our recording conditions, optogenetic stimulation of VTA axons with brief (1 ms) flashes of blue light reliably evoked inward IPSCs in direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs that were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists picrotoxin (n = 12; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,E</a>) and SR95531 (n = 4, not shown). With the exception of synaptic latency, optogenetically-evoked IPSCs (oIPSCs) exhibited similar properties in both experimental systems and were consequently pooled for analysis. They averaged 353 \u00b1 60 pA in peak amplitude (range = 68\u2013905 pA; n = 16) and their kinetics were similar to those observed in dorsal striatum (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), with a 10\u201390% rise time of 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 ms and a decay time constant of 46.8 \u00b1 7.2 ms. The synaptic latency of oIPSCs in NAc did not differ from that observed in dorsal striatum under similar experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>), indicating that the connection is monosynaptic. Synaptic stimulation of midbrain DA neurons therefore directly engages GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on SPNs in both dorsal and ventral striatum."

They include the presence of (1) presynaptic synthetic enzymes, (2) presynaptic vesicular transporters, (3) postsynaptic receptors, and (4) a biochemical mechanism for inactivation. In the case of GABAergic signaling at dopaminergic synapses, conditions 2 and 3 are respectively satisfied by the presence of VMAT2 in DA neurons and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in SPNs. For many central nervous system transmitters, condition 4 is mediated by diffusion and reuptake through plasma membrane transporters. Of the four genes identified in mice that encode high affinity membrane GABA transporters, <i>Slc6a1</i> is expressed predominantly throughout the brain (<a href=\"#bib13\">Borden, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lein et al., 2007</a>). Its gene product, mGAT1, distributes mainly to presynaptic terminals of GABAergic neurons and serves to shape the amplitude and time course of IPSCs as well as regulate extrasynaptic levels of GABA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Isaacson et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Jensen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Overstreet and Westbrook, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Conti et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chiu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bragina et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kirmse et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cepeda et al., 2013</a>).

By contrast, mGAT1 antagonism significantly affected decay kinetics: whereas oIPSC decay time constants remained stable in control recordings (baseline: 33.6 \u00b1 5.8 ms; 3\u20134 min after ACSF wash-in: 32.1 \u00b1 5.8 ms; p=0.6, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), they were prolonged by a factor of 3 in the presence of SKF 89976A (baseline: 38.6 \u00b1 6.0 ms; 3\u20134 min after SKF 89976A wash-in: 115.9 \u00b1 26.3 ms; p=0.002, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These results indicate that mGAT1 activity normally shortens the duration of dopaminergic IPSCs, likely by clearing released neurotransmitter from the extracellular space."

Consistent with this, acute pharmacological inhibition of mGAT1 was accompanied by a significant increase in holding current caused by a threefold increase in tonic GABA current in both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To exclude the possibility that the increase in oIPSC decay time constant stems from changes in recording conditions during bath application of SKF 89976A, we also monitored spontaneous (s) IPSCs as well as IPSCs evoked electrically within the striatum (eIPSCs; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Unlike dopaminergic oIPSCs, neither the amplitude nor the kinetics of eIPSCs were significantly affected after acute mGAT1 inhibition (baseline amplitude: 304 \u00b1 70 pA; 3\u20134 min after SKF 89976A wash-in: 339 \u00b1 80 pA. Baseline 10\u201390% rise time: 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 ms; 3\u20134 min after SKF 89976A wash-in: 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 ms. Baseline decay time constant: 14.8 \u00b1 2.6 ms; 3\u20134 min after SKF 89976A wash-in: 19.6 \u00b1 4.9 ms; n = 9; p&gt;0.1 for all, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), despite a notable increase in holding current during the first few minutes following bath application of SKF 89976A (baseline: \u221282 \u00b1 16 pA; SKF 89976A: \u2212143 \u00b1 21 pA; n = 9; p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Moreover, although the amplitude of sIPSCs decreased slightly in SKF 89976A relative to baseline (97 \u00b1 9 vs 83 \u00b1 7 pA, n = 14; p=0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), the frequency and kinetics of sIPSCs remained unchanged (baseline frequency: 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 Hz; 3\u20134 min after SKF 89976A wash-in: 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 Hz. Baseline 10\u201390% rise time: 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 ms; 3\u20134 min after SKF 89976A wash-in: 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 ms. Baseline decay time constant: 6.8 \u00b1 0.4 ms; 3\u20134 min after SKF 89976A wash-in: 6.4 \u00b1 0.5 ms; p&gt;0.05 for all, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). These results are consistent with previous reports in the striatum and hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib38\">Isaacson et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kirmse et al., 2008</a>). Thus, our results indicate that prolongation of light-evoked IPSCs by SKF 89976A is specific to dopaminergic synapses and not secondary to increased GABAergic tone. Together, these data reveal that the duration of dopaminergic IPSCs is critically dependent on mGAT1 function and, therefore, strongly support that GABA is the transmitter co-released by DA neurons."

However, the high density of GABAergic axons converging into the substantia nigra, combined with the low concentration of GADs in cell bodies compared to axon terminals prevented us from clearly identifying DA neurons that expressed GADs (not shown). We instead imaged coronal brain sections from knock-in mice (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tamamaki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>) expressing either EGFP or Cre recombinase under transcriptional control of the endogenous promoter for <i>Gad1</i> or <i>Gad2</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Cre expression was visualized using a sensitive fluorescent reporter allele (<a href=\"#bib56\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>) and TH expression was revealed via immunofluorescence. These mice offer the advantage of having bright somatic labeling including, in the case of <i>Gad2-ires-</i>Cre mice, of cells with very little transcriptional activity. However, we were unable to detect any DA neuron expressing fluorescent reporter protein driven by either <i>Gad1</i> (0 out of 519 TH<sup>+</sup> neurons) or <i>Gad2</i> (0 out of 526 TH<sup>+</sup> neurons) promoters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). Collectively, these results indicate that midbrain DA neurons in the SNc and lateral VTA of mice do not express the GABA synthetic enzymes GAD65 and GAD67."

GABA transaminase is an enzyme expressed at high levels in GABAergic neurons, including in the ventral midbrain that can reversibly convert succinate semialdehyde into GABA, and vice versa (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bessman et al., 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Roberts and Bregoff, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Medina-Kauwe et al., 1994</a>). Because succinate semialdehyde is readily oxidized to succinate to sustain energy production as part of the Krebs cycle, GABA transaminase is thought to participate in the degradation of GABA in most cells, not its synthesis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Balazs et al., 1970</a>). Nevertheless, we considered the possibility that GABA transaminase might contribute GABA in DA neurons. Double fluorescence in situ hybridization for <i>Vmat2</i> and <i>Abat</i> (the gene encoding GABA transaminase) revealed strong co-labeling in 701 out of 738 DA neurons (95%) within the SNc and lateral VTA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), indicating that DA neurons express genes involved in GABA metabolism. To test whether DA neurons employ GABA transaminase to synthesize GABA, we incubated slices of striatum in control ACSF or vigabatrin (VGT)\u2014an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase\u2014for at least thirty minutes prior to recording oIPSCs in SPNs. In agreement with prior work (<a href=\"#bib63\">Overstreet and Westbrook, 2001</a>), this manipulation significantly elevated extracellular GABA levels (picrotoxin-sensitive tonic current in SPNs in ACSF: 24 \u00b1 3 pA, n = 11; in VGT: 115 \u00b1 23 pA, n = 12; p&lt;0.001, Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test), confirming the effectiveness of the drug. To minimize differences in light-evoked responses within experiments, we obtained maximal oIPSCs using strong ChR2 stimulation and limited comparisons to SPNs located in similar areas of dorsal striatum in adjacent slices. Under these conditions, we did not detect significant differences in oIPSC amplitude between both groups (ACSF: 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 nA; VGT: 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 nA; n = 14; p=0.3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), indicating that GABA transaminase function is not required for GABAergic signaling by DA neurons."

It is therefore conceivable that DA neurons inhibit SPNs by releasing GABA they acquire from the extracellular environment. mGAT1 and mGAT4 (encoded by <i>Slc6a11</i>) are the two major plasma membrane GABA transporters expressed in the mouse midbrain (<a href=\"#bib13\">Borden, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lein et al., 2007</a>).

Inhibition of mGAT1 for a few minutes does not affect the release of GABA from SNc axons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating either that this pharmacological manipulation incompletely blocks GABA reuptake, or that it is too short to deplete presynaptic GABA levels. To determine whether uptake of ambient GABA is necessary for sustaining GABAergic transmission by DA neurons, we therefore inhibited both mGAT1 and mGAT4 in striatal slices using a cocktail of SKF 89976A and SNAP-5114 (a mGAT4 antagonist) for at least 30 min prior to examining oIPSCs in SPNs in the continued presence of GAT antagonists.

Importantly, prolonged exposure to SKF 89976A and SNAP-5114 did not prevent transmitter release non-specifically, as light-evoked dopamine release from SNc axons as well as GABA release from striatopallidal terminals were maintained under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This increase in extracellular GABA might account for the reduced amplitude of oIPSCs by promoting the desensitization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, by shunting synaptic currents, or both. To examine these possibilities, we included an additional experimental condition in which slices were pre-incubated in muscimol before evoking dopaminergic oIPSCs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). Muscimol is a potent synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist that promotes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor desensitization to the same extent as GABA (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mortensen et al., 2010</a>), but displays minimal affinity for plasma membrane GABA transporters (<a href=\"#bib43\">Johnston et al., 1978</a>). The concentration of muscimol was titrated to evoke tonic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated currents similar those that developed upon persistent GAT inhibition (picrotoxin-sensitive tonic current: 212 \u00b1 46 pA, n = 10; p&lt;0.001 vs ACSF; p&gt;0.05 vs GAT antagonists, Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

If membrane GABA reuptake is required for supplying GABA for vesicular exocytosis, inhibiting GATs should prevent DA neurons from maintaining GABA release with repeated stimulation. Indeed, chronic inhibition of GATs precipitated the rundown of GABAergic transmission from DA neurons in an activity-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A second prediction is that elevating extracellular GABA should attenuate synaptic rundown. To test this, we locally applied GABA (100 \u03bcM) to the dorsal striatum for 5\u201310 min prior to recording oIPSCs from SPNs. Following this manipulation, the amplitude of oIPSCs was maintained for several minutes after break-in (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Importantly, this increase in oIPSC amplitude by exogenous GABA was prevented in slices incubated in GAT antagonists (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These data therefore provide strong evidence that membrane GABA transporters play an important role in sustaining GABAergic transmission from DA neurons by supplying the neurotransmitter GABA to presynaptic terminals for vesicular loading and exocytosis."

In this case, the transmitter released by midbrain DA neurons (1) functions as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, (2) serves as a substrate for VGAT (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>), and (3) is a substrate for mGAT1. Although VGAT can transport GABA, glycine, and \u03b2-alanine into synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gasnier, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wojcik et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Juge et al., 2013</a>), glycine does not function as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, and the low affinity of \u03b2-alanine for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors would give rise to IPSCs with faster kinetics than the ones we observed (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jones et al., 1998a</a>). In addition, mGAT1 is highly selective for GABA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Borden, 1996</a>), and applying GABA exogenously helped sustain IPSCs from DA neurons in a GAT-dependent fashion. Although we did not detect GABA synthetic enzymes in DA neurons in our experiments, SNc and VTA neurons display a GABAergic phenotype, as they contain mRNA for GABA transaminase and the membrane GABA transporters mGAT1 and mGAT4. Together, these results strongly suggest that the neurotransmitter released by midbrain DA neurons is GABA. In agreement with this conclusion, a recent electron microscopic study detected GABA in close association with VMAT2-containing synaptic vesicles in dopaminergic terminals within striatum (<a href=\"#bib77\">Stensrud et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, other dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system have been reported to contain and/or release GABA, including amacrine cells in the retina (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hirasawa et al., 2012</a>), periglomerular cells in the olfactory bulb (<a href=\"#bib57\">Maher and Westbrook, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Borisovska et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Liu et al., 2013</a>), as well as dopaminergic cell groups throughout the brain (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bjorklund and Dunnett, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Stamatakis et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that GABA co-release may be a general property of dopaminergic cells."

Given that all cells contain glutamate, an amino acid necessary for the production of proteins, the expression of either GAD67 or GAD65 in conjunction with a vesicular GABA transporter is sufficient to mediate vesicular release of GABA. Previous reports have estimated that up to 10% of DA neurons in the SNc and VTA of rats express mRNA for GAD65 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gonzalez-Hernandez et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2004</a>), suggesting that GABA release may be limited to a subpopulation of DA neurons. We were unable to replicate this observation using two separate approaches, indicating that DA neurons in the SNc and lateral VTA of mice do not rely on de novo synthesis of GABA and have instead adopted other means of obtaining GABA."

In fact, several synapses, including monoaminergic (<a href=\"#bib29\">Giros et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bengel et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Jones et al., 1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Xu et al., 2000</a>), glycinergic (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gomeza et al., 2003a</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Rousseau et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Apostolides and Trussell, 2013</a>) as well as some GABAergic terminals (<a href=\"#bib58\">Mathews and Diamond, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bak et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fricke et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Brown and Mathews, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wang et al., 2013</a>) rely heavily on membrane transporter function to maintain cytosolic transmitter pools available for vesicular loading. Our results show that DA neurons contain mRNA for mGAT1 and mGAT4, indicating that DA neurons might acquire GABA through membrane transport. Indeed, we find that prolonged inhibition of mGAT1 and mGAT4 inhibited GABAergic transmission by DA neurons and precipitated the rundown of oIPSCs, suggesting that DA neurons critically depend on extracellular GABA uptake to maintain cytoplasmic GABA levels and fill synaptic vesicles. By contrast, application of exogenous GABA helped sustain inhibitory transmission from DA neurons. By virtue of the fact that the vast majority of DA neurons in the SNc and lateral VTA contain mRNA for mGATs, our results suggest that GABA co-release is, unlike glutamate co-transmission (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hnasko and Edwards, 2011</a>), a common feature of these cells in the adult nervous system. The reliance on plasma membrane uptake may partially explain why release of both DA and GABA from these neurons is prone to rundown upon repeated stimulation in brain slices (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schmitz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ishikawa et al., 2013</a>), whereas release of glutamate from dopaminergic neurons or GABA from SPNs (which presumably depend on neurotransmitter synthesis to sustain release) do not suffer from the same shortcoming (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Nevertheless, these findings provide evidence that the expression of GABA synthetic enzymes is not required to sustain GABAergic transmission, and identify a GABAergic synapse that instead relies entirely on recycling extracellular GABA. Interestingly, a similar mechanism underlies exocytic release of serotonin from dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zhou et al., 2005</a>) as well as from glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons during development (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lebrand et al., 1996</a>)."

Morphological studies of SPNs at the electron microscopic level have revealed that the majority of dopaminergic synapses terminate on the neck of spines that receive excitatory inputs from cortex and thalamus (<a href=\"#bib90\">Wickens and Arbuthnott, 2005</a>). Although the actions of DA are not believed to be spatially localized (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arbuthnott and Wickens, 2007</a>), this unique synaptic arrangement is indicative of an additional, point-to-point mode of action. An intriguing possibility is that GABA co-release may function to hyperpolarize spines or shunt excitatory cortical and thalamic inputs by activating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Phasic activation of DA neurons may thereby dampen ongoing cortical and thalamic drive onto SPNs to limit DA receptor-mediated plastic changes to synaptic inputs most strongly activated by salient or rewarding stimuli. In addition, the mechanism adopted by DA neurons to obtain GABA may confer these cells the flexibility to dynamically and locally control GABAergic transmission across their extensive axonal arbors. For instance, VTA neurons projecting to NAc and medial prefrontal cortex may only co-release GABA in the former, where extracellular GABA levels are high compared to cortex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Drasbek and Jensen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Weitlauf and Woodward, 2008</a>). Alternatively, phasic and chronic changes in mGAT function or extracellular GABA levels resulting from synaptic activity, drugs or disease may alter the amplitude and kinetics of GABAergic currents arising from midbrain dopamine neurons. A greater understanding of the relative effects of DA and GABA on the activity of striatal circuits will help reveal how DA neurons contribute to behavior in health and disease."

For stereotaxic viral injections, postnatal day 18\u201325 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed in a small animal stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and injected with 1 \u03bcl of an adeno-associated virus (\u223c10<sup>12</sup> genome copies per ml; UNC Vector Core Facility, Chapel Hill, NC) encoding Cre-dependent ChR2 (AAV2/8.EF1\u03b1.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-mCherry or AAV2/8.EF1\u03b1.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-EYFP), as described previously (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>). Injection coordinates were 0.8 mm anterior from Lambda, 1.3 mm lateral and 4.4 mm below pia for SNc, and 0.8 mm anterior from Lambda, 0.6 mm lateral and 4.4 mm below pia for VTA. Alternatively, ChR2(H134R)-EYFP was expressed genetically in Cre-containing cells by crossing <i>Slc6a3-ires-Cre</i>;<i>Drd2-Egfp</i> or <i>Slc6a3-ires-Cre</i>;<i>Drd1a-tdTomato</i> mice with Ai32 mice (stock # 012569; Jackson Labs) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Madisen et al., 2012</a>). The knock-in lines used in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> include <i>Gad1-Egfp</i> (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tamamaki et al., 2003</a>) and <i>Gad2-ires-Cre</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib81\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>). The latter were crossed with mice bearing a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter transgene (Ai14; stock # 007914; Jackson Labs) to reveal the distribution of Cre<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>). Mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Only mice heterozygous for all transgenes were used for experiments."

Endogenous tdTomato and EGFP fluorescence were not immuno-enhanced. Double fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using a tyramide signal amplification method according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEL753001KT; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), as previously described (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kwon et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, brains from 4-week old mice were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. They were then cut in 25-\u03bcm-thick sections with a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL), postfixed in 4% PFA, acetylated in 1% triethanolamine and 0.25% acetic anhydride, dehydrated serially in ethanol, bleached in 3% hydrogen peroxide diluted in methanol, prehybridized, and hybridized at 65\u00b0C using the following anti-sense probes provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (riboprobe ID specified in parentheses): <i>Gad1</i> (RP_040324_01_F01), <i>Gad2</i> (RP_071018_02_B07), <i>Vmat2</i> (RP_071218_02_B08), mouse <i>Gat1</i> (RP_071204_04_H01), mouse <i>Gat4</i> (RP_050428_04_D04), and <i>Abat</i> (RP_050301_02_C02). For in vitro transcription, each cDNA was cloned out from a mouse brain cDNA library using the primer sets suggested in the in situ hybridization data portal from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Two fluorescein- or digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes generated by an in vitro transcription method (Promega, Madison, WI) were hybridized simultaneously and stained by fluorescein or Cy3 chromogens, respectively.

                                "text": "Acute brain slices and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from identified SPNs were obtained using standard methods, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, mice (49\u2013178 days old; median = 107 days) were anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 11 glucose (295 mOsm\u00b7kg<sup>\u22121</sup>). Parasagittal slices of striatum (275-\u03bcm thick) were subsequently obtained in cold choline-based cutting solution (in mM: 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 glucose, 11.6 ascorbic acid, and 3.1 pyruvic acid). Following 15 min recovery in ACSF at 34\u00b0C, slices were kept at room temperature (20\u201322\u00b0C) until use. All solutions were constantly bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were established from direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs in dorsal or ventral striatum resting 18\u201375 \u03bcm below the slice surface (median: 40 \u03bcm) in ACSF warmed to 32\u201334\u00b0C. Direct-pathway SPNs were identified as tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells in <i>Drd1a-tdTomato</i> mice or EGFP<sup>\u2013</sup>cells in <i>Drd2-EGFP</i> mice, and indirect-pathway SPNs as tdTomato<sup>\u2212</sup>or EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in <i>Drd1a-tdTomato</i> and <i>Drd2-EGFP</i> mice, respectively. Patch pipettes (2\u20134 M\u2126) were filled with (in mM) 125 CsCl, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 Cs-EGTA, 3.3 QX-314 (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>salt), 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 Na<sub>2</sub>-Phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH; 295 mOsm\u00b7kg<sup>\u22121</sup>). The recording perfusate always contained NBQX (10 \u03bcM) and R-CPP (10 \u03bcM) to block AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated inward currents, respectively, as well as CGP55845 (2\u20135 \u03bcM) to prevent GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-evoked pre- and post-synaptic modulation. For some experiments (<a href=\"#fig6 fig8\">Figures 6 and 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1 fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>), slices were incubated for at least 30 min (and up to two hours) in ACSF containing CGP55845 (2\u20135 \u03bcM) in addition to vigabatrin (100 \u03bcM), muscimol (0.1 \u03bcM), or SKF 89976A (10 \u03bcM) + SNAP-5114 (50 \u03bcM) to allow for the depletion of cytosolic GABA levels and synaptic vesicles containing GABA, and to control for the effects of chronically elevated GABAergic signaling. In these cases, drugs continued to be present in the recording chamber for the duration of the experiment. For <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, GABA (100 \u03bcM, in ACSF containing either 5 \u03bcM CGP55845 or 5 \u03bcM CGP55845 + 10 \u03bcM SKF 89976A + 50 \u03bcM SNAP-5114) was locally applied to the slice via a gravity-fed 250-\u03bcm-wide flow pipe for 5\u201310 min prior to recording. For all voltage-clamp experiments, errors due to the voltage drop across the series resistance (&lt;20 M\u03a9) were left uncompensated. Membrane potentials were corrected for a \u223c5-mV liquid junction potential. Under these conditions, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated currents appeared inward when SPNs were held at negative membrane potentials (<i>V</i><sub>hold</sub> = \u221270 mV). To activate ChR2-expressing fibers, light from a 473-nm laser (Optoengine, Midvale, UT) was focused on the back aperture of the microscope objective to produce wide-field illumination of the recorded cell. Brief pulses of light (1-ms duration; 5 mW\u00b7mm<sup>\u22122</sup> under the objective for maximal stimulation, 0.3\u20132 mW\u00b7mm<sup>\u22122</sup>, for sub-maximal stimulation) were delivered at the recording site at 30 s intervals under control of the acquisition software. Epifluorescence illumination was used sparingly to minimize ChR2 activation prior to recording. eIPSCs were evoked using constant-current pulses (0.1 ms, 7\u201390 \u03bcA) delivered every 15 s through a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrodes positioned within striatum, 100\u2013200 \u03bcm away from the recorded cell. Constant-potential amperometry was performed as before (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tritsch et al., 2012</a>) using commercial glass-encased carbon-fiber microelectrodes (Carbostar-1, Kation Scientific, Minneapolis, MN) placed within dorsal striatum slices and held at 600 mV. All recordings were obtained within 4 hr of slicing. All pharmacological agents were obtained from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN)."

High-resolution images of regions of interest were subsequently acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center). Individual imaging planes were overlaid and quantified for colocalization in ImageJ (NIH) and thresholded for display in Photoshop (Adobe). Confocal images in figures represent maximum intensity projections of 3-\u00b5m confocal stacks. Membrane currents were amplified and low-pass filtered at 3 kHz using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), digitized at 10 kHz and acquired using National Instruments acquisition boards and a custom version of ScanImage (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pologruto et al., 2003</a>; available upon request or from <a href=\"https://openwiki.janelia.org/wiki/display/ephus/ScanImage\">https://openwiki.janelia.org/wiki/display/ephus/ScanImage</a>) written in MATLAB (Mathworks). Electrophysiology data were analyzed offline using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Natick, MA). In figures, voltage-clamp traces represent the averaged waveform of 3\u20135 consecutive acquisitions. Averaged waveforms were used to obtain current latency, peak amplitude, 10\u201390% rise time and decay time constant. The latter was estimated by measuring the time elapsed from the peak of the IPSC to 1/<i>e</i> (36.8%) of the peak amplitude. Detection threshold for sIPSCs was set at 40 pA to facilitate event detection in the presence of large and noisy tonic GABA currents. For pharmacological analyses in <a href=\"#fig2 fig3\">Figures 2 and 3</a>, the peak amplitude of IPSCs measured 3\u20134 min following the onset of drug perfusion were averaged, normalized to baseline averages obtained immediately prior to drug application and compared statistically to values obtained at corresponding times in control preparations bathed in ACSF. Data (reported in text and figures as mean \u00b1 SEM) were compared using Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) with the following non-parametric statistical tests (as indicated in the text): Mann\u2013Whitney for group comparisons, Wilcoxon signed-rank for paired comparisons, and Kruskal\u2013Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test for multiple group comparisons. In experiments characterizing the time course of synaptic transmission rundown, two-way ANOVAs were used followed by the Sidak's and Tukey's multiple comparison tests for comparisons between two and more conditions, respectively. p values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. N values represent the number of recorded cells. For most experiments, a single cell was recorded from in each slice, with each animal contributing fewer than five recordings to individual data sets."

In this report they extend their studies from the nigrostriatal pathway to the mesolimbic pathway. Interestingly GABA is supplied not by synthetic enzymes in the neurons, but rather by expression of membrane GABA transporters. As previously shown, vesicular uptake of GABA can be performed by the vesicular monamine transporter VMAT2. The questions addressed in this manuscript are whether such corelease occurs in the mesolimbic pathway and whether the agonist is GABA or a related analog."

These experiments are carefully conducted and well presented and convincingly demonstrate that GABA is the principal agonist and that the main source is membrane uptake rather than intracellular synthesis. Although these results are somewhat predictable from prior studies and could be further extended, the results are important in understanding the rather novel, albeit still somewhat mysterious, role of a fast-acting transmitter in midbrain dopamine neurons, and thus should be of interest to a broad community of neuroscientists.

It would be helpful if the authors could address this surprising result \u2013 previous work has indicated expression of GAT-1 by SPNs and an effect of a different inhibitor (NO-711) on amplitude and decay time of events evoked by local depolarization (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kirmse et al. 2008</a>)."

However, it is also possible that dopamine neurons make GABA themselves, and the main argument used here against this is the apparent lack of expression by a variety of criteria. Although these seem reasonable, other work cited by the authors in a different context (<a href=\"#bib77\">Stensrud et al. 2013</a>) along with other work they do cite suggests expression of GAD by a subset of dopamine neurons. Rather than rely on the anatomy, it would help greatly to demonstrate that inactivation of GAD specifically in dopamine neurons does not eliminate the dopaminergic IPSCs. This might require a substantial amount of work that would lie outside the scope of this manuscript (for example a double knockout of both isoforms that is conditional and may not even be available), but it would certainly be helpful. However, showing that expression of a GAD isoform in dopamine neurons makes the dopaminergic IPSCs resistant to inhibition of GAT-1 would be considerably simpler."

It would be great if the authors could address this point, and one way might be to determine whether GAT-1 inhibition influences dopamine release measured by voltammetry-GABA corelease by many terminals should have some effect on total dopamine release, but involvement of only a subset would produce minimal if any effect. This would also help to address one important functional outcome of corelease that has not yet been examined."

This indicates that blocking membrane GABA reuptake does not immediately interfere with the ability of dopaminergic terminals to release GABA, presumably because synaptic vesicles are already filled and cytoplasmic GABA levels have not yet been depleted. In <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, slices were incubated for thirty or more minutes in SKF89976A + SNAP-5114 to allow for depletion of cytoplasmic (and by extension vesicular) GABA in dopaminergic synapses.

Specifically, we show that, in addition to reducing the amplitude of optogenetically-evoked IPSCs, prolonged GAT blockade significantly accelerates rundown of GABAergic transmission. We did not detect differences in either the amplitude of IPSCs or the time course of rundown between slices that were incubated in SKF89976A + SNAP-5114 for less than one hour or between one and two hours, indicating that rundown is activity dependent. Importantly, preventing membrane GABA uptake for thirty minutes or longer does not prevent synaptic release of dopamine from nigrostriatal axons or GABA from striatopallidal terminals indicating that SKF89976A and SNAP-5114 do not impair synaptic transmission non-specifically. These results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that chronic block of membrane GABA reuptake selectively inhibit GABAergic transmission at dopaminergic synapses by depleting cytosolic GABA levels."

It is unlikely that selective expression of mGAT1 in dopamine neurons fully accounts for this difference, as mGAT1 is expressed widely throughout the brain, including in the striatum. However, it is possible that dopaminergic synapses rely exclusively on mGAT1 for membrane GABA transport, whereas classical GABAergic synapses may utilize other transporters in the presence of SKF89976A, such as mGAT4. Indeed, the tonic GABA current evoked by acute bath application of SKF89976A and SNAP-5114 (a mGAT4 antagonist) is more than twice that of SKF89976A alone (picrotoxin-evoked current in SKF89976A: 90 \u00b1 9 pA, n = 15 SPNs; in SKF89976A+SNAP-5114: 198 \u00b1 29 pA, n = 10 SPNs; P = 0.005, Mann Whitney test). Additional factors may contribute to differences in the sensitivity of IPSC kinetics to GAT blockers, including GABAA receptor subunit composition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al. 2008</a>), GABAA receptor desensitization (Overstreet et al. 2000; <a href=\"#bib63\">Overstreet and Westbrook 2001</a>), stimulation strength (<a href=\"#bib38\">Isaacson et al. 1993</a>) and synapse density (<a href=\"#bib64\">Overstreet and Westbrook, 2003</a>), amongst others."

The effect on IPSC kinetics consisted of a slight increase (13 %) in the time taken for the current to decay to 10 % of the peak amplitude in P12-14 slices recorded at ambient temperature. It is unclear whether a significant effect would have been detected using more classical measures of decay time, or if this effect would be maintained in older animals and at elevated temperatures.
