Reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment through genetic activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-associated transcription factor ATF6 attenuates secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we employed a screening approach that included complementary arm-specific UPR reporters and medium-throughput transcriptional profiling to identify non-toxic small molecules that phenocopy the ATF6-mediated reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment. The ER reprogramming afforded by our molecules requires activation of endogenous ATF6 and occurs independent of global ER stress. Furthermore, our molecules phenocopy the ability of genetic ATF6 activation to selectively reduce secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. These results show that small molecule-dependent ER reprogramming, achieved through preferential activation of the ATF6 transcriptional program, is a promising strategy to ameliorate imbalances in ER function associated with degenerative protein aggregation diseases."

Reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment through genetic activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-associated transcription factor ATF6 attenuates secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we employed a screening approach that included complementary arm-specific UPR reporters and medium-throughput transcriptional profiling to identify non-toxic small molecules that phenocopy the ATF6-mediated reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment. The ER reprogramming afforded by our molecules requires activation of endogenous ATF6 and occurs independent of global ER stress. Furthermore, our molecules phenocopy the ability of genetic ATF6 activation to selectively reduce secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. These results show that small molecule-dependent ER reprogramming, achieved through preferential activation of the ATF6 transcriptional program, is a promising strategy to ameliorate imbalances in ER function associated with degenerative protein aggregation diseases."

ER PN remodeling can be achieved by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), comprising three signaling pathways activated downstream of the ER stress sensing proteins IRE1, ATF6, and PERK (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). In response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER (i.e., ER stress), these sensors are activated, resulting in ER PN reprogramming predominantly mediated by the UPR-associated transcription factors XBP1s and ATF6. These transcription factors induce distinct, but overlapping, transcriptional programs that alter the composition of ER PN pathways (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adachi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shoulders et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yamamoto et al., 2004</a>). Intriguingly, preferential ATF6-mediated reprogramming of the ER PN offers a unique opportunity to alter the fate of disease-associated proteins. Genetic activation of the ATF6 transcriptional program attenuates intracellular accumulation of mutant rhodopsin and the Z-variant of A1AT (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chiang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, stress-independent chemical genetic activation of a ligand-regulated ATF6 attenuates the secretion and extracellular aggregation of destabilized, amyloidogenic variants of TTR or immunoglobulin light chains (LCs), without significantly impacting secretion of stable, non-amyloidogenic variants of these proteins or the global endogenous secreted proteome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cooley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shoulders et al., 2013</a>).

Small molecule kinase inhibitors and ATP mimetics have been shown to activate the IRE1/XBP1s arm of the UPR (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mendez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Papa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2012</a>).

Nonetheless, prioritized compounds such as <b>147</b> and <b>263</b> function through a mechanism that requires endogenous ATF6. ATF6 is activated through a mechanism distinct to that utilized by the two other arms of the UPR. In response to ER stress, ATF6 traffics to the Golgi where it is endoproteolytically processed by S1P and S2P (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ye et al., 2000</a>). This releases the ATF6 bZIP transcription factor into the cytosol, facilitating its translocation to the nucleus where it promotes induction of the ATF6 transcriptional program. ATF6 is not known to contain any allosteric small molecule binding sites. Thus, it is likely that our molecules promote ATF6 activation through interactions with proteins that regulate its activity such as BiP and the PDIs. Both of these are predicted to be involved in initiating ATF6 trafficking to the Golgi, although their role in this process remains poorly defined (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nadanaka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shen et al., 2002</a>). Our small molecules could also preferentially induce ATF6 activity by targeting or mimicking metabolites required for activation of this pathway.

This suggests that the covalent modification of ATF6 or a protein involved in the regulation of ATF6 activity (e.g., BiP or PDIs) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nadanaka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shen et al., 2002</a>) by our small molecules could be involved in the activation mechanism. Future medicinal chemistry efforts will focus on exploring the mechanism of action of these compounds and the potential involvement of covalent protein modification for their activity."

MuDPIT experiments were performed by 5\u2009min sequential injections of 0, 10, 20, 30, \u2026, 100% buffer C (500\u2009mM ammonium acetate in buffer A) and a final step of 90% buffer C / 10% buffer B (20% water, 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% fomic acid, v/v/v) and each step followed by a gradient from buffer A (95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to buffer B. Electrospray was performed directly from the analytical column by applying a voltage of 2.5 kV with an inlet capillary temperature of 275\u00b0C. Data-dependent acquisition of MS/MS spectra was performed with the following settings: eluted peptides were scanned from 400 to 1800\u2009m/z with a resolution of 30000 and the mass spectrometer in a data dependent acquisition mode. The top ten peaks for each full scan were fragmented by HCD using a normalized collision energy of 30%, a 100 ms activation time, a resolution of 7500, and scanned from 100 to 1800\u2009m/z. Dynamic exclusion parameters were 1 repeat count, 30 ms repeat duration, 500 exclusion list size, 120\u2009s exclusion duration, and exclusion width between 0.51 and 1.51. Peptide identification and protein quantification was performed using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline Suite (IP2, Integrated Proteomics Applications, Inc., San Diego, CA) as described previously (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ryno et al., 2014</a>). The geneset analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a>) was performed analogous to the analysis of the RNA-seq data using the same proteins from the genesets for ATF6, XBP1s and PERK and log transformed fold changes of protein expression. The plots shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a> were prepared as box and whisker plots using Kaleidograph. Differential activation of the ATF6, XBP1s, and PERK target protein sets was assessed by one-way ANOVA and significance of pairwise comparison confirmed by unpaired t-test. The comparison of RNA-seq and proteomics data (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>) and the data for the geneset analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a>) are included as Source Data."

Wells were treated with DMSO or 10 \u00b5L of compounds and incubated for 16\u2009hr. Cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and washed two times in media. Small aliquots (10 \u00b5L) of cells were removed for a cytotoxicity assay as described above. Cells were resuspended in media (1\u2009mL for DMSO treatment) and the volume was adjusted for each treatment based on cell viability. Cells were conditioned in the media for 8\u2009hr and then were removed by centrifugation. The media samples were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00baC with recombinant Protein A \u2013 Sepharose 4B resin (Life Technologies) to remove fully assembled IgGs that interfere with LC aggregate detection. Cleared media samples were then heated to\u00a055\u00a0\u00baC for 8\u2009hr to induce LC aggregation, added to Blue-Native PAGE loading dye (10% glycerol, 0.5% Coomassie G-250) and then loaded onto 3\u201312% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies). The cathode buffer contained 50\u2009mM Tricene and 15\u2009mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0 with 0.02% Coomassie G-250. The anode buffer contained 50\u2009mM Bis-Tris pH 7.0. The gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes and LC was detected by rabbit anti-human \u03bb light chain polyclonal antibody (Bethyl\u00a0Laboratories), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were imaged using a chemiluminescence substrate (Luminata Forte Western Luminescence Substrate, EMD\u00a0Millipore) and imaged with a ChemiDoc XRS+ scanner (Bio-Rad)."

In this study, they wished to \"drug\" the ATF6 pathway of the UPR by specifically elevating it to enhance quality control mechanisms and prevent the secretion of amyloidogenic proteins. The approach is to screen compounds in cultured cells carrying an ATF6 specific reporter and filtering upregulation hits through secondary screens for quiescence of the other branches. In this way, no specific factor was targeted. Because the transcriptional programs of each pathway were already intensely studied, the authors use gene sets defined by previous studies to further categorize each compound. The authors screened over 600,000 compounds and found 281 that activated the ERSE reporter, with 200 of those displaying reduced activity for the IRE1 pathway. UPR target gene transcriptional profiling filtered out 79 compounds that more strongly activate the ATF6 pathway. Of those, 3 (<b>132</b>, <b>147</b>, <b>263</b>) were used for detailed analyses. Genome wide mRNAseq and proteomic profiling was performed on cells treated with these compounds. <b>132</b> is the strongest inducer but it activates all three pathways. <b>147</b> and <b>263</b> are more specific for the ATF6 pathway but does so more weakly than <b>132</b>. All three activate ATF6 processing and can reduce the secretion of TTR and ALLC amyloidogenic molecules. Co-immunoprecipitation and cyclohexemide chase experiments indicate that retention is not accompanied by enhanced ER-associated degradation."

I see the only weakness of the manuscript in the presentation of the data, but a redesign of the manuscript should be sufficient to make this work accessible for a wider audience. Specifically, it is necessary to explain the overall screen design in a clearer fashion, and explain the selection of the \"preferential activators\", especially since some of them do not match the criteria of the counterscreen, and don't show selectivity for ATF6 (e.g. compound 238). The third screening step (transcriptional profiling) needs to be explained in more detail. For the remainder of the manuscript it would be helpful if the authors then focus on just the compounds that are characterized in detail in the last parts of the manuscript (e.g. just <b>147</b> and perhaps additionally <b>263</b>)."

I see the only weakness of the manuscript in the presentation of the data, but a redesign of the manuscript should be sufficient to make this work accessible for a wider audience. Specifically, it is necessary to explain the overall screen design in a clearer fashion, and explain the selection of the \"preferential activators\", especially since some of them do not match the criteria of the counterscreen, and don't show selectivity for ATF6 (e.g. compound <b>238</b>). The third screening step (transcriptional profiling) needs to be explained in more detail.

We also noted that many of our prioritized molecules contain functional groups found in pan- assay interference compounds (PAINS), including those highlighted in the above comment. The concern about these types of molecules primarily results from potential off-pathway effects that could compromise experimental analysis of their efficacy. Despite the presence of these PAIN functional groups, these compounds phenocopy genetic ATF6 activation in multiple complementary assays. In addition, RNA-seq and proteomic profiling confirms that these molecules exert very little off-pathway effects. This level of compound characterization provides a wealth of information to facilitate the efforts of researchers interested in using our molecules to ensure efficient ATF6 activation in their experimental systems. Consistent with this statement, we have distributed these molecules to &gt;10 laboratories already, all of whom have recapitulated the preferential ATF6 activation in a variety of cell systems including multiple mammalian cell lines, stem cells, and primary cells.
