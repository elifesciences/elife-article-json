Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance."

Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance."

Computational tools were used to predict the strength of binding between the RNAs found in the dominant forms of microbial life on Earth: the bacteria and the archaea. This approach revealed that the majority of messenger RNAs bind more weakly to the most common RNA molecules found in cells than would be expected by chance. Weakened binding should prevent the RNA molecules from becoming tangled with each other and ensure that protein levels are not perturbed by unintended interactions between highly expressed messages and other RNAs."

The findings show that taking this kind of avoidance into account can improve predictions about how much protein will be produced and should therefore make it easier to control protein production in experimental systems."

Yet, at best, these features account for only 40% of variation, and in some instances explain very little of the observed variation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kudla et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Maier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Goodman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2016</a>). Here we show that crosstalk interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs also impact protein abundance, and that such interactions have a greater effect than either mRNA secondary structure or codon usage. We measured interactions between a set of evolutionarily conserved core mRNAs and ncRNAs from 1700 prokaryotic genomes using minimum free energy (MFE) models. For 97% of species, we find a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls. Furthermore, by generating synonymously variant GFP mRNAs that differ in their potential to interact with core ncRNAs, we demonstrate that GFP expression levels can be both predicted and controlled. Our results demonstrate that there is strong selection for the\u00a0avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. Applying this knowledge to mRNA design will enable precise control of protein abundance through the incorporation or exclusion of inhibitory interactions with native ncRNAs."

Under-representation of interactions has been considered for the specific case of Shine-Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequences and the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Borg and Ehrenberg, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Diwan and Agashe, 2016</a>) and between microRNAs and 3' UTRs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartel and Chen, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Farh, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stark et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">van Dongen et al., 2008</a>). We computed the free energy distribution of interactions between highly conserved mRNA:ncRNA pairs and compared this to a number of negative control interactions, which serve to show the expected distribution of binding energy values (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The initiation of translation has been shown to be the rate limiting step for translation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tuller and Zur, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nakahigashi et al., 2014</a>), therefore, we focus our analysis on the first 21 nucleotides of the mRNA coding sequence (CDS). This has the further advantage of reducing computational complexity. We also test a variety of negative control mRNA regions, which are unlikely to play a functional role in RNA:ncRNA interactions. The mRNA controls include (1) di-nucleotide preserving shuffled sequences (<a href=\"#bib50\">Workman, 1999</a>) (orange, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), (2) homologous mRNAs from another phylum (with a compatible guanine-cytosine (G+C) content) (purple), (3) downstream regions 100 base pairs (bps) within the CDS (pink), (4) the reverse complement of the 5\u00b4 of CDSs (green), and lastly (5) unannotated (intergenic) genomic regions (yellow). Our interaction predictions in a single model strain show that native interactions consistently have higher (i.e. less stable) free energies than expected when compared to the five different mRNA negative controls: that is, there is a reduced capacity for native mRNAs and native ncRNAs to interact. We also compared different energy models and confirm that the MFE shift is a result of intermolecular binding (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). We subsequently deployed the most conservative negative control (i.e. di-nucleotide preserving shuffle) and free energy model (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) to detect if this shift for less stable binding of mRNA:ncRNA is true of all bacteria and archaea."

This is generally a biologically reasonable assumption when focussing on core genes based upon past analysis and our own work with RNA-seq data from a range of bacteria and archaea (Figure 4) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lindgreen et al., 2014</a>). Consequently, any potential mRNA interaction regions are saturated with ncRNA, therefore a summative model of interaction energies is a reasonable approximation to the estimated impact of excess hybridization. If modelling ncRNAs that are not so abundant, then a model weighted by expression level may be advantageous, but it is difficult to assess these across all conditions and developmental stages that are evolutionarily relevant. In order to ensure that our analysis is comparable across all bacteria and archaea we have focussed on just the most highly conserved ncRNA and protein-coding genes. Although, many of the ncRNAs are highly structured and are bound by RNA-binding proteins this is not the case during either synthesis and degradation of these products, furthermore, a fraction of the RNA components of these genes will be exposed. Therefore, we expect these will form useful datasets for initial testing of our hypothesis."

This measures a property that we call the \u2018extrinsic avoidance\u2018 of mRNA:ncRNA interactions, yet this approach may fail to identify genuine avoidance in cases when the G+C content differences between interacting RNAs is extreme. Measuring only extrinsic avoidance (using shuffled mRNAs as negative controls), we found that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in most (73%) of the prokaryotic phyla (p&lt;0.05, one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Therefore, there ought to be a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression. To assess this, we examined the relationship between potential stochastic interactions and the variation between mRNA and cognate protein levels for four previously published endogenous mass spectrometry datasets from <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Laurent et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kwon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lu et al., 2007</a>). We computed Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients between protein abundances and extrinsic avoidance, 5\u00b4 end internal mRNA secondary structure and codon usage. Of the three measures, avoidance is significantly correlated in all four datasets (Spearman\u2019s rho values are between 0.11\u20130.17 and corresponding p-values are between 0.01 and\u00a01.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u201312</sup>). In contrast, 5\u00b4 end mRNA structure significantly correlates in two datasets, and codon usage significantly correlates in all four datasets. This indicates that, despite strong selection against stochastic interactions, such interactions do significantly impact the proteome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). We have also conducted an \u2018outlier analysis\u2019 on one of the <i>E. coli</i> datasets (<a href=\"#bib24\">Laurent et al., 2010</a>). We have selected the top and bottom-most expressed genes relative to mRNA expression levels and computed Z-scores for each of codon-usage, internal secondary structure and avoidance measures. We found that avoidance measures show the most extreme shifts downwards for the bottom-most expressed genes and is shifted the highest for the top-most genes (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

This enables the assessment of the impact of synonymous changes on protein abundance using fluorescence. Avoidance and mRNA secondary structure are both significantly correlated with fluorescence, whereas codon usage is not (Spearman\u2019s rho values are 0.11 and 0.65, the corresponding p-values are 3.17\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221241</sup> and 1.69<sup>\u201320</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

We therefore predict that taking crosstalk into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled. To test this, we generated GFP constructs based on the following constraints: codon bias, 5\u00b4 end mRNA secondary structure stability and crosstalk avoidance (see Materials and methods). Our constructs are designed to capture the extremes of one variable, while controlling other variables (e.g. high or low avoidance and near-average codon bias and mRNA secondary structure). The G+C content, a known confounding factor, was also strictly controlled for each construct. We selected a commercial service to perform our GFP transformations to avoid possible bias and increase the robustness of our approach (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ioannidis and Khoury, 2011</a>). We predicted that a construct where all three parameters are optimised will result in a higher expression. Consistent with predictions, our optimised construct had maximal expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Our experimental results support the view that stochastic interactions are selected against, due to deleterious outcomes on expression. We suspect avoidance of crosstalk interactions has several evolutionary consequences. First, as transcriptional outputs become more diverse in evolution, we expect that the probability of stochastic interactions for both new ncRNAs and mRNAs becomes higher. This will impact the emergence of new, high abundance RNAs, since selection for high abundance may be mitigated by deleterious crosstalk events. Second, we predict that stochastic interactions limit the number of simultaneously transcribed RNAs, since the combinatorics of RNA:RNA interactions imply that eventually stochastic interactions cannot be avoided. This may in turn drive selection for forms of spatial or temporal segregation of transcripts. Finally, taking codon usage, mRNA secondary structure and potential mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account allows better prediction of proteome outputs from genomic data, and informs the precise control of protein levels via manipulation of synonymous mRNA sequences (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

The RNAup algorithm combines the intramolecular energy necessary to open binding sites with intermolecular energy gained from hybridization (<a href=\"#bib30\">M\u00fcckstein et al., 2006</a>). In other words, this approach minimizes the sum of opening intramolecular energies and the intermolecular energy (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In our model of avoidance, we test for a reduction in absolute binding MFE relative to negative controls as a measure of avoidance. After testing a variety of negative controls (e.g. dinucleotide preserved shuffled mRNAs, the 5\u00b4 end of homologous mRNAs from a different bacterial phylum, 100 nucleotides downstream of designated interaction region, reverse complements, and identically sized intergenic regions), we selected the dinucleotide frequency preserved shuffled sequences as our negative control since this displayed the most conservative interaction MFE distribution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). In more detail, to serve as a negative control we compute the interaction MFE between each of the core ncRNAs and 200 dinucleotide-preserved shuffled versions of the 5\u00b4\u00a0end mRNAs. A dinucleotide frequency preserving shuffling procedure is used, as Gibbs free energies are computed over base pair stacks, i.e. a dinucleotide alphabet, therefore this method has been shown to be important in order to minimise incorrect conclusions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Workman, 1999</a>). We tested if the energy difference between native and shuffled interaction distributions is statistically significant using the nonparametric one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, which returns a single p-value per genome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). If the distribution of native interaction energies for a genome is significantly higher (i.e. fewer stable interactions) than the negative control, this is an indication that the genome has undergone selection for mRNA:ncRNA avoidance. To create the background density difference lines (seen in grey at <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), we randomly selected 100 bacterial strains and plot differences between the densities of shuffled interactions."

These are where the intrinsic properties of mRNA and ncRNA sequences restrict their ability to interact. For an extreme example, if ncRNAs are composed entirely of guanine and cytosine nucleotides, whilst mRNAs are composed entirely of adenine and uracil nucleotides, then these will rarely interact. Therefore, our energy-based avoidance measures for native and shuffled interactions will both be near zero, and thus will not detect a significant energy shift between the native and control sequences. In order to account for some of these issues, we compared the G+C difference between core ncRNAs and core mRNAs. We used a nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there is a statistically significant G+C difference between the two samples: G+C of ncRNAs vs G+C of 5\u00b4 end mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>)."

We acquired previously published GFP data, associated fluorescence values and mRNA quantifications (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kudla et al., 2009</a>) via personal communication. Our avoidance model showed the highest and most significant correlation with GFP expression in that dataset (R<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.65,\u00a0p=1.69\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221220</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D,E,F</a>). 5\u00b4 end secondary structure (R<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.62,\u00a0p=5.73\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221218</sup>) correlates slightly less than avoidance, while CAI does not correlate significantly (R<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.02,\u00a0p=0.4)."

We now wish to test if avoidance can be used to design mRNA sequences that modulate the abundance of corresponding protein in a predictable fashion. We use a set of GFP mRNA constructs that all maintain the same G+C content, codon adaptation index (CAI) and internal secondary structure but host either very high or very low avoidance values. This procedure was repeated for the CAI and internal secondary structure values while maintaining a constant avoidance. The resulting 13 constructs were synthesised, transformed and expressed by commercial services. In the following paragraphs, we explained how we design our GFP constructs, the experimental set-up and statistical analyses."

In brief, these mRNA variants were scored based upon (1) CAI, (2) mRNA secondary structure in their 5\u00b4 end region, and (3) mRNA:ncRNA interaction avoidance in their 5\u00a0end region. The genome of <i>E. coli</i> BL21 encodes 52 unique core ncRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gardner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nawrocki et al., 2015</a>), to estimate the level of ncRNA avoidance for each GFP mRNA, we sum the binding MFEs. For example, for each GFP mRNA we compute 52 independent binding MFE values for each ncRNA. In short, a higher summed MFE score for a GFP mRNA implies a higher avoidance, while a lower summed MFE score implies a lower avoidance. This approach assumes that the ncRNAs are expressed at much higher levels than GFP mRNAs (i.e.\u00a0[ncRNA]\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0[mRNA]) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Consequently, any potential interaction site on GFP mRNAs are likely to be saturated with ncRNA. Finally, we selected 13 GFP mRNA constructs, while controlling the range of G+C values. These GFP mRNAs were designed to have four different aspects; extreme 5\u00a0end secondary structure (2 minimum and 2 maximum folding MFE constructs), extreme codon bias (2 maximum and 2 minimum CAI constructs), extreme interaction avoidance (2 minimum and 2 maximum binding MFE constructs) and an \u2018optimal\u2019 construct. The optimal construct was selected for a high CAI, low 5\u00b4 end structure and high avoidance. All extreme GFP mRNA constructs have near identical G+C content (between 0.468\u20130.480) and identical G+C contents at the 5\u00b4 end (0.48). Each of the sampled GFP mRNAs is separated from other mRNAs by at least 112 nucleotide substitutions and 122 nucleotide substitutions on average (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Plasmid DNA from each construct was transformed into an expression strain of <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3). Starter cultures were grown in quadruplicate from single colonies in 0.5\u00a0mL of TB kanamycin 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL media in a 96 deep-well microplate and incubated at\u00a030\u00b0C, 400\u00a0rpm (3\u00a0mm shaking throw). Each starter culture was used to inoculate 1.0\u00a0mL of the same media at a ratio of 1:50, each in a single well of a 96 deep-well plate. The cultures were incubated at 30\u00b0C, 400\u00a0rpm for 1 hr, at this point the cultures were chilled for 5 min then induced into 0.2\u00a0mM IPTG and incubated at 20\u00b0C. For analysis, culture samples of 100\u00a0\u03bcL were taken at 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr and 22 hr (overnight) hours post-induction (HPI) for fluorescence and optical density analysis. Samples were collected in PetriWell 96-well flat bottom, black upper, lidded microplates (Genetix). Cell density of fluorescence measurements was performed on a Spectramax M5 Microplate Reader using SMP software v 5.2 (Molecular Devices). For fluorescence intensity measurements, samples were collected in the 96-well plate listed above. Samples were analysed by bottom-read, 10 reads per well at an excitation wavelength =\u00a0488\u00a0nm, emission wavelength =\u00a0509\u00a0nm with an automatic cut-off at 495\u00a0nm and measured as relative fluorescence units (RFU). The raw RFU values were normalised by subtracting the averaged baseline values obtained from untransformed BL21(DE3) at the same time point. All samples at the 22 HPI time point were diluted 1:4 in TB kanamycin 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL media before measurement. Total RNA was purified from induced 0.5 mL of BL21(DE3) cultures on Maxwell\u00c2 16 robot (Promega) using LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit (Promega). RNA concentrations were assessed on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA synthesis was done using ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) according to manufacturer protocol using random primer. The rpsL gene was selected as the reference gene (internal control). RT-qPCR was performed in 384-well plates with a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Life Technology SYBR Green-based PCR assay. The data analysis was performed using Applied Biosystems QuantStudio software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The total volume of reaction was\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcL including 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM of each primer as a final concentration. The following PCR conditions were used: 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The melting curves were analyzed at 60\u201395\u00b0C after 40 cycles. RNA concentrations were subsequently estimated using the approach (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</a>).

They suggest that this base pairing causes some of the recognized disconnect between mRNA and protein levels, and that these stochastic interactions can have a bigger effect on protein production than either mRNA structure or codon bias. They propose a factor called 'avoidance', which refers to the potential of sequences within the first 21 nt of the mRNA to hybridize to ncRNAs, with lower potential for interaction yielding higher overall expression of the gene product."

The R<sup>2</sup> when combining all the parameters range from 0.7 (our data) to 0.2 (Goodman et al. data). By removing the avoidance measure from the linear model the R<sup>2</sup> values decrease between 19% and 56% from the R<sup>2</sup> values in the GFP datasets. In the mass-spec data the R2 values decrease between 3 and 0.2%. Compare this with when we remove internal secondary structure information the R<sup>2</sup> values decrease between 18% and -1% for GFP data, and between 1.5% and -0.02% for the mass-spec data. When we remove codon usage statistics the R<sup>2</sup> values decrease between -0.05% and -0.4% for GFP data, and between 9% and -0.06% for the mass-spec data. This is consistent with the avoidance model being at least as good an explanation for variation in protein expression as either internal secondary structure and codon usage statistics.

The tRNAs may be the least bound, by proteins (other than a transient interactions with tRNA synthetases and the ribosome).
