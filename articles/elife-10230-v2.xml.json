How a neural stem cell under homeostasis converts after injury to a highly regenerative cell remains unknown. Here, we show that during regeneration, axolotl neural stem cells repress neurogenic genes and reactivate a transcriptional program similar to embryonic neuroepithelial cells. This dedifferentiation includes the acquisition of rapid cell cycles, the switch from neurogenic to proliferative divisions, and the re-expression of planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway components. We show that PCP induction is essential to reorient mitotic spindles along the anterior-posterior axis of elongation, and orthogonal to the cell apical-basal axis. Disruption of this property results in premature neurogenesis and halts regeneration. Our findings reveal a key role for PCP in coordinating the morphogenesis of spinal cord outgrowth with the switch from a homeostatic to a regenerative stem cell that restores missing tissue."

How a neural stem cell under homeostasis converts after injury to a highly regenerative cell remains unknown. Here, we show that during regeneration, axolotl neural stem cells repress neurogenic genes and reactivate a transcriptional program similar to embryonic neuroepithelial cells. This dedifferentiation includes the acquisition of rapid cell cycles, the switch from neurogenic to proliferative divisions, and the re-expression of planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway components. We show that PCP induction is essential to reorient mitotic spindles along the anterior-posterior axis of elongation, and orthogonal to the cell apical-basal axis. Disruption of this property results in premature neurogenesis and halts regeneration. Our findings reveal a key role for PCP in coordinating the morphogenesis of spinal cord outgrowth with the switch from a homeostatic to a regenerative stem cell that restores missing tissue."

Therefore, Rodrigo Albors, Tazaki et al. measured gene activity in the neural stem cells involved in axolotl spinal cord regeneration to uncover how these cells develop into a more regenerative form. This revealed that when an axolotl tail is amputated, resident stem cells turn off the genes that are specifically active in neuron-generating cells. In addition, they activate a similar set of genes to that seen in the embryonic cells that form the developing nervous system. These genes speed up cell division and activate an important signaling pathway."

If this pathway is disrupted, the cells return to dividing unequally, generating nerve cells prematurely and halting the growth of the spinal cord. Such insights could help develop methods of repairing damaged nervous tissue in other animals that cannot regenerate to the extent that axolotls can."

Cells with stem cell features persist throughout life lining the spinal cord central canal of the axolotl. These cells divide occasionally to add neurons to the intact central nervous system of the axolotl, presumably by asymmetric divisions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Holder et al., 1991</a>). Following tail amputation, however, the pool of SOX2<sup>+</sup> neural stem cells located within 500 \u03bcm of the injury is mobilized to regenerate the missing portion of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fei et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">McHedlishvili et al., 2007</a>). First, these SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells proliferate extensively, expanding as a tube along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in concert with overall tail regeneration (<a href=\"#bib25\">Egar and Singer, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Holtzer, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">McHedlishvili et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Nordlander and Singer, 1978</a>). Although a few neurons from the source zone move and integrate into the regenerating cord, their contribution is minimal as they do not seem to dedifferentiate or divide during the process (<a href=\"#bib101\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>). It is later on, when the SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells closest to the amputation plane resume neurogenesis that the differentiated cell types of the new spinal cord are gradually replenished in a head-to-tail sequence while cells at the posterior end continue rapid expansion (<a href=\"#bib43\">Holtzer, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">McHedlishvili et al., 2007</a>). Importantly, lineage tracing of cells lining the central canal showed that at least some cells in the source zone become highly proliferative and multipotent, populating different dorsal-ventral regions of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib61\">McHedlishvili et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">McHedlishvili et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, clonal isolates, when transplanted into the regenerating spinal cord, contributed to neurons, astrocytes, as well as oligodendrocytes in all regions of the spinal cord, indicating that a single cell can give rise to all cells of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib62\">McHedlishvili et al., 2012</a>). Thus, cells in the axolotl spinal cord display features of true stem cells, since they can self renew and give rise to all the differentiated cell types of the new spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib23\">Echeverri and Tanaka, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">McHedlishvili et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">McHedlishvili et al., 2012</a>). How a stem cell that is neurogenic under homeostasis converts upon tail amputation to a highly regenerative stem cell remains unknown."

During spinal cord development, SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells residing in the so-called stem zone (SZ) progressively coalesce to form the neural plate (pre-neural tube, PNT) that then closes into the neural tube (<a href=\"#bib95\">Wilson et al., 2009</a>). Although PNT cells express <i>Sox2</i> they do not yet express neuronal transcription factors and thus, remain multipotent and proliferating (<a href=\"#bib19\">del Corral et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">del Corral and Storey, 2004</a>). Cells in the neural tube acquire neural progenitor identity as they start expressing neuronal transcription factors and commit to produce the cell types of the adult spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib19\">del Corral et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jessell, 2000</a>).

A critical part of this program is the reactivation of Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling precisely within the cells that will regenerate the new spinal cord. Investigation of this pathway during regeneration revealed that PCP simultaneously controlled posteriorward orientation of cell divisions and the switch from neurogenic divisions to those divisions that expanded the stem cell pool. Together, these findings provide new insights into how molecular cues initiated by injury control the cell biology of neural stem cells to yield complete spinal cord regeneration in the axolotl."

To establish whether regenerating axolotl neural stem cells dedifferentiate to an embryonic-like state we referred to expression profiling data of chick neural development that exploited the developmental gradient along the neuraxis to profile samples corresponding to the stem zone (SZ), pre-neural tube (PNT), caudal (CNT) and rostral neural tube (RNT) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2014</a>). To investigate the transcriptional profile of regenerating versus homeostatic axolotl neural stem cells we focused on axolotl orthologs to the 100 chicken genes that changed most significantly at the onset of neurogenesis, as captured in the pooled SZ+PNT and CNT+RNT comparison (50 upregulated and 50 downregulated genes) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2014</a>). Specifically, we isolated RNA from the uninjured spinal cord (day 0), the 500 \u03bcm source zone 1 day after amputation (day 1), and the regenerating spinal cord 6 days after amputation (day 6), and used NanoString technology (<a href=\"#bib32\">Geiss et al., 2008</a>) to measure transcript levels of the 100-gene set (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Differential expression analysis between regenerating and uninjured samples showed that most of the transcripts that are differentially regulated during development undergo significant regulation during regeneration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Direct comparison of changes in gene expression between datasets showed that 37 out of 50 chick genes low in the SZ+PNT versus CNT+RNT are downregulated in day 1 or day 6 axolotl samples compared to day 0, and 18 out of 50 chick genes high in the SZ+PNT versus CNT+RNT are upregulated in day 1 or day 6 axolotl samples (significant association, <i>p</i>=0.001294 as result of Fisher's exact test on count data) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

For that, we combined the above mitotic index measurements with a cumulative DNA labeling approach using the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Nowakowski et al., 1989</a>). Briefly, we collected tail tissue at different times of continuous BrdU labeling and calculated the fraction of BrdU-labeled cells lining the central canal of the spinal cord. The fraction of BrdU-labeled cells increased over time as cells duplicated their DNA, until all proliferating cells were labeled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In line with PCNA results, most cells in non-regenerative populations (0.80 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.82 \u00b1 0.01 in uninjured and non-regenerating region of the spinal cord,\u00a0respectively) and almost all cells in the regenerating spinal cord took up BrdU (0.96 \u00b1 0.01). However, the time needed to completely label the proliferating population of the regenerating spinal cord was much shorter (~31 h) than the time required for complete labeling of the uninjured (~192 h) and non-regenerating (~185 h) populations, suggesting that regenerating neural stem cells progress much faster through the cell cycle. By using a modeling approach (see Materials and methods), we calculated the average cell cycle length and the length of the different phases of the cell cycle for the different populations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These calculations indicated that uninjured and non-regenerating populations have an average cell cycle of 324 h \u00b1 21 h and 339 h \u00b1 32 h, respectively. In contrast, regenerating cells undergo significantly shorter cell cycles (119 h \u00b1 10 h).

We then quantified the fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells that were positive or not for the neural stem cell marker SOX2 in regenerating and non-regenerating regions of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). While in the non-regenerating region 84% \u00b1 2% of the EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were SOX2<sup>+</sup>, in the regenerating spinal cord virtually all EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were SOX2<sup>+</sup> (99% \u00b1 1%) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). These observations indicated that whereas non-regenerating cells presumably exit the cell cycle to produce SOX2<sup>-</sup> neurons, regenerating cells undergo proliferative divisions at least during the first 8 days of regeneration. It should be noted that the difference in neurogenesis between the non-regenerating and the regenerating spinal cord is underestimated in this measurement paradigm due to the large difference in cell cycle lengths. Within the six day labeling period, all of the regenerating SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells were expected to complete at least one cell cycle, whereas, only 50% of the SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells would have completed a full cell cycle. Normalizing for this difference, we would expect that after a full cell cycle, only 70% of the EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the non-regenerating portion would express SOX2. Together, these results indicate that neural stem cells speed up their cell cycle as they switch from a neurogenic to a proliferative mode of division that leads to the exponential-like growth of the regenerating spinal cord."

Because Wnts, like Wnt5a, can signal through the PCP pathway to drive tissue growth and morphogenesis during embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Wallingford, 2012</a>), we set out to investigate how this pathway may be contributing to the efficient, tube-like extension of the neural stem cell pool during regeneration. We first documented the spatiotemporal distribution of <i>Wnt5a</i> and <i>Wnt5b</i> transcripts by in situ hybridization. Intriguingly, we found graded upregulation of <i>Wnt5a</i> and <i>Wnt5b</i> transcripts precisely in the regeneration source zone 1 day after amputation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The upregulation of <i>Prickle1</i> followed from day 3 and continued to be expressed in the caudal-most region of the regenerating spinal cord. We then endeavored to measure the size of the Prickle1 zone at different time-points of regeneration. Since it is not possible to capture the entire spinal cord length in sagittal sections of later stage regenerates, we determined the length of the Prickle1 positive zone by counting the number of consecutive cross-sections in which <i>Prickle1</i> in situ signal was visibly stronger in spinal cord cells than elsewhere (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). As the regenerating spinal cord grew along its AP axis, the Prickle1 zone increased in size (429 \u00b1 32 \u03bcm at day 3 and 981 \u00b1 74 \u03bcm at day 6). At day 14, the Prickle1 zone covered the caudal-most ~1600 \u03bcm of the regenerating spinal cord (1579 \u00b1 75 \u03bcm) but <i>Prickle1</i> transcripts returned to undetectable levels close to the amputation plane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Remarkably, the Prickle1 zone correlated with regions of a simple neuroepithelial structure that have yet to initiate robust neurogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

Because oriented cell divisions are a classical read-out of PCP in proliferating and elongating tissues (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fischer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Matsuyama et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Quesada-Hernandez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Saburi et al., 2008</a>), we set out to investigate the spatial aspects of cell division in the regenerating spinal cord. To measure cell division orientation, we produced image stacks across thick spinal cord cross-sections using confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). From these stacks we extracted two vectors, the vector between the two mitotic spindle poles of late anaphase or telophase cells (<i>S</i>) and the vector of the AP axis of the spinal cord (<i>AP</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). From these vectors, we calculated the projection of the spindle on the AP axis (<i>Proj <sup>S</sup><sub>AP</sub></i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and see Materials and methods). This parameter ranges from 0, for cells dividing orthogonal to the AP axis, to 1, for cells dividing parallel the AP axis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The <i>Proj <sup>S</sup><sub>AP</sub></i> value was plotted for each mitotic cell according to its AP position along the spinal cord, what allowed us to record whether cells fell within or outside the Prickle1 zone (as measured in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We found that cells within the Prickle1 zone were significantly biased to divide parallel to the AP axis, whereas cells outside of the Prickle1 zone divided randomly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These observations raised the possibility that PCP mechanisms orient the axis of cell division along the AP axis."

The function of PCP in many tissues has been tested via overexpression of core PCP components which presumably overwhelms the localization machinery and therefore disorients PCP (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib38\">Gray et al., 2011</a>]) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carreira-Barbosa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cho et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Goto and Keller, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Gubb et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Jessen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Tree et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wallingford and Harland, 2001</a>). Studies in <i>Drosophila</i> have classified PCP phenotypes into two classes. Deletion or overexpression of certain core PCP components such as Prickle randomize cell polarization cell autonomously only in those cells in which Prickle expression levels are deranged (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gubb and Garcia-Bellido, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lawrence et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Strutt and Strutt, 2007</a>). In contrast, a second class, which includes Vangl2, yields non cell-autonomous defects in PCP both in the cells with expression defects as well as their surrounding neighbors (<a href=\"#bib91\">Vinson and Adler, 1987</a>). Similarly, the lack or excess of Vangl2 in vertebrates propagates polarity defects non-cell autonomously, spreading the PCP defect through the tissue (<a href=\"#bib17\">Darken et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Mitchell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Montcouquiol et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sienknecht et al., 2011</a>). We took advantage of these two modes of disrupting PCP to study the cellular and tissue roles of PCP in the regenerating neural stem cells. To test a functional link between PCP and oriented cell division, we overexpressed <i>Prickle1</i> in spinal cord cells by electroporation of an axolotl <i>Prickle1</i> plasmid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). Quantitative real time PCR confirmed 10-fold higher <i>Prickle1</i> expression at day 6 in <i>Prickle1</i>-electroporated spinal cords than in controls (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, because on average only 21.5% of the spinal cord cells overexpressed <i>Prickle1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the levels of <i>Prickle1</i> per electroporated cell were actually much higher. We focused on these electroporated, <i>Prickle1</i>-overexpressing cells to investigate whether excess <i>Prickle1</i> perturbed polarized cell divisions in the electroporated cells. Analysis of mCherry-only electroporated cells indicated that these cells displayed the same bias to divide parallel to the AP axis within the Prickle1 zone as in non-electroporated animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In contrast, this bias in division orientation was lost in <i>Prickle1</i>-overexpressing cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). <i>Prickle1</i>-overexpressing cells, however, continued to divide at a similar rate than control-electroporated cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, PCP operates during spinal cord regeneration and one of its roles is to orient the axis of cell division along the rapidly elongating AP axis."

Note that control cells divide randomly within the Prickle1-negative zone (day 3 n=22 cells, day 6 n=34, day 14 n=22 cells), but show significant bias towards the AP axis within the Prickle1 zone (day 3 n=17 cells, day 6 n=27, day 14 n=21 cells). The bias to divide along the AP axis is lost in cells overexpressing <i>Prickle1</i> within the Prickle1 zone (day 3 n=22 cells, day 6 n=18 cells, day 14=28 cells). Cells pooled from at least 4 tails/group.

We co-electroporated <i>Vangl2</i> plasmid together with mCherry and mCherry alone as control, amputated the tails, and followed the regenerative growth of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Measurements of spinal cord outgrowth at day 4 and day 6 showed that spinal cords overexpressing <i>Vangl2</i> were shorter than controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Since PCP instructs cells in the regenerating spinal cord to divide along the elongating AP axis, it is possible that disrupting PCP misplaces daughter cells and leads to less efficient AP extension. If that was the case, we expected to find more cells within the cross-sectional circumference of <i>Vangl2</i>-overexpressing spinal cords. Indeed, we counted a greater number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells on cross-sections of <i>Vangl2</i>-overexpressing spinal cords compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Together, these observations point to the classical shorter and broader PCP phenotype and confirm that PCP mechanisms are required for efficient extension of the regenerating spinal cord."

The observation that the spindles oriented parallel to the AP axis implied that those spindles also tended to lie parallel to the apical surface of the spinal cord and therefore would have vertical cleavage planes. During development, such vertical cleavage planes with respect to the apical surface of the neural tube result in symmetric proliferative divisions, leading to the expansion of the early neuroepithelial cell pool (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Das and Storey, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Peyre and Morin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Xie et al., 2013</a>). We thus asked whether the shortened spinal cord in <i>Vangl2</i>-overexpressing axolotls was due solely to reduced morphogenetic extension along the AP axis, or whether randomizing the axis of cell division additionally caused defects related to stem cell self-renewal\u00a0and\u00a0expansion. In order to confirm disruption of the orderly spindle orientation by Vangl2 overexpression, we first examined the cleavage plane of mitotic cells within the source zone of control and <i>Vangl2</i>-overexpressing spinal cords 4 days after tail amputation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). We found a tight distribution of vertically oriented cleavage planes in control-electroporated spinal cords, whereas mitotic cells within the regenerating stem cell pool of <i>Vangl2</i>-overexpressing spinal cords displayed a more variable distribution of cleavage planes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), indicating a relaxation in the constraint to divide with vertical cleavage planes."

Interestingly, at day 4 the density of PH3<sup>+</sup> cells was similar in control and <i>Vangl2</i>-overexpressing spinal cords.

In agreement with BrdU experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), a substantial number of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells differentiated into neurons within the 6-day labeling period in the non-regenerating region of the spinal cord, and <i>Vangl2</i> overexpression had no effect on the fraction of neurons formed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, while practically no neurons were born during the labeling time in the regenerating region of control spinal cords, we found a significant number of newborn neurons in <i>Vangl2</i>-overexpressing spinal cords (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Taken together, these findings indicate that PCP is an essential mediator of the switch from the neurogenic divisions seen in the uninjured spinal cord to the proliferative divisions observed in the regenerating spinal cord at least during the first 8 days of regeneration. Perturbing PCP by overexpression of <i>Vangl2</i> results in more variable mitotic cleavage planes and premature neurogenesis that presumably reduces the numbers of proliferative cells and hampers regenerative spinal cord growth."

This overall difference in regenerative success among vertebrates is largely reflected in differences in daughter cell fate decisions. In mammals, spinal cord lesions induce neural stem cells to proliferate and give rise mainly to scar-forming astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barnabe-Heider et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Meletis et al., 2008</a>).

For example, during development the onset of retinoic acid signalling halts the expansion of neural progenitors and drives them to make neurons in the developing spinal cord. In our gene expression analysis, retinoic acid-target genes such as <i>Rarb, Crabp1,</i> and <i>Meis2</i>, become downregulated in the regenerating spinal cord, suggesting that signals that promote neurogenesis programs are shut down to possibly allow the execution of self-renewing,\u00a0multipotent programs during regeneration. In the embryo, the somites produce retinoic acid. In the axolotl, the tail muscles might continue supplying retinoic acid postnatally. The decline in retinoic acid signaling that we observe during regeneration may be related to the fragmentation of the flanking muscle fibers after amputating the tail, that degenerate and might therefore stop supplying retinoic acid. This would allow the spinal cord cells close to the amputation site to re-acquire a multipotent state and grow into the tail blastema. Intriguingly, we noticed that when muscles start regenerating at the amputation site, neural stem cells start resuming neurogenesis. Further studies will be needed to address the relationship between mesodermal tissue, neurogenesis, and retinoic acid."

An important aspect of our findings is that, during regeneration, the implementation of PCP mechanisms coordinately orients tubular outgrowth and switches the mode of cell division from a neurogenic to an expansive, proliferative mode of division. PCP has previously been implicated in the extension of tubular structures such as kidney tubules (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fischer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Karner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Lienkamp et al., 2012</a>) and on the other hand has been associated with expansion of muscle satellite stem cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Le Grand et al., 2009</a>). In the developing mouse brain, Vangl2 malfunction interferes with normal spindle positioning and leads to premature terminal differentiation of neural progenitors (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lake and Sokol, 2009</a>). In the regenerating axolotl spinal cord both aspects of PCP appear to operate simultaneously to elicit efficient expansion of the neural stem cell pool in a tubular form. Although here we have focused on the role of PCP in controlling the orientation of cell division, the extension of the regenerating spinal cord tube may also rely on other proliferation-independent, PCP-oriented cell behaviors such as convergence and extension (<a href=\"#bib93\">Wallingford, 2012</a>)."

Intriguingly, graded Wnt5a and Wnt5b upregulation is a common feature of regenerative systems such as the lizard tail (<a href=\"#bib45\">Hutchins et al., 2014</a>), the salamander limb (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ghosh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Knapp et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Wu et al., 2013</a>), and the tail and spinal cord of salamander, fish, and <i>Xenopus</i> (this study and <a href=\"#bib12\">Caubit et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Stoick-Cooper, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hui et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Sugiura, 2009</a>). Yet, the role of Wnt5 in the regeneration field has remained controversial. In zebrafish fin regeneration, constitutive overexpression of Wnt5 halts regeneration while in <i>Xenopus</i>, grafting Wnt5-expressing cells yields the generation of a complete ectopic tail (<a href=\"#bib84\">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Sugiura et al., 2009</a>). Our study suggests that Wnt5 gradients may implement PCP to re-establish the axis of polarity needed to drive polarized, regenerative tissue outgrowth. It is thus possible that the contradictory results in <i>Xenopus</i> and zebrafish studies are due to the experimental approach taken to investigate the role of Wnt5a. In the fin, global overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited regeneration, which was interpreted to mean that non-canonical Wnt signalling inhibits regeneration. However, since as we and others have shown, excess of PCP signaling has negative effects on regeneration and so it is likely that this global overexpression was in fact deranging PCP, leading to inefficient regeneration. Alternatively, the relative wiring between the canonical and non-canonical branches of the Wnt signalling pathway may be different in the zebrafish fin and spinal cord compared to the regenerating amphibian tail leading to different influences on regeneration."

The work identifies non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling as a key player in this process, including transcriptional up-regulation of mediators of this pathway and its requirement for a switch from neuron generating to progenitor generating divisions in the regenerating neural tube. The authors further show that this correlates with the ability of PCP signaling to influence mitotic spindle orientation and so identify a cell biological explanation for this change in cell behaviour. The authors take advantage of some interesting tools; the paper is well written, and the data robust. These findings are interesting and might be important for understanding the spinal cord regeneration mechanisms in general."

The work in development clearly shows that Wnt5 expression is associated with outgrowths of both epithelium and mesenchyme-containing structures. The functional analysis of Wnt5 in different regeneration systems has not yielded as uniform of a conclusion. While in amphibians Wnt5 is clearly associated with tail outgrowth (for example this study and PMID: 18977433), in the zebrafish, fin activation of Wnt5 supressed regeneration (PMID: 17185322). It is unclear if this latter observation is due to the global activation of Wnt5 signalling, which would derange PCP making regeneration less directed, or whether, as hypothesize as the authors, this reflects an antagonism between canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways in fin cells. To our knowledge, the role of Wnt/PCP signalling after spinal cord injury has not been studied in zebrafish or mouse, but would clearly be important for comparative purposes."

In another project in the laboratory we are starting to study these issues with respect to myotome regeneration, and therefore eventually we will link the differentiation of myotomal tissues with the onset of neurogenesis in the spinal cord. The focus of the current manuscript is primarily the early switch from the uninjured state to the PNT-like state. Taking all into consideration, an experimental link between RA from non-spinal cord sources and neurogenesis will be taken up in a future manuscript."

At this stage, Vangl2 overexpressing spinal cords extend rather normally. In a second project in the laboratory, we have followed labeled cells or small clusters during spinal cord regeneration quantitatively based on their initial position behind the amputation plane. This data, along with some of the data presented in the current manuscript, are being used to construct a quantitative model of regeneration. The results so far indicate that migration plays a minor role in spinal cord regeneration, and that growth can be explained largely by proliferation and some slight \u201cpushing\u201d from more anterior cells, due to their slow expansion. This is an extensive project and will not be submitted prior to the current manuscript. We would prefer to keep that work separate, but are happy to provide the data for perusal when requested."
