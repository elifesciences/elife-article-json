Muscle fibers are particularly susceptible to injury, and defective sarcolemma resealing causes muscular dystrophy. Caveolae accumulate in dystrophic muscle fibers and caveolin and cavin mutations cause muscle pathology, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that muscle fibers and other cell types repair membrane wounds by a mechanism involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis of lysosomes, release of acid sphingomyelinase, and rapid lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis. Wounding or exposure to sphingomyelinase triggered endocytosis and intracellular accumulation of caveolar vesicles, which gradually merged into larger compartments. The pore-forming toxin SLO was directly visualized entering cells within caveolar vesicles, and depletion of caveolin inhibited plasma membrane resealing. Our findings directly link lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis to the maintenance of plasma membrane and muscle fiber integrity, providing a mechanistic explanation for the muscle pathology associated with mutations in caveolae proteins."

Muscle fibers are particularly susceptible to injury, and defective sarcolemma resealing causes muscular dystrophy. Caveolae accumulate in dystrophic muscle fibers and caveolin and cavin mutations cause muscle pathology, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that muscle fibers and other cell types repair membrane wounds by a mechanism involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis of lysosomes, release of acid sphingomyelinase, and rapid lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis. Wounding or exposure to sphingomyelinase triggered endocytosis and intracellular accumulation of caveolar vesicles, which gradually merged into larger compartments. The pore-forming toxin SLO was directly visualized entering cells within caveolar vesicles, and depletion of caveolin inhibited plasma membrane resealing. Our findings directly link lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis to the maintenance of plasma membrane and muscle fiber integrity, providing a mechanistic explanation for the muscle pathology associated with mutations in caveolae proteins."

Similar effects were seen in response to mechanical damage caused by tiny glass beads. Moreover, blocking the expression of caveolar genes prevented cells from repairing membrane damage."

The results offer new insights into why mutations in caveolar proteins are associated with muscle disorders, including muscular dystrophy and cardiac dysfunction."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induces exocytosis of lysosomes, a process required for PM resealing (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reddy et al., 2001</a>). PM repair was initially suggested to be mediated by a membrane patch applied to the wound site (<a href=\"#bib39\">Miyake and McNeil, 1995</a>), or through exocytosis-mediated reduction in PM tension (<a href=\"#bib64\">Togo et al., 2000</a>). However, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lysosomal exocytosis is also required for the resealing of cells injured by pore-forming toxins (<a href=\"#bib67\">Walev et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Idone et al., 2008</a>). These toxins generate stable, protein-lined transmembrane lesions that cannot be resealed by a membrane patch or simply by relieving PM tension. Recent studies clarified this issue, by showing that lysosomal exocytosis in wounded cells is followed by a rapid, cholesterol-dependent form of endocytosis that removes pores and lesions from the PM (<a href=\"#bib26\">Idone et al., 2008</a>) and directs them to lysosomes for degradation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Corrotte et al., 2012</a>)."

Transcriptional silencing of ASM abolished PM repair, and addition of exogenous ASM restored resealing (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tam et al., 2010</a>). These findings provided a novel conceptual framework for the mechanism of PM repair, indicating that exocytosis promotes resealing not by generating a membrane patch, but by releasing enzymes that remodel the outer leaflet of the PM and stimulate endocytosis. ASM converts the abundant PM lipid sphingomyelin into ceramide (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schissel et al., 1996</a>), and ceramide-enriched microdomains can trigger invagination of lipid bilayers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Holopainen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Trajkovic et al., 2008</a>). However, the exact role of ceramide and the nature of the endocytic vesicles triggered by cell wounding are still unknown."

Intriguingly, the fragile muscle fibers from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy contain elevated numbers of caveolae-like vesicles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonilla et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Repetto et al., 1999</a>), and mutations in the muscle-specific caveolar protein caveolin-3 (Cav3) cause multiple forms of muscle pathology (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gazzerro et al., 2010</a>). These observations, taken together with the recently uncovered role for endocytosis in PM repair (<a href=\"#bib26\">Idone et al., 2008</a>), raised the possibility that caveolae-derived endocytic vesicles might play a direct, heretofore unrecognized role in the mechanism responsible for resealing PM wounds. In this study we show that injury-induced internalization of caveolae-derived vesicles is a dynamic process essential for the restoration of PM integrity."

Previous TEM studies detected numerous large, irregularly shaped endocytic vesicles in cells fixed 4\u20135 min after SLO permeabilization (<a href=\"#bib26\">Idone et al., 2008</a>). Surprisingly, when cells were examined just 30 s after treatment with SLO or SM, the newly formed endocytic vesicles (identified by luminal BSA-gold added as an endocytic tracer) appeared as homogeneously round and small (&lt;80 nm). Similar peripheral &lt;80 nm endocytic vesicles were present in untreated cells, albeit in lower numbers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Quantification revealed that treatment with SLO or SM for 30 s increased the number of BSA-gold-containing vesicles relative to controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Clathrin-coated vesicles in the same preparations did not contain BSA-gold, in agreement with the slower rate of formation of this class of endocytic vesicles (results not shown). At later time points (60 and 180 s) larger compartments suggestive of homotypic fusion of the &lt;80 nm vesicles were increasingly observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Quantification of vesicle size, area and BSA-gold content supported the conclusion that the small endocytic vesicles induced by exposure to SLO or SM increase in size over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>)."

To investigate a potential role of caveolae-derived vesicles in the internalization of SLO pores, cells were permeabilized with GFP-tagged SLO (which retains full pore-forming activity [<a href=\"#bib26\">Idone et al., 2008</a>]) and analyzed by cryo-immuno EM using antibodies against GFP or the caveolae-associated protein caveolin-1 (Cav1) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Drab et al., 2001</a>). The amount of GFP-SLO associated with flat regions of the PM gradually decreased over time, consistent with a toxin internalization process (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Importantly, during the first 60 s after injury GFP-SLO was increasingly detected on &lt;80 nm vesicles containing Cav1, which are properties of caveolae (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). By 300 s the amount of SLO co-localizing with Cav1 decreased, in agreement with the previously described traffic of internalized SLO into later compartments of the endocytic pathway (<a href=\"#bib10\">Corrotte et al., 2012</a>). The number of &lt;80 nm vesicles positive for Cav1 alone or SLO alone also decreased over time, simultaneously with an increase in the number of &gt;80 nm vesicles containing either Cav1 alone or both Cav1 and SLO (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). These results are fully consistent with our TEM analysis of SLO-permeabilized cells, showing an initial increase in the number of &lt;80 nm endocytic vesicles followed by the gradual appearance of merged compartments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

However, the possibility still remained that caveolar vesicles containing SLO might still be connected to the PM. To directly address this issue, we developed a flow cytometry (FACS) assay for detection of cell-associated fluorescent SLO before and after quenching with specific antibodies. To ensure accessibility of the fluorescent moiety to the quenching antibodies, we used a single cysteine SLO mutant labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 at the N-terminus (a region not inserted into membranes during pore-formation [<a href=\"#bib56\">Shatursky et al., 1999</a>]). When cells were incubated with the labeled toxin at 4\u00b0C, addition of anti-Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies quenched &gt;90% of the fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, under conditions that allow toxin binding but not endocytosis, most cell-associated toxin is accessible to quenching antibodies. When the same amount of labeled toxin was added to cells at 37\u00b0C, cells were fully permeabilized and about 30% resealed in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> under the assay conditions, as indicated by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). By gating on the PI-negative (resealed) cell population we found that at least 50% of the cell-associated Alexa 488-SLO was protected from quenching (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), indicating that it entered compartments no longer in contact with the extracellular medium. Antibody-mediated quenching of extracellular Alexa 488-SLO was also observed by confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and quench-protected intracellular toxin colocalized with Cav1-positive puncta (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

As an additional independent assay for detecting SLO-induced caveolar endocytosis, we examined the co-localization of EHD2 with Cav1 clusters at the PM by TIRF microscopy, after cells were permeabilized with SLO or treated with SM. Most of the Cav1 staining at the surface of untreated cells appeared as puncta that were also positive for EHD2, as previously described for the stable population of PM-associated caveolae (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stoeber et al., 2012</a>). The intensity of Cav1 puncta decreased with time after SLO or SM exposure, reflecting an inward movement away from the bright TIRF field adjacent to the PM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). In addition, cells permeabilized with SLO or exposed to SM showed a progressive loss in Cav1-EHD2 co-localization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>), as expected for caveolar endocytosis."

Thus, injury with SLO or exposure to the ceramide-generating enzyme SM increase the population of peripheral caveolae-like vesicles in a Cav1-dependent manner, a process that correlates with the ability of these cells to reseal their PM. Quantification by cryo-immuno EM revealed that \u223c20% of the Cav1 detected on sections of NRK cells was initially associated with flat PM regions without caveolae, and this fraction was reduced to \u223c9% after 60 s of exposure to SLO+Ca<sup>2+</sup>, along with an increase in labeling of intracellular &lt;80 nm vesicles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

Cells depleted in dynamin-2 with Dyn2 siRNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) were strongly deficient in transferrin endocytosis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), but fully capable of repairing their PM after permeabilization with SLO+Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). SLO-treated Dyn2-deficient cells contained numerous caveolae-like &lt;80 nm vesicles that were not stained by externally added ruthenium red, consistent with a complete fission from the PM. Clathrin-coated vesicles in the same preparations were strongly stained with extracellular ruthenium red and showed elongated \u2018necks\u2019 in continuity with the PM, typical features of dynamin deficiency (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). In sharp contrast, no similar structures were observed associated with caveolae. To examine a potential compensatory role of dynamin-1, we performed similar assays using an inducible fibroblast cell line generated from dynamin-1 and -2 double conditional knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferguson et al., 2009</a>). After tamoxifen induction these cells became strongly depleted in both dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) and defective in transferrin endocytosis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). However, after exposure to SLO+Ca<sup>2+</sup> or SM these cells were still fully capable of blocking FM1\u201343 and propidium iodide (PI) influx (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>) and of upregulating endocytosis of the B subunit of cholera toxin (which is internalized by caveolar and other forms of endocytosis [<a href=\"#bib29\">Kirkham et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chinnapen et al., 2007</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>).

Strikingly, our results revealed that a large fraction of the endocytic vesicles formed a few seconds after injury resemble caveolae, the ubiquitous flask-shaped PM invaginations that have been implicated in transcytosis, mechanosensing and signaling responses (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parton and Simons, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lajoie and Nabi, 2010</a>). Wounded cells show increased numbers of small, homogeneously shaped vesicles with the typical morphology and markers of caveolae. Several independent lines of evidence demonstrate that internalization of these vesicles occurs rapidly, with a time-course that matches the kinetics of PM repair. Cryo-immuno EM, endocytosis and live imaging assays showed that the pore-forming toxin SLO is removed from the PM and traffics into cells in vesicular carriers containing the caveolar marker Cav1. Furthermore, transcriptional silencing of Cav1 in non-muscle cells and Cav3 in myotubes inhibits caveolae formation and PM repair. Collectively, our study identifies caveolar vesicles as dynamic endocytic structures that play a key role in the restoration of PM integrity."

Mutations in PTRF/cavin1 also lead to muscular dystrophy and cardiac dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rajab et al., 2010</a>), and overexpression of this caveolae-associated protein rescues membrane repair defects in dystrophic muscle (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). In earlier studies these effects were not attributed to caveolae assembly and internalization, but rather to an independent role of caveolin and cavin molecules in regulating the traffic of unrelated proteins involved in muscle fiber repair, such as dysferlin and MG53 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hern\u00e1ndez-Deviez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hayashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>).

However, it is important to note that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in dystrophin, a main component of the dystroglycan complex that confers stability to the sarcolemma (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohn and Campbell, 2000</a>). Duchenne dystrophic fibers are very susceptible to contraction-induced wounding, and are likely to undergo repeated cycles of injury and repair\u2014a process that we now show to involve intracellular accumulation of caveolar vesicles, in several cell types including C2C12 myotubes and primary muscle fibers. Thus, our findings provide a novel explanation for the accumulation of caveolae within fragile muscle fibers that is fully consistent with a direct role of caveolar endocytosis in sarcolemma resealing. Our results are also in agreement with the elevated number of caveolar profiles observed in cell types subject to chronic membrane stress, such as endothelial cells and adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parton and Simons, 2007</a>)."

Caveolae are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, and contain the abundant surface lipid sphingomyelin that generates ceramide after cleavage of its phosphorylcholine head group by SM (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu and Anderson, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Parton and Simons, 2007</a>). Exogenously added glycosphingolipids selectively stimulate caveolar endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sharma et al., 2004</a>), and the ceramide core of glycosphingolipids was identified as an important determinant of caveolae internalization (<a href=\"#bib57\">Singh et al., 2003</a>). However, the mechanism by which glycosphingolipids modulate caveolar endocytosis remained unclear, because a non-hydrolyzable synthetic glycosphingolipid analog was reported to have the same effect (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sharma et al., 2004</a>). Our study clarifies this issue, by directly demonstrating that treatment of the outer leaflet of the PM with the ceramide-generating enzymes ASM or SM is sufficient to induce internalization of vesicles with properties of caveolae. In agreement with our findings, ASM (<a href=\"#bib44\">Opreanu et al., 2011</a>) and ceramide (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu and Anderson, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bilderback et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Czarny et al., 2003</a>) were detected in caveolae-enriched membrane fractions."

These findings are in full agreement with our additional lines of evidence implicating caveolar vesicles as endocytic carriers responsible for lesion removal from the PM. However, it is also important to note that a complex cross-talk exists between caveolar and other cholesterol-dependent, clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. Thus, non-caveolar cholesterol/sphingolipid raft-dependent endocytic carriers may also play a role in removing lesions from the PM under some conditions, such as in Cav1-deficient cells, which were shown to upregulate non-caveolar endocytic pathways (<a href=\"#bib31\">Le et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nichols, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Singh et al., 2003</a>)."

However, more recent studies using dominant-negative forms of dynamin-2 (<a href=\"#bib66\">van Deurs et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2008</a>) or cells deficient in both dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferguson et al., 2009</a>) failed to observe inhibition of caveolar endocytosis and the accumulation of PM-connected caveolar intermediates expected from a fission block. These findings led to suggestions that indirect effects on the actin cytoskeleton or sequestration of essential factors distinct from dynamin might explain the inhibition in caveolar endocytosis by dominant-negative dynamin (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2008</a>). After extensive analysis of cells depleted in dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 we did not observe any defects in caveolar endocytosis in response to PM wounding, suggesting that this process may be dynamin-independent. Not all forms of endocytosis require the GTPase dynamin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guha et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hansen and Nichols, 2009</a>), and the existence of different forms of caveolar endocytosis has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Le and Nabi, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Singh et al., 2003</a>). Given that ceramide accumulation is sufficient to induce membrane invagination and inward budding of membranes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Holopainen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Trajkovic et al., 2008</a>), it is an intriguing possibility that sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation may bypass the requirement for dynamin in the fission of caveolar vesicles associated with PM repair."

A recent study showed that internalized SLO moves to the perinuclear area in endocytic vesicles that gradually increase in size and merge with late endosomes/lysosomes, where ubiquitinated toxin is degraded in an ESCRT-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib10\">Corrotte et al., 2012</a>). Strikingly, in this study we found that cell injury or exposure to purified SM initially generates homogeneous &lt;80 nm vesicles with a morphology typical of caveolae, which then rapidly merge originating larger, irregular intracellular compartments. Interestingly, wounded cells accumulate larger and more abundant endocytic vesicles after the cortical cytoskeleton is disrupted with cytochalasin D (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tam et al., 2010</a>), a condition that enhances caveolae motility (<a href=\"#bib63\">Thomsen et al., 2002</a>). Thus, removal of obstacles presented by the cortical cytoskeleton may facilitate internalization and intracellular merging of caveolae. Supporting this view, we observed reduced levels of EHD2, the ATPase proposed to link caveolae to actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moren et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stoeber et al., 2012</a>), on caveolar vesicles that move deeper into cells after injury or exposure to SM."

We envision that the rapid intracellular merging of surface-connected caveolae, possibly enhanced by the higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flowing through large lesions, might generate forces on the PM that constrict and ultimately reseal wounds (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). Such \u2018bunch of grapes\u2019 pattern of caveolar vesicles is also observed in cells not subjected to a specific wounding procedure (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fra et al., 1995</a>). However, it is important to note that lifting cells from dishes and other routine cell handling steps often results in PM wounding and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Detaching cells from their substratum was actually reported to trigger rapid and robust caveolae internalization (<a href=\"#bib41\">Muriel et al., 2011</a>). Our observations suggest a model where caveolae-derived branched endocytic structures still tethered to the PM would be generated as a consequence of the vigorous Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and localized release of lysosomal ASM triggered by large wounds. These branched caveolae-derived structures appear to accumulate around the periphery of the PM wounds, and as their deeper portions merge intracellularly, constriction forces may be generated on the PM facilitating bilayer resealing. This model predicts that when the complex caveolar structures pinch off from the PM, large intracellular vesicles would be generated next to injury sites (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). This scenario is fully consistent with previous EM observations of large vesicles close to wound sites (<a href=\"#bib38\">McNeil and Steinhardt, 2003</a>). These large intracellular vesicles were at the time interpreted as exocytic \u2018patches\u2019, responsible for resealing the wound. Here we propose a very different scenario for the repair of mechanical injury to the PM: After Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lysosomal exocytosis and ASM release, caveolae-derived vesicles would move into cells while undergoing a homotypic fusion process, which would ultimately result in large compartments of endocytic origin (as opposed to a large exocytic patch, as proposed in earlier models\u2014[<a href=\"#bib38\">McNeil and Steinhardt, 2003</a>])."

An intriguing possibility is that mechanical wounds may actually occur preferentially in areas where caveolae are present, because membranes may be rendered more fragile by the flattening of caveolae that follows a mechanical stretch (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>). Caveolae are extremely abundant in cells that are under mechanical stress in vivo, such as smooth muscle fibers and endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parton and Simons, 2007</a>).

Importantly, this work also identifies caveolar endocytosis as a pathway that may be directly affected in several types of muscular dystrophy. Resealing of injured muscle fibers requires muscle-specific proteins such as dysferlin and MG53, which accumulate in vesicles close to sites of injury and have been assumed to facilitate formation of an exocytic membrane patch (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2009a</a>). In light of our findings and of the newly uncovered role of endocytosis in PM repair, it will be of great interest to determine whether these muscle-specific proteins participate in wound resealing by facilitating caveolar assembly/internalization, and lesion removal by endocytosis."

Briefly, 500 \u00b5l of a 50 \u00b5M SLO solution (in PBS no Ca<sup>2+</sup>) were incubated with 10 mM of reactive dye for 2 hr at room temperature. After reaction, the labeled SLO was separated from unbound dye by gel filtration. Subconfluent NRK cells were treated or not with control or Cav1 siRNA for 48 hr, trypsinized, counted and diluted to 1,5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells/250 \u00b5l for flow cytometry.

Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCanto, Becton Dickinson, Sparks Glencoe, MD) and A488 fluorescence was assessed before and after adding 10 \u00b5g/ml of rabbit anti-Alexa Fluor 488 quenching antibody (Life Technologies) for 2 min. PI (50 \u00b5g/ml) was added to all samples at the end of the assay to assess levels of PM repair. Data were analyzed using Flo-Jo software (Three Star, Inc, Ashland, VA)."

Spinning disk confocal images were acquired for 4 min at 1 frame/3 s using an UltraVIEW VoX system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) attached to an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) with a 40 \u00d7 NA 1.3 objective (Nikon) and a CCD camera (C9100\u201350; Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ). Quantitative analysis of fluorescence in a defined intracellular area was performed using Volocity Suite (PerkinElmer). For live imaging of GFP-SLO internalization, HeLa cells were cultured on glass-bottom dishes (MatTek) and transfected with mRFP tagged Cav1 (mRFP-Cav1) for 24 hr using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells expressing mRFP-Cav1 were pre-incubated for 5 min on ice with 800 ng/ml of GFP-SLO (generated as described in <a href=\"#bib26\">Idone et al. [2008]</a>), and 4\u00b0C DME with Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to induce PM repair after warming to 37\u00b0C on a heated stage, followed by imaging for 5 min at 1 frame/2 s as previously described for FM1\u201343 imaging. Since the amount of SLO fluorescence that becomes associated with cells under conditions that allow PM repair is limited, to bring the signal out from the noise floor inherent to the imaging system all datasets were processed using NIS-Elements software (Nikon Instruments). First, drift correction was performed on datasets to account for drift with temperature changes at high magnification. In order to improve the signal to noise ratio and minimize the effects of the spurious noise, a 3-frame rolling average was employed followed by a regional maximum detection, which compares a pixel (or group of pixels) to its neighboring region and determines where there is a significant difference. Routine scaling of the image resulted in the contrast viewed in the included datasets (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2 and 3</a>). Volocity Suite (Perkin Elmer) was used to draw lines beneath the PM to record fluorescence intensity levels of GFP-SLO and mRFP-Cav1 and create kymographs displaying fluorescence levels over time (Y axis) for each pixel along the line (X axis). Colocalization of GFP-SLO and mRFP-Cav1 was analyzed and displayed as positive PDM (product of the differences from the mean)."

It is important to note that this was a challenging assay to set up because we could not use more extensive methods of amine-based labeling that would have resulted in brighter toxin \u2013 such methods are known to interfere with the oligomerization and extensive C-terminal conformational change that is required for SLO pore formation. Importantly, residues at the C-terminus of SLO are inserted in the lipid bilayer during pore formation, and in the process become protected from quenching. This was elegantly demonstrated by Rod Tweten, an expert in pore-formation by cholesterol-dependent toxins, who advised us in these experiments. He kindly provided us with a single cysteine SLO construct that can be labeled with thiol-reactive maleimide-Alexa 488 at the N-terminus, a region of the toxin that does not participate in oligomerization and membrane insertion, remaining exposed extracellularly after pore formation. Alexa 488 was chosen for the labeling because it is stable over a wide pH range, brighter than other fluorophores and very efficiently quenched by anti-Alexa 488 commercial antibodies."

In contrast, at 37\u00b0C a much larger fraction of the cell-associated SLO was protected from quenching, as would be expected from a complete internalization process. The clear results of this assay argue strongly against the suggestion that the Cav1-positive caveolae containing SLO that we observed by cryo-immuno EM were still connected to the PM. The remaining quenchable SLO associated with cells that resealed their PM at 37\u00b0C is likely to correspond to bound but not fully oligomerized toxin."

The appropriate quenching of extracellular fluorescence requires an intact plasma membrane (SLO forms pores large enough to allow entry of the quenching antibodies). Thus, as an alternative approach to complement our cryo-immuno EM colocalization of SLO and Cav1, we performed confocal microscopy in cells incubated with Alexa 488-SLO and treated with quenching anti-Alexa 488 antibodies. The quenching antibody activity was evident in these images, and some of the Alexa 488-SLO that survived quenching was observed associated with Cav1-positive intracellular pucta (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."
