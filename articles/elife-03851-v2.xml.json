While many important functions have been attributed to adiponectin under high-fat diet conditions, little is known about its essential role under regular chow. Employing a mouse model with inducible, acute \u03b2-cell ablation, we uncovered an essential role of adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions to maintain minimal lipid homeostasis. When insulin levels are marginal, adiponectin is critical for insulin signaling, endocytosis, and lipid uptake in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. In the absence of both insulin and adiponectin, severe lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia lead to lethality. In contrast, elevated adiponectin levels improve systemic lipid metabolism in the near absence of insulin. Moreover, adiponectin is sufficient to mitigate local lipotoxicity in pancreatic islets, and it promotes reconstitution of \u03b2-cell mass, eventually reinstating glycemic control. We uncovered an essential new role for adiponectin, with major implications for type 1 diabetes."

While many important functions have been attributed to adiponectin under high-fat diet conditions, little is known about its essential role under regular chow. Employing a mouse model with inducible, acute \u03b2-cell ablation, we uncovered an essential role of adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions to maintain minimal lipid homeostasis. When insulin levels are marginal, adiponectin is critical for insulin signaling, endocytosis, and lipid uptake in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. In the absence of both insulin and adiponectin, severe lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia lead to lethality. In contrast, elevated adiponectin levels improve systemic lipid metabolism in the near absence of insulin. Moreover, adiponectin is sufficient to mitigate local lipotoxicity in pancreatic islets, and it promotes reconstitution of \u03b2-cell mass, eventually reinstating glycemic control. We uncovered an essential new role for adiponectin, with major implications for type 1 diabetes."

The ongoing loss of \u03b2-cells under these conditions is associated with a failure to effectively regenerate \u03b2-cell mass. This can be attributed not only to the low capacity for replication and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bouwens and Rooman, 2005</a>) but also the detrimental cytotoxic environment that the cells are exposed to due to the dysregulation of the balance between insulin and glucagon (<a href=\"#bib24\">Robertson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Unger and Cherrington, 2012</a>). Insulin deficiency results in hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, both of which trigger \u03b2-cell glucotoxicity and oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib19\">Poitout and Robertson, 2008</a>), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fonseca et al., 2009</a>), and lipotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kusminski et al., 2009</a>).

After extensive \u03b2-cell ablation, adiponectin becomes essential for survival. In the context of insulin deficiency, the lack of adiponetin aggravates the lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia to lethal levels. The critical role of adiponectin in maintaining minimal lipid homeostasis is recapitulated in the streptozotocin-treated (STZ) mouse model. Specifically, adiponectin is required for lipid uptake into subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Under normal conditions, the action of adiponectin can be mediated through enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity and intracellular fatty acid translocation. However, under insulinopenic conditions, the primary adiponectin-mediated effect relies on enhanced insulin sensitivity and endocytic activity. While insulin deficiency and widespread loss of \u03b2-cells lead to augmented intracellular lipotoxicity, adiponectin overexpressing mice effectively overcome the resulting intracellular lipotoxicity in \u03b2-cells by ameliorating lipid metabolism and thereby paving the way for \u03b2-cell mass recovery."

Only 33% of the adiponectin null mice survived 9 weeks post dimerizer, with a median survival of 8.4 weeks, while 87% of the <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> mice remained alive. Adiponectin overexpressing mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Combs et al., 2004</a>) crossed into the homozygous PANIC-ATTAC background (<i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>Tg/+</i></sup>) show a similar survival rate as <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> mice.

We addressed whether changes in hepatic lipid secretion may be the underlying reason. We treated the mice with the lipoprotein lipase inhibitor tyloxapol (WR-1339) and monitored serum lipid accumulation, a classical test to assess VLDL secretion. Compared to <i>WT</i> control mice, adiponectin null mice demonstrated only a minor trend towards an increase in serum triglyceride content (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and rate of accumulation (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We also examined a panel of metabolic gene expression in the livers of STZ-treated <i>Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Adn</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice and observed no significant changes (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

Does adiponectin play a role in suppressing lipolysis under conditions of low insulin? To address this question, we administered a low dose of insulin to STZ-treated mice (0.1 mU/g body weight), and measured circulating glycerol levels under these conditions. This small amount of insulin substantially reduced serum glycerol (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), while it only minimally affected circulating triglycerides (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6A</a>) and NEFAs (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6B</a>). Intriguingly, compared to <i>WT</i> mice, adiponectin null mice were resistant to the action of insulin, with minimal impact on glycerol levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This suggests adiponectin is critical for insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis under insulinopenic conditions. The enhanced lipolysis in STZ-treated adiponectin null mice might, at least in part, account for the reduced fat mass seen in the <i>Adn</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

We examined whole body and tissue-specific uptake of circulating triglycerides using <sup>3</sup>H-triolein. No apparent differences between <i>WT</i> and adiponectin null mice were noted prior to STZ treatment. In contrast, post STZ treatment, adiponectin null mice showed a 39% lower whole body clearance rate of labeled triolein compared to <i>WT</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Among the nine tissues examined, we observed significant differences of triolein uptake only in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT, 50% lower in STZ-treated null mice than in STZ-treated <i>WT</i> mice) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Consistent with a primary site of action on subcutaneous fat pads, we have reported that after long-term high-fat diet exposure, adiponectin promotes preferentially subcutaneous WAT expansion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asterholm and Scherer, 2010</a>). We also partitioned the tissue-specific <sup>3</sup>H-triolein uptake into incorporated (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) vs oxidized lipids (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The difference in triolein uptake in subcutaneous WAT was primarily the result of a reduced level of incorporation. In agreement with the <sup>3</sup>H-triolein uptake assay, histological analysis of adiponectin knockouts demonstrated a major reduction of adipocyte size in subcutaneous WAT and trends towards smaller cell size in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, no such reduction was found in gonadal WAT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We further confirmed the essential role of adiponectin in lipid uptake employing the PANIC-ATTAC model. 3 weeks post dimerizer, <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>Tg/+</i></sup>, <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>P-Adn</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice were subjected to oral gavage of BODIPY-labeled fatty acids and examined for fluorescence signal in subcutaneous WAT by confocal microscopy.

Compared to the euglycemic wild-type controls, STZ-treated animals showed elevated signals for apolipoproteins. Interestingly, most of the ApoA1 and ApoE signals, as well as part of the ApoB signal, located adjacent to endomucin, a marker for venous and capillary endothelial cells, reflecting apolipoproteins in circulation. The endomucin signal itself demonstrated increased vascular density in subcutaneous WAT of STZ-treated lipoatrophic animals, which was also observed in gonadal WAT (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3\u20135</a>). Furthermore, adiponectin knockout-induced ApoA1 accumulation was significant in subcutaneous WAT and BAT, but not in gonadal WAT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Compared to STZ-treated wild-type mice, adiponectin null mice showed trends towards an increase in ApoB signal in both subcutaneous and gonadal WATs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). As for the ApoE signal, there was a trend towards an increase in subcutaneous WAT, but not in gonadal WAT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Collectively, these data suggest an overall accumulation of apolipoproteins in the local circulation of adipose tissues of STZ-treated mice, which is exacerbated by adiponectin depletion predominantly in subcutaneous WAT."

A low dose of insulin treatment (0.2 mU/g body weight) markedly suppressed the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) serine-660 phosphorylation, a marker positively associated with lipolysis, by 57% and induced Akt serine-473 phosphorylation by 8.6-fold in subcutaneous WAT of STZ-treated wild-type mice. However, STZ-treated adiponectin nulls showed a blunted response in HSL inhibition (41%), and an abolished Akt activation (13%), as compared to the same animal prior to insulin injection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The unchanged post-heparin lipoprotein lipase activity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) is unlikely to be a major contributing factor to the impaired lipid uptake in the STZ-treated adiponectin null animals. The fatty acid translocase CD36 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) are also unlikely contributors, both of which show comparable distributions between genotypes. Expression of Scavenger Receptor Class B Member 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, was enhanced in STZ-treated adiponectin knockouts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), which could reflect a compensatory response for the HDL accumulation in circulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>)."

Adiponectin overexpressing mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Combs et al., 2004</a>) were crossed into the homozygous PANIC-ATTAC background (<i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>Tg/+</i></sup>) and treated with the same high-dose of dimerizer as the <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>P-Adn</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice to induce \u03b2-cell apoptosis. The adiponectin transgenic mice sustained higher levels of plasma adiponectin than the wild-type mice, also in the absence of insulin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Dimerizer treatment led to a moderate decrease in whole-body fat mass by week 2. From that point onward, the adiponectin transgenic mice showed a complete recovery in fat mass by week 5 and sustained normal fat mass through week 10, at which point the experiment was stopped (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                                "text": "We have previously shown that adiponectin enhances INS-1 \u03b2-cell survival by reducing accumulation of ceramides, a family of lipotoxic sphingolipids (<a href=\"#bib7\">Holland et al., 2011</a>). To investigate the in vivo roles of adiponectin on lipotoxicity in \u03b2-cells, we measured different sub-species of sphingolipids in pancreatic islets isolated from <i>WT</i>, <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>, and <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>Tg/+</i></sup> mice 5 weeks post \u03b2-cell ablation. For most individual ceramide species as well as the total ceramide content, we observed a trend in diabetic <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> islets towards increased ceramides as compared to islets from euglycemic <i>WT</i> mice and a concomitant drop of ceramides in the <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>Tg/+</i></sup> islets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The same trends applied to dihydro-ceramides, which are ceramide biosynthetic precursors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The pro-survival lipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate and sphinganine-1-phosphate were below the detection limit in all islet preparations, and sphingoid bases were not significantly altered by adiponectin (data not shown). Among the hexosyl-ceramides, lactosyl-ceramides displayed the same pattern of change as ceramides overall (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), while no significant changes were observed in glucosyl-ceramides (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). As the major storage pool of sphingolipids, most of the sphingomyelins also reproduced the trends seen in ceramides among the three genotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Taken together, our data suggest increased levels of lipotoxic species in <i>P-Adn</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> islets, which may account, at least in part, for the further loss of \u03b2-cells from week 5 to week 10 post the initial insult (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In contrast, adiponectin transgenic mice reduced the lipotoxic sphingolipid content to levels seen in the non-diabetic <i>WT</i> mice. It is likely that this phenomenon accounts for the enhanced pro-survival effects on the \u03b2-cells."

                        "text": "In this study, we uncover for the first time a pathological condition under which adiponectin is indispensable for survival. When insulin levels decrease by &gt;90% after intensive \u03b2-cell loss, adiponectin ensures the minimal homeostasis for lipid metabolism. Consistent with insulin action promoting lipid storage in adipose tissue, adiponectin exerts a similar effect on lipid uptake, but does so by distinct mechanisms. First, adiponectin mediates lipid uptake specifically in subcutaneous WAT, but not in epididymal WAT. Hepatic VLDL secretion and fatty acid metabolism are unchanged. Second, adiponectin regulates neither lipoprotein lipase activity under insulinopenic conditions nor the intracellular translocation of fatty acids. Rather, caveolin-1 is reduced, thereby reducing endocytosis of lipids. This is in agreement with our previous reports on caveolin-1 knockout mice, which show significantly lower body weight and fat mass than wild-type controls under both regular chow and high-fat diet regimen (<a href=\"#bib23\">Razani et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wernstedt Asterholm et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, our adiponectin knockout mice with insulin deficiency recapitulate the lipodystrophic phenotypes reported in caveolin-1 null mice, including impaired triglyceride clearance, hyper-triglyceridemia, adipocyte hypotrophy, without a change in lipoprotein lipase activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Razani et al., 2002</a>). Third, adiponectin potentiates insulin signaling and the suppression on lipolysis mediated by the trace levels of insulin present. It is tempting to speculate that adiponectin exerts autocrine/paracrine actions on subcutaneous adipose as a hormone, motivating future studies on signaling pathways and transcriptome/proteome analysis under insulinopenic conditions. The generation of mouse models allowing for conditional elimination of both adiponectin receptors adipoR1 and adipoR2 should be insightful. In cases where both insulin and adiponectin are depleted, fat mass becomes critically low, accompanied by exceedingly high triglycerides and ketone bodies in circulation, resulting in major mortality."

                        "text": "Our findings also underscore adiponectin as a messenger for the crosstalk between adipose tissue and pancreatic \u03b2-cells, especially under insulinopenic conditions. Massive pancreatic \u03b2-cell failure leads to hypoinsulinemia and dyslipidemia (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dunn, 1992</a>). The ensuing aggravated lipotoxicity further impairs \u03b2-cell function and survival (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lupi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Kusminski et al., 2009</a>). Our findings demonstrate that adiponectin can disrupt this vicious cycle at multiple levels and, in so doing, promote potent regenerative effects on functional \u03b2-cell mass. Adiponectin improves lipid storage in adipose tissue and improves systemic lipid metabolism. These general improvements in dyslipidemia may contribute, at least in part, to the reduction of \u03b2-cell lipotoxicity in the adiponectin overexpressing mouse, as reflected by ceramide measurements. The reduced level of local lipotoxicity may mediate \u03b2-cell survival and proliferation. Overexpression of adiponectin is sufficient to regenerate \u03b2-cells and regain glycemic control. Taken together, our data highlight the link between lipid metabolism and \u03b2-cell maintenance and identify adiponectin as a key mediator of this process. This does not exclude a direct effect of adiponectin on \u03b2-cells, since adiponectin is avidly binding to \u03b2-cells in vivo and exerts potent cytoprotective effects on \u03b2-cells under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Holland et al., 2011</a>)."

In vitro experiments have provided strong evidence that lipotoxicity can impair \u03b2-cell function and survival (<a href=\"#bib17\">Maedler et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Rakatzi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hoppa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Holland et al., 2011</a>). Unger and colleagues demonstrated in rats that pancreatic islets transplanted into the hepatic portal area were destroyed by the local hyperlipidemic environment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lee et al., 2007</a>) and islets from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats are subject to lipotoxic destruction via ceramide (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shimabukuro et al., 1998</a>). Poitout and colleagues have established that wild-type islets similarly develop ceramide-induced impairments in islet function under hyperlipidemic/hyperglycemic conditions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kelpe et al., 2003</a>). In the PANIC-ATTAC model, the prolonged \u03b2-cell loss in adiponectin wild-type and adiponectin null mice is unlikely due to prolonged exposure to dimerizer, which has a half-life in mice of \u223c5 hr. Rather, this is the result of glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and/or ER stress. In the PANIC-ATTAC islets, we did not detect any differences in oxidative stress and ER stress markers between adiponectin wild-type and transgenic adiponectin overexpressing mice (data not shown). However, we did see differences at the level of lipotoxic intermediates as judged by the results from the islet ceramide assays that revealed a reduction of lipotoxic ceramides as well as their precursors and derivatives. Ultimately, this improved microenvironment allows for increased recovery of islet mass."

After 1 hr incubation, 0.15 ml of SAB was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for insulin assay, and islets were transferred to 1 ml SAB with 16 mM glucose. After 1 hr incubation, 0.15 ml of SAB was sampled for insulin assay as previously, and islets were picked into 200 \u03bcl of 1 M acetic acid with protease inhibitors (#11836170001; Roche). Islets were subjected to 30 s sonication on ice, and 5 \u03bcl of the islet lysate were diluted 1:500 in 1 M acetic acid with protease inhibitors for insulin assay. 20 \u03bcl of 10 N NaOH was added to neutralize the remained islet lysate and then mixed with 300 \u03bcl of 100% isopropanol. DNA was precipitated after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 15 min, rinsed briefly with 70% ethanol, and re-suspended in 100 \u03bcl 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.5). DNA concentration was determined by SYBR green incorporation."

All of the reviewers felt that the discovery of new role for adiponectin is likely to have major impact. At the same time, there was also consensus that the mechanistic aspects of the work could be further developed. Given that the mechanism linking ceramide levels to beta-cell toxicity was previously reported, it seems that a reasonable strategy for revision would be to provide additional insight into the mechanism by which adiponectin is affecting adipocyte lipid uptake."

In agreement with our observations on ApoA1, adiponectin KO exhibited stronger ApoB and ApoE signals associated with the vasculature marker endomucin compared to wildtype controls. We agree with the reviewer that apolipoproteins are only part of the lipoproteins, and our data on fractionation of circulating lipoproteins show increased triglyceride and cholesterol in VLDL in STZ-treated adiponectin KO relative to wildtype controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D and 2E</a>). The accumulation of apolipoproteins in local vasculature of adipose tissue is consistent with the lipid uptake deficiency in STZ-treated adiponectin KO, and may account for, at least in part, the elevation of VLDL lipid content observed."

To mimic the insulinopenic conditions, mice were stimulated with a low dose of insulin (0.2 mU/g body weight). Akt phosphorylation was evident in wildtype mice, but completely abolished in adiponectin KO, where we also observed a trend towards reduced inhibition of HSL. Therefore, under insulinopenic conditions, adiponectin is required for insulin signaling, and supports the suppression of lipolysis."
