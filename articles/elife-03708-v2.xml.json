Despite this, nucleotide diversity and population-scaled recombination are positively correlated in eukaryote genomes. To investigate interactions between heterozygosity and recombination we crossed <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines carrying fluorescent crossover reporters to 32 diverse accessions and observed hybrids with significantly higher and lower crossovers than homozygotes. Using recombinant populations derived from these crosses we observed that heterozygous regions increase crossovers when juxtaposed with homozygous regions, which reciprocally decrease. Total crossovers measured by chiasmata were unchanged when heterozygosity was varied, consistent with homeostatic control. We tested the effects of heterozygosity in mutants where the balance of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair is altered. Crossover remodeling at homozygosity-heterozygosity junctions requires interference, and non-interfering repair is inefficient in heterozygous regions. As a consequence, heterozygous regions show stronger crossover interference. Our findings reveal how varying homolog polymorphism patterns can shape meiotic recombination."

Despite this, nucleotide diversity and population-scaled recombination are positively correlated in eukaryote genomes. To investigate interactions between heterozygosity and recombination we crossed <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines carrying fluorescent crossover reporters to 32 diverse accessions and observed hybrids with significantly higher and lower crossovers than homozygotes. Using recombinant populations derived from these crosses we observed that heterozygous regions increase crossovers when juxtaposed with homozygous regions, which reciprocally decrease. Total crossovers measured by chiasmata were unchanged when heterozygosity was varied, consistent with homeostatic control. We tested the effects of heterozygosity in mutants where the balance of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair is altered. Crossover remodeling at homozygosity-heterozygosity junctions requires interference, and non-interfering repair is inefficient in heterozygous regions. As a consequence, heterozygous regions show stronger crossover interference. Our findings reveal how varying homolog polymorphism patterns can shape meiotic recombination."

During meiosis homologous chromosomes pair and undergo crossover recombination, which together with independent chromosome segregation and gamete fusion increases genetic diversity between progeny (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barton and Charlesworth, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Villeneuve and Hillers, 2001</a>). Meiotic crossovers form via the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the SPO11 endonuclease (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bergerat et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Keeney et al., 1997</a>). Nucleolytic resection of DSBs generates 3\u2032 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is bound by the RAD51 and DMC1 recombinases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bishop et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Shinohara et al., 1992</a>). The resulting nucleoprotein filament then invades a homologous chromatid to form a heteroduplex intermediate (<a href=\"#bib57\">Hunter and Kleckner, 2001</a>). The invading ssDNA 3\u2032-ends undergo DNA synthesis using the homologous duplex as a template and after second-end capture forms double Holliday junctions (dHJs) (<a href=\"#bib104\">Szostak et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1995</a>). The dHJs can then be resolved as crossovers, which are cytologically evident as chiasmata (<a href=\"#bib87\">Page and Hawley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Janssens et al., 2012</a>). Chiasmata hold chromosomes together and ensure that homologous pairs segregate to opposite cell poles, so that gametes inherit a balanced chromosome number (<a href=\"#bib87\">Page and Hawley, 2003</a>)."

In <i>Arabidopsis</i> \u223c200 DSBs form per meiosis and proceed to form strand invasion intermediates, of which \u223c10 are repaired as crossovers, with the excess being repaired as non-crossovers, or via intersister recombination (<a href=\"#bib45\">Giraut et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ferdous et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Yang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Drouaud et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Wijnker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Qi et al., 2014</a>). 80\u201385% of wild type crossovers are dependent on the ZMM pathway (<i>MSH4</i>, <i>MSH5</i>, <i>MER3</i>, <i>HEI10</i>, <i>ZIP4</i>, <i>SHOC1</i>, <i>PTD</i>) and show interference, that is, they are spaced further apart than expected at random (<a href=\"#bib29\">Copenhaver et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Higgins et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Mercier et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chelysheva et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Macaisne et al., 2008</a>). The remaining minority of crossovers are non-interfering and require <i>MUS81</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berchowitz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Higgins et al., 2008b</a>). However, as chiasmata are still observed in <i>msh4 mus81</i> double mutants, additional crossover pathways must exist (<a href=\"#bib51\">Higgins et al., 2008b</a>). The majority of interhomolog strand invasion intermediates are dissolved by the FANCM helicase, which acts with the MHF1 and MHF2 co-factors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Crismani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Knoll et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Girard et al., 2014</a>). Mutations in <i>FANCM</i>, <i>MHF1</i> and <i>MHF2</i> cause dramatic increases in non-interfering crossovers (<a href=\"#bib31\">Crismani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Knoll et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Girard et al., 2014</a>). It is presently unclear whether non-interfering crossovers occurring in <i>fancm</i> are generated by the same pathway as in wild type, as a direct test of <i>MUS81</i> dependence is precluded by <i>fancm mus81</i> lethality (<a href=\"#bib31\">Crismani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Knoll et al., 2012</a>). Both crossovers and non-crossovers can be accompanied by gene conversion events, which in the case of non-crossovers form via the synthesis-dependent strand annealing pathway (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allers and Lichten, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">McMahill et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Yang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Drouaud et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Wijnker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Qi et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Meiotic recombination is sensitive to DNA polymorphism between homologous chromosomes, that is, heterozygosity. For example, insertion-deletion (indel) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) suppress crossovers at the scale of hotspots (kb) in fungi, plants and mammals (<a href=\"#bib33\">Dooner, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Borts and Haber, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Jeffreys and Neumann, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baudat and de Massy, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Cole et al., 2010</a>). This is thought to occur due to heteroduplex base-pair mismatches inhibiting recombination, following interhomolog strand invasion. Large scale chromosome rearrangements, such as inversions or translocations, also suppress crossovers (<a href=\"#bib95\">Schwander et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Thompson and Jiggins, 2014</a>). Despite the inhibitory effects of polymorphism on crossovers, nucleotide diversity and population-scaled recombination estimates are positively correlated in many plant and animal genomes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Begun and Aquadro, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Hellmann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Spencer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Gore et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Paape et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Cutter and Payseur, 2013</a>). For example, linkage disequilibrium-based crossover estimates and sequence diversity (\u03c0) are positively correlated in <i>Arabidopsis</i> at varying physical scales (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Choi et al., 2013</a>). Multiple processes contribute to these relationships. For example, positive or negative directional selection can reduce diversity at linked sites, with a greater effect in regions of low recombination, known as hitchhiking and background selection (<a href=\"#bib53\">Hill and Robertson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Hudson and Kaplan, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Nordborg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Smith and Haigh, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Cutter and Payseur, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Campos et al., 2014</a>). These phenomena will cause regions of low recombination under selection to have low diversity, consistent with data in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguade et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Begun and Aquadro, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wiehe and Stephan, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Campos et al., 2014</a>). Recombination may also be mutagenic and increase diversity, for example via mismatch repair enzymes showing a mutational bias for A:T &gt; G:C transversions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Duret and Galtier, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Webster and Hurst, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Gl\u00e9min et al., 2014</a>)."

We define <i>trans</i> modifiers as loci encoding diffusible molecules that control recombination on other chromosomes, and elsewhere on the same chromosome, as exemplified by mammalian <i>PRDM9</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baudat et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Berg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Myers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Parvanov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Fledel-Alon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Sandor et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Kong et al., 2013</a>). We define <i>cis</i> modification as variation that influences recombination only on the same chromosome, for example, the inhibitory effects of high SNP density, inversions and translocations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Dooner, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Borts and Haber, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Jeffreys and Neumann, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baudat and de Massy, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Cole et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Schwander et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Thompson and Jiggins, 2014</a>). Regional patterns of chromatin and epigenetic information can also cause significant <i>cis</i> effects, for example loss of either H2A.Z deposition or DNA methylation alters crossover frequency in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Colom\u00e9-Tatch\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Melamed-Bessudo and Levy, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Mirouze et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Yelina et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Choi et al., 2013</a>)."

We observed extensive variation in F<sub>1</sub> hybrid recombination rates, with both significantly higher and lower crossovers than homozygous backgrounds. We further analysed Col \u00d7 Ct F<sub>2</sub> recombinant populations using three independent crossover reporter intervals (<i>420</i>, <i>CEN3</i> and <i>I2f</i>). We did not detect <i>trans</i> modifiers in these crosses, but observed a novel <i>cis</i> modification effect caused by heterozygosity. Specifically, juxtaposition of heterozygous and homozygous regions is associated with increased crossover frequency in the heterozygous region and a reciprocal decrease in the homozygous region. To investigate this phenomenon mechanistically we repeated analysis in mutants where the balance of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair is altered (<i>fancm, zip4</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i>). This analysis demonstrates that remodelling of crossovers across heterozygosity/homozygosity junctions is dependent on interference. We also show that the non-interfering repair is less efficient in heterozygous regions. As a consequence, interference measurements are stronger in heterozygous regions. Our findings show how varying polymorphism patterns can differentially influence meiotic recombination along chromosomes."

The 5 intervals tested (<i>I1b</i>, <i>I1fg</i>, <i>I2f</i>, <i>420</i> and <i>CEN3</i>) range from 0.67\u20135.40 megabases (Mb), represent 11.5% of the genome (14.34 Mb) in total and are located in sub-telomeric, interstitial and centromeric regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The intervals vary in experimental recombination rate, with the centromeric interval <i>CEN3</i> being the lowest (2.11 cM/Mb) and the sub-telomeric interval <i>I2f</i> being the highest (13.02 cM/Mb) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). As <i>Arabidopsis</i> male meiosis shows elevated sub-telomeric recombination, this likely contributes to the high <i>I2f</i> crossover frequency, which is measured in pollen (<a href=\"#bib45\">Giraut et al., 2011</a>). Low recombination in <i>CEN3</i> is also expected, as the centromeric regions are heterochromatic and known to show suppressed crossover frequency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Copenhaver et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Giraut et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Salom\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Yelina et al., 2012</a>). To asses relative heterozygosity levels we analysed pairwise sequence differences relative to Col-0 using the 19 genomes dataset, which was generated from a subset of the accessions used in our crosses (<a href=\"#bib42\">Gan et al., 2011</a>). <i>CEN3</i> shows the highest heterozygosity levels, followed by the interstitial and sub-telomeric intervals (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Therefore, the regions analysed represent diverse chromosomal environments with varying levels of recombination and inter-accession sequence polymorphism."

Fluorescent measurements of gametes or progeny are used to asses segregation of the transgenes through meiosis and thereby measure crossover rates (<a href=\"#bib79\">Melamed-Bessudo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Berchowitz and Copenhaver, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Yelina et al., 2013</a>). Previously, we developed flow cytometry protocols to increase scoring-throughput using fluorescent pollen, allowing up to 80,000 gametes to be scored per individual plant (<a href=\"#bib114\">Yelina et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib115\">2013</a>). To increase throughput when measuring fluorescent seed we adapted CellProfiler image analysis software, allowing us to rapidly score \u223c2000 seed per individual (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Carpenter et al., 2006</a>). This method gives recombination measurements not significantly different from manually collected data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) (generalized linear model (GLM), hereafter GLM, p = 0.373). To test for significant differences between recombinant and non-recombinant counts using replicate groups we used a GLM assuming a binomial count distribution. Replicate heterozygous F<sub>1</sub> individuals were analysed for each cross and 13,264,943 gametes were scored in total, to provide an extensive survey of the influence of polymorphism heterozygosity on crossover frequency (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes showed both significantly higher and lower total recombination compared to Col homozygotes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) (GLM with 113\u00b0 of freedom p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>). F<sub>1</sub> genetic distances and polymorphism levels within the intervals were poorly correlated, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barth et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Gan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Salom\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>). This weak correlation may be partially explained by unknown structural rearrangements. For example, the Shahdara (Sha) accession has a sub-telomeric inversion (3\u20135.1 Mb) on chromosome 3 relative to Col (<a href=\"#bib72\">Loudet et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Simon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Salom\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>), and Col/Sha F<sub>1</sub>s show consistently low crossovers in <i>420</i>, which overlaps the inversion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Hence the contribution of unknown structural polymorphisms to variation in recombination rates could be significant. Further evidence of the complex effect of polymorphism is evident from the <i>CEN3</i> interval, which spans the repetitive and structurally diverse centromeric region of chromosome 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Copenhaver et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Clark et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ito et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Gan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Horton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Long et al., 2013</a>), and showed high variability in F<sub>1</sub> crossover frequency (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Unexpectedly, some of the most diverged crosses, for example two accessions from Atlantic islands Cvi-0 and Can-0, showed highest <i>CEN3</i> crossovers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ito et al., 2007</a>). 10 of 26 F<sub>1</sub>s showed significantly higher summed crossover frequency compared with Col homozygotes, consistent with previous reports that recombination can increase in heterozygous backgrounds in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barth et al., 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> modification of crossovers by genetic variation has been observed in plants (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barth et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Yao and Schnable, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Yandeau-Nelson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Esch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">McMullen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">L\u00f3pez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Salom\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bauer et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, the variation in F<sub>1</sub> crossover frequency observed here is likely caused by complex interactions between <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> modifying effects."

The physical extent of the effect was less (2.62 Mb) on the long arm of chromosome 3 for <i>CEN3</i> than observed for <i>420</i> and <i>I2f</i>, potentially due to heterozygosity effects acting independently from both arms across the centromere.

To test this idea we constructed a three-colour pollen FTL interval termed <i>I3bc</i> that overlaps the <i>420</i> seed interval on chromosome 3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

We therefore next used mutations in meiotic recombination pathways to analyse the genetic requirements of these effects. Specifically, we generated plants carrying the linked chromosome 3 fluorescent crossover reporters <i>420</i> and <i>CEN3</i> (<i>420-CEN3</i>), with varying Col/Ct genotype and that were wild type, <i>fancm</i> or <i>fancm zip4</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>\u2014<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Crossover frequency in <i>420</i> and <i>CEN3</i> can be scored in the same individuals, as these intervals use fluorescent proteins expressed in seed and pollen respectively. In <i>fancm</i> DSBs that would normally be repaired as non-crossovers enter a non-interfering pathway leading to a substantial increase in crossovers, although the interfering pathway remains active (<a href=\"#bib31\">Crismani et al., 2012</a>). In <i>fancm zip4</i> only non-interfering crossovers occur, due to mutation of the ZMM gene <i>ZIP4</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Chelysheva et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Crismani et al., 2012</a>). In wild type, both interfering and non-interfering pathways are active, but interfering crossovers predominate and constitute \u223c85% of total crossovers (<a href=\"#bib29\">Copenhaver et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Higgins et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Mercier et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, by comparing genetic distances in wild type, <i>fancm</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i>, where the relative proportions of interfering and non-interfering repair vary dramatically, we can investigate the sensitivity of different recombination pathways to heterozygosity."

When homologous chromosomes align on the metaphase-I plate, crossovers can be cytologically visualized as chiasmata (<a href=\"#bib92\">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2002</a>). To estimate the number of crossovers per meiotic nucleus we performed chromosome spreads of pollen mother cells (PMCs), followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a <i>45S</i> rDNA probe (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#SD14-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). We counted total chiasmata in metaphase-I nuclei in Col/Col homozygotes, Ct/Ct homozygotes and Col/Ct F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes. In addition, we counted chiasmata in recombinant <i>420-CEN3</i> lines showing high (HET-HOM, 27.96 cM) and low (HOM-HET, 13.83 cM) <i>420</i> crossover frequency (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). Adjacent chiasmata count categories were combined to give a minimum expected value of five for the purposes of a chi-square test with 8\u00b0 of freedom. This test gave no significant differences in chiasmata between the genotypes (p = 0.3365) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Together this is consistent with homeostatic maintenance of crossover numbers, despite local crossover changes caused by juxtaposition of heterozygous and homozygous regions."

                                "text": "Our analysis of <i>420-CEN3</i> recombination rates implicated interference as driving crossover changes across homozygosity/heterozygosity junctions. We therefore sought to directly measure interference in lines with varying heterozygosity. We generated <i>I3bc</i> lines that varied in Col/Ct genotype and that were wild type, <i>fancm, zip4</i> or <i>fancm zip4</i> (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We first compared <i>I3bc</i> plants that were Col/Col homozygous (HOM-HOM) with Col/Ct heterozygotes (HET-HET). In wild type, genetic distances did not significantly change between HOM-HOM and HET-HET (GLM p = 0.352 and p = 0.666), but crossover interference significantly increased (GLM p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD15-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>). Consistent with previous observations, <i>fancm</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i> showed a significant reduction and an absence of interference respectively, in a HOM-HOM background (GLM p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> and p = 4.94 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#SD16-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Crismani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Yelina et al., 2013</a>). In HET-HET plants the crossover frequency increases seen in <i>fancm</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i> were again greatly suppressed, or eliminated, relative to HOM-HOM, as observed previously for <i>420-CEN3</i> (GLM both p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Unexpectedly, interference measurements significantly increased in both <i>fancm</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i> mutants in a HET-HET background compared to HOM-HOM (GLM p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> and p = 4.94 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). We propose that in the absence of the ZMM pathway alternative repair pathways exist which are differentially sensitive to polymorphism and interference. Multiple, redundant repair pathways are consistent with the residual crossovers observed in <i>msh4 mus81</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#bib51\">Higgins et al., 2008b</a>). Finally, we measured <i>I3bc</i> cM in <i>zip4</i> mutants alone (HOM-HOM) and observed significantly decreased crossovers compared with wild type HOM-HOM (GLM p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, <a href=\"#SD15-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>). Importantly, <i>zip4</i> genetic distances were further significantly reduced when comparing HOM-HOM to HET-HET backgrounds (GLM p = 1.79 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup> and p = 1.53 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This provides additional evidence that the non-interfering repair pathway remaining in <i>zip4</i> is inefficient in heterozygous regions. Interference measurements using <i>I3bc</i> are reliant on the relatively rare double crossover classes (N<sub>-Y-</sub> + N<sub>B-R</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Due to low <i>zip4</i> fertility it was difficult to obtain sufficient DCO counts to make reliable interference measurements, although the observed counts are consistent with an absence of interference in this mutant (<a href=\"#SD18-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 4</a>)."

As shown earlier, we observed that Col/Ct (HET-HOM) heterozygosity suppressed the crossover increases seen in <i>fancm</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i> (GLM p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>), with the same significant increases in crossover interference strength (GLM p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> and p = 4.94 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a>). The reciprocal situation was observed in HOM-HET plants where <i>I3bc</i> was Col/Col homozygous and the rest of the chromosome Col/Ct heterozygous. <i>I3b</i> and <i>I3c</i> genetic distances were significantly decreased in wild type HOM-HET compared with wild type HOM-HOM plants (GLM both p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,D</a>). HOM-HET <i>fancm</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i> plants showed high crossovers, as the non-interfering pathway is efficient in the homozygous <i>I3bc</i> interval (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,D</a>). We also generated HET-HOM <i>zip4</i> lines, which unlike wild type showed significantly lower <i>I3b</i> and <i>I3c</i> cM than HOM-HOM <i>zip4</i> (GLM both <i>P</i>= p &lt; 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This again demonstrates that crossover remodelling at heterozygosity/homozygosity junctions requires interference and that non-interfering repair is inefficient in heterozygous regions."

                                "text": "As an independent test of the effect of heterozygosity on crossover interference we analysed four three-colour FTL intervals distributed throughout the genome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We measured crossover frequency and interference in Col/Col homozygotes vs Col/Ler F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes using meiotic pollen tetrads (<a href=\"#tbl8\">Tables 8, 9</a>). This approach is possible as the FTL crossover reporter system was generated in the <i>qrt1-2</i> mutant background, where sister pollen grains remain physically attached as meiotic tetrads (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berchowitz and Copenhaver, 2008</a>). We scored a total of 49,801 tetrads for Col/Col (an average of 6225 per interval) and 42,422 tetrads for Col/Ler (an average of 5302 per interval) (<a href=\"#tbl8\">Tables 8, 9</a>). Compared to Col/Col, genetic distance significantly decreased in Col/Ler for six of the eight intervals measured and the remaining two intervals were not significantly changed (<a href=\"#tbl8\">Table 8</a>). To calculate interference strength we compared cM values in each interval from tetrads that had a crossover in the adjacent interval, to the same intervals in tetrads lacking a crossover in the adjacent interval, and detected significant positive interference in all cases (<a href=\"#tbl9\">Table 9</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berchowitz and Copenhaver, 2008</a>). The resulting interference ratios were then compared between Col/Col and Col/Ler using Fisher's combined probability test, which revealed a significant increase in interference strength in Col/Ler (\u03c7<sup>2</sup><sub>.001[16]</sub> = 39.26) (<a href=\"#tbl9\">Table 9</a>). Therefore, the effect of heterozygosity increasing the interference strength is evident in both Col \u00d7 Ct and Col \u00d7 Ler crosses."

The mechanism of interference is presently unclear, but a Beam-Film model has been developed where crossovers are patterned via forces similar to mechanical stress and which predicts experimental data (<a href=\"#bib63\">Kleckner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib118\">2014b</a>). In this model each chromosome begins with an array of precursor interhomolog strand invasion events, one of which becomes crossover designated via a stress-related force (Designation Driving Force DDF). This causes a local reduction and redistribution of stress in both directions that dissipates with increasing distance (<a href=\"#bib63\">Kleckner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib118\">2014b</a>). At the point where stress increases sufficiently precursor events can again become crossover designated. Any remaining precursors then mature into other fates including non-crossovers and non-interfering crossovers (<a href=\"#bib63\">Kleckner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib118\">2014b</a>)."

Detection of heterozygosity most likely occurs downstream of interhomolog strand invasion and the formation of base pair mismatches. Therefore, we assume that the initial distribution of meiotic DSBs is unchanged in homozygous or heterozygous states. Mismatches are observed to have a local inhibitory effect on meiotic crossovers (<a href=\"#bib33\">Dooner, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Borts and Haber, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Jeffreys and Neumann, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baudat and de Massy, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Cole et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, one possibility is that mismatched precursors in heterozygous regions are slowed in maturation and trigger feedback mechanisms that cause further DSBs, for example via ATM/ATR kinase signalling (<a href=\"#bib18\">Carballo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Kurzbauer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Garcia et al., 2015</a>). As a consequence, heterozygous regions would receive more \u2018late\u2019 DSBs, leading to more precursors and a higher chance of receiving a crossover designation event. An increased chance of crossover designation would lead to spreading of interference into adjacent homozygous regions causing reciprocal crossover decreases. An alternative model is that mismatched precursors are more sensitive to crossover designation and thus heterozygous regions have a higher chance of an interfering crossover, leading to similar effects. These potential models could be distinguished by measurement of non-crossover (NCO) levels, which should increase in heterozygous regions if more DSBs occur. Our data also demonstrate that non-interfering repair is less efficient in heterozygous regions, which will further contribute to the changes we see across homozygosity/heterozygosity junctions."

For example, at the mouse <i>A3</i> hotspot an indel polymorphism within an inverted repeat overlaps a crossover refractory zone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Cole et al., 2010</a>). However, this zone forms significant numbers of non-crossovers, indicating that the repeat/indel does not inhibit DSB formation, but inhibits downstream progression to crossover recombination (<a href=\"#bib27\">Cole et al., 2010</a>). In yeast addition of SNPs to the <i>MAT-URA3</i> hotspot decreased crossovers and increased the frequency of gene conversions, further indicating that polymorphism can inhibit crossovers at fine-scale (<a href=\"#bib15\">Borts and Haber, 1987</a>). Finally, intragenic mapping of the maize Bronze hotspot demonstrated that transposon insertions suppress crossovers more strongly than single nucleotide changes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Dooner, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Fu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Dooner and He, 2008</a>), again consistent with progression to crossover repair being inhibited by local sequence polymorphisms. Several heteroduplex joint molecules with distinct properties form during meiosis, including displacement-loops and dHJs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Keeney and Neale, 2006</a>). It is possible that these joint molecules and their interactions with recombinases are sensitive to base-pair mismatches. The mismatch repair protein MutS directly recognizes mismatched base-pairs and serves as a paradigm for this type of function (<a href=\"#bib67\">Lamers et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Obmolova et al., 2000</a>)."

For example, multiple levels of interference have been detected in mice (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Boer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Cole et al., 2012</a>), Zip3 foci with distinct timing and properties are observed in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib96\">Serrentino et al., 2013</a>), and \u2018upstream\u2019 DSB patterns are altered in \u2018downstream\u2019 ZMM mutants (<a href=\"#bib105\">Thacker et al., 2014</a>). As plants, fungi and mammals share the presence of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair pathways similar effects over heterozygosity/homozygosity junctions may be generally important (<a href=\"#bib102\">Stahl et al., 2004</a>). However, when assessing the significance of such effects it is also important to consider how outcrossing vs selfing will influence patterns of homozygosity and heterozygosity within different species. Together our data show how varying patterns of sequence polymorphism along chromosomes can have a significant effect on distributions of meiotic recombination."

However, there is relatively good support, in population genetics literature, for the idea that this pattern reflects the fact that linked selection (e.g. hitchhiking and background selection) have effects over relatively large physical regions in regions of low crossing over (see <a href=\"#bib32\">Cutter and Payseur 2013</a>). The authors do not seem to mention this dominant, and relatively well supported, group of hypotheses and instead seem to frame the positive correlation as an empirical observation in search of a mechanistic hypothesis (that they provide). Obviously these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and so this does not rule out the idea that the authors' mechanistic explanation could also play a role. The authors need to be much clearer about the background to these observations, if they are to contribute to the larger debate about determinants of levels of polymorphism."

Much of the broad variation in recombination rates, in many systems, is explained by proximity to centromeres and telomeres (presumably a mechanistic constraint). Thus a lot of the variation in broad-scale recombination rates is not tied to polymorphism, but rather to large-scale chromosomal architecture. Once again the authors' proposed mechanism could contribute to the strength of the correlation, but this argument does suggest that this contribution may be somewhat minor."

To put it another way, in the wild type case, there is an increase in crossovers and a decrease in non-crossovers (more of which turn into crossovers in <i>fancm</i> than in wild type). The basis for this effect is unclear. However, it is strongly reminiscent of crossover homeostasis where a reduction in DSBs leads to a differential loss of non-crossovers as compared to crossovers. Since it is unlikely that heterozygosity will be recognized at the DSB level (although this is not totally excluded given diverse indications of <i>trans</i> effects on DSBs in yeast), it would instead imply that there is a reduced chance that a DSB actually giving a recombination intermediate that could lead to a crossover or non-crossover.

However: (a) In comparisons between fully homozygous and fully heterozygous regions, the frequency of COs is essentially the same (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7AB, 8AB</a>). This cannot be explained by an increase in CO interference alone. It implies some other effect. (b) The observation of increased CO interference by CoC analysis can be explained either by an increase in the \u201cspreading distance\u201d of the interference signal or by a decrease in the strength of CO-designation; both effects decrease the CoC at short inter-interval distances (See Zhang et al PLoS Genetics 2014 and PNAS 2014). If the relevant effect is to decrease the strength of CO-designation the observed effect is actually not promoting the interfering CO pathway but making it worse. (c) The fact that CO number does not change in a fully heterozygous region even though interference effectively increases (a, above) suggests/implies the existence of another effect, which could/should be upstream of any recombination fate decision. Most simply: if there is a decrease in the efficiency of CO-designation, the resultant decrease in COs can be overcome by an increase in the frequency of DSBs (or DSB-mediated pre-CO interactions). Perhaps mismatched chromatin structure has such an effect, maybe especially in sub-telomeric regions which might be influenced by pre-DSB homologous pairing interactions."

Assuming experimental problems (below) can be ignored, what is observed (assayed region underlined) is, essentially, the following: (a) the frequency of COs is lower in HOM-HET than in HOM-HOM; and (b) the frequency of COs in HET-HOM is higher than in HET-HET. That is, an adjacent heterozygous region decreases COs in a homozygous region relative to what would have been seen in a fully homozygous situation while an adjacent homozygous region increases COs in a heterozygous region relative to what would have been seen in a fully heterozygous situation. <i>But</i>\u2026 HOM-HOM and HET-HET both show the same frequency of COs as one another (see Figures 6CD, 7 and 8 for the clearest examples).

This is not: \u201cheterozygous regions attract crossovers from homozygous regions on the same chromosome at the megabase scale\u201d.

The paper also shows (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7, 8</a>) that this interplay is not observed in a <i>fancm zip4</i> double mutant where there are still COs, but of a variety that does not set up interference. Fine. Interference is required. And if everything were the same in HOM and HET regions, there would be no effect of having one next to the other, so just saying that there is interference is not enough. There has to be some asymmetry. The authors seem to think that the difference is that interference is \u201cstronger\u201d in HET regions and \u201cweaker\u201d in HOM regions. If this were true, and if that effect crossed the border between the two regions, COs in HET regions would tend to decrease COs in HOM regions relative to the effect from normal HOM interference; oppositely, HET regions will experience less interference from an adjacent HOM region than from an adjacent HET region.

This is seen also in the other analyzed sub-telomeric interval (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4GH</a>). This should be specifically investigated.

(ii) The top-ranked F<sub>2</sub> in the 4D data set is very pecuIiar.

(iii) As in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, there could be unknown effects from selecting the subset of F<sub>2</sub>s that did not have a CO in the sub-telomeric region. Are there markers all the way to the end of the chromosomes or are sub-telomeric crossovers going to be missed (which is a problem for the analysis since many COs will be there specifically in the selected population, thus biasing the sample. There is actually a hint of such a problem in the fact that the observed \u201ceffect\u201d is absent for the centromere (a central marker) and weak for an interstitial marker. One interpretation is that observation of an effect is a consequence of selecting a sub-telomeric region for analysis (rather than being an actual phenomenon is specific to such regions). The authors have only presented data saying whether each F<sub>2</sub> is homozygous or heterozygous for the markers tested. But in principle, they could figure out the exact arrays of markers on the two chromosomes of the F<sub>2</sub> and thus were crossovers occurred in the preceding F<sub>1</sub> cross(es). While perhaps difficult, this might reveal additional informative information to further guide interpretation."

The major advantage of analysis in <i>fancm</i> and <i>fancm zip4</i> is that fertility is restored due to a large increase in non-interfering crossovers, allowing us to collect high quality fluorescence data in backgrounds with dramatically altered levels of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair (<a href=\"#bib31\">Crismani et al., 2012</a>, Science).

In the Introduction and Discussion we have expanded on factors that could influence this relationship, including background selection and genetic hitchhiking, which will cause regions of low recombination under directional selection to have low diversity. We also discuss the potential for recombination-associated mutagenesis.

The high rate of <i>I2fg</i> recombination also derives from the fact that the sub -telomeric regions are highly recombining during male meiosis and <i>I2fg</i> measures fluorescent pollen (<a href=\"#bib45\">Giraut et al., 2012</a>, PLoS Genet). Therefore, chromosomal location exerts a significant effect on recombination rates when comparing between intervals.

This phenomenon implies reciprocal interplay between the two regions. This phenomenon applies specifically to junction regions. Fully heterozygous regions exhibit almost the same recombination frequency as fully homozygous regions, at least in the situation examined here.
