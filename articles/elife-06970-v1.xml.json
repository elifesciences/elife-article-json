Proteins that are secreted or reside within the organelles of the secretory pathway initiate their journey when they are translocated into the membrane or lumen of the ER. In the unique oxidizing environment of the ER, nascent polypeptides undergo chaperone assisted folding and modifications, such as glycosylation and formation of disulfide bonds, to become mature active proteins before exiting from the ER (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mori, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>). In addition, the ER is a major site for lipid synthesis and storage of intracellular calcium (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mcmaster, 2001</a>). Many of these ER functions must work in concert to satisfy cellular demands (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oakes and Papa, 2014</a>). The unfolded protein response (UPR)-signaling pathway is a conserved response to ER stress and plays a critical role in maintaining ER function by up-regulating the transcription of genes coding for ER chaperones and protein-folding components (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cox et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mori et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, the ER cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i> and is generated only from existing ER. Given the critical function of the ER, it seems likely that cell cycle regulatory mechanisms must exist to ensure inheritance of a fully functional ER during cell division."

Upon ER stress induction, activation of this ER Stress Surveillance (ERSU) pathway results in re-localization of the cytokinesis-associated septin complex away from the bud neck, leading to a block in ER inheritance and cytokinesis. We showed that the ERSU pathway is independent of the UPR and is mediated by the Slt2 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK). In the absence of Slt2, cells do not exhibit the block in ER inheritance and the septin ring remains at the bud neck following exposure to ER stress, similar to normally dividing, unstressed cells. Ultimately, however, <i>slt2\u0394</i> cells are not able to sustain their growth due to the transmission of the stressed ER into the daughter cell. In fact, preventing ER transmission into <i>slt2\u0394</i> daughter cells by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization can restore growth. Importantly, while Slt2 MAPK is known to play a role in the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, we found that the ERSU and CWI pathways are completely distinct (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babour et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Levin, 2011</a>). The discovery of the ERSU pathway thus not only identified a novel cell cycle checkpoint that ensures the inheritance of functional ER but also raised a number of important questions about the underlying mechanisms."

                        "text": "Furthermore, it is also unclear how the ER contents, including misfolded proteins, are segregated during the cell cycle. Under normal growth conditions, terminally misfolded proteins in the ER are retro-translocated into the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes in a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hampton, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bukau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Smith et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thibault and Ng, 2012</a>). When misfolded ER proteins are overexpressed or the ERAD function is diminished, the damaged proteins accumulate into large foci within the ER lumen. A recent study proposed that these large \u2018aggregate\u2019-like foci are selectively retained in the mother cell via a mechanism that depends on the lateral ER diffusion barrier established by the septin ring at the bud neck (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clay et al., 2014</a>). Such lateral diffusion barriers between the mother and daughter yeast cells have been proposed to play pivotal roles in preventing undesirable materials, such as protein aggregates, from transferring to the daughter cells. While the exact mechanisms that establish the mother\u2013daughter diffusion barrier remain to be elucidated, the barrier was reported to be formed as soon as the new bud emerges and depends on the bud site selection component GTPase, Bud1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clay et al., 2014</a>). This study thus presented an attractive model suggesting that ER protein aggregate inheritance is regulated similarly to that of large protein aggregates in the cytoplasm, such as Q-bodies, JUNQ (juxta-nuclear quality control compartment) and IPOD (insoluble protein deposit), which are actively retained in the mother to protect the daughter cell from toxicity of the protein aggregates (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>). However, a potentially unique feature of ER protein aggregate inheritance is that it could be affected by inheritance of the ER itself. To further our understanding of how ER protein aggregates are divided between mother and daughter cells, we investigated the distribution of ER protein aggregates in relation to the inheritance of the ER."

A single amino acid change in CPY* (G255R) leads to improper folding, and the protein accumulates in the ER (<a href=\"#bib14\">Finger et al., 1993</a>). Expression of CPY*-mRFP was placed under the control of the galactose (GAL1) promoter and induced by incubation in galactose-containing media. After 2 hr of induction, CPY*-mRFP formed aggregate-like foci that co-localized with both the cortical ER (cER) and perinuclear ER (pnER) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We quantitated and evaluated the number of CPY*-mRFP foci in individual cells according to the daughter cell (bud) size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A small number (&lt;20%) of cells with small bud size (less than 2 \u03bcm in length; classified as class I cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babour et al., 2010</a>), transferred CPY* foci to the bud, while the majority of cells (\u223c80%) contained foci only in the mother (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, \u223c50\u201360% of class II (medium sized buds, larger than 2 \u03bcm in length) and class III (large buds with the nucleus and pnER in the bud) cells transferred CPY* foci to the bud (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Previous studies have reported that expression of CPY*, but not CFTR, induces the UPR (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chaudhuri et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, we found that induction of CPY*-mRFP resulted in the expression of a UPR reporter (UPRE-GFP, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lane 3), and this was further increased upon treatment of cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (Tm), a well-characterized ER stress inducer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lane 4) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cox et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mori et al., 1993</a>). We also asked whether CPY* aggregates activate the ERSU pathway, which functions to ensure the inheritance of functional cER (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babour et al., 2010</a>). We found that a majority of the class I daughter cells did not inherit the cER under the ER stress condition evoked by CPY*-mRFP expression, and cER inheritance was also diminished in class II and III cells, but to a much lesser extent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Additionally, the magnitude of the cER inheritance block caused by CPY*-mRFP expression was less than that induced by Tm treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E,F</a>).

In our experiments, the moderate expression level of UPRE-GFP revealed that CPY*-mRFP aggregates induced a moderate level of ER stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lane 3) and also induced a mild block in ER inheritance compared with that induced by 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of Tm (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E,F</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Based on the previous report, we anticipated that CPY*-mRFP expression alone (which induced low/medium levels of ER stress) should result in retention of CPY* aggregates in the mother cells. We observed, however, that CPY*-mRFP aggregates were distributed in both mother and daughter cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

Notably, distribution of CPY* aggregates to the daughter cells was also further diminished in these cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>) and correlated with the reduced level of cER transmission (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Likewise, distribution of CFTR aggregates to the daughter cells was only diminished in cells in which ER inheritance was blocked by Tm treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,D</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Collectively, these data therefore demonstrate that the magnitude of the ER inheritance block is affected by the level of ER stress, and that preferential retention of CPY* or CFTR aggregates in the mother cell is not an intrinsic property of the protein aggregates themselves, but rather, is dictated by ER inheritance."

To test this, we examined the distribution of CFTR and CPY* aggregates in <i>slt2\u0394</i> cells, which are incapable of blocking ER inheritance in response to ER stress. We reported previously that Tm (1 \u03bcg/ml) treatment does not block cER inheritance in <i>slt2\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babour et al., 2010</a>) and this was also observed in <i>slt2\u0394</i> cells when ER stress was induced by CPY* aggregate expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> +Gal and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; compare to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> for WT cells). Notably, entry of the cER into the daughter <i>slt2\u0394</i> cells was paralleled by the entry of CPY* aggregates, which contrasts with the ERSU-dependent block in both cER and aggregate inheritance by WT daughter cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> for <i>slt2\u0394</i> vs 2G, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a> for WT).

Therefore, we examined whether Bud1 deficiency affected either cER inheritance or the distribution of ER protein aggregates. We found that the cER inheritance behavior of <i>bud1\u0394</i> cells and WT cells subjected to ER stress by treatment with Tm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or expression of CPY*-mRFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) was similar. Furthermore, transmission of CPY* aggregates was also similar in the two strains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

In both cases, one would expect that the retention of the stressed ER, and thus, of ER protein aggregates, in the mother cell would be limited only to cells with small daughter cells. To investigate these possibilities, we synchronized yeast cells in G1 by incubation with \u03b1-factor.

Even at 200 min after release (3 hr post-Tm), &gt;85% of phase I cells remained undivided (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>; purple bars and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, in most phase I cells, the cER remained in the mother cell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In contrast, at 50 min after \u03b1-factor release (before induction of ER stress), almost all of the phase II daughter cells had already inherited the cER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). After Tm addition, these cells underwent cytokinesis (cell division), and at 1 hr after Tm addition (110 min), \u223c50% of cells were derived from TR-positive mother cells, and the remaining \u223c50% were TR-negative and were derived from the first daughter cell that emerged after \u03b1-factor release (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>, 110 min gray bars and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). After division, the number of cells with the cER in the daughter cell was small (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,F</a>; 110 min, and <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The observed differences between phase I and phase II cells in cytokinesis and ER inheritance were not due to an inability of phase II cells to respond to Tm. Phase I and II cells showed similar degrees of UPR activation after ER stress, as reflected in the levels of spliced <i>HAC1</i> mRNA resulting from activated Ire1 RNase-mediated mRNA cleavage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). Intriguingly, phase II cells exhibited a block in both cytokinesis and cER inheritance block at the second round of division, and the daughter cell arising from the first cell division did not further divide. Instead, we observed cells with two daughter cells. This was also observed for phase I cells in which the second daughter cell started to emerge after 3 hr of Tm treatment. At this point (Tm, 3 hr), \u223c13% of phase II and \u223c20% of phase I cells had two buds (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results therefore demonstrate that cells in which the cER is already in the daughter cell at the time of ER stress induction proceed through cytokinesis once, but display blocks in both cytokinesis and cER inheritance in the next cell cycle."

To test this, we used a FRAP assay with WT cells expressing Kar2/BiP-sfGFP reporter (a major ER chaperone fused to \u2018superfolder\u2019 GFP), which displays significantly better folding in the oxidizing ER luminal environment than GFP or EGFP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pedelacq et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aronson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lajoie et al., 2012</a>). In both mammalian and yeast cells, Kar2/BiP binding to unfolded client proteins increases in response to ER stress, reducing its mobility within the ER lumen (<a href=\"#bib52\">Snapp et al., 2006</a>). This can be monitored by the reduced rate of FRAP. Small areas of the cER or pnER (indicated by black rectangles in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) in the mother and daughter cell were photobleached and the rate of Kar2/BiP-sfGFP fluorescence recovery from the surrounding area was assessed. In the mother cell, the fluorescence recovery rate was significantly reduced by Tm treatment when compared with control DMSO-treated cells, and this was similar for both the cER and pnER (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). However, there were no significant differences between the mother and daughter cell in recovery rates in either the cER or pnER under control or Tm-treated conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), indicating that the ER stress levels are identical in mother and daughter cells. Taken together, the data presented do not support the preferential retention of ER protein aggregates in the mother cell, but instead argue that ER inheritance regulates the fate of unfolded proteins and the inheritance of ER protein aggregates by the daughter cell."

In turn, ER stress activates the ERSU pathway, which blocks ER transmission into the daughter cell (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babour et al., 2010</a>). These observations raise important questions about the potential mechanism(s) underlying the lack of CPY* aggregates in the daughter cell. One explanation is that transmission is blocked concomitantly with the ERSU pathway-mediated block in ER inheritance. Alternatively, independent regulatory mechanisms may also control the segregation of ER protein aggregates. The results of our experiments described here unambiguously demonstrated that the ERSU pathway governs the location of ER protein aggregates."

We found that a majority of class I cells (83%) retained CPY*-mRFP aggregates in the mother and only 17% of daughter cells had inherited the aggregates. At face value, these numbers appear to indicate that CPY*-mRFP aggregates are retained in the mother cells. However, daughter cells lacking the inherited cER should not contain CPY*-mRFP aggregates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In fact, ER stress induced by CPY*-mRFP aggregate expression blocked cER inheritance in a large population of the class I daughter cells. Thus, when the analysis was restricted to daughter cells that contain the cER, we found that 63% of these cER-positive daughter cells also contained CPY*-mRFP aggregates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Even for cells with larger buds (class II or III), we observed that CPY*-mRFP localization was dictated by the presence of the cER in the daughter cell. Thus, we conclude that the cellular distribution of CPY*-mRFP aggregates is determined by the location of the cER. Our conclusions are further supported by the observations with GFP-CFTR; we found that GFP-CFTR aggregates did not activate the ERSU pathway, in agreement with the lack of UPR activation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>). If a separate mechanism exists to retain ER protein aggregates in the mother cell irrespective or independently of the ER inheritance block, we would expect that GFP-CFTR aggregates should be retained in the mother cells. However, we found that GFP-CFTR aggregates entered the daughter cells effectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), and there was no evidence for preferential retention of aggregates in the mother cell. Finally, further support for the hypothesis that the distribution of ER protein aggregates is dictated by the ER inheritance status came from our study of ERSU-deficient <i>slt2\u0394</i> cells. These cells do not undergo a block in ER inheritance in response to ER stress and accordingly, <i>slt2\u0394</i> daughter cells contained higher levels of CPY*-mRFP aggregates than do WT CPY*-mRFP-expressing daughter cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

The aggregates had similar biochemical behavior, as indicated by their detergent insolubility (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Interestingly, GFP-CFTR aggregates were present in almost all of the cER-positive small-budded cells (class I: &lt;2-\u03bcm diameter, gray vs yellow bars in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), whereas CPY*-mRFP aggregates were present in only about half of cER-positive small-budded cells (gray vs yellow bars in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). A similar trend was found after treatment with Tm (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> vs <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). These data suggest that GFP-CFTR aggregates behave like soluble proteins in the ER lumen, perhaps because of the lack of proteotoxicity. In this regard, analysis of GFP-CFTR aggregates could provide a unique opportunity to monitor the behavior of soluble non-toxic ER luminal proteins in live cells."

Our data differ from those in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clay et al., 2014</a>), which showed an increase in CPY*-GFP foci in <i>bud1\u0394</i> daughter cells and thus suggested an important role for Bud1 in the retention of CPY*-GFP foci in the mother cell. Paradoxically, that study observed only one or two CPY*-GFP foci in WT daughter cells and up to six CPY*-GFP foci in <i>bud1\u0394</i> daughter cells. Interestingly, Barral and colleagues argued that the greater abundance of CPY*-GFP foci in the <i>bud1\u0394</i> daughter cells was due to increased transfer of the soluble form of CPY*-GFP from the mother and subsequent formation of CPY*-GFP aggregates in the daughter cell (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clay et al., 2014</a>). However, there was no direct demonstration that soluble CPY*-GFP levels were in fact increased. During our analysis (n &gt; 100 cells per experiment with at least three independent repeats), we never observed significant differences in the average number of CPY*-mRFP aggregates in WT and <i>bud1\u0394</i> daughter cells, or even in WT and <i>bud1\u0394</i> mother cells (data not shown). The reason for the different findings in the two studies is currently not clear. The ERSU pathway functions in at least two different yeast strain backgrounds (W303 and BY4741). Interestingly, <i>bud1\u0394</i> mother cells appear to have a shorter replicative lifespan than WT mother cells under optimal stress-free growth conditions. If CPY* aggregates are retained in the WT mother cell in order to preserve ER proteostasis in the daughter cell and thus ensure its longevity, one may anticipate that <i>bud1\u0394</i> mother cells, which contain fewer CPY* aggregates, would have better ER proteostasis and thus live longer than WT mother cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clay et al., 2014</a>). Together with other data presented here, our finding that CPY*-mRFP aggregate distribution correlates with the lack of the ER inheritance block in <i>bud1\u0394</i> cells strengthens the hypothesis that the ERSU pathway regulates the distribution of ER protein aggregates in yeast daughter cells."

                        "text": "Our results suggest a potentially significant difference in the manner in which cells cope with cytoplasmic vs ER protein aggregates. To date, several distinct cytoplasmic protein aggregates have been reported: ubiquitinated cytoplasmic proteins associate with JUNQ, whereas insoluble proteins associate with IPOD upon proteasome inactivation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>) or in the presence of amyloid proteins such as Huntingtin with extended polyQ. In cells with functional proteasomes, misfolded proteins dynamically form inclusion bodies called Q-body protein aggregates (<a href=\"#bib56\">Spokoini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Roth and Balch, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). An interesting feature of these cytoplasmic protein aggregates is their differential subcellular localization; JUNQ associates with the ER/nucleus, IPOD is found next to the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ogrodnik et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Polling et al., 2014</a>), and Q-bodies are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib56\">Spokoini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). These protein aggregates are selectively retained in the mother cell, and a recent study has revealed an intriguing mechanism for retention of Q-body protein aggregates through association with the ER and eventually with the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). We found that fluorescently tagged forms of both CPY* and CFTR aggregates appeared to be scattered throughout the ER. Ultimately, the ERSU pathway blocks ER inheritance and prevents transmission of ER protein aggregates into the daughter cell. The asymmetric distribution of cytosolic protein aggregates and large inclusions such as JUNQ and IPOD is protective and allows the daughter cells to be rejuvenated during each cell division. ER aggregates may similarly be prevented from entering the daughter cell. But during ER stress, ER aggregates are retained by the ERSU mechanism that prevents transfer of the stressed ER. Cytosolic protein aggregates have been reported to associate with the ER, raising the intriguing possibility that the ER functions as a central controller for the distribution of protein aggregates in the cell. Alternatively, the association of cytoplasmic protein aggregates with the ER may somehow induce ER stress and consequently, the ERSU pathway. In this scenario, the ERSU pathway may function as a master regulator for both the ER and cytoplasmic protein aggregates."

By observing asynchronous populations of yeast cells, we found that both class II and class III cells exhibit the block in ER inheritance during ER stress, but it is less pronounced than in class I cells, as we described in our initial report. This finding suggests that ER stress must be recognized early in the cell cycle in order to induce the ERSU pathway. Significantly, ER transfer to the daughter cell had already taken place in many class II and III cells prior to encountering ER stress, and presumably, these populations contribute to the lower number of cells exhibiting the cER inheritance block. Using synchronized cells, we found that cells at later stages of the cell cycle, when the cER is already in the daughter cell at the time of exposure to ER stress, undergo cytokinesis for the first round of the cell cycle but exhibit a block in cER inheritance and cytokinesis during the second round. Thus, the ERSU pathway is effective only when ER stress is sensed at an early stage of the cell cycle and can be ignored until the second cell cycle if the cER was already present in the daughter cell."

Failure to align chromosomes properly, for example, activates the spindle assembly checkpoint, leading to inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex and induction of cell death (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang and Barford, 2014</a>). To our knowledge, the observation that class II and III cells with cER-containing daughter cells proceed normally through the first round of cytokinesis after ER stress, <i>and that this \u2018error\u2019 is not corrected</i> until the second round, is unprecedented. Results of the FRAP experiments indicate that ER stress was manifested within 30 min of stress induction in both class II or III daughter cells. Thus, these cells must somehow bypass the ERSU pathway-induced cytokinesis block in the first round of division but halt the cell cycle during the next round of cytokinesis. In the case of the replication checkpoints, it would not be possible to lose a chromosome at the first division and then recover during the second cell cycle. In contrast, a functionally stressed ER might be tolerated if the problem is resolved promptly in the next cell cycle. Currently, the molecular mechanisms dictating the decisions by class I, II, and III cells to proceed\u2014or not\u2014through cytokinesis are unknown; the answers to these and other questions raised here await further studies."

Protein extracts were prepared and the following detergent solubility test was performed (as described in [<a href=\"#bib2\">Alberti et al., 2010</a>]) to characterize the CPY*-mRFP and GFP-CFTR foci observed under the microscope. The cell pellet was resuspended in 600 \u03bcl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (5 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride [PMSF], aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A), 50 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 25 \u03bcM MG132, and then lysed with glass beads at 4\u00b0C. A sample of 300 \u03bcl of the lysate was mixed with 300 \u03bcl of cold detergent-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, (SDS) and vortexed for 10 s. The remaining 300 \u03bcl of sample was diluted with an additional 300 \u03bcl of lysis buffer. The crude lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 800 rcf (4\u00b0C) to pellet the cell debris. Supernatant samples (250 \u03bcl each) were centrifuged in a TLA 100 rotor for 30 min at 80,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C using a TL Beckman ultracentrifuge. The pellet from the RIPA buffer lysate was resuspended in 250 \u03bcl of RIPA buffer. The pellet from the lysis buffer only was resuspended in 250 \u00b5l of lysis buffer (no detergent). Equal volumes of unfractionated (total), supernatant (S), and pellet (P) samples were incubated in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 2% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. CPY*-mRFP extracts were heated for 5 min at 95\u00b0C, and GFP-CFTR extracts were heated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. CPY*-mRFP was detected with anti-mRFP rat monoclonal antibody (1:1000, cat # ABIN334653, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rat antibody (Bio-Rad). GFP-CFTR was detected with anti-GFP mouse monoclonal (1:1000, cat # 11814460001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad)."
