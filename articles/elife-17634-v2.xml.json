Ptch, a proton driven antiporter, is required for Smo inhibition via an unknown mechanism. Hh ligand binding to Ptch reverses this inhibition and activated Smo initiates the Hh response. To determine whether Ptch inhibits Smo strictly in the same cell or also mediates non-cell-autonomous Smo inhibition, we generated genetically mosaic neuralized embryoid bodies (nEBs) from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). These experiments utilized novel mESC lines in which <i>Ptch1, Ptch2, Smo, Shh</i> and <i>7dhcr</i> were inactivated via gene editing in multiple combinations, allowing us to measure non-cell autonomous interactions between cells with differing Ptch1/2 status. In several independent assays, the Hh response was repressed by Ptch1/2 in nearby cells. When <i>7dhcr</i> was targeted, cells displayed elevated non-cell autonomous inhibition. These findings support a model in which Ptch1/2 mediate secretion of a Smo-inhibitory cholesterol precursor."

Ptch, a proton driven antiporter, is required for Smo inhibition via an unknown mechanism. Hh ligand binding to Ptch reverses this inhibition and activated Smo initiates the Hh response. To determine whether Ptch inhibits Smo strictly in the same cell or also mediates non-cell-autonomous Smo inhibition, we generated genetically mosaic neuralized embryoid bodies (nEBs) from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). These experiments utilized novel mESC lines in which <i>Ptch1, Ptch2, Smo, Shh</i> and <i>7dhcr</i> were inactivated via gene editing in multiple combinations, allowing us to measure non-cell autonomous interactions between cells with differing Ptch1/2 status. In several independent assays, the Hh response was repressed by Ptch1/2 in nearby cells. When <i>7dhcr</i> was targeted, cells displayed elevated non-cell autonomous inhibition. These findings support a model in which Ptch1/2 mediate secretion of a Smo-inhibitory cholesterol precursor."

Despite the discovery of exogenous and endogenous molecules capable of regulating Smo, no Smo-regulatory Ptch substrate has been identified (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sharpe et al., 2015</a>). Nevertheless, several observations indicate that the endogenous cargo of Ptch is a steroidal molecule: (1) the plant-derived steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine binds Smo and inhibits the Hh response (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Incardona et al., 1998</a>); (2) heterologous Ptch expression in yeast enhances BODIPY-cholesterol efflux (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bidet et al., 2011</a>); (3) the closest prokaryotic homolog of Ptch, HpnH, transports bacterial sterols (hopanoids) from the inner to the outer bacterial membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doughty et al., 2011</a>); (4) 7-dehydroxycholesterol reductase (7DHCR), catalyzes the conversion of 7DHC into cholesterol and genetic loss of <i>7dhcr</i> is associated with defects in Shh signaling, perhaps via accumulation of a late sterol precursor (or its derivative) that inhibits Smo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bijlsma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gruchy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Incardona et al., 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Linder et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sever et al., 2016</a>); (5) Ptch has a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that is conserved within sterol biogenesis regulatory enzymes, and thus likely binds sterols (<a href=\"#bib33\">Incardona, 2005</a>), and this domain is necessary for Smo inhibition by Ptch in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Strutt et al., 2001</a>). Within the third transmembrane domain of the SSD (the fourth transmembrane domain of Ptch1) resides a universally conserved Aspartic acid residue that when mutated in bacterial RNDs blocks transport (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 1999</a>). Mutation of this residue in Ptch1 yields an allele unable to inhibit Smo both in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alfaro et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Strutt et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Taipale et al., 2000</a>).

The observation that murine fibroblasts overexpressing Ptch1 can condition their supernatant with a Smo inhibitor supports this notion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bijlsma et al., 2006</a>). However, few reports address non-cell-autonomous Smo regulation by Ptch1 antiporter activity. This may be due to other non-cell autonomous mechanisms of Ptch-mediated inhibition unrelated to its antiporter activity, such as its proposed ability to sequester Hedgehog ligands from the environment and thus suppress the Hh response (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Struhl, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Incardona et al., 2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Milenkovic et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Strutt et al., 2001</a>). Ligand sequestration by Ptch thus complicates efforts to assess non-cell autonomous antiporter-mediated Ptch activity. Besides these possible non-cell autonomous activities, Ptch plays a cell autonomous role in the activation of Smo via the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yavari et al., 2010</a>) that can activate Smo via its intracellular C-terminal domain."

Shh is expressed ventrally in embryos in the notochord and floor plate, yielding a ventral to dorsal gradient of Hh pathway activity in which ventral cell types have a high level of pathway activation. We can effectively model these signaling events in vitro by differentiating genetically distinct stem cells into neuralized embryoid bodies (nEBs) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meinhardt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wichterle et al., 2002</a>). nEBs have previously been shown to be highly responsive to Shh, the Smo agonist SAG, and cyclopamine, indicating that Smo activity is subject to regulation in this system (<a href=\"#bib20\">Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2002</a>).

If the null hypothesis of Ptch1/2 as strict cell-autonomous Smo inhibitors is true, we predict that in mosaic tissues in which cell differ in regard to their Ptch1/2 status the resulting level of Hh response is the average of both constituent cells cultured alone.

We then demonstrate that within genetically mosaic nEBs, cells with Ptch1/2 activity inhibit the Hh response non-cell autonomously in neighboring cells deficient for Ptch1/2 that contain activated Smo. Ptch1/2 also inhibits the response of neighboring wild-type cells to Shh and the Smo agonist SAG.

Because <i>Shh</i> encodes an activating factor, and Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells indicate pathway quiescence, this cell line differentiated in the manner predicted. <i>Ptch1</i><sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup> nEBs by contrast were highly ventral (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,M</a>), corroborating previous reports using this cell line, and supporting the canonical view that Ptch1 is a negative pathway regulator (<i>Ptch1</i><sup>LacZ</sup> is an established null allele [<a href=\"#bib24\">Goodrich et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rohatgi et al., 2007</a>]).

Before employing this assay in mosaic nEBs, we investigated whether Ptch1:LacZ induction mirrored ventral neural progenitor differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) in our cell line panel.

These measurements corroborate our findings in monotypic nEBs with neural progenitor markers and support a role for Smo-dependent, Shh ligand-mediated signaling in nEBs lacking Ptch1 (but not Ptch2), and the loss of Shh dependence in the complete absence of Ptch1/2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These data suggest that Ptch1:LacZ is a reliable output for Hh pathway activity across cell lines. We performed a time-course experiment to more precisely establish the point of maximal pathway activation.

We speculate that this is due to varying levels of Ptch2 activity. It also appears that the loss of Smo decreases the ability of Ptch1/2 to inhibit the Hh response non-cell autonomously. This observation is easily explained by a decrease in Ptch1/2 levels as Ptch1/2 expression is under the control of Smo. Thus, even in the complete absence of Hh pathway activation, Ptch1/2 can still inhibit Smo. This is consistent with the observation that in tissues without detectable levels of Ptch1/2, Smo remains inactive."

We previously demonstrated that Ptch1 localizes to late endosomes while mediating Shh uptake, and that Shh signaling requires endosomal acidification (<a href=\"#bib31\">Incardona et al., 2002</a>). Conserved acidic residues required for proton flux in prokaryotic RNDs are also required for Ptch1 to repress Smo (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alfaro et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Strutt et al., 2001</a>). One possibility is that Ptch1/2 enrich the endosomal lumen or intraluminal vesicular in multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) with a Smo inhibitor.

This view is consistent with the known role of the prokaryotic RND HpnN (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doughty et al., 2011</a>) that transports bacterial sterols between inner and outer membranes.

The finding that genetically normal stromal cells respond to Shh expressing tumors by infiltrating and supporting them heightens the importance of our observations because Ptch1/2 loss in the tumor may affect Shh sensitivity in supporting stromal cells non-cell autonomously (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yauch et al., 2008</a>).

Responding cells interpret graded Hh ligand distributions, resulting in stereotyped patterning, and Ptch1/2 have complex roles in this process. As Hh receptors, Ptch1/2 bind extracellular Shh and initiate the response. In Drosophila, Ptch activation results in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate that in turn activates Smo via its intracellular C-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yavari et al., 2010</a>), a mechanism conserved in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2016</a>). Invariably, Hh signaling induces <i>Ptch1/2</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holtz et al., 2013</a>) and Ptch1/2 induction then leads to negative feedback, possibly by secreting more Smo inhibitor, increasing Shh sequestration, or both. Our finding that Ptch1/2 inhibit the Hh response non-cell autonomously, even in nEBs devoid of Shh ligand, supports the notion that the non-cell autonomous inhibition mediated by Ptch1/2 is mediated by the antiporter activity of Ptch1/2, rather than by ligand sequestration. The ability of relatively few Ptch1/2 expressing cells to inhibit the Hh response pathway further supports this idea."

Identity of these lines was confirmed by the presence of 40 chromosomes per cell, and mouse-specific DNA sequences of the edited genes. mESC lines were maintained using standard conditions in dishes coated with gelatin, without feeder cells. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasm by Hoechst stain, and grown in the presence of tetracycline and gentamycin at regular intervals. Cultures with visible Mycoplasma infection were discarded. None of the cell lines used in this study is listed in the Database of Cross-Contaminated or Misidentified Cell Lines."

The mechanism of Ptch inhibition of Hh signaling remains poorly understood and answering this question will be of broad interest. The idea that Ptch might act non-autonomously to inhibit Shh signaling has been around for a some time in the field. Nevertheless the evidence one way or the other has been weak. The additions and alterations the authors have made to their study deal with some of the criticisms that were raised in the initial review.

This experiment reintroduces Shh expressing cells into the system (from the Smo-/- cells). This seems to be what the authors are trying to avoid in most experiments in order to simplify interpretation. Smo-/- cells have the effect of reducing Nkx2.2 in neighbouring cells, which is rationalized as being due to the presence of Ptch in these cells, however the effect is 'mild', as Ptch activity itself is reduced by the Shh produced by the Smo-/- cells. This experiment and the convoluted interpretation seems to add little clarity, especially as the comparison is between Ptch1-/-;Ptch2-/-Smo-/- (which have no non-cell autonomous effect on Nkx2.2/Olig2), and Smo-/- (which have slightly reduced Nkx2.2 and increased Olig2)."

Why is there a larger inhibition of Hh signaling by 7DHC in cells cocultured with shh-/- or shh-/-;dhcr7-/- cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)? The authors suggest that it could be because Ptch1/2 processes 7DHC into a more potent non-autonomous inhibitor. However it is important to note that deleting DHCR7 or addition of 7DHC to cells will also have substantial feedback effects on cholesterol biosynthetic pathway that could effect multiple cellular processes, notably vesicle trafficking and/or cilia formation. The effects observed in these experiments could therefore be indirect because a change in e.g. vesicle trafficking."

The authors make two observations. First, through a complex series of experiments using numerous embryonic stem cells lines that lack key components of the Hh pathway, the authors demonstrate that Ptch2 (in the absence of Ptch1) is capable of inhibiting Smo. In a second series of experiments, through co-culture methods, the authors show that the Ptch1 and Ptch2 are capable of inhibiting Smo via non-cell autonomous interactions. From these studies, the authors conclude that Ptch1 and Ptch2 mediate the secretion of a factor that inhibits Smo activation in nearby cells."

Through multiple experiments, the authors make a case for the existence of a secreted factor mediated by Ptch1/2 that is capable of inhibiting Smo activity. While no factor is directly identified, its existence is intriguing and would be a significant contribution to the large body of work that has been dedicated towards understanding the interaction between Ptch and Smo.

If NEB tissue still exists, this should be fairly easy to accomplish. One could use markers such as Caspase3 to assess for cell death, <i>Sox2</i> (or any broadly expressed progenitor marker) to assess for progenitor abundance, and Tuj1 or Neun (or any broadly expressed neuronal markers) to assess for neuronal abundance.

We feel these studies illustrate that mechanistic insights remain to be discovered even though at first glance they seem to be at odds with canonical models for Hh signaling. Of note is a recent Nature paper (Byrne et al., July 26 2016) that demonstrates a cholesterol binding pocket in the N-terminal extracellular Cysteine-rich domain (CRD), that is required for Hh signal transduction, further suggesting orthosteric regulation of Smo activity via the CRD."

While it may be anecdotal, this is actually supported by <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, in which the control NEB is by far the largest and is made up of more ventral progenitors than the PtchLacZ/LacZ; Ptch2-/-, Smo-/- NEB. For this reason, I would encourage that a few control experiments be done to determine if there are any differences in (i) progenitor abundance, (ii) neuronal abundance, and (iii) cell death across the various mESC cell lines. If NEB tissue still exists, this should be fairly easy to accomplish. One could use markers such as Caspase3 to assess for cell death, Sox2 (or any broadly expressed progenitor marker) to assess for progenitor abundance, and Tuj1 or Neun (or any broadly expressed neuronal markers) to assess for neuronal abundance.
