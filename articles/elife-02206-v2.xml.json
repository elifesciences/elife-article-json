To define a basis for such variation, we examined clock speed in a reporter-modified Bay-0 x Shakdara recombinant inbred line and localized heritable variation. Extensive variation led us to identify <i>EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3)</i> as a major quantitative trait locus (QTL). The causal nucleotide polymorphism caused a short-period phenotype under light and severely dampened rhythm generation in darkness, and entrainment alterations resulted. We found that ELF3-Sha protein failed to properly localize to the nucleus, and its ability to accumulate in darkness was compromised. Evidence was provided that the <i>ELF3-Sha</i> allele originated in Central Asia. Collectively, we showed that ELF3 protein plays a vital role in defining its light-repressor action in the circadian clock and that its functional abilities are largely dependent on its cellular localization."

To define a basis for such variation, we examined clock speed in a reporter-modified Bay-0 x Shakdara recombinant inbred line and localized heritable variation. Extensive variation led us to identify <i>EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3)</i> as a major quantitative trait locus (QTL). The causal nucleotide polymorphism caused a short-period phenotype under light and severely dampened rhythm generation in darkness, and entrainment alterations resulted. We found that ELF3-Sha protein failed to properly localize to the nucleus, and its ability to accumulate in darkness was compromised. Evidence was provided that the <i>ELF3-Sha</i> allele originated in Central Asia. Collectively, we showed that ELF3 protein plays a vital role in defining its light-repressor action in the circadian clock and that its functional abilities are largely dependent on its cellular localization."

During these diurnal cycles, light is correlated with warmth, while darkness is correlated with coolness. Thus, to ensure fitness in response to such regular environmental oscillations, many organisms have evolved an internal timing mechanism to predict these cyclic environmental cues, and this is termed the circadian clock. This internal clock synchronizes major developmental and physiological processes. For example, a considerable proportion of metabolism is under clock control (<a href=\"#bib21\">Graf et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haydon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sanchez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sanchez-Villarreal et al., 2013</a>), and seasonal developmental programs require a circadian oscillator (<a href=\"#bib63\">Thines and Harmon, 2011</a>). The coordination of molecular and physiological processes with the external environment thus provides an adaptive advantage under diverse climatic conditions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dodd et al., 2005</a>)."

In Arabidopsis, the central loop consists of two closely related single-myb transcription factors, CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), as well as the pseudo response regulator (PRR) TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1). In the morning, CCA1 and LHY repress <i>TOC1</i> by directly binding to its promoter, resulting in the evening accumulation of TOC1, which, in turn, represses <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gendron et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). The core oscillator is further tuned by an evening- and morning-phased loop. The evening loop is proposed to include GIGANTEA (GI) and TOC1, where GI activates the expression of <i>TOC1</i>, and TOC1 represses <i>GI</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Locke et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zeilinger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Two members of the pseudo response regulator gene family, <i>PRR7</i> and <i>PRR9</i>, repress <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> during the day, and this establishes the morning loop (<a href=\"#bib41\">Locke et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zeilinger et al., 2006</a>). Recently, an evening complex comprising EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), and LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX) has been found to repress the morning loop by specifically binding to the <i>PRR9</i> promoter to mediate transcription repression (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nozue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kolmos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dixon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Helfer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nusinow et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Herrero and Davis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>)."

PRR7 and PRR9 have been reported to play a role in temperature compensation, which is the resistance of period change under differing mean ambient temperatures (<a href=\"#bib54\">Salom\u00e9 and McClung, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Salome et al., 2010</a>). However, diurnal temperature regulation of the circadian clock is still poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib44\">McClung and Davis, 2010</a>). In contrast, light has been established as a key factor for the entrainment of the clock where continuous irradiation shortens free-running period length in a fluence-rate-dependent manner as a process termed parametric entrainment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aschoff, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Covington et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Johnson et al., 2003</a>). Most genetic components of the clock were originally discovered from a light-entrained oscillator. Several studies have shown that many observable rhythms in plants dampen in constant darkness (DD), where dampening is defined as a reduction in circadian amplitude. For example, many genes have been associated with circadian rhythms of mRNA abundance that are expressed robustly under constant light (LL), but dampen in DD (<a href=\"#bib65\">Watillon et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhong et al., 1997</a>). Furthermore, the cyclic protein accumulation of several clock-regulated components, such as GI and ELF3 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">David et al., 2006</a>), was found to be reduced when shifted to darkness.

The <i>elf3</i> mutant was originally isolated in a screen for lines displaying photoperiod-independent early flowering (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zagotta et al., 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">1996</a>). Further characterization of <i>elf3</i> revealed other severe phenotypes, including defects in clock-regulated leaf movement rhythms, rhythmic hypocotyl elongation, and arrhythmic expression of gene expression under the free running condition of LL and in DD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hicks et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Reed et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thines and Harmon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kolmos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>). Natural variation at <i>ELF3</i> has been detected that could be associated to an alteration in shade-avoidance responses, which included increased elongation of the hypocotyl, delay of cotyledon opening in seedlings, increased elongation of stems and petioles, and reduced developmental timing in adults, and to changes in circadian function (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tajima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jimenez-Gomez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Coluccio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Undurraga et al., 2012</a>). <i>ELF3</i> was cloned and reported to encode a nuclear protein of unknown function, and it was proposed to work as a transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hicks et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2001</a>). Based on the accumulation of ELF3 protein upon shifting plants to LL, and its decrease when plants were shifted to DD, it was concluded that its abundance is dependent on ambient light (<a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2001</a>). To extend this hypothesis based on the reported light-dependent phenotypes of <i>elf3</i>, <a href=\"#bib46\">McWatters et al. (2000)</a> proposed that ELF3 fulfills the so-called <i>zeitnehmer</i> concept, in that this factor acts to bridge light perception to the clock. This idea was further strengthened when ELF3 was found to physically interact with the phytochromeB photoreceptor (<a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2001</a>). The previously noted role of ELF3 in light input to the circadian clock (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kolmos et al., 2011</a>) is not altered by new findings that <i>ELF3</i> is core to the oscillator."

Worldwide, the species distribution of Arabidopsis ranges from the equator to extreme northern latitudes near the Arctic Circle (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koornneef et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, as an alternative to induced mutants, another source of genetic variation can be found among naturally occurring populations of Arabidopsis. More specifically, environmental variations across and within local populations of Arabidopsis act as a discriminatory force on the gene pool from which only a few genetic variants of adaptive phenotypes will be selected and pass through reproduction. Arabidopsis populations based on Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) have been derived from parental accessions. Such populations are advantageous in mapping novel gene interactions. For example, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was used to explain circadian parameters associated with natural variation in the circadian rhythmicity of leaf movement (<a href=\"#bib59\">Swarup et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Michael et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Edwards et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anwer and Davis, 2013</a>). More recently, the rhythm of bioluminescence from modified firefly <i>LUCIFERASE</i> (<i>LUC</i>) genes coupled to the clock-controlled promoter was successfully used to map QTLs for circadian parameters (<a href=\"#bib9\">Darrah et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boikoglou et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the luciferase-based system can be employed to accurately measure variation in circadian-rhythm parameters within RIL populations to detect phenotypically expressed genetic variation in circadian clock genes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anwer and Davis, 2013</a>)."

Classical QTL mapping in a modified Bay-0 x Shakdara mapping population, followed by positional cloning, revealed an allele of <i>ELF3</i> (<i>ELF3-Sha</i>) that accelerates circadian oscillations in a light-dependent manner and a dampened oscillator in darkness. We determined that the periodicity phenotype of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> results from a single encoded amino-acid change A362V, which is an allelic variant that is largely confined to a latitudinal stripe in Central Asia. Furthermore, we identified that the circadian abnormalities in <i>ELF3-Sha</i> are associated to cellular localization defects of ELF3 protein that results in an inability to properly function under light and in darkness. Thus, by characterizing <i>ELF3-Sha</i>, we clarified the molecular mode-of-action of ELF3 in the circadian clock."

These lines were synchronized to respective photic and thermal entrainment, and free-running periodicity was assessed under identical conditions of constant light and constant temperature. After applying both entrainment protocols, extensive variation in periodicity was observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>); however, the two parental ecotypes displayed similar periodicity, irrespective of preceding entrainment. Compared to photic entrainment, a significant shift for shortened free-running periodicity of <i>CCR2</i> after thermal entrainment was observed for the parental lines, as well as RILs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The periodicity differences after respective photic vs thermal entrainment (Period Light Dark (LD)\u2013Period TMP [TMP]) extended from minus 0.56 hr to plus 1.66 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), with parental lines displaying periodicity differences of plus 1.84 and plus 2.15 hr for Sha and Bay-0, respectively (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boikoglou et al., 2011</a>). The averaged periodicity differences of BxS lines were moderate (0.433, p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Thus, despite the transgressive variation observed in the RILs for <i>CCR2</i> periodicity and periodicity differences (LD-TMP), the averaged periodicity differences seen in the RILs were similar in magnitude as the periodicity differences seen in the parental lines."

The factor with the most significant effect in period variation was environment, with genotypes having a lesser, albeit highly significant effect (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Moreover, when the genotypic effect was compared between RILs and transformants, a far greater variation in periodicity could be observed in RILs (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

Three HIFs were made (57, 92 and 343; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for construction details), each harboring either the Bay allele (HIF-Bay-0) or Sha allele (HIF-Sha) at the Chr2 locus. An analysis of the free-running period of these lines revealed that HIF-Sha always displayed a shorter period as compared to HIF-Bay-0. This period-shortening effect was independent of the preceding LD or TMP entrainment condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The complexities of the HIF genomic structure created the possibility for equally complex epistatic interactions that cannot be simply defined. Therefore, to circumvent the possibility of such interactions, a NIL with a small introgression of Sha at this Chr2 locus (NIL-S), in an otherwise homogeneous Bay genetic background, was generated. This line was measured for periodicity. Consistent with the HIFs, NIL-S displayed a 2-hr shorter period, as compared to Bay-0, which was only observed under LL. In DD, no significant period difference was detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, in DD, the free-running profile of <i>CCR2::LUC</i> in NIL-S was different from the Bay parental line, so that, in NIL-S, <i>CCR2::LUC</i> rhythmicity lost robustness, whereas <i>CCR2::LUC</i> in Bay-0 displayed rhythms for 7 days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, under both LL and in DD, the Sha parental line displayed a <i>CCR2::LUC</i> profile similar to that of Bay-0, and different from NIL-S (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B and 3A</a>)."

Next, we assessed the effect of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> on hypocotyl length by measuring the hypocotyl length of HIFs, NIL-S, Bay-0, Sha, and the null allele <i>elf3-1</i> under short days, constant red (RR), and constant blue (BB) light. Similar to the near lack of flowering-time phenotype under long days, we did not observe a substantial difference in the hypocotyl length of HIFs, NIL-S, and Bay-0 under RR or BB. Under short days, however, HIF 89-S displayed a marginally elongated hypocotyl length, compared to HIF 539-B, but this response was four times less than that seen in the null <i>elf3</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Overall, a NIL that harbored <i>ELF3-Sha</i> in a Bay background did not display substantial physiological effects under normal growth conditions, indicating that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> maintains developmental activity lost in null <i>elf3</i> alleles."

Therefore, to test the precision of <i>LHY::LUC</i> expression rhythms in <i>ELF3-Bay</i> and <i>ELF3-A362V</i>, we estimated the period and R.A.E. of these lines under LL and in DD. Under LL, <i>ELF3-A362V</i> displayed a \u223c1.5-hr short period compared to <i>ELF3-Bay</i>, with both lines showing high precision (R.A.E. &lt;0.20; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6B and 7A</a>, ZT40-120). However, in darkness, while both lines had similar period estimates, <i>ELF3-A362V</i> did not maintain precision and displayed high R.A.E. (R.A.E. &gt;0.75), compared to <i>ELF3-Bay</i> (R.A.E. &lt;0.35; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6B and 7B</a>, ZT160-240). Interestingly, the loss of precision of <i>LHY::LUC</i> rhythm was recovered in <i>ELF3-A362V</i> when the plants were returned to the light at ZT250 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6B and 7C</a>, ZT260-340). This restoration of precision led us to hypothesize that in darkness the clock remains partially functional in <i>ELF3-Sha</i> in the context of this low precision. To confirm this, we performed an experiment where the phase of <i>ELF3-Bay</i> and <i>ELF3-A362V</i> lines was estimated after resumption of plants to LL that were previously subjected to different intervals of darkness. We reasoned that if the <i>ELF3-A362V</i> plants are truly arrhythmic in DD, then the circadian phase after resumption of light should be determined solely by the exposure to light and not by the duration of the dark period. For <i>ELF3-Bay</i>, with a more functional clock in the dark, the phase will be determined in part by the duration of dark exposure. We found that <i>LHY::LUC</i> peaked at a similar time in both <i>ELF3-Bay</i> and <i>ELF3-A363V</i>, which in part was determined by the duration of the dark period. This revealed the presence of a partially functional oscillator during the dark period in both these lines. Further, no significant phase difference between these lines was detected at any time point tested (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Interestingly, consistent with the above results (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), once the plants were transferred back to the light, robust rhythms of <i>LHY::LUC</i> were restored (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Notably, in a phase\u2013difference graph (Phase <i>ELF3-Bay</i> minus Phase <i>ELF3-A362V</i>), a consistent pattern of phase oscillations was detected, supporting the existence of a functional oscillator in both <i>ELF3-Bay</i> and <i>ELF3-A362V</i> that display differences in their respective resetting behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This confirms that ELF3-Sha contributes to light-input to the clock, but displays differences in its \u2018<i>zeitnehmer</i>\u2019 entrainment capacity. Taken together, we concluded that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> requires light input to maintain precision of the circadian clock; however, darkness does not fully abolish the low-amplitude oscillation in <i>ELF3-Sha</i> plants and that entrainment processes appear altered."

These trends were termed alpha compression and alpha expansion, respectively. This process is also known as parametric entrainment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aschoff, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Johnson et al., 2003</a>). ELF3, as a repressor of light signaling to the clock, is expected to be involved in such parametric entrainment (<a href=\"#bib8\">Covington et al., 2001</a>). In the past, the availability of null mutants precluded testing such a hypothesis. However, the fact that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> is a functional allele could be advantageous in determining if <i>ELF3</i> is involved in parametric entrainment. To test this, we measured the free-running period of Bay and NIL-S under an array of fluences, including RR, BB, and \u2018white\u2019 (RB) light. Under diverse intensities and qualities of light, we found that NIL-S displayed a shorter period than Bay. Moreover, both Bay and NIL-S followed Aschoff's rule, displaying shortening of periodicity with increase in fluence rate (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>). From these results, one of two conclusions may be drawn: (1) that ELF3 is not directly involved in parametric entrainment or (2) that the <i>ELF3-Sha</i> allele is fully functional in discriminating between different light intensities."

Wild-type plants with a functional clock entrained under 24-hr environmental cycles (T24) maintain the same rhythms when transferred to shorter cycles (T12). In this way, plants resist the resetting of the oscillator by sporadic environmental changes during a diurnal cycle. However, if the short cycles (T12) persist, a robust clock should reset to the new environment. Conversely, when transferred from T24 to T12, mutants with a dysfunctional clock promptly follow the shorter cycles (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nozue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thines and Harmon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kolmos et al., 2011</a>). To test the demultiplication ability of <i>ELF3-Sha</i>, we monitored <i>LHY::LUC</i> expression for 7 days in <i>ELF3-Bay</i>, <i>ELF3-A362V</i>, Ws-2, and <i>elf3-4</i> lines under T12 cycles (6 hr light and 6 hr dark) after initially entraining under T24 cycles (12 hr light and 12 hr dark). As previously reported for null <i>elf3</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kolmos et al., 2011</a>), we detected a driven 24 hr rhythm, and, thereafter, <i>LHY::LUC</i> completely followed the T12 cycles in this mutant, revealing, in turn, a dysfunctional clock (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). As expected, both Ws-2 and <i>ELF3-Bay</i> initially resisted the T12 cycles for 3 days, displaying driven T24 rhythms. However, after 3 days, both Ws-2 and <i>ELF3-Bay</i> showed a robust adaptation to the T12 cycles, which were observed as strong <i>LHY::LUC</i> peaks matching the peaks expected for T12 cycles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Interestingly, <i>ELF3-A362V</i> did not show this effect in T12 cycles, and strong <i>LHY::LUC</i> peaks completely matched the T24 cycles for all 5 days (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Since both Ws-2 and <i>ELF3-Bay</i> responded to persistent T12 cycles, while <i>ELF3-Sha</i> did not, we concluded from these results that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> failed to perceive persistent new environmental signals, revealing that the circadian oscillator in <i>ELF3-Sha</i> is indeed defective in proper entrainment resetting."

Accordingly, expression profiling revealed that <i>elf3</i> had reduced expression of the core oscillator genes <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i>, but high levels of the evening genes <i>TOC1</i> and <i>GI</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fowler et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kikis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dixon et al., 2011</a>). As these null <i>elf3</i> studies were conducted in the context of arrhythmia, placing <i>ELF3</i> in the clock network has been difficult. However, as <i>ELF3-Sha</i> displayed rhythmicity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), we monitored the luciferase reporter expression profile of the central clock genes <i>CCA1</i>, <i>LHY</i>, <i>TOC1</i>, <i>GI, PRR7,</i> and <i>PRR9</i> in NIL-S and compared it with Bay-0 wild type and the null mutants <i>elf3-1</i> and <i>elf3-4</i> under both LL and DD. Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kikis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thines and Harmon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dixon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kolmos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>), both null mutants, <i>elf3-1</i> and <i>elf3-4</i>, displayed arrhythmia with reduced levels of <i>CCA1::LUC</i> and <i>LHY::LUC</i> and high levels of <i>TOC1::LUC</i>, <i>GI::LUC</i>, <i>PRR7::LUC,</i> and <i>PRR9::LUC,</i> compared to Bay-0 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Consistent with the short-period phenotype of <i>CCR2::LUC</i> in NIL-S (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), all clock genes also displayed a short-period phenotype (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013F</a>). The comparison of expression profiles of these clock genes in NIL-S, <i>elf3-1</i>, <i>elf3-4</i> and Bay-0 revealed an intermediate effect of <i>ELF3-Sha</i>. Specifically, in NIL-S, the expression of <i>CCA1::LUC</i> and <i>LHY::LUC</i> was higher than that of <i>elf3-1</i> and <i>elf3-4,</i> but lower than that of Bay-0. Similarly, the expression of <i>TOC1::LUC</i>, <i>GI::LUC, PRR7::LUC,</i> and <i>PRR9::LUC</i> in NIL-S was lower than that of <i>elf3-1</i> and <i>elf3-4</i>, but higher than that of Bay-0 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013F</a>). Similar to LL, profiles of luciferase expression for clock genes with reduced levels in DD were observed in NIL-S, <i>elf3-1</i>, <i>elf3-4</i> and Bay-0, except that of <i>TOC1::LUC</i> in NIL-S, which was high and comparable to the null mutants (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G\u2013L</a>). A continuous increase in the expression of <i>GI::LUC</i> in NIL-S was also observed. No significant period difference was observed in NIL-S and Bay-0 in any clock gene under DD. Consistent results were also obtained when we confirmed the luciferase expression data by monitoring the transcript profile of these genes under LL (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Unlike <i>elf3-1</i> and <i>elf3-4</i> loss-of-function mutants, our cumulative results indicate that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> is a hypomorphic allele capable of sustaining the oscillation network."

Thus, the short-period phenotype of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> could be caused by a reduced level of <i>ELF3</i> transcript or protein accumulation. To test this, we first measured the transcript accumulation of <i>ELF3</i> and then assessed the amount of protein generated. We found that the mean level of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> transcript was slightly higher relative to <i>ELF3-Bay</i>. Correspondingly, higher ELF3-Sha protein accumulation was detected in comparison to <i>ELF3-Bay</i>, as measured by the ELF3-YFP signals (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A\u2013D</a>). As increases in ELF3 drives a long period (<a href=\"#bib8\">Covington et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>), elevated protein levels in <i>ELF3-Sha</i> thus did not explain the short-period phenotype. Importantly, a more detailed comparison of ELF3-Bay-YFP and ELF3-Sha-YFP revealed differences in cellular localization. Specifically, the formation of distinct nuclear bodies, a characteristic of ELF3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>), was markedly attenuated in ELF3-Sha, whereas these nuclear bodies were clearly observable in ELF3-Bay (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A,B</a>). Additionally, the preferential nuclear localization of ELF3 was compromised in ELF3-Sha, which displayed a markedly elevated amount of cytoplasmic content, compared to ELF3-Bay (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A\u2013D</a>). Quantification of YFP revealed that the nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic ratio of ELF3-Sha was four times less than that of ELF3-Bay (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12E</a>). As such, we proposed that these localization defects of ELF3-Sha underlie its oscillator defects."

This is particularly relevant as it has been shown that ELF3 accumulates under light, but quickly dissipates in darkness by proteasomal machinery involving the action of COP1 and GI. Furthermore, both these proteins physically interact with ELF3 to form similar nuclear bodies that are presumed to be their point of interaction (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>). As such, it could be anticipated that the lack of formation of such nuclear bodies in ELF3-Sha might result in its dysregulation. To examine such a possibility, we monitored the patterns of <i>ELF3</i> transcript and protein accumulation over a diurnal cycle under LD compared to the same patterns under LL and in DD. Under LD, we found only a minor increase in <i>ELF3-Sha</i> transcript and protein levels compared to <i>ELF3-Bay</i> (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A,B</a>). However, under LL, the <i>ELF3-Sha</i> transcript was significantly higher at all time-points compared to <i>ELF3-Bay,</i> which also resulted in elevated levels of ELF3-Sha protein (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C,D</a>). Furthermore, compared to LD where ELF3 accumulation decreased during the evening hours, we found elevated protein levels of both ELF3-Bay and ELF3-Sha during subjective night (ZT16 and ZT20). These results were consistent with previous reports that ELF3 accumulation increases in light (<a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>). In DD, similar to LL, <i>ELF3-Sha</i> transcript levels were higher compared to <i>ELF3-Bay</i>. However, we did not detect any significant difference in ELF3-Bay and ELF3-Sha protein levels during subjective day, whereas during subjective night (ZT16 and ZT 20), we found that ELF3-Sha accumulation was considerably lower than ELF3-Bay (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13E,F</a>). Taken together, a higher accumulation of ELF3-Sha under LL and overall lower levels in DD, despite higher transcript abundance, led us to conclude that ELF3-Sha protein dissipates in darkness comparatively more rapidly than ELF3-Bay."

To accomplish this, we retrieved the <i>ELF3</i> coding sequence (CDS) of 251 accessions from the \u20181001 Genome-Project\u2019 (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and performed several population-genetics analyses. The sequence comparison revealed the presence of 59 polymorphic sites segregating at the <i>ELF3</i> locus, including encoded A362V. Out of these 59 polymorphic sites, 16 were synonymous and 43 were nonsynonymous. The A362V was detected in 15 accessions, and in a phylogenetic analysis, all of these grouped together in a single clade, suggesting a common origin (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14A</a>). Therefore, we looked at the geographical distribution of these accessions and found that they all were distributed in Central Asia between 37\u00b0N and 54\u00b0N, with two exceptions at Nemrut and Rubenzhoe collected from Turkey and the Ukraine, respectively (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Interestingly, similar to Sha that naturally grows at high altitudes (e.g., Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan), most of these accessions were also high-altitude accessions collected in the mountains (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). These results suggest that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> originated from Central Asia and that this allele might have been maintained during species migration preferentially by altitude-associated individuals."

Here, we reported the characterization of a natural allele of <i>ELF3 (ELF3-Sha)</i> to a QTN level of understanding. In the quantitative analysis of circadian periodicity of a modified BxS population, we identified a QTL and further validated it in HIFs and a NIL (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Our periodicity results were consistent with previous studies where the <i>ELF3</i> in Sha was found to modulate the shade-avoidance response, including the action of shade on the oscillator (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jimenez-Gomez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Coluccio et al., 2011</a>). In those studies, HIFs were the main genetic resource used. The authors of those papers proposed <i>ELF3</i> to be a candidate locus for the detected shade-avoidance QTL, and transgenic efforts were used to complement that notion (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jimenez-Gomez et al., 2010</a>). Here, we generated the appropriate NIL and showed that the introgression of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> to Bay-0 resulted in severe circadian alterations, including a curtailed period length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

The intermediate expression profile of several clock genes in <i>ELF3-Sha,</i> when compared to wild-type and null mutants, confirmed that it is a hypomorphic allele (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10 and 11</a>). This characteristic of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> is distinctly different from <i>elf3</i> null mutants, which displayed complete arrhythmia under LL (<a href=\"#bib8\">Covington et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hicks et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thines and Harmon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kolmos et al., 2011</a>). However, the functionality of the oscillator in these mutants in darkness remained disputable. Based on the observation that the circadian rhythms persist in the <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, it was proposed that ELF3 solely acts as a light <i>zeitnehmer</i>, or timekeeper, and that it is not a required component of the oscillator. In contrast, a recent study reported that the circadian oscillator was abolished in constant darkness (DD) in temperature-entrained <i>elf3-1</i> seedlings, emphasizing that ELF3 is an integral part of the oscillator as well as acting as a <i>zeitnehmer</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Thines and Harmon, 2010</a>). As these studies were mainly based on null mutants, a conclusive statement about ELF3 function in sustaining the oscillator in DD is hard to draw. Consequently, in this paper, we thus analyzed the profile of several clock genes in the functionally stable <i>ELF3-Sha</i> mutant in DD, comparing it with those in <i>elf3-1</i> and <i>elf3-4</i> null mutants. Consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib62\">Thines and Harmon, 2010</a>), we could not detect any sign of rhythmicity in null <i>elf3</i> mutants. Interestingly, in the hypomorphic <i>ELF3-Sha</i>, a rapid dampening in the expression of several clock markers in DD was observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A, 5D, 6A</a>, and right panels of <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G\u2013L</a>). Thus, our results conclusively demonstrate that ELF3 is required for robust oscillation in darkness and further support the idea that ELF3 is an integral part of the oscillator (<a href=\"#bib62\">Thines and Harmon, 2010</a>). Although <i>ELF3-Sha</i> lost robustness and precision in prolonged darkness, it is important to note that it quickly recovered when transferred back to the light (F<a href=\"#fig6\">igures 6A,B, 7A\u2013C</a>). Consequently, we further propose that the function of <i>ELF3</i> is collectively defined by both the light\u2013dark boundary and by circadian clock regulation."

In contrast, under LL, <i>ELF3-Sha</i> was rhythmic for all genes studied, and it displayed an intermediate level of expression compared to wild type and loss-of-function <i>elf3</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013F</a>, left panels). Specifically, NIL-S displayed higher expression of <i>TOC1</i> and <i>GI</i> compared to Bay-0, but lower expression than <i>elf3-1</i> and <i>elf3-4</i>. In contrast, expression of <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> was lower in NIL-S, compared to Bay-0, but higher than <i>elf3-4</i>. Consistent with the previous finding that CCA1 and LHY regulate <i>PRR7</i> and <i>PRR9</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Farre et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nakamichi et al., 2010</a>), a higher transcript abundance of <i>PRR7</i> and <i>PRR9</i> was observed in NIL-S (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10E,F and 11C,D</a>). These data, along with recent findings showing the evening complex (<i>ELF3</i>, <i>ELF4</i>, and <i>LUX</i>) directly binds to the <i>PRR9</i> promoter to repress transcription, support the repressive action of ELF3 in the core oscillator (<a href=\"#bib25\">Helfer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nusinow et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>). Higher expression levels of the evening genes <i>TOC1</i> and <i>GI</i>, as well as dramatically dampened oscillations of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> in darkness, cannot be simply explained by only considering ELF3 at <i>PRR9</i>. Considering the double loss-of-function mutant <i>cca1-11 lhy-21</i> is rhythmic, an additional repressive role of ELF3 by targeted degradation of GI is conceptually plausible (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ding et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>). Taken together, our data support a hypothesis which holds that the EC-containing ELF3 has more than one entry point in the circadian clock (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kolmos et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Herrero and Davis, 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "ELF3 is both a cytosolic and nuclear localized protein. It appears to be multifunctional in that it has several binding partners. These include phyB, COP1, ELF4, and GI (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nusinow et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>). Different domains of ELF3 specifically interact with these different proteins. Both phyB and COP1 interact with the N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kolmos et al., 2011</a>), whereas ELF4 and GI interact with the middle domain (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>). Further, all these proteins co-localize in the nucleus where they form distinct nuclear bodies (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mas et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>). Such nuclear foci could be suspected as interaction points of binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Herrero and Davis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Thus, formation of fewer ELF3-nuclear foci from encoded <i>ELF3-Sha</i> might be the result of a defect in the binding of one of its interacting proteins. Since the A362V variant is located in the middle domain of ELF3, such a hypothesis could be particularly attributed to either GI and/or ELF4. The rhythmic accumulation of both ELF3 and GI depends upon the activity of COP1 that mediates ubiquitination and targeted degradation of these proteins in dark conditions (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>). It is noteworthy here that ELF3 is essential for this process. In the absence of ELF3, COP1 cannot interact with GI and thus cannot initiate its decay. However, GI is not required for COP1-mediated ELF3 degradation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2008</a>). When these data are taken together, the formation of a COP1-ELF3-GI complex could be considered a plausible active mechanism controlling the rhythmic accumulation of these proteins. Under these conditions, A362V mutation in <i>ELF3-Sha</i> would result in attenuated binding affinity with GI, disturbing the balance of the COP1-ELF3-GI complex and, in turn, resulting in the rapid decay of ELF3. Both the lower accumulation of ELF3-Sha protein, despite the generation of higher transcript (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13E,F</a>), and aberrant oscillator behavior of ELF3-Sha in prolonged darkness support this hypothesis. The short-period phenotype of <i>ELF3-Sha</i> under LL could also be explained by an early decay of ELF3-Sha during light/dark entrainment. As ELF3 directly represses <i>PRR9</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dixon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>), the early depletion of ELF3-Sha results in an early expression of <i>PRR9</i>, an event that sets the pace of the oscillator during the preceding entrainment, which is maintained through LL. Based on these results and our observation that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> is defective in proper clock resetting (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), we propose that ELF3 plays a pivotal role in defining entrainment properties of the circadian clock, which, in turn, depend on cyclic accumulation of ELF3 protein, but not on its absolute levels or, indirectly, its transcript abundance. This idea could be further supported by the observation that ELF3 protein rhythmically oscillates and drives a long period in plants that constitutively overexpress <i>ELF3</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Covington et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dixon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2012</a>). Discounting the important role that ELF3 plays in clock entrainment, it can be provisionally excluded that ELF3 is involved in parametric entrainment because we could not detect any differential effect of fluence rate on <i>ELF3-Sha</i> periodicity compared to <i>ELF3-Bay</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>). Fluence rate curves based on <i>ELF3-ox</i> also support this notion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Covington et al., 2001</a>)."

Notably, in the context of the Ws-2 and Bay-0 genomes, we could show that <i>ELF3-Sha</i> is a hypomorphic allele defective in proper localization of encoded ELF3 protein. This defect resulted in two distinct phenotypes: one displaying a light-dependent short period and the other exhibiting loss of rhythm robustness in darkness. These phenotypes were clearly observable in both the Bay-0 and Ws-2 genetic background. It is notable that Sha parental line did not itself display such obvious circadian defects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B and 3A</a>). Related to this, the transcript profile of clock genes in Sha followed the same pattern as observed in Bay-0, and such pattern was distinct from that seen in NIL-S (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Moreover, <i>ELF3-Sha</i> did not affect hypocotyl length in NIL-S and Sha in the same way. Under all light qualities tested, the hypocotyl length of NIL-S was similar to that of Bay-0, but was significantly longer when compared to Sha (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), leading to the possibility that other segregating QTLs within Sha wild type genetically interact with <i>ELF3-Sha</i>.

In these three BC2 populations from the separate RIL crosses, the plants were self-crossed, and in the derived BC2F2 populations, lines that were homozygous for Bay or for the Sha alleles, at four marker positions, were identified. Multiple F2 versions of each of these derived lines were isolated. F3 seeds that harbored <i>CCR2::LUC</i> were collected from these plants for periodicity tests, as described below. The selected F3 HIFs containing Sha at QTL interval were further backcrossed three times to Bay-0 to generate NIL-S. The introgression of Sha at QTL interval and the homogeneous Bay-0 background were confirmed with genome-wide SSLP markers.

Using the natural hypomorphic allele, you now show that ELF3 is indeed a core clock gene that is required for both proper circadian rhythms in the light, and also for sustained rhythms in darkness. Furthermore, you show that ELF3 is required for appropriate entrainment to light/dark cycles, indicating a dual role for this protein in the core clock mechanism as well as in the input pathway that connects light signals to the circadian clock. Finally, you provide evidence that this allele affects the subcellular localization of the protein, interfering with the formation of nuclear speckles and resulting in increased cytoplasmic accumulation of this protein, presumably through alterations in the ability of this ELF3 variant to interact with other clock components that localize to the nucleus such as GI."
