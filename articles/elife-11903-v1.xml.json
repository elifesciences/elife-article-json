Modulation of the PTEN/mTORC1 pathway in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Here, we report that AKT activation, downstream of <i>Pten</i> deletion, promotes axon regeneration and RGC survival. We further demonstrate that GSK3\u03b2 plays an indispensable role in mediating AKT-induced axon regeneration. Deletion or inactivation of GSK3\u03b2 promotes axon regeneration independently of the mTORC1 pathway, whereas constitutive activation of GSK3\u03b2 reduces AKT-induced axon regeneration. Importantly, we have identified eIF2B\u03b5 as a novel downstream effector of GSK3\u03b2 in regulating axon regeneration. Inactivation of eIF2B\u03b5 reduces both GSK3\u03b2 and AKT-mediated effects on axon regeneration. Constitutive activation of eIF2B\u03b5 is sufficient to promote axon regeneration. Our results reveal a key role of the AKT-GSK3\u03b2-eIF2B\u03b5 signaling module in regulating axon regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS."

Reactivation of the intrinsic regenerative capability promotes CNS axon regeneration after injury (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fischer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gaub et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Moore et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">O'Donovan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Watkins et al., 2013</a>). Significantly, deletion of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes axon regeneration after optic nerve injury (<a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2008</a>). Loss of PTEN leads to the\u00a0accumulation of PIP<sub>3</sub> (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate), resulting in the\u00a0activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT via PDK1-mediated phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carnero et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luo et al., 2003</a>). AKT is a critical node in cell signaling downstream of growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular stimuli and regulates a wide spectrum of cellular functions, which include cell survival, growth, proliferation, metabolism, and migration (<a href=\"#bib31\">Manning and Cantley, 2007</a>).

AKT inactivates the kinase activity of GSK3 through phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b1 at Ser21 or GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cross et al., 1995</a>). Studies in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) have generated different results regarding the role of GSK3 in regulating PNS axon regeneration. Using <i>Gsk3a</i>-S21A/<i>Gsk3b</i>-S9A double knock-in mice, in which GSK3\u03b1/GSK3\u03b2 cannot be inactivated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation, one group did not observe obviously phenotype in sensory axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), whereas the other group reported that sustained GSK3 activity markedly facilitated sciatic nerve regeneration (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gobrecht et al., 2014</a>). In the CNS, pharmacological inactivation of GSK3 by the\u00a0administration of lithium, a GSK3 inhibitor, stimulates axon formation and elongation in the presence or absence of inhibitory substrates after spinal cord injury (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dill et al., 2008</a>). However, the mechanism of lithium action is not completely clear as many other potential targets including a number of vital enzymes are also inhibited by lithium in an uncompetitive manner (<a href=\"#bib38\">Phiel and Klein, 2001</a>). Thus, genetic evidence is needed to examine the role of GSK3 in CNS axon regeneration."

                                "text": "AKT activation, indicated by phosphorylation at Ser473 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bozulic and Hemmings, 2009</a>), was readily detectable in RGCs labeled by anti-Tuj1 immunoreactivity in the developing retina and was significantly reduced in adult mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. To examine whether the\u00a0deletion of <i>Pten</i> leads to AKT activation, we injected AAV-Cre into the vitreous body of adult <i>Pten<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice, resulting in Cre-mediated <i>Pten</i> deletion in RGCs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>), (<a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2008</a>). Two weeks after viral injection, we detected increased phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 in RGCs either with or without ONC, in comparison with <i>Pten<sup>f/f</sup></i>mice injected with AAV-GFP as a control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). To investigate whether AKT activation is sufficient to promote axon regeneration, we injected AAV-caAKT (a constitutively active form of AKT [<a href=\"#bib22\">Kohn et al., 1996</a>]), or AAV-GFP as a control, into the vitreous body of adult wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F</a>) and performed ONC two weeks after viral injection. Axon regeneration was examined two weeks after ONC using immunohistochemistry for GAP-43 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Koprivica et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Leon et al., 2000</a>). While very few axon fibers extended beyond the crush site in the AAV-GFP injected control, robust axon regeneration was stimulated in the AAV-caAKT injected retina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Upon AKT activation, many regenerating axon fibers were observed at the proximal region of the crush site. The number of regenerating axons gradually declined over a longer distance from the lesion site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To assess the effect of AKT activation on RGC survival, we quantified the number of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells using immunohistochemistry on retinal flatmount preparations two weeks after ONC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In comparison to 25.7% of\u00a0RGCs remaining in the AAV-GFP injected control, significantly more RGCs (48.4%) were scored in the AAV-caAKT injected retina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Our results indicate that <i>Pten</i> deletion activates AKT, and AKT activation promotes both axon regeneration and RGC survival after optic nerve injury."

To examine whether blockade of mTORC1 signaling also affects AKT-induced axon regeneration, we administered rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 in the AAV-caAKT-injected retinas. In comparison with the vehicle treatment as a control, rapamycin treatment partially reduced the number of regenerating axon fibers (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). The residual regenerative effect could be due to incomplete blockage of mTORC1 signaling by the drug treatment, or additional mTORC1-independent pathway(s) may exist to regulate axon regeneration downstream of AKT. We also assessed RGC survival after rapamycin treatment. AKT-induced RGC survival was largely neutralized by rapamycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013D</a>)."

Phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9 results in inactivation of its kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cross et al., 1995</a>). Phospho-GSK3\u03b2 level was higher in the developing retina relative to the adult age (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Two weeks after AAV-caAKT injection in adult wild-type mice, we detected increased phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9 in RGCs either with or without ONC, in comparison with the AAV-GFP injected retina as a control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>). We also examined whether <i>Pten</i> deletion also led to GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation at Ser9 in RGCs. As expected, increased phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 was observed in <i>Pten</i>-deficient RGCs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Our results indicate that GSK3\u03b2 is a downstream target of PTEN/AKT signaling in RGCs. To investigate whether GSK3\u03b2 inactivation mediates AKT-induced axon regeneration and RGC survival, we co-injected AAV-caAKT with AAV-GSK3\u03b2 S9A, a Ser-to-Ala mutant of GSK3\u03b2 that cannot be phosphorylated by AKT and therefore is constitutively active (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eldar-Finkelman et al., 1996</a>). In comparison with the AAV-caAKT and AAV-GFP co-injection, regenerative axon growth was significantly reduced by AAV-GSK3\u03b2 S9A co-injection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>). However, AKT-induced RGC survival was not affected by the expression of GSK3\u03b2 S9A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>). Our results indicate that AKT phosphorylates and thus inactivates GSK3\u03b2, leading to improved axon regeneration, but not RGC survival."

While no obvious regenerating axon fibers were observed in the AAV-GFP injected control, <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion resulted in improved axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We next examined the time course of axon regeneration in <i>Gsk3b</i>-deficient RGCs after injury (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). At 1 day after ONC, optic nerve fibers terminated at the crush\u00a0site in <i>Gsk3b<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice injected with either AAV-GFP or AAV-Cre. At 3 days after ONC, we observed axon sprouting in the <i>Gsk3b</i>-deleted RGCs. At 7 days after ONC, regenerating axon fibers extended beyond the lesion site in <i>Gsk3b</i>-deficient RGCs, overcoming the inhibitory environment at the lesion site labeled by immunohistochemistry for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). However, deletion of <i>Gsk3a</i> did not stimulate the regenerative response of injured axons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), although AKT activation also increased its phosphorylation at Ser21 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To further examine whether elimination of the kinase activity of GSK3\u03b2 is responsible for <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion-induced axon regeneration, we injected AAV-GSK3\u03b2 K85A, a kinase dead mutant of GSK3\u03b2 that inhibits endogenous GSK3\u03b2 in a dominant negative manner (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dominguez et al., 1995</a>), into the vitreous body of adult wild-type mice. Two weeks after ONC, we observed many regenerating axon fibers extending beyond the lesion site in the AAV-GSK3\u03b2 K85A injected mice, a regenerative response slightly weaker in comparison with <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). We also analyzed neuronal survival two weeks after ONC in the retinas of <i>Gsk3a</i> deletion, <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion, and AAV-GSK3\u03b2 K85A injection. None of these manipulations changed the rate of RGC survival (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>). Our results indicate that the\u00a0deletion of <i>Gsk3b</i>, but not <i>Gsk3a</i>, promotes RGC axon regeneration likely through inactivation of the kinase activity of GSK3\u03b2."

And our results demonstrate that GSK3\u03b2 may represent another important signaling pathway downstream of PTEN/AKT to regulate CNS axon regrowth. To distinguish whether <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion-induced axon regeneration is through activation of the mTORC1 pathway or through an mTORC1-independent mechanism, we first examined whether mTORC1 signaling is altered by <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion using immunohistochemistry for phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6) to monitor the activity of mTORC1 in RGCs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2008</a>). While AKT activation significantly increased the mTORC1 activity, evidenced by a higher fluorescence intensity of p-S6 immunoreactivity in RGCs in adult wild-type mice injected with AAV-caAKT compared to the control injection, <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion did not perturb the activity of mTORC1 as the immunofluorescence intensity of p-S6 remained at the same low level as the control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). To further assess whether the mTORC1 pathway contributes to the regenerative effects induced by <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion, we administered rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 activity in <i>Gsk3b</i>-deleted RGCs. While rapamycin markedly reduced AKT-induced axon regeneration and RGC survival (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), <i>Gsk3b</i> deficiency-induced axon regeneration was not affected by rapamycin treatment, and neither was RGC survival in <i>Gsk3b</i>-deleted RGCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin significantly reduced <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion induced axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our results indicate that GSK3\u03b2-mediated effects on axon regeneration require protein synthesis but are achieved through an mTORC1-independent mechanism."

                                "text": "GSK3\u03b2 regulates many cellular processes through\u00a0phosphorylation of its diverse substrates that include transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, motor proteins, and proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Saijilafu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sutherland, 2011</a>). eIF2B (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B) is a heteropentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor that converts eIF2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2) from the inactive GDP\u2013bound form to the active GTP-bound complex, representing a rate-limiting step in protein translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pavitt, 2005</a>). eIF2B\u03b5 (eIF2B epsilon subunit), the largest catalytic subunit of eIF2B, is inhibited by GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation at the Ser535 site, linking regulation of global protein synthesis to GSK3\u03b2 signaling (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pap and Cooper, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2001</a>). Due to the importance of protein synthesis in the regenerative growth of axons, we examined the role of eIF2B\u03b5 in optic never regeneration. Phosphorylation of eIF2B\u03b5 at Ser535 in RGCs was significantly higher in adult mice in comparison with that in the developing retina (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that elF2B\u03b5-controlled protein translation is maintained at a low basal level in adult RGCs. Optic nerve injury alone did not activate eIF2B\u03b5 as the\u00a0phosphorylation of eIF2B\u03b5 was detected at similar levels to uninjured retinas after ONC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By contrast, phospho-eIF2B\u03b5 (Ser535) immunoreactivity was markedly reduced in <i>Gsk3b</i>-deleted RGCs in the presence or absence of axon injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>), indicating increased eIF2B\u03b5 activity for protein translation. <i>Gsk3a</i> deletion did not change eIF2B\u03b5 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that GSK3\u03b1 may not regulate eIF2B\u03b5 activity in RGCs. To determine the role of eIF2B\u03b5 in GSK3\u03b2-mediated axon regeneration, we inhibited the activity of eIF2B\u03b5 in <i>Gsk3b</i>-deleted RGCs by co-injection of AAV-eIF2B\u03b5 E572A, a dominant negative mutant of eIF2B\u03b5 that lacks catalytic activity but is capable of forming heteropentameric eIF2B complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Boesen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang and Proud, 2008</a>). Two weeks after ONC, the number of regenerating axons was significantly reduced by AAV-eIF2B\u03b5 E572A co-injection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>). To examine whether protein synthesis is involved in eIF2B\u03b5-regulated axon regeneration, we used Alexa Fluor-conjugated OPP incorporation assay to label newly translated proteins. While the basal level of protein translation in RGCs was suppressed by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion resulted in a significant increase in OPP-labeled new synthesized proteins, which was largely negated by eIF2B\u03b5 E572A treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). These results clearly demonstrate that protein synthesis is tightly controlled by GSK3\u03b2/eIF2B\u03b5 signaling during axon regeneration. However, inhibition of eIF2B\u03b5 had no effect on the survival of <i>Gsk3b</i>-deleted RGCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>)."

Both the inhibitory extrinsic environment and the diminished intrinsic regenerative capability in the adult CNS contribute to the poor regeneration of axons after injury. Removal of the inhibitory influences in the extracellular environment is insufficient to stimulate a major regenerative response. On the other hand, activation of intrinsic signaling pathways within CNS neurons has yielded encouraging results in promoting axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib7\">de Lima et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kurimoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Deletion of <i>Pten</i>, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, stimulated robust axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2008</a>). We found that AKT was phosphorylated at Ser473 and thus activated in the <i>Pten</i>-deleted RGCs. Significantly, expression of a constitutively active myristoylated AKT promoted both axon regeneration and RGC survival. AKT regulates a number of diverging downstream signaling pathways through phosphorylation of diverse cellular targets (<a href=\"#bib31\">Manning and Cantley, 2007</a>). Previous studies have established that the mTORC1 pathway is an important downstream signaling in mediating <i>Pten</i> deletion-induced axon regeneration, as reactivation of this pathway by TSC1 deletion or S6K1 activation effectively promotes axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). However, mechanisms other than the mTORC1 pathway downstream of <i>Pten</i> deletion have not been elucidated."

In the adult PNS, GSK3 signaling regulates mammalian sensory axon regeneration by inducing the expression of Smad1 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Saijilafu et al., 2013</a>). In the spinal cord injury model, neuronal deletion of <i>Gsk3b</i> enhances dorsal column axon regeneration via CRMP2-regulated microtubule dynamics, specifically in the growth cone (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liz et al., 2014</a>). Here, using the optic nerve injury model, we have demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 plays a pivotal role in regulating CNS axon regeneration. <i>Pten</i> deletion or AKT activation led to phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at the site of Ser9, resulting in inactivation of its kinase activity in RGCs. Expression of GSK3\u03b2 S9A, a kinase active mutant of GSK3\u03b2, significantly reduced axon regeneration induced by AKT activation. Deletion of <i>Gsk3b</i> or inactivation of GSK3\u03b2 with the expression of GSK3\u03b2 K85A, a kinase dead mutant of GSK3\u03b2, was sufficient to promote axon regeneration. However, GSK3\u03b1 did not have these same effects. These results are in line with studies showing GSK3 isoform-specific effects in developmental axon growth (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Indeed GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 have been shown to act on different substrates in the brain (<a href=\"#bib41\">Soutar et al., 2010</a>). We did not assess the results of complete elimination of GSK3 activity, which has been associated with the\u00a0suppression of axon growth in developmental studies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, unlike AKT activation that promoted both axon regeneration and RGC survival, GSK3 inactivation did not promote RGC survival, suggesting that mTORC1 and/or other unidentified factors downstream of AKT are involved in promoting the survival of RGCs."

The activity of eIF2B\u03b5 is inhibited by GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation. In response to insulin, GSK3\u03b2 kinase activity is inhibited, eIF2B\u03b5 is dephosphorylated and thus more active, leading to an enhancement of protein translation. In the CNS, eIF2B\u03b5-controlled protein translation is required for the development and maintenance of brain white matter, which is composed of bundles of myelinated axons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fogli and Boespflug-Tanguy, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Geva et al., 2010</a>). We found that eIF2B\u03b5 is a key downstream target of GSK3\u03b2 to regulate axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Inhibition of eIF2B\u03b5 with the dominant negative mutant eIF2B\u03b5 E572A significantly reduced axon regeneration induced by <i>Gsk3b</i> deletion or AKT activation. More importantly, activation of eIF2B\u03b5 with the constitutively active mutant eIF2B\u03b5 S535A was sufficiently effective to promote axon regeneration, emphasizing the importance of protein synthesis as a major neuronal intrinsic mechanism in CNS axon regeneration."

Each of these steps in translation initiation is facilitated by proteins referred to as eukaryotic initiation factors eIFs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Klann and Dever, 2004</a>). The tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> binding to the 40\u00a0s ribosomal subunit requires the exchange of GTP-bound for GDP-bound eIF2, which is catalyzed by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Therefore, GSK3\u03b2-mediated eIF2B\u03b5 activation enhances the recycling of eIF2 for further rounds of translational initiation, constituting a critical regulatory mechanism to control the intrinsic regenerative ability of RGCs after nerve injury. The 5\u2019 cap-binding protein eIF4E is required for the binding of the 43\u00a0s pre-initiation complex to most eukaryotic mRNAs. mTORC1 activation enhances protein synthesis through phosphorylation of 4E-BP (translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein), a negative regulator of eIF4E. However, 4E-BP inhibition is not sufficient to promote axon regeneration as co-deletion of 4E-BP1/2 in RGCs does not stimulate optic nerve regeneration. Interestingly, activation of S6K1, another downstream factor of mTORC1, promotes RGC axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). S6K1 activation promotes the translation of 5\u2019 TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine tract) mRNAs, which encode exclusively components of the translation machinery including ribosomal proteins, elongation factors, and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</a>). It appears that mTORC1 and GSK3\u03b2 signaling, although acting independently to regulate protein translation downstream of AKT, converge on a common translation regulatory mechanism for axon regeneration."

The cross-sectional width of the nerve was measured at the point at which the counts were taken and was used to calculate the number of axons per millimeter of the width of the nerve. The number of axons per millimeter was then averaged over all sections. \u03a3a<sub>d</sub>, the total number of axons extending distance <i>d</i> in a nerve having a radius of <i>r</i>, was estimated by summing over all sections having a thickness <i>t</i>: Sa<sub>d</sub>= \u03c0<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> x [average axons/mm]/<i>t</i>."

They demonstrate that upon PTEN genetic ablation (which has been demonstrated to result in CNS axonal outgrowth), there is activation of AKT, downstream phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3\u03b2, and consequently, activation (disinhibition) of eIF2B\u03b5. The activation of this pathway results in significant axon regeneration, accompanied by increased protein synthesis. The identification of the GSK3\u03b2-eIF2B\u03b5 pathway as relevant for axonal regeneration expands the scope of potential targets to improve axonal regeneration following CNS nerve injury. The study has effectively integrated use of viral vectors to express constitutively active and dominant negative forms of several pathway components, together with Cre-mediated knockout, and systematically show that regeneration is induced in a GSK3\u03b2 independent of mTORC1 signaling. The data are convincing and the manuscript is presented in a logical and straightforward manner. The experiments were carefully designed and executed, and the results are technically sound."

Nonetheless, when GSK3\u03b2 is inactivated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), the regenerative effect appears smaller than that resulting from AKT constitutive activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) (although a direct comparison of these effects is missing). It therefore appears important to acknowledge that both branches, although independent, result in the stimulation of mRNA translation initiation, thus converging on a common mechanism for axonal regeneration.

For instance, did AKT activation also inactivate GSK3\u03b1 in RGCs (Will caAKT lead to increased level of GSK3\u03b1-S21 phosphorylation)? How did GSK3\u03b1 knockout affect the phosphorylation of eIF2B\u03b5 (Is eIF2B\u03b5 phosphorylation reduced in GSK3\u03b1 knockout mice)? Answers to these questions would greatly improve the study.

Nonetheless, when GSK3\u03b2 is inactivated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), the regenerative effect appears smaller than that resulting from AKT constitutive activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) (although a direct comparison of these effects is missing). It therefore appears important to acknowledge that both branches, although independent, result in the stimulation of mRNA translation initiation, thus converging on a common mechanism for axonal regeneration. One experiment that is lacking is the demonstration that protein synthesis inhibitors block the regenerative effect of the GSK3\u03b2-eIF2B\u03b5 signaling axis.</i>"

To demonstrate that protein synthesis is a common regulatory mechanism for axon regeneration, we have performed the experiments suggested by the reviewers to inhibit protein synthesis using anisomycin and assess GSK3\u03b2-deletion induced axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A-B</a>) and elF2B\u03b5 activation induced axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A-B</a>), and found that anisomycin treatment significantly reduced the regenerative effect of the GSK3\u03b2-eIF2B\u03b5 signaling axis.

For instance, did AKT activation also inactivate GSK3\u03b1 in RGCs (Will caAKT lead to increased level of GSK3\u03b1-S21 phosphorylation)? How did GSK3\u03b1 knockout affect the phosphorylation of eIF2B\u03b5 (Is eIF2B\u03b5 phosphorylation reduced in GSK3\u03b1 knockout mice)? Answers to these questions would greatly improve the study.

To address these questions, we analyzed the activity of GSK3\u03b1 by performing phospho-GSK3\u03b1-Ser21 immunohistochemistry following AAV-caAKT injection, using AAV-GFP injection as a control, and found that AKT activation inactivated GSK3\u03b1, either with or without optic nerve injury (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We have also analyzed the phosphorylation of eIF2B\u03b5 in the GSK3\u03b1 knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, the phospho-eIF2B\u03b5 level was not affected by GSK3\u03b1 deletion. Our results indicate that both GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 are phosphorylated and thus inactivated by AKT, but only GSK3\u03b2 regulates the activity of eIF2B\u03b5. This may explain why no axon regeneration was observed after optic nerve injury in GSK3\u03b1 knockout mice."
