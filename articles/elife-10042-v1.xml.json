Despite recent advances characterising one of these populations, the neuromesodermal progenitors, their nature and relationship to other populations remains unclear. Here we show that neuromesodermal progenitors are a single Sox2<sup>low</sup>T<sup>low</sup> entity whose choice of neural or mesodermal fate is dictated by their position in the progenitor region. The choice of mesoderm fate is Wnt/\u03b2-catenin dependent. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling is also required for a previously unrecognised phase of progenitor expansion during mid-trunk formation. Lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors represent a distinct committed state that is unable to differentiate to neural fates, even upon overexpression of the neural transcription factor Sox2. They do not require Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling for mesoderm differentiation. This information aids the correct interpretation of <i>in vivo</i> genetic studies and the development of <i>in vitro</i> protocols for generating physiologically-relevant cell populations of clinical interest."
