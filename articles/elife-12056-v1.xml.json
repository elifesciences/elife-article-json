                    "text": "Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to nicotine, the principal addictive component driving tobacco smoking. In a companion study, we found that reduced activity of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 underlies the hypersensitivity of adolescent mice to the effects of cocaine. Here we report that nicotine potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons more readily in adolescent mice compared to adults. Adult mice with genetic or pharmacological reduction in p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine\u2019s synaptic effects, like adolescents. When we investigated the influence of allelic variability of the <i>Eif2s1</i> gene (encoding eIF2\u03b1) on reward-related neuronal responses in human smokers, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the <i>Eif2s1</i> gene modulates mesolimbic neuronal reward responses in human smokers. These findings suggest that p-eIF2\u03b1 regulates synaptic actions of nicotine in both mice and humans, and that reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 may enhance susceptibility to nicotine (and other drugs of abuse) during adolescence."

In a companion study, we found that reduced activity of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 underlies the hypersensitivity of adolescent mice to the effects of cocaine. Here we report that nicotine potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons more readily in adolescent mice compared to adults. Adult mice with genetic or pharmacological reduction in p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine\u2019s synaptic effects, like adolescents. When we investigated the influence of allelic variability of the <i>Eif2s1</i> gene (encoding eIF2\u03b1) on reward-related neuronal responses in human smokers, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the <i>Eif2s1</i> gene modulates mesolimbic neuronal reward responses in human smokers. These findings suggest that p-eIF2\u03b1 regulates synaptic actions of nicotine in both mice and humans, and that reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 may enhance susceptibility to nicotine (and other drugs of abuse) during adolescence."

People who start using nicotine during adolescence are more likely to become addicted to it during adulthood, but the reasons for this are not well understood. Nicotine causes long-lasting changes in the brain that are responsible for the feelings of pleasure and reward. In particular, nicotine strengthens the connections between neurons at structures called synapses and increases communication between reward-related neurons in key reward areas of the brain. This hijacking of the natural reward system requires new proteins to be made. However, the relationship between protein synthesis and adolescents being particularly vulnerable to nicotine addiction was not known."

In the United States, the direct and indirect financial costs of smoking are estimated at more than $300 billion each year (<a href=\"#bib26\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Xu et al., 2015</a>).

Human neuroimaging studies of smokers have shown that exposure to nicotine alters reward-related activity in dopaminergic reward regions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Rose et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, in rodents, while nicotine is known to potentiate excitatory synaptic connections to DA neurons in the reward-related ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Mansvelder and McGehee, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Saal et al., 2003</a>), the precise molecular mechanism underlying nicotine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) remains unclear. In a companion article (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huang et al., 2016</a>), we found that the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 regulates adolescent vulnerability to the synaptic and behavioral effects of cocaine. Briefly, adolescent (5 weeks old) mice proved to be more sensitive to a lower dose of cocaine than adult (3\u20135 months old) mice with regard to reduced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, the induction of LTP, and cocaine-induced behavior [conditioned place preference (CPP), a common behavioral task that reflects behavioral reinforcement underlying the development of drug addiction] (<a href=\"#bib13\">Koo et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with these findings, genetic and pharmacological reduction in p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control increased the susceptibility of adult mice to the synaptic and behavioral effects of cocaine, making adult mice resemble adolescents in this respect. Furthermore, other drugs of abuse (including nicotine), that are known to induce LTP in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib21\">Saal et al., 2003</a>), also reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huang et al., 2016</a>), thus highlighting the role of p-eIF2\u03b1 as a common effector implicated in the initiation of addictive behavior. In the present study, we found that, like cocaine, mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine-evoked synaptic potentiation in the VTA. Furthermore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, we identified a functional genetic variation in the promoter of the <i>Eif2s1</i> gene encoding eIF2\u03b1 that alters brain responses to rewarding stimuli in human tobacco smokers."

We therefore asked whether this was also true for nicotine. To answer this question, we measured glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in VTA DA neurons from adolescent (5 weeks old) and adult (3\u20135 months old) mice 24\u2009hr after single intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of either saline or different doses of nicotine. The peak amplitudes of the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and <i>N</i>-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated components of the evoked EPSCs (recorded at +40 mV) were isolated and used to calculate the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio as described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huang et al., 2016</a>). An increase in this ratio was taken as an index of LTP. We found that a relatively low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg i.p.) was sufficient to induce LTP in VTA DA neurons from adolescent mice, but not in adult mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a, b</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, a higher dose of nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) was required to elicit comparable LTP in VTA DA neurons from adult mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, like cocaine, nicotine induces LTP in VTA DA neurons at a significantly lower dose in adolescent mice."

Indeed, a low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) induced LTP only in adult mice in which p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation was blocked pharmacologically with ISRIB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a>). Hence, like adolescent mice, adult mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control are more susceptible to nicotine-induced LTP. Thus, our findings that reducing p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control renders animals more susceptible to the effects of both cocaine (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huang et al., 2016</a>) and nicotine underscores a key role of p-eIF2\u03b1 as a common regulator of drug-induced synaptic potentiation and behavior."

Because p-eIF2\u03b1 crucially regulates drug-induced changes in synaptic strength and behavior in mice, we sought to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway could be associated with reward-induced changes in neuronal activity in human smokers. Indeed, by studying specific SNPs chosen on the basis of this hypothesis, we bypassed the problems inherent to large exploratory data analyses and multiple comparisons typical of genome-wide association studies.

To examine the functional effect of the A/G polymorphism (rs10144417) at this site, we measured firefly luciferase reporter activity ex-vivo using a 5 kilobase (kb) segment of the <i>Eif2s1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). Briefly, human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were co-transfected with a firefly luciferase reporter (Fluc) containing either the A or G variant and a renilla luciferase reporter (Rluc), which was used as a transfection control. We found that, compared to the A variant, the normalized G variant Fluc/Rluc ratio was significantly increased (~40%, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>), reflecting increased expression of <i>Eif2s1</i>. To determine whether overexpression of <i>Eif2s1</i> could affect p-eIF2\u03b1\u2013mediated translational control, we co-expressed in HEK293T cells <i>Eif2s1</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Donz\u00e9 et al., 1995</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a>), a 5\u2019UTR-<i>Ophn1</i> firefly luciferase reporter (5\u2019UTR-<i>Ophn1</i>-Fluc; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i</a>), whose translation is known to be enhanced by conditions that increase p-eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>), and a renilla Luciferase reporter (Rluc), which was used to calculate the relative Fluc/Rluc translation ratio. Strikingly, increased expression of <i>Eif2s1</i> significantly reduced the normalized Fluc/Rluc ratio, indicating a significant reduction in translation of <i>Ophn1</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2j</a>). Additionally, expression of <i>Eif2s1</i> selectively reduced 5\u2019UTR-<i>Ophn1</i>-Fluc activity, but had no effect on Rluc activity (data not shown). These data were further supported by our findings that overexpression of <i>Eif2s1</i> also reduced translation of a 5\u2019UTR-<i>Atf4</i> firefly luciferase reporter (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which is typically up-regulated by increased p-eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sidrauski et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lu et al., 2004</a>). Hence, overexpression of the alpha subunit of eIF2 (<i>Eif2s1</i>) reduces p-eIF2\u03b1\u2013mediated translation."

Several different mechanisms could be at play. Overexpression of <i>Eif2s1</i> could affect eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation by altering: a) the assembly of eIF2 complex [eIF2 is a heterotrimer consisting of an alpha (encoded by <i>Eif2s1)</i>, a beta (encoded by <i>Eif2s2</i>), and a gamma subunit (encoded by <i>Eif2s3</i>), b) the binding of eIF2 to key regulatory proteins (e.g., eIF2B and/or eIF5), or c) by titrating the phosphorylated alpha subunit away from the eIF2 complex. Moreover, overexpression of <i>Eif2s1</i> could alter the expression of a given eIF2\u03b1 kinase or phosphatase. Such compensatory translational homeostatic mechanisms have been observed when the levels of key translation initiation factors (e.g., eIF4E, 4E-BPs, PABP, Paips) are either increased or decreased (<a href=\"#bib12\">Khaleghpour et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Yanagiya et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Yoshida et al., 2006</a>)."

For instance, mice with reduced eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine-induced changes in synaptic function. Similarly, smokers carrying the G variant, who also have reduced eIF2\u03b1-mediated translation, show reduced reward-induced activity in the caudate and putamen, suggesting that such individuals are likely to consume more drugs to obtain reward activity comparable to that of non-smokers. Finally, these insights may hold promise for new p-eIF2\u03b1-based approaches to treating drug abuse."

Structural MPRAGE images were collected as 160 1\u00d71\u00d71 mm axial slices (TE=2.66 ms, TR=1200 ms, flip angle=12\u00b0, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix) while functional images were collected as 2x2x2 mm epi scans (TR 2\u2009s, TE 40 ms) over a 44 mm \u201cslab\u201d covering the regions of interest. Light-juice pairings were presented during functional scanning using ePrime software (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA). For each of a maximum of 55 light-juice pairings, a Standard Infuse/Withdraw Harvard 33 Twin Syringe Pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) delivered 1 mL of juice 7s after a light cue. Prior to scanning, participants were given a choice of sugar-free sweet drinks (such as lemonade, iced tea with peach or fruit punch, and the preferred juice was given during scanning). fMRI data were analyzed using a standard AFNI processing stream (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cox, 1996</a>). Briefly, the first four TRs were removed to establish a stable baseline. Data were then corrected for slice-time acquisition (3dTshift), aligned to the first image and measured for motion (3dvolreg), registered to the high resolution MPRAGE, and transformed to MNI space using a single spatial transform (@auto_tlrc, 3dAllineate). A 4.5 mm smoothing kernel was applied in 3dmerge and submitted to a General Linear Model (GLM) regression in 3dDeconvolve. GLM regressors for linear, quadratic, and cubic linear trends; x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw motion parameters; and the two stimulus conditions: visual cue and juice reward were included. An analysis of the interaction between smoker/non-smoker group and genotype (e.g. rs10144417 AA vs. GG/AG) was performed using a 3D multivariate model (3dMVM) and family-wise error correction. The percent signal change in BOLD activation for individual subjects was extracted from caudate and putamen regions of interest (ROIs) and restricted to those voxels identified as having a <i>P</i>&lt;0.05 and alpha&lt;0.05 in the multivariate model of group by genotype interaction. No effect of age, number of years smoking, average number of cigarettes per day, gender, or ethnicity was observed in the fMRI analysis."

Thus, in the Discussion section of our accompanying paper (p. 12), we speculate that nicotine (and other drugs of abuse) either inhibit the activity of a given eIF2\u03b1 kinase or promote the activity of eIF2\u03b1 phosphatases, processes to which we suspect adolescents are more prone.
