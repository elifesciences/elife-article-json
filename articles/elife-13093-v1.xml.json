But simply surviving is not enough; organisms must also reproduce, otherwise there would be no evolution. In the animal kingdom, for example, colourful feathers, sophisticated songs and elaborate courtship rituals are all employed to increase the chances of a successful copulation. Naturalists have marvelled at these mating rituals for hundreds of years and filled countless notebooks with descriptions and drawings of them. However, a more detailed understanding of mating behaviour has had to wait for arrival of new techniques in genetics and neuroscience, and the rise to fame of the vinegar fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, as a model organism."

Finally he licks the female\u2019s genitalia and attempts to copulate with her. Now, in eLife, Benjamin Kallman, Heesoo Kim and Kristin Scott of the University of California at Berkeley identify further pathways that guide mating decisions in male flies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Kallman et al., 2015</a>)."

However, little is known about how these neurons are connected to achieve this behaviour. Previous studies have shown that chemicals present on the cuticle can affect courtship behaviour in flies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</a>). The cuticular pheromones produced by a female fly promote mating and allow the courting male to identify her as a female of the same species; the pheromones produced by males have the opposite effect and inhibit courtship. Flies detect these compounds via a pair of sensory neurons housed in their leg bristles. The neurons that respond to male pheromones are called M cells, and those that respond to female pheromones are called F cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Pikielny, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>)."

Neurobiologists have become increasingly interested in P1 neurons over the last decade, and have shown that activating them correlates with the start of courtship behaviour (<a href=\"#bib1\">Clowney et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Kohatsu et al., 2011</a>).

F cell activation was seen to excite the P1 cluster and resulted in enhanced courtship, whereas M cell activation did not excite the P1 cluster and may even have suppressed it. However, given that F cells terminate in the fly\u2019s thorax, Kallman et al. found that another class of neurons, called PPN1, serves as the link between F cells and the P1 cluster in the higher brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

They found that the M cells activated a cluster of neurons called mAL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>); this cluster had previously been shown to send out inhibitory signals (<a href=\"#bib3\">Kimura et al., 2005</a>). Inactivating the mAL neurons led to males courting each other. But how does mAL normally inhibit male-male courtship? In a final set of experiments, Kallman et al. showed that mAL neurons form connections with P1 neurons and inhibit their activity. Thus, while activating F cells led to an overall activation of P1, activating M cells resulted in an overall inhibition of P1. This suggests that the balance between excitation and inhibition determines this male-specific behaviour."
