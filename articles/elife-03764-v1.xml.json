The brainstem auditory pathways course bilaterally to the inferior colliculi (ICs). Each IC represents one side of auditory space but they are interconnected by a commissure. By deactivating one IC in guinea pig with cooling or microdialysis of procaine, and recording neural activity to sound in the other, we found that commissural input influences fundamental aspects of auditory processing. The areas of nonV frequency response areas (FRAs) were modulated, but the areas of almost all V-shaped FRAs were not. The supra-threshold sensitivity of rate level functions decreased during deactivation and the ability to signal changes in sound level was decremented. This commissural enhancement suggests the ICs should be viewed as a single entity in which the representation of sound in each is governed by the other."

The electrodes were placed in the region of the midbrain that contains two structures called the inferior colliculi (meaning \u2018lower hills\u2019 in Latin). Each inferior colliculus predominantly receives inputs from the opposite ear. However, recordings made in one colliculus when the other was deactivated revealed that one colliculus normally alters the response of the other. This shows that there is an important sideward interaction between the two halves of the auditory pathway in the midbrain that refines how fundamental aspects of sound, such as its frequency and intensity, are processed."

Generation of a unified representation of sensory space requires a functional interaction between the two sides of the pathway, which, in the case of vision and touch, occurs in the cerebral cortex predominantly via the corpus callosum. Hearing, however, is distinct amongst the senses in having extensive pre-thalamic processing in the brainstem.

Processing in each side is dominated by the respective contralateral sound field. Each limb of the pathway culminates in the midbrain in the respective left or right inferior colliculi (ICs) whose outputs provide the primary ascending input to the auditory thalamus and cortex on each side. While the left and right pathways are distinct, they involve crossed connections at several levels (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moore and Osen, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Glendenning and Masterton, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Glendenning et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Oliver, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cant and Benson, 2003</a>). Some of these crossed connections, such as those between the cochlear nuclei and the superior olivary complex, occur between different levels in the hierarchy and mediate interactions that extract the interaural disparities underlying sound localization. Such connections have been termed the acoustic chiasm (<a href=\"#bib19\">Glendenning et al., 1985</a>). In addition, there are commissural connections that interconnect mirror opposite nuclei. These are found as early in the pathway as the cochlear nuclei (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams and Warr, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cant and Gaston, 1982</a>), while, in the midbrain, the commissure of Probst connects the dorsal nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (DNLLs) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goldberg and Moore, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hutson et al., 1991</a>).

Cooling did not spread to the contralateral IC and did not modulate the afferent volley to the contralateral IC, showing that changes imparted by the cooling protocol in the contralateral IC were of commissural origin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Orton et al., 2012</a>).

To this end, we generated RLFs for single units by recording responses to multiple presentations of pure tones at the unit CF at several sound levels. Effectively, this is a measure of a neuron's response to stimuli on a vertical line transecting the FRA at CF. Each RLF was classified into one of five previously reported types (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rees and Palmer, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Winter et al., 1990</a>). Non-monotonic RLFs were defined using the criteria of <a href=\"#bib49\">Rees and Palmer (1988)</a>, where a reduction in firing of 25% or more was required at a sound level above that which produced maximal firing. Non-monotonic RLFs comprised 12 of the 38 neurons recorded. A range of FRA types can give rise to non-monotonic RLFs. While examples of all RLF types showed firing rate changes during contralateral IC deactivation, only non-monotonic RLFs changed shape. Four of the 12 non-monotonic RLFs became monotonic (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>), four became straight (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), while the remainder remained non-monotonic."

Specifically, activity mediated by commissural fibers connecting the ICs influences the responses of almost all the IC neurons we recorded in at least one of four ways. The majority of neurons in our sample showed changes in firing rate following deactivation of the other IC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Neurons with nonV frequency response areas also showed changes in receptive field shape, often (but not exclusively) becoming more V-like in the absence of commissural input (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). We observed that deactivating inputs from the opposite IC reduced supra-threshold firing rates to sounds of varying level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Finally, deactivation reduced the ability of IC neurons to signal changes in sound level by changes in firing rate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Similar changes were observed whether the IC was deactivated by cooling or MDP."

Although the responses of individual units in those studies are consistent with our data, the population based patterns of change we reveal here were not apparent. The two neural deactivation methods we have applied in this study have the advantages of 1) not needing direct interference with the preparation during deactivation, and 2) rapid recovery from deactivation. We have shown that cooling as a method of deactivation is restricted to the IC when cooling cycle durations are less than 25 min (<a href=\"#bib44\">Orton et al., 2012</a>). Under these conditions, deeper structures, such as the DNLL, appear unaffected. We have also demonstrated reversible deactivation with a second method, MDP with effects consistent with cooling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The methods are complementary in that cooling effects are more extensive within the IC, and consequently produce more substantial changes in the other IC but MDP provides greater control over the extent of the deactivation, albeit with generally more modest effects. The similarity of the datasets using the two methods also gives confidence that they reflect the consequences of deactivating the contralateral IC. It is not impossible that some of the consequences of deactivation are mediated via descending pathways originating in the IC to lower brainstem structures, but this seems unlikely. Recordings of evoked potentials from the recorded IC while cooling the other show significant changes at latencies consistent with processing in the IC, but little or no effect on the incoming afferent volley to the IC (<a href=\"#bib44\">Orton et al., 2012</a>)."

Immunohistochemical studies suggest that the majority of commissural fibers are excitatory, with only 10\u201320% labelling for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nakamoto et al., 2013</a>). The changes in response properties we observed are consistent with commissural input exerting both excitatory and inhibitory influences, with much greater inhibition than would be predicted from the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory fibers. This suggests that within the contralateral IC, excitatory commissural fibers can exert their effects di- or poly-synaptically via inhibitory neurons in the target IC. Evidence supporting this idea comes from intracellular recordings in IC slices in which electrical stimulation of the CoIC revealed inhibitory currents that were reduced by glutamatergic blockade consistent with di-synaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib53\">Smith, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Moore et al., 1998</a>)."

Nevertheless all nonV responses are similar in appearing to be shaped from V responses by excitatory and/or inhibitory inputs. Whether this shaping occurs in the inferior colliculus or is inherited from earlier stages of the auditory pathway is still contentious. Both the firing rates and response areas of nonV units were modified by deactivation of the contralateral IC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> &amp; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). Often, but not always, nonV FRAs became more V-shaped (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

Stimuli that arrive at each of the two ears are commonly disparate in temporal, level or spectral characteristics. These disparities are fused by central processing into an auditory percept. The construction of left and right auditory hemi-fields is a consequence of monaural and binaural analysis in the brainstem leading to the encoding of sound source location in azimuth and elevation, but our behavioral <i>sensitivity</i> to changes in sound position is greatest around the midline where these representations meet (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mills, 1958</a>). Furthermore, our ability to separate sound sources, for example to hear out an individual speaker in a noisy social situation, is enhanced by binaural hearing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Litovsky and McAlpine, 2010</a>). Commissural modulation of frequency receptive fields in the ICs may assist sound source separation in acoustical cluttered situations. By modulating the spectral area of FRAs in each IC, this processing may increase FRA diversity to overcome correlated noise present in a neural population, and thus improve signal extraction and information content in a neuronal population (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zohar et al., 2013</a>)."

However, the most substantive critique made by the two reviewers concerned the inactivation protocols and the lack of information about the precise IC region that is inactivated. Ideally, there would be evidence of the area inactivated in each experiment. Reviewer #3 is not sure of the specificity of silencing the commisural fibers, and that some of the effects observed could be due to silencing also the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL)."

The reviewers found in the introduction section some statements for example, that the commissure of IC is the most prominent crossing of the brainstem auditory pathways. He/she notices the trapezoid body probably contains more crossing fibers and that it could be good to cite the series of papers on acoustic chiasm. Also, the reviewer would like you to cite recent papers on binaural responses in the IC from whole-cell in vivo responses, as they could be important for the data interpretation of this paper."

The Unit in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a> doesn't appear to have changed much (not significantly?), while that in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a> became more insensitive and unresponsive rather than losing its non-monotonicity. Similarly, the \u201cstraight\u201d response in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a> could be simply insensitivity, with the non-monotonic portion of the response occurring at higher than tested sound levels. Given these issues, I find it difficult to accept that the input to the binary classifier was meaningful.

This possibility is examined (l.117-124). It appears that the units shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5b,c</a> did indeed have a certain disconnect between threshold and half-maximal firing rate, in that firing appeared to increase at a lower level (threshold) than expected from the main ascending arm of the RLF. But the observation from these units is that the main ascending arm of the RLF had a slope very similar to that of the same units before and after contra inactivation. If the units in 5b,c are unrepresentative, they should be replaced, but they do serve as examples of how a disconnect between threshold and half-maximal firing may not be a good metric of overall sensitivity to sound level."

We do reference our previous paper (<a href=\"#bib44\">Orton et al., 2012</a>), which is devoted to validating the cooling technique in our preparation, but we should have summarized the major points in the current paper. These points have now been added to emphasize that the measured deactivation of the IC extends to depths representing frequencies up to \u223c8 kHz, i.e. the dorsal half of the IC. On this basis we believe that the DNLL, which lies below the IC, was not deactivated. In addition we took a number of steps to avoid the possibility of the spread of cooling, including limiting the time for which cooling was applied. For practical reasons it was not possible to make these measurements in every experiment, but our measures in numerous control experiments reported in <a href=\"#bib44\">Orton et al. (2012)</a> give us confidence that the extent of cooling is within the same bounds from experiment to experiment. Our use of microdialysis of procaine was to provide an additional control for the spread of cooling, although the effects reported with this method are generally more modest because the spread of the effect is more spatially restricted within the IC. We do have confirmation from each MDP experiment that the lesion from the microdialysis probe was always confined within the left IC. We can therefore unequivocally rule out deactivation of the DNLL in these experiments and we found similar effects to cooling experiments in these experiments. Thus, while we cannot exclude the possibility that the DNLL was affected in every cooling case, we believe it is highly unlikely. We do cover these points in the Discussion, but agree that appropriate statements were needed in the Methods. We have added text to the Methods and the Results to clarify these issues."

One of the puzzles of the IC is this lack of obvious correspondence between morphology and physiology. Such evidence may yet come to light, but more data is required to investigate this issue. Previous studies (e.g. <a href=\"#bib30\">LeBeau et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Palmer et al., 2013</a>) do suggest that units with V and nonV responses receive different inhibitory input, and our current findings suggest that intercollicular connections account, at least in part, for these differences."

The unit in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a> had a reduction of 30% in firing rate at higher sound levels in the control condition, and was therefore classified as non-monotonic. During procaine infusion, the largest reduction from peak firing was 5%, and was therefore reclassified as being monotonic saturating. We interpret the change in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a> as being a reduction in both the sensitivity to lower sound levels and a change in monotonicity. While the unit showed reduced sensitivity to lower sound levels, an increase in firing rate still occurred over 50 dB, indicating the unit could still signal changes in sound level. In the control condition the unit reduced by 55% from maximum firing and was classified as being non-monotonic. During deactivation this became a reduction of 14% during deactivation as the RLF was reclassified as being monotonic saturating. This supports our classifications of a change from non-monotonic to monotonic across the wide range of stimuli we presented. We accept the criticism that the changes in the unit in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a> do not preclude the possibility that the non-monotonic portion of the response could have occurred at higher sound levels than those presented. We make the claims of changes in non-monotonicity only across the range of stimuli we presented, as it would be impossible to know what the response of any unit would be to stimuli that were not presented. We prefer to retain this example as a good example of a change in sensitivity.

For example, the dynamic spiking range in the example neuron in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a> reduced by 45% compared to the control condition. The ability of an ideal observer to decode changes in sound level from a change in firing rate is dependent on the variance of the responses as well as the dynamic range and gradient of the slope, something out DI measure takes account of. In the example unit, the 45% reduction in dynamic range of the slope was quantified as a 20% reduction in DI. This indicates that while DI quantified the changes observed, accounting for the variance in the response as well as the slope lost some sensitivity. That being said, it is to our knowledge, the first and only method to be able to quantify the changes in neural discrimination across the range of stimuli presented. Using this method, we found a &gt;10% reduction in median and inter-quartile range of population DI during deactivation. We would argue that reducing the ability of the population of IC neurons to encode changes in sound level by &gt;10% represents a significant contribution of CoIC mediated processing to this task.

Although the nonV FRA group contains several different types, they are alike in being shaped to some extent by inhibition and thus the distinction between V and nonV is not arbitrary. Furthermore, V and nonV FRAs can be categorized as distinct from each other using both objective and subjective methods (Palmer et al., 2103) and have been reported by all investigators into spectral processing in the IC.

Our point is that while the location of sounds in auditory space in the azimuthal plane are first computed in the SOC, the representations of ITD and ILD cues are largely processed separately in the MSO and LSO respectively. ILDs are further processed in complex brainstem circuitry involving the DNLL before reaching the ICs. Additionally, the spectral cues required for localization in the vertical plane are processed in the DCN before reaching the ICs. The point we wanted to make is that the first point in the auditory pathway where all three of these cues converge and might interact is in the ICs. We have amended the text to clarify this point."

Using this criterion, the units in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> a-c were all defined as non-monotonic in the control condition. All lost that non-monotonicity during deactivation. Non-monotonic RLFs were the only type of RLF to have any change in RLF classification during deactivation. We have added more detail on our classification method."
