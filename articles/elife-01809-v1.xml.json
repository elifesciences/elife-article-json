For a long time it was thought that most of the mutations that lead to antimicrobial resistance in bacteria led to a reduction in fitness, which meant that the resistant bacteria did not grow as fast as those that were susceptible to antimicrobials. These fitness costs are important because they determine how quickly resistance is likely to develop, or to disappear if antibiotic use is discontinued (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson and Hughes, 2010</a>). However, resistant bacteria often develop secondary mutations that can compensate for these fitness costs, and these mutations allow the bacteria to thrive, even in antimicrobial free environments (<a href=\"#bib5\">Lenski, 1998</a>). When this occurs, resistance is likely to continue even if antibiotic use is stopped. This is why public health bodies around the world are so worried by the spread of antibiotic resistance."

However, resistance to the fluoroquinolones is increasing all over the world (<a href=\"#bib6\">Parry and Beeching, 2009</a>). Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Stephen Baker of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Vietnam and co-workers in Vietnam and the UK have compared the fitness of various mutants of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi that are resistant to fluoroquinolones with the fitness of a strain that is still susceptible to these drugs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>)."

Resistance to these antibiotics in <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi involves changes in these target enzymes that reduce the ability of the drugs to bind to them. These changes occur by substitution mutations in two genes, <i>gyr</i>A and/or <i>par</i>C, that encode these enzymes. Advances in site-directed mutagenesis allowed Baker and co-workers to construct eleven fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants and one susceptible control mutant with known nucleotide substitutions from a susceptible, weakened laboratory strain of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi. The resistant mutants were generated by substitutions at two positions in the <i>gyr</i>A gene and one in the <i>par</i>C gene, which were introduced in combinations to create single, double or triple mutants. Seven of the eleven lab-engineered mutants have been found in clinical isolates, whilst the remaining four had not been observed in nature before."

Pyrosequencing of extracted DNA was used to determine the frequency of each mutation and the parent strain at each time-point, and to calculate the fitness of each mutant compared to the parent strain.

This goes against the dogma that resistance mutations always have a fitness cost, and can explain the frequent occurrence of certain resistant mutants in the antibiotic free environment. The single mutant with highest selective advantage (called S83F) contributed 1.3% more offspring per generation than the parent strain, and the most competitive double mutant (S83F-D87N, which has two changes within the <i>gyr</i>A gene) contributed 7.4% more offspring per generation. In contrast, the triple mutant (S83F-D87G-S80I) contributed 1% less offspring per generation than the parent strain: this indicates a negative interaction between these mutations, with the third mutation wiping out the fitness advantage of the double mutants."
