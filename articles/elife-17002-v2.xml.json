We capitalized on this distinctive trait and completed a gene expression-guided functional screen to identify factors that regulate diverse aspects of neural regeneration in <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>. Our screen revealed molecules that influence neural cell fates, support the formation of a major connective hub, and promote reestablishment of chemosensory behavior. We also identified genes that encode signaling molecules with roles in head regeneration, including some that are produced in a previously uncharacterized parenchymal population of cells. Finally, we explored genes downregulated during planarian regeneration and characterized, for the first time, glial cells in the planarian CNS that respond to injury by repressing several transcripts. Collectively, our studies revealed diverse molecules and cell types that underlie an animal\u2019s ability to regenerate its brain."

We capitalized on this distinctive trait and completed a gene expression-guided functional screen to identify factors that regulate diverse aspects of neural regeneration in <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>. Our screen revealed molecules that influence neural cell fates, support the formation of a major connective hub, and promote reestablishment of chemosensory behavior. We also identified genes that encode signaling molecules with roles in head regeneration, including some that are produced in a previously uncharacterized parenchymal population of cells. Finally, we explored genes downregulated during planarian regeneration and characterized, for the first time, glial cells in the planarian CNS that respond to injury by repressing several transcripts. Collectively, our studies revealed diverse molecules and cell types that underlie an animal\u2019s ability to regenerate its brain."

Brain regeneration, as a process, must occur through several interrelated steps: wound signaling and healing; production of new cells by proliferation, dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation; specification of cell lineages of the proper type(s) and ratio(s); organization of new cells in three-dimensional space; differentiation of precursors; reestablishment of connections required for functional restoration; and, finally, cessation of regeneration to avoid overgrowth or damage to nearby healthy tissue. Of these steps, production of new CNS cells has been a major focus. The advent of mammalian stem cell-based approaches and advances in cell reprogramming enabled the creation of new, often functional, neurons in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib136\">Wichterle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib142\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib140\">Yan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib130\">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Elkabetz and Studer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Pi\u00f1a-Crespo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib135\">Wernig et al., 2004</a>). Additionally, the discovery of endogenous stem cell pools in the mammalian brain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Altman and Das, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Eriksson et al., 1998</a>) raises the possibility of enhancing the brain\u2019s ability to create new neurons from within (for a review of this progress, see <a href=\"#bib38\">Gage and Temple, 2013</a>). Despite these advances, functional repair in the human CNS remains an extremely ambitious goal and requires the development of new therapies aimed not only at generation of new cells, but also placing and integrating these cells appropriately within a broader regenerative context."

While some species, like zebrafish and axolotls have a greater regenerative capacity than do mammals, species with the ability to regenerate an entire brain de novo are rare in the animal kingdom and in the realm of established model organisms (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bely and Nyberg, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib123\">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Egger et al., 2007</a>). Of the small number of animals that regenerate their brains after injury, planarians have emerged as a tractable model system in which to study this remarkable process. Scientists have appreciated the extreme capacity for regeneration found in planarians for over two hundred years (<a href=\"#bib32\">Elliott and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2013</a>). A nascent brain structure appears soon after amputation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cebri\u00e0 et al., 2002b</a>) and reproducible brain wiring is indicated by full functional recovery, with resumed movement and feeding after one week (<a href=\"#bib46\">Inoue et al., 2004</a>). Anatomical studies have revealed details of the structure and molecular complexity of the planarian central nervous system (CNS), which consists of bi-lobed cephalic ganglia (the brain) and two ventral nerve cords (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Agata et al., 1998</a>). The planarian brain is composed of a diverse array of neural subtypes that produce conserved neurotransmitters and dozens of neuropeptides (<a href=\"#bib81\">Nishimura et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib82\">2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Collins et al., 2010</a>).

The regenerative ability of planarians depends on a pool of stem cells called neoblasts, at least some of which are pluripotent (<a href=\"#bib133\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). This stem cell pool is heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib128\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Moritz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hayashi et al., 2010</a>) and stem cells respond to injury by migrating, proliferating, and producing daughter cells that differentiate to replace all cell types of the body (<a href=\"#bib112\">Sal\u00f3 and Bagu\u00f1\u00e0, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bagu\u00f1\u00e0, 1976</a>). Additionally, planarians restore their axial polarity after injury; polarity markers reappear early during the regenerative process and are responsible for resetting the body plan (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Adell et al., 2010</a>). Specifically, anterior cues (including Notum and secreted Frizzled-related proteins) inhibit posterior Wnt ligands to enable head and brain regeneration (<a href=\"#bib95\">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</a>)."

Despite the identification of these molecules, we know little about the mechanisms that coordinate cell biological events required for regenerative success. We do not yet understand how neoblasts are directed toward particular neural fates or how cells of different neural subtypes become distributed to ensure proper ratios of diverse cell types. Though polarity cues certainly play a key role, we still lack an understanding of how cells within the organism interpret such cues. Furthermore, the signaling molecules that promote regeneration generally and instruct replacement of specific cell types are largely unknown. While muscle cells produce polarity cues during homeostasis and in response to injury (<a href=\"#bib139\">Wurtzel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib137\">Witchley et al., 2013</a>), it is not yet clear whether they also produce molecules that promote regeneration, or whether other cells carry out or assist in this key signaling role.

Finally, by investigating genes downregulated during regeneration, we identified a marker that led us to discover a population of cells that we determined to be glia, based on their gene expression and morphology.

To identify key time points, we performed several time courses to examine morphological restoration and resumed expression of known brain markers following this particular injury. We examined regenerating animals at 12\u2009hr or 24\u2009hr intervals by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization (ISH, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Over 900 transcripts were upregulated (\u22652x, p\u22640.01) at one or more time points in regenerating animals compared to cut (0\u2009hr) controls that were initially identical to the regenerating animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Of the genes upregulated compared to cut controls, we eliminated transcripts that were very low abundance, parts of repetitive sequences, or housekeeping genes and cloned 428/933 transcripts for further analyses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We examined the gene expression patterns of these genes by ISH and were able to establish expression patterns for ~85% of them (362/428). We hypothesized that our dataset would be enriched in genes expressed in the CNS and, indeed, found that 47% of genes with clear expression patterns showed enrichment in the CNS (170/362, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). Of the 170 genes with CNS expression, 132 were expressed broadly and 38 showed enrichment in subsets of CNS cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). Additionally, genes expressed in the CNS were often expressed elsewhere, for example in the parenchyma or in the intestine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Of upregulated genes with detectable expression patterns, we also found that 9% showed enriched expression in the head (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>) and 17% were expressed in the parenchyma, some in a pattern similar to neoblast genes (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E</a>). Additional genes were expressed in tissue-specific patterns that included the pharynx, intestine, protonephridia, epithelium, and eyespots (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013G</a>). Some non-CNS expression patterns could still reflect neural tissue in the pharynx, body wall, or eyes, but we have not investigated neural regeneration outside the CNS at this point. However, the variety of expression patterns reflects the diverse physiological changes that occur concurrently during head regeneration (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3A</a>)."

Thus, to distinguish between target genes whose knockdown specifically affected CNS regeneration and those which had indirect effects through other mechanisms, we repeated RNAi experiments and examined effects of each of the 30 genes on anterior polarity, stem cell maintenance, and regeneration of tail tissue. First, we examined the anterior marker <i>sFRP-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib94\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Gurley et al., 2008</a>) after RNAi of each gene. RNAi knockdown of 5 genes (<i>argininosuccinate synthase, autophagy-related 13, smarcb1, fzd-5/8\u20132</i>, and <i>hesl-3</i>) reduced <i>sFRP-1</i> expression during regeneration, with reductions ranging from minor to severe (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>-blue bars, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, for these five genes, the small brain RNAi phenotype could result from insufficient reestablishment of anterior identity. We also investigated whether the stem cell pool was affected after RNAi knockdown of these 30 genes using the neoblast marker <i>smedwi-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib100\">Reddien et al., 2005</a>). We determined that knockdown of three genes caused a reduction in <i>smedwi-1</i> signal: <i>snRNPC</i> and <i>rbp-1-like</i>, which have not been described, and the previously identified gene <i>soxP-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>-red bars, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>). We concluded that RNAi of these three genes led to brain regeneration phenotypes secondary to stem cell defects. Finally, to confirm that brain regeneration phenotypes did not merely result from a general impairment in blastema formation (i.e. general defects in neoblast proliferation or migration), we repeated each RNAi experiment and amputated animals anterior and posterior to the pharynx and subsequently measured blastema size after six days. RNAi of five genes (<i>tRNA synthase, GTPbp, argininosuccinate synthase, wdr24</i>, and <i>smarcb1</i>) caused smaller blastemas after regeneration and only <i>GTPbp(RNAi)</i> had an anterior-specific reduced blastema size (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3B</a>). Thus, these five genes likely play a role in regeneration that is not specific to the CNS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>-gray diagonal lines). RNAi of the remaining 19 genes caused no overt polarity or stem cell defects by ISH and no evidence of generally reduced regenerative activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>-black bars). We thus prioritized these genes for further study, as these represent the most promising candidates for factors specifically influencing brain regeneration."

RNAi targeting 12 genes caused head regression and/or curling, while knockdown of 7 genes caused general lysis (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We used ISH with the <i>smedwi-1</i> probe and detected loss or reduction of neoblasts after knockdown of 13 of these genes (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>); in many of these cases (e.g., <i>zfp-4</i>), the causative gene had not been implicated in planarian neoblast biology. As expected, most genes identified in this portion of the screen showed ubiquitous or parenchymal expression patterns (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) with enrichment in stem cells and/or stem cell progeny (<a href=\"#bib60\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3C</a>). Other knockdowns (e.g., <i>exo70, hnRNPK</i>, and <i>smarcc2</i>) caused tissue homeostasis phenotypes despite the presence of stem cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), suggesting potential roles for these genes in proper stem cell function, tissue maintenance, or differentiation. One of these genes (<i>hnRNPK</i>) is required for pharynx regeneration (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adler et al., 2014</a>) and here we show that it is important for head maintenance and regeneration. Therefore, <i>hnRNPK</i> could have a broad role in the\u00a0maintenance or renewal of differentiated cell types. RNAi of one gene, <i>jouberin</i>, also caused bloating reminiscent of protonephridial defects (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

We reasoned that some of these genes might be influencing a subset of neural cell types or progenitors. We began with <i>soxB2-2</i>, which encodes a SOX family transcription factor. <i>soxB2-2</i> was expressed in cells of the head in whole animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and is expressed in a small number of cells in the anterior of regenerating planarians (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A prior transcriptomic study found that <i>soxB2-2</i> was expressed in stem cells and stem cell progeny (<a href=\"#bib60\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, <i>soxB2-2(RNAi)</i> animals showed a small brain phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>) and also a reduced response to vibrations in their environment (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). After <i>soxB2-2(RNAi),</i> we did not detect any defects in anterior polarity by ISH (data not shown) or qPCR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The only neural marker to be significantly downregulated after <i>soxB2-2(RNAi)</i> was <i>tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), though loss of neural subsets (rather than whole classes) might be difficult to detect with this methodology. However, several neural progenitor genes were consistently downregulated after <i>soxB2-2(RNAi)</i>, including significant downregulation of <i>hlh-1, otxA,</i> and <i>POU2/3\u20132</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Each of these genes is expressed in a subset of cells in the planarian brain and in neoblast progeny (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>). We confirmed that <i>hlh-1</i> signal is reduced by ISH after <i>soxB2-2(RNAi)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We therefore conclude that SoxB2-2 plays a role in promoting expression of a neural progenitor gene during the course of brain regeneration."

Among the 30 genes identified in our functional analysis as being required for proper brain regeneration, several genes (including <i>CRELD</i>) encoded putative signaling molecules. Of these genes, a few are expressed in differentiated cells (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3B</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>). One such group of genes is the <i>LDLRR (low density lipoprotein receptor-related</i>) family. <i>LDLRR-1</i> and <i>LDLRR-2</i> were previously identified in an analysis of wound-response genes (<a href=\"#bib98\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>). <i>LDLRR-1</i> is expressed in the parenchyma, while <i>LDLRR-2</i> is expressed in a subset of intestinal cells and in epithelial cells, particularly in the head (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Both show redistribution of expression after injury, with punctate expression in the blastema during regeneration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We also identified a gene with similarity to <i>LDLRR-1</i> in our functional screen, which we have named <i>LDLRR-3</i>; this gene is also expressed in a pattern resembling that of <i>LDLRR-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). <i>LDLRR-1</i> was so named for an LDLR (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor) domain (<a href=\"#bib98\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>); however, the current gene model for LDLRR-1 includes a signal peptide sequence but no transmembrane domain, suggesting that LDLRR-1 is likely to be a secreted molecule or to remain attached to the cell surface by other means (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We were unable to detect known domains within the existing LDLRR-2 sequence, but LDLRR-3 has a domain architecture similar to LDLRR-1 and also lacks a transmembrane domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Furthermore, <i>LDLRR-1</i> and <i>LDLRR-3</i> share closest similarity with proteins of the Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan (HSPG) family (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3G</a>). HSPGs play diverse roles in regulation of the extracellular matrix and signaling (for review, see <a href=\"#bib67\">Lin, 2004</a>). Thus, the planarian family of LDLRR molecules could serve to modulate signaling in a way that promotes regeneration."

Because muscle cells secrete position-control factors that set up the body axis of planarians (<a href=\"#bib137\">Witchley et al., 2013</a>), we tested whether LDLRR-3 could be produced by muscle cells. We found that <i>LDLRR-3<sup>+</sup></i>cells do not express the muscle marker <i>mhc (myosin heavy chain</i>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kobayashi et al., 1998</a>); thus, <i>LDLRR-3</i> is expressed in differentiated, non-muscle cells to promote regeneration. Furthermore, while <i>LDLRR-1</i> and <i>LDLRR-3</i> are expressed in similar patterns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), their expression is only partly overlapping (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>); all <i>LDLRR-3<sup>+</sup></i> cells express <i>LDLRR-1</i>, but only half of <i>LDLRR-1<sup>+</sup></i> cells express <i>LDLRR-3</i>.

We hypothesized that regionally expressed genes might affect local connectivity or function in the regenerating planarian CNS. One subset of genes upregulated during regeneration was expressed medially in the planarian brain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). RNAi targeting these genes did not cause small brain phenotypes (data not shown). However, we did detect a specific phenotype after targeting the planarian homolog of <i>arrowhead</i>, a gene that encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Curtiss and Heilig, 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1997</a>). Planarian <i>arrowhead</i> is expressed in neurons, at least some of which are <i>ChAT<sup>+</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). Despite normal brain size, <i>arrowhead(RNAi)</i> animals regenerated with a gap between the lobes of the cephalic ganglia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, arrows). The medial gap was more clearly visualized with an anti-synapsin antibody that stains the planarian neuropil, a region rich in axons, dendrites, and synapses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). The anterior commissure is the largest commissure in the planarian CNS and connects the two lobes of the cephalic ganglia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Many axons cross the midline at the anterior commissure, including photoreceptor axons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Agata et al., 1998</a>). We detected photoreceptor neurons using an anti-arrestin antibody (VC-1; <a href=\"#bib3\">Agata et al., 1998</a>) and determined that photoreceptor axons appeared frayed and/or failed to cross the midline in a majority of <i>arrowhead(RNAi)</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013G</a>). Failure of photoreceptor axons to cross at the anterior commissure was never detected after <i>control(RNAi)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013G</a>). One factor previously shown to regulate axon guidance in planarians is <i>slit</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cebri\u00e0 et al., 2007</a>). While some <i>arrowhead<sup>+</sup></i> cells are <i>slit<sup>+</sup></i>, the overall <i>slit</i> expression pattern was unaffected after <i>arrowhead(RNAi)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that <i>arrowhead</i> regulates cells or factors that drive reconnection of the planarian brain lobes and organization of newly regenerated axons at the anterior commissure."

Planarian brain branches have been ascribed functions in mechanosensing and/or chemosensing (<a href=\"#bib89\">Oviedo et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib127\">Umesono et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib78\">Nakazawa et al., 2003</a>) and the auricles at the edge of the head of other planarian species have been shown to be important for chemosensory behavior (<a href=\"#bib53\">Koehler, 1932</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">Farnesi and Tei, 1980</a>). The expression of <i>CNG1</i>, which encodes a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, as well as other homologs of olfactory signaling proteins in the brain branches (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), supported the hypothesis that these structures mediate functions specific to chemosensing. We observed a particularly interesting expression pattern for <i>CNG1</i>, which was expressed in regions at the very edge of the head (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>), a location expected for cells serving in a sensory capacity. CNG channels play important signaling roles in the retina and olfactory neurons of other organisms, being activated by cyclic nucleotides (cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP) downstream of sensory signaling (<a href=\"#bib97\">Pifferi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>)."

The maze was designed so that planarians had to detect chemicals from their food (liver paste) and travel ~45 cm toward the food in order to eat. <i>FLI-1(RNAi)</i> animals consistently showed significantly reduced completion of the maze-based feeding assay, compared to <i>control(RNAi)</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Taken together, our findings: i) support a role for the planarian brain branches in chemosensory behavior and ii) suggest that FLI-1 is important for regeneration of some aspect of CNS structure or connectivity that restores chemosensory function during regeneration. Furthermore, our analysis of these genes reveals a previously underappreciated complexity to the brain branch structures, which must be reestablished during regeneration."

We were interested in the types of cells that express these downregulated genes, so we cloned 70 genes and determined the expression patterns of 58 by ISH (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3H</a>). The most frequent expression patterns for these genes were in the peripharyngeal secretory cells and the intestine (39% and 24%, respectively, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that cell loss or a\u00a0change in the physiology of these organ systems occurs during the early stages of planarian head regeneration. We also detected a number of genes expressed in posterior regions (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), an expected pattern as posterior genes likely need to be downregulated after amputation to permit rescaling of the body axis.

                                "text": "The\u00a0nervous systems of many metazoans contain non-neural support cells that are broadly called glia. The existence of glial cells in planarians has been a matter of debate: electron microscopy analyses have been used to argue both for and against the presence of such cells (<a href=\"#bib75\">Morita and Best, 1966</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib66\">Lentz, 1967</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 and Ballester, 1978</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">Golubev, 1988</a>). The identification of <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i> glia is significant, especially given (i) the downregulation of <i>IF-1</i> as an injury response and (ii) the tendency of glial cells in other organisms to affect neural regeneration (positively or adversely depending on the situation \u2013 for review, see <a href=\"#bib93\">Pekny et al., 2014</a>, and for more recent results see <a href=\"#bib5\">Anderson et al. (2016)</a>). <i>IF-1</i> itself shares some similarity with intermediate filament genes expressed in neurons (vertebrate <i>neurofilament</i> and <i>C. elegans intermediate filament, ifa-1</i>) and glia (vertebrate <i>glial fibrillary acid protein</i>) (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3G</a>). Thus, to determine whether the <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i> cells of the planarian nervous system share similarities with glial cells in other organisms, we sought to identify genes coexpressed with <i>IF-1</i>. One frequent function of glial cells is to take up excess neurotransmitters or other chemicals that can be toxic to nearby neurons. For example, astrocytes take up glutamate and convert it to glutamine (<a href=\"#bib116\">Schousboe et al., 1977</a>). Glutamate uptake occurs through excitatory amino acid transporters and conversion of glutamate to glutamine is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase (<a href=\"#bib109\">Rothstein et al., 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">Norenberg and Martinez-Hernandez, 1979</a>). We therefore investigated the expression patterns of planarian <i>slc1a-5 (solute carrier 1a-5 / EAAT</i>) and <i>GS-1 (glutamine synthetase-1</i>) and found that they were also expressed in a pattern similar to <i>IF-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Furthermore, we detected <i>IF-1</i> coexpression with both <i>slc1a-5</i> and <i>GS-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). We also confirmed non-neural expression of <i>slc1a-5</i> using both <i>PC-2</i> and <i>ChAT</i> as markers of neurons (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Recently, a comprehensive characterization of solute carrier proteins in <i>S. mediterranea</i> was completed (<a href=\"#bib131\">Vu et al., 2015</a>). We assayed the expression patterns of several additional solute carrier\u00a0genes and determined that <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup>\u00a0</i>cells express <i>slc1a-3</i> (an additional glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter), <i>slc2a-1</i> (a facilitative glutamate transporter), <i>slc6a-2</i> and <i>slc6a-8</i> (sodium and chloride-dependent sodium:neurotransmitter transporters), and <i>slc7a-8</i> (a cationic amino acid transporter) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Importantly, many of the genes coexpressed with <i>IF-1</i> are not differentially expressed (<i>slc1a-5</i> and <i>slc6a-2</i>) or are even slightly upregulated during regeneration (<i>slc2a-1, GS-1,</i> and <i>slc7a-8</i>). Taken together, these results indicate that <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i> glial cells in planarians are similar to glial cells (and in particular astrocytes) in other organisms, in that they express a variety of transporters of the solute carrier family (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cahoy et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, because most markers coexpressed with <i>IF-1</i> are not reduced after amputation, we conclude that glial cells are not lost after injury, but instead alter their gene expression."

Reasoning that genes that behave like <i>IF-1</i> during regeneration might meet both criteria, we turned to our clustering analysis, and focused on\u00a0module 2, a cluster of 1520 genes (including <i>IF-1</i>) that are downregulated by 12\u00a0hr post-amputation and even more significantly downregulated at 36\u00a0hr and 72\u00a0hr (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>). As a pilot study, we cloned 48 genes from this module and examined their expression patterns. The majority of these genes showed expression patterns irrelevant to our glial studies. However, two transcripts were expressed in <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i>cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013E</a>). <i>jagged-like</i> encodes a protein with weak similarity to Jagged that contains a signal peptide, two EGF domains, and a\u00a0transmembrane domain. We also identified a gene that encodes a signal peptide-containing protein; we named this novel gene <i>estrella</i> ('star' in Catalan) based on its expression pattern and the origin of our <i>S. mediterranea</i> strain in Barcelona. The expression pattern of <i>estrella</i> highlights the extensive processes of glial cells and their wide distribution in the neuropil, the peripheral nervous system, near the brain branches, and near photoreceptors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2013G</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Cowles et al., 2014</a>). Together, our results indicate that <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup> </i>glial cells respond to injury by downregulating a variety of genes (including genes that encode potential signaling molecules) over the course of several days."

Planarian glial cells were also distinct from nearby neurons in that they had electron-dense cytoplasm and elongated nuclei with abundant peripheral heterochromatin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). Throughout the neuropil, where neuronal processes are a dominant feature, electron-dense projections were also common (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), suggesting extensive projection of glial cells throughout the neuropil of the planarian nervous system. Though we have not yet shown that the cells identified by electron microscopy are <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i>, the morphology seen by electron microscopy is consistent with the cell shapes revealed by <i>estrella</i> gene expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2013G</a>).

On one end of the regenerative spectrum, the injury response can minimize damage and cordon off injured tissue. In organisms like planarians, however, an exquisite set of events results in the precise and reproducible replacement of missing tissues and complete restoration of structure and function. While a general picture of the wound response has emerged from planarians and other model organisms (<a href=\"#bib98\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>), we do not yet understand how this wound response can be faithfully channeled into a regenerative response. Studies of planarians and other regenerative model organisms have begun to provide an understanding of regeneration in broad strokes. In planarians, stem cell activity drives cell replacement and a reestablished coordinate system of axial polarity cues redirects the planarian body plan. Still, many basic questions remain, particularly in understanding how stem cell activity and polarity intersect with other cellular events to specifically produce missing organs like the CNS."

Some signals, from small molecules to proteins, have been identified in other regenerative model organisms (e.g., Wnt3 in <i>Hydra</i>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cysteinyl leukotriene in zebrafish, a MARCKS-like protein in axolotl, and newt anterior gradient protein; <a href=\"#bib22\">Chera et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">Kyritsis et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib80\">Niethammer et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">Kumar et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib119\">Sugiura et al., 2016</a>). Surprisingly, the signals that promote regeneration in planarians remain mysterious. Notwithstanding a host of signaling molecules known to establish polarity in the regenerating worm, only a few signaling molecules or their receptors have been determined to regulate regeneration, including opposing Follistatin and Activin signals and EGF- and FGF-receptors that regulate various aspects of homeostasis and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib106\">Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">Gavino et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">Fraguas et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib120\">Ogawa et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib98\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">Lei et al., 2016</a>). Importantly, though planarian neoblasts have been hypothesized to integrate a wide variety of signals to choose between daughter cell fates (<a href=\"#bib102\">Reddien, 2013</a>), whether neoblasts express the diversity of receptors required to integrate numerous signals remains unknown. Neoblasts do express FGF-receptors that are important for tissue maintenance (<a href=\"#bib120\">Ogawa et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib98\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>), but no ligands for these receptors have been identified through homology searches. Thus, further exploring the signals required for regeneration, as well as the cellular origin(s) and receiver(s) of each signal will greatly enhance our understanding of how diverse cellular events (i.e., proliferation, migration, organization, differentiation) are triggered and coordinated during the regenerative response. One goal of our screen was to identify putative signals that influence regeneration, generally, or for the CNS in particular. To that end, we identified several putative signaling molecules encoded by <i>CRELD, F-spondin</i>, and <i>LDLRR</i> family genes that each encode a secreted or transmembrane protein that could function in a signaling capacity."

Conversely, <i>CRELD2</i> encodes a secreted protein (<a href=\"#bib88\">Oh-hashi et al., 2011</a>).

A recent single-cell analysis suggested that neurons do not respond to injury with gene expression changes (<a href=\"#bib139\">Wurtzel et al., 2015</a>). However, these studies were performed on worm fragments that were missing their cephalic ganglia, and only addressed gene expression changes in the first 12\u2009hr after amputation. We identified one gene upregulated later in regeneration, <i>arrowhead</i>, that is required at the midline of the cephalic ganglia for axon organization across the anterior commissure. This non-cell-autonomous role likely involves signaling from <i>arrowhead<sup>+</sup></i> neurons at this location to organize the projections of other cells, including the photoreceptor neurons. Our preliminary finding that some <i>arrowhead<sup>+</sup></i> cells express <i>slit</i> offers one clue about how this might occur, but a deeper investigation of Arrowhead targets will distinguish between this and other possibilities. Thus, at a minimum, some neurons of the CNS likely influence the organization of one another during regeneration. Further work will be required to identify the molecules that govern this influence and to study other contributions of the CNS to the signaling environment required for a proper regenerative response."

In our study, RNAi knockdown of <i>runt</i> failed to significantly influence any of the specific markers of differentiated neurons that we tested in this analysis (e.g., <i>ChAT</i> to mark cholinergic neurons). Although knockdown of <i>soxB2-2</i> decreased several markers, only <i>tyrosine hydroxylase (TH</i>) dropped past the threshold of statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). That RNAi would affect presumptive neural progenitors without a detectable effect on a neural marker could simply be due to a lack of tools required to delineate the affected neural cell types, or due to the sensitivity of the assay. However, other transcription factors identified in this screen as having no brain-size phenotype (e.g., <i>glass</i>) could play more subtle roles in specification or function of neural subtypes. <i>FLI-1</i> expression in neoblasts could shift them to certain fates important for brain-branch architecture or wiring. In contrast, transcription factors like <i>arrowhead</i> and <i>mblk</i> are each expressed predominantly in differentiated cell types (<a href=\"#bib60\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>), and likely function later in differentiation or in mature neurons to affect maintenance, connectivity, or function. Along these lines, a homolog of <i>mblk</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> is important for neurite pruning (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kage et al., 2005</a>)."

However, no expression at the anterior tip is visible. One straightforward model for the function of <i>hesl-3</i> would be that it is required for specification of muscle cells that eventually contribute to the anterior pole. Another possibility is that <i>hesl-3<sup>+</sup></i> cells contribute to regeneration of the brain and that the regenerating brain is important for resetting or maintaining anterior polarity. Neural tissue is critical for regeneration in a variety of other model organisms (<a href=\"#bib57\">Kumar and Brockes, 2012</a>), but we have not been able to determine whether it is so in planarians. Future work will be required to identify targets of <i>hesl-3</i> and to determine whether its roles in head patterning and brain regeneration occur through an influence on neurogenesis, polarity, or both."

We investigated genes downregulated during planarian regeneration and discovered a marker (<i>Intermediate Filament-1</i>) that is expressed in non-neural cells that have several hallmarks of glial identity. First, <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i> cells express a range of solute carrier family genes, including genes that are important for reuptake of glutamate; this function is carried out by astrocytes in the mammalian nervous system (<a href=\"#bib116\">Schousboe et al., 1977</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">Norenberg and Martinez-Hernandez, 1979</a>). Second, <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i> cells are present in the neuropil and have extensive cytoplasmic projections, positioning them ideally to support axonal or synaptic activity of neurons in the CNS. Third, <i>IF-1<sup>+</sup></i> cells respond to injury by changing their gene expression (downregulating <i>IF-1, jagged-like</i>, and <i>estrella</i>), much like astrocytes in mammals (for reviews, <a href=\"#bib118\">Sofroniew, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib92\">Pekny and Nilsson, 2005</a>)."

                                "text": "The discovery of glia in the planarian CNS raises many interesting possibilities for future study. Glia are an abundant, diverse, and essential population of cells in the mammalian nervous system, so functional regeneration of human neural tissue would require regeneration of glia alongside regeneration of neurons themselves. Thus, it will be informative to understand how glia repopulate the regenerating planarian CNS and in particular how glial and neural regeneration are coordinated. Additionally, activation of astrocytes in the mammalian nervous system protects tissue after injury but also contributes to glial scarring that can promote or prohibit axonal regrowth or functional recovery (<a href=\"#bib93\">Pekny et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">Anderson et al., 2016</a>). Though it is not yet clear whether the planarian glial injury-response program is important for driving or permitting regeneration, contrasting the planarian glial response with that of glia in non-regenerating organisms might shed light on how glial activation can be harnessed for purely regeneration-promoting functions. For example, planarian <i>IF-1</i> is downregulated after injury, while mammalian <i>GFAP</i> is upregulated during astrocyte activation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Condorelli et al., 1990</a>). Finally, RNAi of the glial genes identified in this study has so far failed to reveal phenotypes (data not shown). This is not surprising, because the downregulation of <i>IF-1</i> and other glial genes during regeneration suggests that gain-of-function treatments might be more likely to perturb regeneration. More nuanced assays and identification of genes required for glial specification or maintenance will be required to assess whether and how planarian glia support neuronal biology and behavior in planarians."

As such, they provide a simple, in vivo model for understanding neural regeneration. In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach to guide an unbiased functional screen. Through RNAi studies, we identified several factors that influence reestablishment of cell types, reconnection of a major commissure, and restoration of chemosensory behavior. Genes identified in our study also mark new cell types, including planarian glia, putative chemosensory cells, and previously unknown parenchymal cells that promote regeneration. In sum, we have advanced our understanding of diverse aspects of planarian neurobiology and neural regeneration; furthermore, we have laid the foundation for a wide range of studies geared toward understanding success and failure in neural regeneration."

RNAi-treated, regenerated animals (10\u201312 per replicate) were placed in the maze in the position shown (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Mazes were covered to allow complete darkness and animals were permitted 1\u2009hr to complete the maze and eat. Animals that had eaten were scored based on the presence of green in their intestines. Experiments were performed in biological triplicate and differences between the samples were evaluated using a Chi-squared test. In a separate experiment, control and <i>FLI-1(RNAi)</i> animals were added to the center of 60\u2009mm petri dishes on a sheet with concentric circles (the smallest of which was 1.5 cm in diameter). After 15 min, animals were scored for their ability to move beyond the starting circle. A Chi-squared test was also used to evaluate the difference between these samples."

By analyzing changes in gene expression, selecting those candidate genes with the most significant changes and then following up on these candidates by both RNAi and whole-mount visualization of gene expression, the authors have produced an extensive map of genetic activities associated with brain function and regeneration in planarians. For instance, the authors report that <i>soxB-2a</i> controls production of neural progenitors, that <i>hesl-3</i> is important for expressing patterning genes marking the far anterior region, that <i>mblk</i> suppresses expression of several neural transcription factors. Given the nature and design of the screen, it is not surprising that the findings reported here would encompass a very broad range of biological functions that not only expands on prior work in the field but also contributes novel and interesting findings to our understanding of neuronal regeneration. Chiefly among these, are the discovery of planarian glial-like cells, the identification of genes regulating regeneration and of specific cephalic ganglia regions likely associated with chemosensation in this animal."

However, the analyses of all the reported findings are uneven in depth and complexity, which is to be expected by the very nature of the approach. Because this work opens many new avenues of research, rather than recommending an even expansion of the analyses for all of the genes reported, it is our opinion that both the authors and the developmental biology and planarian communities would be best served if these findings are reported as an <i>eLife</i> Tools and Resources article."

It is possible that there is synergism or redundancy between multiple members of this family, but it will take significantly more work to explore this possibility, so we have not included our preliminary data on this subject. We also confirmed that these genes are not downregulated after irradiation, with <i>F-spondin</i>and <i>LDLRR-3</i>cells still present at 7 d post-irradiation when the worms showed significant lysing and tissue damage (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).
