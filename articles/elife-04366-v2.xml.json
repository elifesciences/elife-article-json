This study uncovers and investigates the effect of phosphatidic acid on Kv channel gating. Using the method of reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers, in which protein and lipid components are defined and controlled, we characterize two effects of phosphatidic acid. The first is a non-specific electrostatic influence on activation mediated by electric charge density on the extracellular and intracellular membrane surfaces. The second is specific to the presence of a primary phosphate group, acts only through the intracellular membrane leaflet and depends on the presence of a particular arginine residue in the voltage sensor. Intracellular phosphatidic acid accounts for a nearly 50 mV shift in the midpoint of the activation curve in a direction consistent with stabilization of the voltage sensor's closed conformation. These findings support a novel mechanism of voltage sensor regulation by the signaling lipid phosphatidic acid."

The first way is generic: the negative charge in phosphatidic acid shifts the membrane voltage. The second way is specific to phosphatidic acid: the end of the molecule with the negative charge interacts with the part of the potassium channel that senses changes in voltage to keep the pore closed. The next challenge is to understand how neurons shift their phosphatidic acid levels to regulate their electrical activity."

Even the structurally simple bacterial K<sup>+</sup> channel KcsA requires anionic phospholipids in order to open (<a href=\"#bib10\">Heginbotham et al., 1998</a>), while the more complex eukaryotic inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels are so dependent on the lipid PIP<sub>2</sub> (see abbreviations section for lipid and detergent definitions) that they might have been called the PIP<sub>2</sub>-regulated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib12\">Huang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Suh and Hille, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hansen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</a>). These are just two examples from a growing list of ion channels whose function depends on the presence of specific lipid molecules. In the latter example, since PIP<sub>2</sub> levels vary as a function of the physiological state of a cell, PIP<sub>2</sub> is known as a \u2018signaling lipid\u2019 because it triggers or signals the action of molecules to which it binds, such as inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels."

For example, the archeal KvAP channel requires phospholipids in order to open; they remain completely inactive in non-phospholipid membranes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Schmidt et al., 2006</a>). Eukaryotic Kv7 channels, also known as M current channels, depend on the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Falkenburger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kruse et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Rodriguez-Menchaca et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Telezhkin et al., 2012</a>). Stimulation of Gq-coupled G protein coupled receptors activates phospholipase C, which depletes PIP<sub>2</sub> from the membrane's inner leaflet and closes Kv7 channels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Dickson et al., 2013</a>). Thus, PIP<sub>2</sub> functions as a signaling lipid in regulating Kv7 channel activity, just as for inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels."

Channels were reconstituted into planar bilayer membranes, which allow complete control of lipid composition (<a href=\"#bib17\">Miller, 1986</a>). We identified one lipid, phosphatidic acid (PA), which uniquely affects channel gating. We next studied the mole fraction dependence, membrane sidedness, and chemical characteristics of PA necessary to mediate its effect. We further show that PA similarly alters gating in the distantly related Kv channel KvAP. Experiments with mutant KvAP channels point to a mechanism whereby the primary phosphate group on PA stabilizes voltage sensor arginine residues in the closed conformation. Because PA is a naturally occurring \u2018signaling lipid\u2019 in the inner leaflet of cell membranes, we think we have likely uncovered a new and biologically relevant mode of Kv channel regulation."

At a mole fraction of 0.05 the effect of POPA on V<sub>mid</sub> is already substantial, and by 0.1 it is nearly complete. Thus, POPA influences gating according to an approximately saturating function with a steep dependence in the low (less than 0.1) mole fraction range. The functional relationship is similar whether POPA is added to DPhPC or POPE membranes, although, due to the intrinsic instability of pure POPE bilayers, gating was not assessable at the origin in POPE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

Voltage sensors of Kv channels respond to the electric field inside the membrane, which is a function of both the applied voltage across the membrane and the surface potentials at the membrane\u2013water interface. (The electric field is also a function of dipole potentials at the membrane water interface, but these, being essentially identical but oppositely oriented on the two sides of the membrane, cancel.) To interpret <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, consider that the channel responds to V<sub>mem</sub>, the value of the voltage difference across the membrane where the voltage sensors reside. We the experimenters do not know the value of V<sub>mem</sub>, but set the command voltage, V<sub>i</sub> \u2212 V<sub>o</sub>, with our amplifier. The pictures illustrate how changing surface charge on the membrane gives rise to different values of V<sub>mem</sub> under a constant command voltage according to the expression V<sub>mem</sub> = (V<sub>i</sub> \u2212 V<sub>o</sub>) + (\u03a6<sub>i</sub> \u2212 \u03a6<sub>o</sub>), where \u03a6<sub>i</sub> is the surface potential on the inside and \u03a6<sub>o</sub> is the surface potential on the outside.

In the absence of surface charge the experimenter observes the half open probability at a command voltage (V<sub>i</sub> \u2212 V<sub>o</sub>)<sub>mid</sub> = V<sub>mem</sub>\u02b9.

Therefore the V<sub>mid</sub> shift in these experiments must have resulted from a non-surface charge, PA-specific effect. In the experiments behind <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a> the lipid composition of the two leaflets was different and therefore different surface charge densities should have contributed to the V<sub>mid</sub> shift. As noted earlier, POPA in the inner leaflet caused a greater shift than POPA in the outer leaflet or than POPG/POPS in either leaflet (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B\u2013D and 5A\u2013E</a>). This can be understood in terms of a specific offset added to a surface charge offset for the case of POPA in the inner leaflet. In fact the shift produced by inner leaflet POPA (\u223c+50 mV, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C and 5A</a>) was approximately equal to the surface charge shift (\u223c+20 mV, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>) plus the PA-specific shift (\u223c+30 mV, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

A strong interaction between guanidinium and phosphate groups has been described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Woods and Ferre, 2005</a>). We therefore wondered whether PA in the inner membrane leaflet might stabilize a closed conformation of the voltage sensor through interactions with one or more of the arginine residues on the charge-bearing S4 helix of the voltage sensor. To test this possibility we turned to mutagenesis. Mutations in the paddle chimera Kv channel are not well tolerated so we tested whether the PA-specific effect is present in another distantly related Kv channel that can be more easily mutated. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> shows a PA-specific (both membrane leaflets contain PA so the surface charge effect should be absent) positive V<sub>mid</sub> shift in the activation curve of the archeal channel KvAP (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In its signaling role, PA is most commonly generated from either phosphatidyl choline via phospholipase D cleavage or from diacylglycerol via diacylglycerol kinase (<a href=\"#bib4\">Foster, 2013</a>). Once generated, PA can then be rapidly depleted from the plasma membrane by phosphatidic acid phosphatase or a variety of phospholipases, thus allowing tight cellular control over its abundance (<a href=\"#bib4\">Foster, 2013</a>). The precise control of plasma membrane PA concentrations in response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli combined with its influence on Kv channel function situate PA at a potential interface between cellular and global metabolic signaling pathways and membrane excitation."

PA's effect is exerted by two mechanisms. The surface charge component is expected of any charged lipid disposed asymmetrically over the two membrane leaflets (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ramu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Xu et al., 2008</a>). The PA-specific component requires a primary phosphate group on the lipid molecule and acts only from the inner leaflet. The mutational data support a hypothesis that PA in the inner leaflet interacts with specific arginine residues in the voltage sensor. It seems plausible that hydrogen bonding between a primary phosphate group and arginine guanidinium group could hold the voltage sensor closed, requiring stronger depolarization to open (i.e. a V<sub>mid</sub> shift to more positive voltages). We have determined crystal structures of the paddle chimera mutant in the presence of brominated PA. We typically observe electron density for lipid molecules in the crystal structure, but none with a specific signal for bromine. Therefore we do not know whether PA is specifically bound to a groove on the surface of the channel. Given the somewhat surprising observation that PA influences gating similarly in both the eukaryotic Kv channel and KvAP\u2014channels that are only distantly related\u2014we imagine that PA's specific effect might be mediated through the guanidinium\u2013phosphate interaction alone (i.e. without other interactions between the lipid tail and the channel). In other words, we imagine in a closed conformation the arginine could be released from its hydrogen bond pairing with counter charges on the channel and become anchored in the membrane's inner leaflet through hydrogen bonding with a primary phosphate group."

This silencing will lead to increased membrane excitability.

The main channel studied here is the Kv1.2/2.1 paddle chimera, for which an X-ray structure is available, and the authors incorporate the channel into planar lipid membranes, using DPhPC as the standard control lipid. When comparing a wide range of additional lipids incorporated into both leaflets of planar lipid bilayers, the authors find that the phosphatidic acid (PA) DOPA produces the most dramatic effect, shifting the G-V relationship to more positive voltages. Further comparison of lipids with alterations in either the headgroups or acyl chains shows that this effect is due to the presence of an anionic headgroup. In elegant experiments with a phospholipase D, which will produce PA from DPhPC, the authors find different effects when modifying the external and internal leaflets. In the external leaflet, PA shifts the G-V to negative voltages whereas in the internal leaflet PA produces a much larger shift to more positive voltages. The authors then compare a series of anionic lipids (DOPA, POPG and POPS) with zwitterionic POPC in experiments in which vesicles containing those lipids are fused with planar lipid membranes containing DPhPC. All three anionic lipids produce negative shifts in the G-V when applied externally, but when applied internally, POPA produces a larger positive shift when compared to POPG or POPS. From these results the authors conclude that anionic lipids in external and internal leaflets shift the G-V relationships by altering the surface charge of the membrane, and that intracellular PA has an additional effect that is not as robust as the larger anionic lipids tested. In a final series of experiments with KvAP, another Kv channel for which structures are available and that is easier to mutate, express and reconstitute, the authors contend that this additional effect of internal PA can be explained by an interaction of the anionic lipid with the innermost basic residue positions of the S4 helix that stabilizes a closed state."

Is KvaP really a valid surrogate for the paddle chimera in these experiments? From reading the early Schmidt papers it would appear that KvAP in membranes containing the anionic POPG have G-Vs shifted to negative membrane voltages and when containing positively charged Eth-DOPC they are shifted positive. Are these responses to lipid composition comparable to what is seen with paddle chimera? Also, it would be important to present both the Vmid values along with deltaVmid for the S4 mutations.

In most other respects KvAP and paddle chimera are not very similar."

In contrast, Oliver and colleagues suggest that PUFAs inhibit Kv channels by inducing conformational changes in the selectivity filter (Oliver et al, <i>Science.</i> 304, 265-270.). Due to the lack of consensus in the field, we would prefer not to include the discussion of PUFAs."
