However, little is known about the involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice grown under phosphate starvation and recovery conditions, we identified widespread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements (TEs) close to highly induced genes. These changes in mC occurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly <i>DCL3a</i>-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, however no evidence of meiotic transmission was observed. Similar analyses performed in <i>Arabidopsis</i> revealed a very limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs in proximity to environmentally induced genes are silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in response to stress."

However, little is known about the involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice grown under phosphate starvation and recovery conditions, we identified widespread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements (TEs) close to highly induced genes. These changes in mC occurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly <i>DCL3a</i>-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, however no evidence of meiotic transmission was observed. Similar analyses performed in <i>Arabidopsis</i> revealed a very limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs in proximity to environmentally induced genes are silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in response to stress."

This chemical group forms part of the backbone of DNA molecules, and has a crucial role in many chemical reactions that occur inside cells. Plants in particular need a source of phosphate to grow. This is why agricultural fertilizers are rich in phosphate, but unfortunately, the use of fertilizers is not sustainable. Many researchers are now looking for new ways to maintain high crop yields without chemical fertilizers, and understanding how crops are affected in times of shortage will be pivotal to achieving this goal."

The experiments showed that when rice plants were not given enough phosphate, the pattern of DNA methylation changed. This was particularly true around certain genes that help the plants survive in these difficult conditions. Notably, in the absence of phosphate, methylation also occurs more often in DNA sequences called transposable elements that sit close to these useful genes, and less often around other genes."

Therefore, the extra methylation observed by Secco et al. may be a cautionary measure to inactivate these transposable elements and limit their potential deleterious effects. Further experiments went on to show that these useful genes seem to be switched on before the DNA of these transposable elements is methylated, implying that the extra methylation observed in these transposable elements is a consequence of the activation of these nearby useful genes."

Plants preferentially absorb this nutrient as inorganic phosphate (Pi), a form of P with low availability and mobility in the soil (<a href=\"#bib52\">Poirier and Bucher, 2002</a>). As a consequence, Pi is one of the most limiting nutrients for plant growth and development in most agricultural soils. To overcome these issues, application of large quantities of Pi fertilizers has been the primary strategy to maintain crop yields. Yet, this approach is increasingly economically and environmentally unsustainable, with the reserves of Pi rocks greatly diminishing. It is therefore critical to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in Pi homeostasis in order to generate plants with increased P acquisition and use efficiency, associated with sustained yields that will contribute to improve global food security. Plants have developed a wide set of sophisticated responses aimed at acquiring and utilizing Pi efficiently in order to maintain cellular Pi homeostasis even under Pi limiting conditions (\u2212Pi) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rouached et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chiou and Lin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Peret et al., 2011</a>). In \u2212Pi, the expression level of genes encoding high affinity Pi transporters (<i>PTs</i>) in the roots increases in order to increase Pi uptake, as well as inducing and secreting acid phosphatases and ribonucleases to mobilize organically bound P. In contrast, the levels of P-containing intermediates such as nucleotides, RNA and phospholipids are dramatically reduced under \u2212Pi, with phospholipids being replaced with sulpho- and galactolipids. As a consequence, genes involved in sulpho- and galactolipids synthesis, such as sulpholipid synthases (<i>SQDs</i>) and monogalactosyl diacylglycerol synthases (<i>MGDs</i>) are highly up-regulated in \u2212Pi conditions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Misson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59a\">Secco et al., 2013a</a>). Members of the SPX-domain containing protein family (e.g., <i>SPX</i>, <i>PHO1</i> and <i>NLA</i>) have also been shown to be key regulators of Pi homeostasis, being involved in Pi transport and signaling (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rouached et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kant et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Secco et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59a\">Secco et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Puga et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wang et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "In addition to the complex regulation observed at the transcriptome level, studies have shown that Pi homeostasis is also regulated by several post-transcriptional mechanisms involving non-coding RNAs, such as miR827, miR399 and <i>IPS1</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chiou and Lin, 2011</a>) as well as post-translational changes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bayle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2014</a>). However, only a limited number of studies have assessed the potential involvement of altered DNA or histone modifications in response to Pi starvation, and stresses in general (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sahu et al., 2013</a>). Smith and colleagues previously reported that in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) the histone variant H2A.Z was deposited at a number of Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes and that a loss H2A.Z resulted with their de-repression (<a href=\"#bib68\">Smith et al., 2010</a>). In addition, using low resolution, non-quantitative and locus-specific methods, several studies have shown the potential involvement of altered DNA methylation in response to stresses (<a href=\"#bib35\">Labra et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chinnusamy and Zhu, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib75\">2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Karan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Zhou, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sahu et al., 2013</a>). Deep sequencing technologies now enable whole genome single base resolution analysis of DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cokus et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lister et al., 2008</a>), thus enabling global assessment of changes in DNA methylation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Indeed, <a href=\"#bib18\">Dowen et al. (2012)</a> previously reported that biotic stress could induce dynamic changes in DNA methylation of repetitive sequences or transposons, often coupled to transcriptional changes of neighbouring genes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dowen et al., 2012</a>). In addition, <a href=\"#bib84\">Zhong et al. (2013)</a> recently reported that changes in DNA methylation patterns play a role in the process of tomato fruit ripening (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zhong et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "Cytosine DNA methylation (mC) is involved in a range of important biological processes, including silencing of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TEs), genomic imprinting, and stable gene silencing. In plants, DNA methylation exists in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH, where H = A, C or T) through the activity of multiple genetically distinct pathways (<a href=\"#bib36\">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</a>). De novo DNA methylation is mediated by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathways. In the canonical RdDM pathway, transcripts produced from the RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) are then copied into dsRNAs by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR2) before being processed into 24-nucleotides (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3). These newly generated siRNAs are then loaded onto ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) before being guided towards the nascent scaffold of RNAs transcribed by the RNA polymerase V (Pol V) through sequence complementarity. Finally, this complex recruits the DNA methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) to perform de novo methylation in all sequence contexts (<a href=\"#bib42\">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</a>). Recently, another RdDM pathway, which is independent of Pol IV and DCL3, has been identified and is referred to as RDR6-RdDM (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nuthikattu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Panda and Slotkin, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Creasey et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bond and Baulcombe, 2015</a>). In this pathway, Pol II derived transcripts are copied by RDR6 into dsRNAs before being processed into 21-22-nt siRNAs by DCL2 and DCL4. These siRNAs can then either induce post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) when loaded onto AGO1 or initiate de novo DNA methylation when associated with AGO2, thus ultimately triggering the canonical RdDM pathway. Maintenance of DNA methylation through replication is mediated by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) methyltransferases in the CG and CHG contexts, respectively, and are thus referred to as symmetrical methylation, while methylation in the non-symmetrical CHH context has to be established de novo after DNA replication and involves the activities of the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 and 2 (DRM1/DRM2) and CMT2 methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib24\">Finnegan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Du et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>). Within the plant species studied to date, the general methylation state of particular genomic features are relatively conserved, with TEs often highly methylated in all contexts, and CG methylation commonly located in gene bodies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Feng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zemach et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</a>). However, large differences in global DNA methylation levels can be observed amongst plant species potentially associated with different TE content in the various plant genomes. Indeed, the TE-rich genome (\u223c40%) of rice has a much higher aggregate level of DNA methylation than the TE-poor (\u223c15%) <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ragupathy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</a>)."

Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, we identified species-specific, widespread and mitotically heritable changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation that are particularly enriched at stress responsive genes. These changes in DNA methylation occur after changes in nearby gene expression, and are thus likely a consequence of induced transcription of nearby Pi responsive genes, as well as being largely independent of <i>DCL3a</i>. Altogether, we demonstrate a species-specific process in which Pi starvation causes highly localized changes in the genomic DNA methylation patterns in rice, which may act to repress the potentially deleterious activity of TEs located near genes that are highly induced upon stress."

The 52 days time point consisting of 21 days starvation +31 days recovery enabled investigation of the effects of long term resupply on Pi starved plants, and coincided with the emergence of the first panicles and grains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Pre-germinated rice seedlings were grown for 14 days in Pi sufficient conditions (0.32 mM Pi) before being transferred to either Pi sufficient (0.32 mM Pi) or Pi deficient (0 mM Pi) media for 21 days. After 21 days of Pi deficient treatment, half of the plants were either maintained under Pi deficient conditions or re-supplied with Pi (0.32 mM) for 1, 3 or 31 days. To confirm the effectiveness of the Pi starvation and resupply treatments, physiological and molecular analyses were performed. Growth analyses revealed that 21 days of Pi deprivation resulted in a 2.3 fold decrease in shoot biomass (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), however no significant differences could be observed for the root biomass after 21 days of treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Indeed, hierarchical clustering of the 45 root samples based on their CNN methylation levels in the 175 PSI DMRs revealed two main clusters, with cluster 1 containing all +Pi samples as well as the 3 and 7 days \u2212Pi samples, and cluster 2 comprising all long-term \u2212Pi time points (\u226521 days) in addition to the Pi re-supplied samples (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, unlike transcript abundance, where 3 days of Pi resupply was sufficient for the majority of PSI genes to return towards non-stressed level, DNA methylation levels were unaffected by 3 days of Pi recovery. While long-term (31 days) Pi resupply resulted in the PSI DMR methylation level moving towards the Pi sufficient methylation levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the long-term resupply samples were still more closely related to the long-term Pi starvation samples rather than those of +Pi, as assessed by methylation level at the PSI DMRs in roots (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, nutrient stress-induced differential methylation states can persist for substantial periods of time following cessation of the stress conditions."

Given the role of DNA methylation in repressing TE activity, and the high frequency of TEs in the rice genome, accounting for 40% of the total genome length (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ragupathy et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</a>), the position of the DMRs with respect to annotated TEs was assessed. Among the 175 root PSI DMRs, 90% overlapped with TEs, with Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs), the most common class of TEs in the rice genome (69% of all TEs), accounting for 58% of the DMRs overlapping with TEs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To investigate the specificity of the changes in DNA methylation in TEs, DNA methylation levels were assessed in TEs overlapping PSI DMRs as well as in all annotated TEs after 21 days of Pi treatment. Altogether, while TEs overlapping PSI DMRs show significant changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation, the majority of all annotated TEs are unaffected by Pi starvation, suggesting that Pi starvation triggers specific and localized changes in DNA methylation in a subset of all annotated TEs (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In addition, RNA-seq analysis failed to reveal any significantly differentially expressed TEs (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) that overlapped with PSI DMRs, between Pi sufficient and deficient conditions (7 and 21 days), with more than 80% of them not being expressed (Figure 2\u2014source data 2, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Next, each of the 175 PSI DMRs were assigned to the nearest gene, resulting in the association of 126 unique genes with PSI DMRs (Figure 2\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Gene transcript abundance analyses revealed that 66 of these DMR-associated genes (52%) were differentially expressed by &gt;2 fold (FDR &lt; 0.05) in response to 21 days \u2212Pi (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The steady state transcript abundance of 35% of the 126 genes was &gt;4 fold higher following 21 days Pi starvation. Furthermore, gene ontology analyses revealed a strong enrichment for genes encoding proteins involved in phosphate homeostasis, such as acid phosphatases, phosphate transporters, and factors involved in glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Of note, while the majority of DMR-associated genes were associated with only one DMR, several genes were associated with multiple DMRs, including key PSI marker genes such as <i>SPX1</i>, <i>SPX2</i>, <i>SPX5</i>, <i>PT10</i> and <i>MGD2</i>, reinforcing the strong association between differential DNA methylation and transcription in response to \u2212Pi."

Firstly, changes in shoot methylation levels were assessed at the 175 PSI DMRs identified in the roots (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, Figure 2\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>), revealing similar changes in DNA methylation levels in response to Pi starvation in both roots and shoots, though to a lesser extent in the shoots. Secondly, shoot methylomes under Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions were analysed in order to identify shoot PSI DMRs. Due to the lower number of replicates used to identify shoot PSI DMRs (n = 3) compared to the root PSI DMRs (n = 9), a less stringent FDR cut-off of &lt; 0.05 was selected for further analysis, resulting in the identification of 341 shoot PSI DMRs (FDR &lt; 0.05) (Figure 2\u2014source data 3, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Assigning the 341 shoot PSI DMRs to the nearest genes identified 43 distinct genes that were significantly differentially regulated by Pi starvation in the shoots (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In addition, analysis of the methylation levels in all contexts (CNN) revealed that the 341 shoot PSI DMRs had similar patterns of methylation in both roots and shoots, suggesting that Pi starvation affects DNA methylation in roots and shoots in a similar manner. Altogether, more than 30 conserved regions showed significant changes in both roots and shoots, and could be associated to PSI marker genes such as <i>SPX1</i>, <i>SPX2</i> and <i>MGD2.</i>"

Among the 175 root PSI DMRs identified, 100 PSI DMRs were close to genes showing significant changes (FDR &lt; 0.05) in gene transcription upon long term Pi starvation, corresponding to 66 unique genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, Figure 2\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Notably, 63 (95%) of these DMR-associated genes were induced by Pi starvation, and included key regulators of Pi homeostasis such as Pi transporters (<i>PT3</i>, <i>PT4</i>, <i>PT9, PT10</i>), <i>SPX</i> genes (<i>SPX1</i>, <i>SPX2</i>, <i>SPX3</i>, <i>SPX5</i>), <i>MGD2, IPS1</i> and pre-miR827. Only three of the DMR-associated genes were down-regulated by long term Pi starvation. Hierarchical clustering of the differential methylation levels in all contexts for the root PSI DMRs in response to Pi deprivation revealed two distinct clusters, with DMRs in cluster 1 and 2 being hyper- and hypomethylated in response to Pi starvation, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The first group contained 81 PSI DMRs associated with 61 genes that were overwhelmingly hypermethylated in the CHH context, with a subset displaying CHG hypermethylation. Furthermore, these hypermethylated DMRs almost exclusively (80 of 81) overlapped with TEs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, the 19 hypomethylated PSI DMRs from Cluster 2, associated with 13 unique genes, less frequently overlapped with TEs (42% overlap). Notably, most of the known key regulators of Pi homeostasis were present in both clusters, including the <i>SPX</i> genes, <i>IPS1</i>, pre-miR827 and some <i>PTs</i>. Altogether, the majority of PSI DMRs are located in close proximity to genes, gain DNA methylation in response to Pi deprivation, preferentially in the CHH context, and almost exclusively overlap with TEs."

The average changes in CNN methylation levels in the PSI DMRs in response to Pi stress were compared to the associated changes in nearby gene steady state transcript abundance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, Figure 2\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). After 3 and 7 days of Pi starvation, 18% and 55% of the PSI DMR associated genes, respectively, showed significant changes in transcript abundance (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05), while only 5% and 9% of the 100 PSI DMRs showed significant changes in DNA methylation compared to +Pi samples (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, Figure 3\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Long term Pi deprivation (\u226521 days \u2212Pi) was sufficient to induce significant changes in both gene transcript abundance and DNA methylation levels, with all PSI DMRs being significantly differentially methylated after 24 days of \u2212Pi compared to +Pi (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, while resupplying Pi starved plants with Pi for 3 days resulted in 87% of the DMR associated genes differentially expressed upon Pi starvation to return to Pi sufficient-like levels, 94% of PSI DMRs still showed significant differences in DNA methylation levels compared to +Pi conditions (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05). Finally, while 52 days of Pi starvation resulted in only 22% of PSI DMR associated genes showing significant changes in transcript abundance (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) compared to +Pi, likely a consequence of the floral transition and nutrient reallocation to the grains, the majority of PSI DMRs remained unaffected, with 83% of PSI DMRs still showing significant changes in DNA methylation after 52 days \u2212Pi compared to 52 days +Pi (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05). Resupplying Pi for 31 days resulted in 11 of the 100 PSI DMRs showing significant persisting changes in DNA methylation (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05) while no significant changes in gene transcription could be observed compared to +Pi. Taken together, Pi deprivation and Pi resupply appear to first rapidly modulate the transcript levels of genes induced by the stress before subsequently inducing changes in DNA methylation, indicating that the Pi starvation-induced changes in transcription precede, and are potentially causal, for the changes in DNA methylation. This induction of methylation may be involved in repressing the activity of specific TEs close to highly induced genes, via hypermethylation of the TEs in the CHH context."

                                "text": "Due to the observation that differences in DNA methylation in some PSI DMRs may persist despite 31 days of Pi resupply, during which root fresh weight is increased by more than 2.2 fold (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we wanted to assess the extent of potential transmission of changes in DNA methylation through mitosis. Hierarchical clustering of 45 root samples based on their methylation levels in all sequence contexts (CNN) in the 175 PSI DMRs revealed that the 31 days Pi recovered roots were more closely related to the \u2212Pi samples than the +Pi samples, further indicating that some stress induced differences in DNA methylation can persist despite extended Pi recovery (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, resupplying Pi for 31 days resulted in 96 of the 175 PSI DMRs showing more than a 2 fold reduction in the differential DNA methylation levels induced by 52 days \u2212Pi, when compared to +Pi, suggesting that the majority of PSI DMRs are returning towards Pi sufficient levels after 31 days of Pi resupply (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, only 14 of the 175 PSI DMRs (11 hypermethylated, 3 hypomethylated) showed significant differences in DNA methylation level (CNN) between 52 days +Pi compared to 52 days resupply (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05), while not presenting significant differences between 52 days \u2212Pi vs 52 days resupply (t-test, FDR &gt; 0.05), suggesting that changes in DNA methylation persist in only a limited subset of these PSI DMRs after 31 days of Pi resupply (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, Figure 4\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Of note, despite identifying significant persisting differences in DNA methylation, Pi resupplied samples often showed DNA methylation levels that were intermediate between +Pi and \u2212Pi samples. These persistent differences in methylation levels preferentially occurred in the CHH context (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and were associated with 13 unique genes located nearby, including key regulators of Pi homeostasis such as <i>SPX2</i> and <i>MGD2</i>. Among these 14 persisting PSI DMRs, the single hypomethylated persisting DMR, namely the second DMR associated with <i>SPX2</i> (denoted SPX_DMR2), showed the greatest change in DNA methylation level (CNN) in response to Pi stress, decreasing from 50% in +Pi to 1.3% in \u2212Pi, as well as being maintained at a similar low level (1.5%) despite 31 days of Pi resupply (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Overall, it appears that only a small proportion of the Pi starvation induced changes in DNA methylation can be sustained despite 31 days of Pi resupply and active cell growth, while the majority of PSI DMRs have DNA methylation levels returning towards +Pi levels."

In +Pi conditions, the reduced transcription of <i>DCL3a</i> was accompanied by widespread changes in DNA methylation, significantly altering DNA methylation levels in 9379 regions in the genome (6694 hypo- and 2685 hypermethylated regions in <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi line compared to WT; FDR &lt; 0.05), in addition to 3531 genes displaying a significant change in transcript abundance (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) compared to WT +Pi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similar results were also observed between WT and <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants under Pi deficient conditions, with 8164 DMRs and 1791 differentially expressed genes identified (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, Figure 5\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Analysis of the DMRs induced in <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants revealed that the majority of changes in DNA methylation occurred in the CG and CHG contexts, under both Pi sufficient and deficient conditions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,E,F,G</a>). Among the 175 PSI DMRs identified previously (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), only 8 and 5 regions also showed significant differences in DNA methylation between WT and <i>DCL3a</i> plants under Pi sufficient and deficient conditions, respectively, and corresponded to 11 unique PSI DMRs (8 unique associated genes) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,C,D</a>; Figure 5\u2014source data 2, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). These 11 DMRs corresponded to 7 and 4 regions previously identified as hypo- and hypermethylated in response to \u2212Pi in WT, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Of the 4 hypermethylated PSI DMRs altered in the <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants, only one was associated with significant changes in nearby gene transcript abundance in response to \u2212Pi in WT, while all the hypomethylated PSI DMR associated genes were significantly differentially regulated by \u2212Pi in WT (Figure 5\u2014source data 2, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, while reduction in <i>DCL3a</i> transcript levels only moderately affected DNA methylation in 6 of the 11 PSI DMRs (mC change &lt; 15%), DNA methylation was almost completely abolished in all contexts in five of these hypomethylated PSI DMRs, which were associated with <i>SPX1</i>, <i>SPX2</i> and <i>MGD2</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E,F</a>). Among these, three DMRs were associated with <i>SPX2</i>, and showed an average reduction in DNA methylation levels from 47% in WT +Pi to 1% in <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants +Pi, indicating a requirement for <i>DCL3a</i> in maintaining the methylation in these regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Furthermore, among the 8 genes associated with <i>DCL3a-</i>dependant PSI DMRs, only <i>SPX2</i> showed significant changes in transcript abundance between WT and <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants, decreasing by 69 fold under +Pi conditions (15.9 FPKM in WT +Pi and 0.2 FPKM in <i>DCL3a </i>RNAi plants +Pi) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Despite a 2 fold difference in transcript abundance, no significant difference in <i>SPX2</i> transcript abundance was observed between WT and <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants under \u2212Pi conditions, suggesting that the Pi responsiveness of <i>SPX2</i> is maintained in the <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants."

In addition, 7 days after germination, half of the Pi starved plants were transferred to Pi sufficient conditions for 3 days to allow recovery. RNA-seq analysis was performed to assess the transcriptional response to the Pi treatments, identifying 4560 genes displaying differential transcript abundance in the roots after 10 days of Pi starvation (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, Figure 6\u2014source data 1, available at Dryad, <a href=\"#bib62\">Secco et al., 2015</a>).

For example, while under Pi sufficient conditions only 10% of the cytosines in the CHH context were methylated in the DMR associated with <i>Atcopeg1</i>, Pi starvation increased the number of methylated cytosines in the CHH context to 40%, before returning to 24% upon 3 days of Pi resupply, suggesting that the changes in DNA methylation observed are transient. Overall, despite Pi starvation having a limited effect upon DNA methylation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> compared to rice, with only 2 PSI DMRs identified, the location of these PSI DMRs appears to be conserved, with hypermethylated regions overlapping with specific TEs that are close to highly induced PSI genes."

However, despite our understanding of Pi homeostasis greatly increasing during the past decade, very little is known about the potential role of changes in the epigenome in response to Pi starvation, and to stresses in general. Comprehensive methylome profiling coupled with an extensive time course experiment enabled investigation of the presence and potential role of dynamic epigenomic changes upon stress, revealing the temporal relationship between changes in DNA methylation and transcription, and the stability of altered DNA methylation states through mitosis and meiosis. Indeed, this study provides insights into the dynamic changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation, with the identification of widespread changes in DNA methylation near PSI genes, in a species-dependent manner, likely correlated with the TE content of the genome. It is well known that plant genomes exhibit a very large diversity of size and repeat content as well as methylation levels, which were recently shown to be positively correlated, thus highlighting the central role of DNA methylation in repressing the potentially deleterious activity of TEs through hypermethylation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</a>). However, the majority of DNA methylation analyses performed in plants to date have focused on <i>Arabidopsis</i>, despite being relatively depleted of TEs (15\u201320% of the genome) and being poorly methylated compared to other plant genomes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</a>).

Several studies have reported that changes in the environment can affect the methylation status of some regions of the genome, using low resolution and non-quantitative techniques such as methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (<a href=\"#bib13\">Choi and Sano, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hauser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib75\">2011b</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">Karan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shaik and Ramakrishna, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sahu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yu et al., 2013</a>). However, these studies have lacked the resolution to provide the specific context and genomic location of the changes in DNA methylation, thus offering limited insights into the potential role of stress-induced changes in DNA methylation. While this study primarily focused in the main organ involved in nutrient sensing and uptake, namely the root, both roots and shoots appeared to exhibit similar changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation. In addition, all but one of these DMRs overlapped with TEs. While, several studies have suggested that there is a negative relationship between methylation of TEs and nearby gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eichten et al., 2012</a>), we observed the opposite trend, with hypermethylated DMRs being located in close proximity to PSI genes. Consequently, we sought to shed light upon the temporal hierarchy, and thus potential causal relationships, between the observed environmentally-induced differential DNA methylation and the changes in gene transcript abundance. Using our time-course experiment, we demonstrated that upon Pi stress, changes in transcription occurred prior to changes in DNA methylation levels, thus suggesting that induction of gene transcription may be causal for the differential DNA methylation. In addition, since almost all the regions gaining DNA methylation in response to Pi deprivation overlap with TEs, such a process could potentially constitute a mechanism to repress the activity of specific TEs that are near highly induced PSI genes when plants are confronted with \u2212Pi conditions. Indeed, vonHoldt and colleagues recently showed that the methylation pattern of TEs is a complex function of TE size, age and distance to a gene, with young TEs being preferentially poorly methylated (<a href=\"#bib72\">vonHoldt et al., 2012</a>). During Pi stress, PSI genes are highly expressed, presumably requiring increased chromatin accessibility to facilitate access of Pol II and other transcription machinery, which may facilitate the transcription of poorly methylated nearby TEs, with potentially deleterious effects upon the genome such as insertional inactivation of genes and ectopic recombination. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the majority of the hypermethylated PSI DMRs are independent of <i>DCL3a</i>, a key component of the canonical RdDM pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that the RDR6-RdDM pathway, another entry point into RdDM that recognizes Pol II-derived TE transcripts, may act to methylate these TEs. Overall, the observed increase in DNA methylation in specific TEs located close to PSI genes provides insights into a cellular activity that may act to maintain localized suppression of transposable elements in genomic regions that must be transcriptionally activated to respond to environmental perturbation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

TE A represents TEs that are located distant from genes and are highly methylated, while TE B represents TEs that are close to genes and lowly methylated. Upon short term Pi deprivation, RNA polymerase II is recruited to Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes, resulting in increased PSI gene expression. These high levels of RNA polymerase II could induce transcription of nearby and poorly methylated TEs, such as TE B, which could have deleterious effects upon the plant. As a consequence, upon prolonged Pi deprivation, TEs that are close to highly expressed stress-induced genes are hypermethylated, via a <i>DCL3a</i>-independent mechanism, thus preventing their transcription via RNA polymerase II. Black and white circles represent methylated and unmethylated cytosines, respectively. Thickness of the dashed lines represents the proportion of RNA polymerase II recruited to PSI genes or TEs."

                        "text": "In contrast, hypomethylated rice root PSI DMRs overlapped less frequently with TEs, and were often affected by knockdown of <i>DCL3a</i>, suggesting a different function of this subset of PSI DMRs, and likely involving the canonical RdDM pathway. Among the 11 <i>DCL3a-</i>dependent PSI DMRs, those associated with <i>SPX1</i> and <i>SPX2</i> were the most affected by reduced transcription of <i>DCL3a</i>. It has recently been shown that both SPX1 and SPX2 can inhibit phosphate starvation responses through Pi-dependant direct interaction with PHR2, a key transcription factor controlling the majority of Pi-responsive genes. Under Pi sufficient conditions, SPX1 and SXP2 are tightly bound to PHR2, preventing PHR2 from interacting with its cognate binding sites, and suppressing induction of Pi responsive genes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Puga et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib76\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Surprisingly, <i>SPX2</i> transcript abundance was &gt;65 fold lower in the <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi line compared to WT, potentially enabling PHR2 to interact with its target binding sites and induce transcription of PSI genes. Such a mechanism would thus explain the high number of differentially expressed genes observed between WT and the <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi line under +Pi conditions (3531), compared to \u2212Pi (1791), where <i>SPX2</i> is expressed at similar levels between WT and the <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi line. However, it remains unclear how the knockdown of <i>DCL3a</i> can repress <i>SPX2</i> to such an extent in +Pi conditions. It is unlikely that the repression of <i>SPX2</i> is a direct consequence of <i>DCL3a</i>-dependent changes in DNA methylation at this locus, since similar DNA methylation patterns are observed in <i>DCL3a</i> RNAi plants under +Pi and \u2212Pi, while <i>SPX2</i> is highly induced in \u2212Pi and not expressed in +Pi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). In addition, several studies have shown that changes in DNA methylation within or near DNA binding elements could interfere with the binding of cognate transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deng et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bird, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zhong et al., 2013</a>). Zhong and colleagues (2013) recently showed in tomato that binding sites for RIN (Ripening Inhibitor), one the main transcription factors involved in fruit ripening, were frequently demethylated during ripening, thus enabling the induction of ripening genes (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zhong et al., 2013</a>). Such a mechanism could potentially occur in rice, fine-tuning the expression of specific genes involved in Pi homeostasis by regulating the binding capacity of specific transcription factors to PSI genes. However, the involvement of such a mechanism in the Pi starvation response remains to be determined."

While the majority of PSI DMRs returned towards +Pi DNA methylation levels, 14 root PSI DMRs showed significant sustained changes in DNA methylation despite 31 days of Pi resupply, suggesting that these epialleles are likely to be transmitted to newly generated cells, and can thus be mitotically inherited. In addition, unlike animals where DNA methylation is reset in primordial germ cells and during embryogenesis, DNA methylation states in plants can be stably transmitted from parents to offspring (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kinoshita et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Becker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schmitz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Weigel and Colot, 2012</a>), and thus could potentially establish a transgenerational \u2018memory\u2019 of the stress. However, to date few reports have studied the potential heritability of stress-induced DNA methylation changes, and no evidence of transgenerational transmission of stress-induced differential DNA methylation exists (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hauser et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">Pecinka and Scheid, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sahu et al., 2013</a>). Boyko and colleagues reported that the progeny of stress-treated plants had increased homologous recombination frequency and global DNA methylation levels, as well as higher tolerance to stress (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boyko et al., 2010</a>). However, no evidence of transgenerational transmission of differences in DNA methylation was observed, and the increase in global genome methylation levels did not persist in successive generations during the absence of stress (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boyko et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, several recent studies suggest that specific mechanisms exist to prevent transgenerational inheritance of stress-induced epigenetic states (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baubec et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Crevillen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Iwasaki and Paszkowski, 2014</a>). Furthermore, Hagmann and colleagues, using a near-clonal North American <i>A. thaliana</i> population that has diverged under natural conditions for at least a century, recently showed that environment-induced changes are only minor contributors to durable genome-wide heritable epigenetic variation, with more than 97% of the total methylated genome space not being altered by the environment across dozens of generations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hagmann et al., 2015</a>). In this study, we found no evidence of transgenerational inheritance of PSI DMRs, suggesting that PSI DMRs, and potentially most stress-induced differential methylation in general, are not transmitted to their progeny and are thus not likely to contribute to transgenerational stress memory."

To estimate the bisulfite non-conversion frequency, the frequency of all cytosine basecalls at reference cytosine positions in the unmethylated control lambda genome was normalized by the total number of basecalls at cytosine reference positions in the lambda genome. DMRs were identified as previously described (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lister et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, for each cytosine in the CNN context, a root mean square test was performed as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib51\">Perkins et al., 2011</a>). To do so, a contingency table where rows indicated the position of each cytosine in the CNN context on the genome and the columns indicated the number of reads that supported a methylated cytosine or an unmethylated cytosine was generated. Next, p-values were simulated using 10,000 permutations and for each permutation, a new contingency table was generated by randomly assigning reads to cells with a probability equal to the product of the row marginal and column marginal divided by the total number of reads squared. To increase the efficiency of this process, the permutations were stopped when a p-value returned 100 permutations with a statistic greater than or equal to the original test statistic. The p-value cutoff that would control the FDR at our desired rate was determined as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bancroft et al., 2013</a>).The largest p-value cutoff that still satisfied our FDR requirement was then chosen and significant sites showing changes in DNA methylation were combined into DMRs if they were within 200 bases of one another and had methylation changes in the same direction. Furthermore, blocks that contained fewer than 8 and 5 differentially methylated sites were discarded in the rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i> analyses, respectively. The sample comparison details for the identification of the DMR sets described in this study are described below."

On the plus side, there was broad agreement that this is likely the most rigorous study of stress-induced DNA methylation changes in plants. On the negative side, it is difficult to come to any strong conclusions. First, the question of whether methylation changes are mostly a consequence of altered transcription or vice versa is not really solved. Much of the evidence points to transcriptional changes being more important, but there is some tantalizing evidence for the opposite scenario, such as methylation of transcription factor binding sites affecting RNA expression. However, this latter observation is not entirely new, as you point out yourself, and the statistical significance is difficult to judge without a genome-wide comparison. There is potential methylation of one PHR1 binding site, but what about all the other PHR1 binding sites in the genome, and what could be a plausible biological mechanism for such a specific effect? Finally, we appreciated the <i>Arabidopsis</i> data. We agreed that the differences in repeat content might explain the different effects seen in this species, but overall the <i>Arabidopsis</i> data do not help to better understand the phenomenon \u2013 with the added caveat that the experiments and analyses were not done exactly in the same way."

The authors analyze gene expression by RNA-seq and DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. The re-supply experiment is most noteworthy, as it shows very nicely a resetting of the transcriptional activity to control levels once Pi is available to the plant. The methylome, in contrast has a lag phase and only slowly returns back to the initial configuration, with some regions persistently maintaining their altered methylation pattern."

On the one hand, the data presented are very descriptive, and most findings are not evaluated in detail. On the other hand, the data is presented in a way that suggests a regulatory or causal link between DNA methylation and transcription, although data support for this is only marginal or at least not verified. On several occasions the change in DNA methylation is described as being linked to the change in expression, as for the SPX2 locus, which is even given as an example of a putatively more general mechanism. In the Discussion, the authors then again refute links between methylation and expression. This latter take is much more consistent with their data (but is not kept up throughout the manuscript). For example, both hypo- and hyper-methylation-associated genes are up-regulated. Along the same line, re-establishment of control transcription levels does not correlate with re-established methylation after Pi resupply. SPX2 expression drops back to control levels after re-supply of Pi while the methylation is persistently altered. The conclusion from these observations should then be that gene expression and DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation are most likely not linked."

On several occasions the change in DNA methylation is described as being linked to the change in expression, as for the SPX2 locus, which is even given as an example of a putatively more general mechanism. In the Discussion, the authors then again refute links between methylation and expression. This latter take is much more consistent with their data (but is not kept up throughout the manuscript). For example, both hypo- and hyper-methylation-associated genes are up-regulated. Along the same line, re-establishment of control transcription levels does not correlate with re-established methylation after Pi resupply. SPX2 expression drops back to control levels after re-supply of Pi while the methylation is persistently altered.

While reduced expression of <i>DCL3a</i> had major effects on the epigenome, altering DNA methylation at &gt;9000 regions in the genome, very few effects were observed in the phosphate starvation induced DMRs, with hypermethylated DMRs being almost exclusively <i>DCL3a</i>-independent, indicating that this process likely does not involve the canonical RdDM pathway."

It should also be possible to correlate Pol-II ChIP localisation with demethylation, in addition to other 5'-associated chromatin marks, e.g. H2A.Z, H3K4 methylation, nucleosome free regions.
