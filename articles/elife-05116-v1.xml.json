In this study, we report altered genomic mosaicism in single, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurons characterized by increases in DNA content and amyloid precursor protein (<i>APP</i>) gene copy number. AD cortical nuclei displayed large variability with average DNA content increases of \u223c8% over non-diseased controls that were unrelated to trisomy 21. Two independent single-cell copy number analyses identified amplifications at the <i>APP</i> locus. The use of single-cell qPCR identified up to 12 copies of <i>APP</i> in sampled neurons. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes targeting <i>APP</i>, combined with super-resolution microscopy detected primarily single fluorescent signals of variable intensity that paralleled single-cell qPCR analyses. These data identify somatic genomic changes in single neurons, affecting known and unknown loci, which are increased in sporadic AD, and further indicate functionality for genomic mosaicism in the CNS."

In this study, we report altered genomic mosaicism in single, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurons characterized by increases in DNA content and amyloid precursor protein (<i>APP</i>) gene copy number. AD cortical nuclei displayed large variability with average DNA content increases of \u223c8% over non-diseased controls that were unrelated to trisomy 21. Two independent single-cell copy number analyses identified amplifications at the <i>APP</i> locus. The use of single-cell qPCR identified up to 12 copies of <i>APP</i> in sampled neurons. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes targeting <i>APP</i>, combined with super-resolution microscopy detected primarily single fluorescent signals of variable intensity that paralleled single-cell qPCR analyses. These data identify somatic genomic changes in single neurons, affecting known and unknown loci, which are increased in sporadic AD, and further indicate functionality for genomic mosaicism in the CNS."

We therefore first interrogated the DNA content of pathologically confirmed prefrontal cortices (N = 32), using previously described methodologies for DCV analyses in neuronal nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Westra et al., 2010</a>). In control experiments, AD cerebellar nuclei showed DNA content profiles similar to lymphocytes, characterized by histograms with sharp peaks and narrow bases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). By comparison, AD cortices displayed high variability characterized by right hand shoulders (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> [AD-7]), large right hand peak shifts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> [AD-6]), and wide bases. Of the AD cortex samples examined, greater than 90% displayed a net DNA content increase, averaging approximately 8% gain over human lymphocyte controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013H</a>). Notably, the AD cortex displayed increases beyond those observed in non-diseased cortices, with an average gain of approximately 6% over age and sex-matched samples (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013H</a>). AD cortices also displayed an increased coefficient of variation over non-diseased cortical nuclei and all cerebellar nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>) as well as a consistent skewed distribution compared to AD cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition, we examined 14 paired sets of AD cortex and cerebellum from the same individual (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and 12 paired sets from non-diseased individuals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Each AD cortex showed unique cortical histograms and increases in total cortical DNA compared to the cerebellum. In AD and non-diseased brain samples, DNA content changes did not correlate with age, Braak score, or postmortem index (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013H</a>), and DNA content was independent of nuclear size (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Westra et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, the increase observed was significantly less than a 4N tetraploid genome (\u223c12,800 Mb), yet significantly more than what would be expected from a hypersomy of even the largest chromosome (chr1: \u223c250 Mb or 3.9%). These results indicate that neuroanatomically selective increases in DNA content represent a distinct, reproducible, and prevalent characteristic of the AD brain."

The most highly validated gene associated with AD is <i>APP,</i> wherein constitutive gains have previously been linked to AD through familial AD and DS (<a href=\"#bib56\">Prasher et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jonsson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McNaughton et al., 2012</a>).

The normal existence of genomic mosaicism might produce \u2018hot-spots\u2019 of cells with increased <i>APP</i> copy number, and we therefore interrogated small cohorts of brain nuclei from paired cortex and cerebellum.

We therefore examined AD cortical nuclei using a highly liberal protocol for calling aneusomies whereby borderline FISH profiles suggestive of aneusomy were always included in quantitative assessments, in an effort to detect possible differences between AD and control brains. Importantly, all analyses were conducted blind to the identity of samples, an approach made possible by interrogating purified nuclei rather than cells or tissues that themselves show identifying increases of plaques and tangles in AD. Nuclei were double-labeled with a commercially available chromosome 21 q-arm \u2018whole chromosome paint\u2019 (WCP) and a regional \u2018point\u2019 probe for 21q22.13-q22.2 (220 Kb) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013I</a>). The ability of this technique to detect aneuploidy was validated using interphase nuclei from a human trisomy 21 brain (<a href=\"#bib70\">Svendsen et al., 1998</a>) revealing three nuclear signals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>) (see also (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rehen et al., 2005</a>)). Three separate, blinded observers counted each sample. Despite using liberal counting criteria, no statistically significant changes in chromosome 21 aneuploidy rates, including trisomies, between AD (N = 4974 nuclei, N = 9 brains) and non-diseased brains (N = 2576 nuclei, N = 5 brains) were observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). Comparably high levels of aneuploidy have been reported for chromosome 21 displaying no difference between AD and non-diseased hippocampal cells (<a href=\"#bib73\">Thomas and Fenech, 2008</a>). Thus, results from dual probe FISH analyses do not support increased trisomy 21 in AD but are consistent with alternative CNV mechanisms that could produce <i>APP</i> copy number values exceeding 3, as was observed in 75-genome qPCR analyses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

To assess <i>APP</i> copy number in single neurons, an optimized microfluidic protocol to assess genomic copy number via qPCR using a Biomark HD 48.48 Dynamic Array integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) (Fluidigm, South San Francisco) was adapted from gene expression protocols. Nuclei were isolated and interrogated at two reference genes (see Materials and methods) and two <i>APP</i> exons that flanked the majority of the coding sequence at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of <i>APP</i> (exons 3 and 14). Samples were run in triplicate and assays in sextuplicate, which generated high numbers of replicate data points allowing for improved copy number resolution to an extent not possible by conventional qPCR (<a href=\"#bib74\">Weaver et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Whale et al., 2012</a>). A total of 154 neuronal nuclei were individually examined from three AD and three non-diseased brains, within which nuclei from the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex were separately analyzed. In single AD cortical nuclei, significant increases in <i>APP</i> copy number, ranging up to 12 copies in a single nucleus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), were observed with a high concordance rate between exons (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). AD cortical nuclei displayed increased average copy numbers (\u223c3.8\u20134 copies) over control samples (\u223c1.7\u20132.2 copies) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), with increased frequencies of high copy number nuclei (six or more copies) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 6C and 5E</a>, red lines) primarily occurring in prefrontal cortex samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>). The AD cortex showed an approximately fourfold increase over the non-diseased cortex of nuclei with greater than 2 <i>APP</i> copies (55\u201366% vs 12\u201315%) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,I</a>). In addition, nuclei with fewer than 2 <i>APP</i> copies were also identified. In neuronal nuclei with greater than two copies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,I</a>, gold bars), AD cortical nuclei showed statistically significant increases (\u223c5 copies for both exons) over the other samples (\u223c3 copies for both exons) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,J</a>).

                                "text": "The identification of high <i>APP</i> copy number nuclei by single-cell qPCR suggested the possibility that amplified loci could produce detectable FISH signals. In chromosome 21 non-quantitative regional point probe FISH experiments, we occasionally observed variable puncta sizes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rehen et al., 2005</a>) that were initially dismissed as technical hybridization variability but which might potentially indicate sub-chromosomal variation of loci containing target sequences. However, conventional point-probe FISH analysis, while useful for assessments of aneusomy or rearrangements, cannot quantitatively evaluate copy number changes occurring as contiguous copies in close proximity to one another. Moreover, other conventional techniques for identifying copy number in single cells, such as single cell sequencing, rely heavily on genome amplification, which may introduce bias or mask CNVs. We therefore developed a detection assay based upon PNA chemistry. PNA probes hybridize with single base discrimination and have been used to quantify short repeat sequences such as those found on telomeres (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buchardt et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lansdorp et al., 1996</a>). This raised the possibility that amplified copies of <i>APP</i> could be identified using multiple PNA probes simultaneously hybridized to unique gene sequences, provided that amplification occurred in a physically constrained locus rather than being dispersed throughout the genome."

Relative probe sequence locations were also designed to avoid fluorochrome proximity quenching. Single PNA probes did not produce a detectable signal in any samples using standard fluorescence microscopy used for aneusomy FISH (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rehen et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2005</a>), contrasting with clearly detectable telomeric signals, which led to evaluation of more sensitive microscopic techniques including confocal, deconvolution (<a href=\"#bib76\">Westra et al., 2010</a>), and ultimately super resolution structured illumination microscopy (N-SIM, Nikon) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gustafsson, 2000</a>), which all failed to detect possible signals in AD nuclei. However, hybridization of increasing numbers of distinct PNA probes combined with N-SIM visualization resulted in the empirical determination of a threshold that identified one, and rarely two, punctate signals that were much more frequent in AD nuclei (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), and with a frequency consistent with single-cell qPCR data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). AD neuronal nuclei showed single purely green puncta (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, #1 arrow, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1\u20136</a>) and rarer two puncta signals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, #3 arrow, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>), all of which could be differentiated from lipofuscin puncta that fluoresced in all channels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, #2 arrow, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Internal positive control signals identified telomeres (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, red fluorescent puncta). Use of 3D-SIM enabled acquisition and analysis of super resolution projections of individual green puncta (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) revealing a range of morphologies and intensities (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>) consistent with varied <i>APP</i> copy number and possibly distinct, intrachromosomal genomic organization. This threshold detection using multiple PNA probes targeting <i>APP</i> visualized green puncta in 56% of AD neuronal nuclei compared to 22% in non-diseased and 14% in DS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). There was no evidence of single-copy detection in any sample, contrasting with standard FISH data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013I</a>), despite always showing telomeric signals. Compared to single-cell qPCR data, which reports both endogenous alleles in addition to amplification, copy numbers at a <i>single</i> locus below \u223c2 were not visualized with PNA-FISH, allowing focused analyses on positive profiles resulting in fluorescence intensity plots ( <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) that were highly reminiscent of <i>APP</i> copy number plots produced by single-cell qPCR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Mosaicism was documented based on multiple independent criteria: increased DCV in 90% of examined AD brains, varied and increased <i>APP</i> copy number in small cohorts, increased <i>APP</i> CNVs in single neurons identified by single-cell qPCR, and <i>APP</i> copy number increases in single nuclei visualized by PNA-FISH. These data are consistent with our inability to substantiate increases in trisomy 21 in cells of the sporadic AD brain. The concomitant increase in DCV suggests effects on other loci that are also altered in AD, the most obvious of which would be copy gains, but which could also involve losses based upon the presence of increased DCV range observed in AD; such loci might contribute to the progeric presentation of sporadic AD and possibly familial forms of AD that still require decades for disease to manifest. Our working hypothesis ties the currently accepted pathogenicity of <i>APP</i> gene dosage, established by familial AD and DS, to sporadic AD through a mechanism of somatic, mosaically increased <i>APP</i> copy number in some neurons. Our data do not exclude the possibility that the changes observed are a downstream effect of causative factors in the disease. However, if mosaic genomic changes are downstream of disease onset, <i>APP</i> copy number changes would likely play a significant role in disease progression."

                        "text": "Advances in single-cell genomic sequencing had initially suggested its use for identifying <i>APP</i> CNVs in single AD neurons. However, existent technology is limited to published sequence resolution between \u223c2-5 Mb and \u223c0.025X genome coverage (<a href=\"#bib21\">Evrony et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gole et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">McConnell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cai et al., 2014</a>). Considering the &lt;0.3 Mb size of the <i>APP</i> locus, single cell sequencing would be incapable of identifying all but the rarest <i>APP</i> CNVs observed here. In addition, whole genome single cell sequencing is limited by throughput, demonstrated by the low number of neurons reported in this field, and is complicated further by variable results (Cai et al. N = 82 (QC neurons), Evrony et al. N = 6, Gole et al. N = 6, McConnell et al. N = 110). Notably, DNA losses predominated in both <a href=\"#bib11\">Cai et al. (2014)</a> and <a href=\"#bib45\">McConnell et al. (2013)</a> however, <a href=\"#bib28\">Gole et al. (2013)</a> observed that two thirds of somatic CNVs were gains, consistent with increases in DNA content reported previously, and all three studies support a <i>range</i> of DCV amongst neurons, although none of these prior studies assessed AD neurons. While future advances will improve sequence resolution, throughput, and amplification fidelity in single cells, the distinct single cell strategy employed here allowed copy number assessment of a single targeted gene, <i>APP</i>, an approach which may be generalizable to other loci and diseases. Compared to the prior single-neuron reports, 320 single, neuronal nuclei were assessed here for <i>APP</i> CNVs wherein single cell qPCR data markedly resembled PNA-FISH data. Notably, these single cell techniques also possess limitations. For example, single cell qPCR requires normalization to single copy reference genes and control populations, which presents unique difficulties in assessing mosaic neuronal populations. For example, changes in copy number could reflect changes in both the reference and target gene, which might result in artifactual increases (or decreases) in a target gene. Similarly, assessment of copy number from an amplified template could also produce artifactual changes, and thus results require independent techniques for verification, especially since the original template is consumed in the single cell reaction and cannot be further assessed. The use of PNA-FISH does not require any amplification or normalization, and yet PNA-FISH and single-cell qPCR produced a highly similar distribution of APP copy number amplifications. The employed techniques were not capable of assessing intact neurons or their histological organization, which will require technological modifications. Similarly, assessments of genomic and expression data in a single neuron also await technological advancements. Finally, these techniques are currently capable of interrogating only parts of the entire APP locus; therefore, at this time the precise structure of APP CNVs and the mechanisms leading to their existence are unknown."

                        "text": "Our data have bearing on at least 3 AD hypotheses. First, the prevailing amyloid hypothesis in AD posits that A\u03b2 deposition drives AD (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</a>). Increased incidences of amyloid senile plaques are observed in all forms of AD and appear to be directly linked to <i>APP</i> dosage in DS and familial AD. The mosaic increases in neuronal <i>APP</i> copy number reported here provide an explanation for the universal presence of A\u03b2 senile plaques in sporadic forms\u2014indeed, all forms\u2014of AD despite an absence of constitutive copy number gain. The presence of rare neurons with <i>APP</i> amplifications in non-diseased brains also provides an explanation for the observed presence of senile plaques in otherwise normal, aged brains (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gibson, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cras et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mackenzie et al., 1996</a>), consistent with the ages of non-diseased brains examined here, which exceeded 75 years. Along with the occurrence and augmentation of DCV, <i>APP</i> amplification in AD is consistent with dysregulation of normally occurring processes in the etiology of AD pathogenesis. A second hypothesis proposes increased <i>APP</i> dosage through trisomy 21 based largely upon the neuropathology of DS (<a href=\"#bib35\">Heston and Mastri, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Potter, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Geller and Potter, 1999</a>). However, dual chromosome point-paint FISH for chromosome 21 using liberal calling criteria on \u223c5000 AD brain cells (N = 14 brains) showed no relationship between total mosaic aneusomies and AD. Moreover, the lack of observed increases of trisomy 21 in sporadic AD are consistent with prior studies in both peripheral non-brain and intact brain tissues, which reported <i>APP</i> levels approximating 2N (<a href=\"#bib54\">Podlisny et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">St George-Hyslop et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tanzi et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bertram et al., 2010</a>), and is further consistent with mosaic CNVs observed here. The purposeful use of liberal counting criteria resulted in generally higher percentages of aneusomies than reported previously (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rehen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Iourov et al., 2009</a>), however the increases were observed in both AD and non-diseased samples without linkage to AD. Our results do not eliminate roles for mosaic aneuploidy in AD, but do not support trisomy 21 as a specific mechanism for increasing <i>APP</i> copy number in sporadic AD. A third hypothesis is that abnormal cell cycle reentry in post-mitotic neurons contributes to AD (<a href=\"#bib80\">Yang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Herrup and Arendt, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kruman II et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Copani et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mosch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Herrup, 2012</a>). Our DCV analyses detected maximum gains of \u223c21% and average gains of \u223c8.2% over lymphocytes, representing a fraction of the 100% increase expected in a 4N cell. The subgenomic increases observed here are also consistent with the reported absence of adult neurogenesis in the normal cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rakic, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhardwaj et al., 2006</a>), and could also be relevant to reports of nucleotide incorporation in adult cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gould et al., 1999</a>). Concepts involving changes in DNA synthesis in AD without cell-cycle progression or neurogenesis could be rectified through subgenomic DNA synthesis in post-mitotic neurons that might involve DNA synthetic proteins reported in AD (<a href=\"#bib12\">Copani et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2006</a>)."

                        "text": "The observed genomic alterations in AD could occur through both developmental as well as aging processes as reported for at least one form of mosaicism, aneuploidies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bushman and Chun, 2013</a>) that have been linked to caspase-mediated cell death (<a href=\"#bib51\">Peterson et al., 2012</a>) and could have relevance to developmental <i>APP</i> functions (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nikolaev et al., 2009</a>). Perhaps tellingly, these developmental cell death processes also involve DNA fragmentation and double strand breaks (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blaschke et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Staley et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blaschke et al., 1998</a>) that have recently been reported in neurons exposed to physiological and AD stimuli (<a href=\"#bib69\">Suberbielle et al., 2013</a>). It is possible that somatic mosaicism may arise through dysfunction of normally operative DNA repair mechanisms that produce DCV in the normal brain, with augmentation in the diseased brain. We speculate that increased DCV and <i>APP</i> CNVs observed in AD may in part reflect neurons that have delayed or averted cell death, wherein somatic genomic changes could provide a survival advantage at a cost of altered neurophysiological functions."

                        "text": "The DNA content changes observed here showed not only disease relationships but also varied with brain region and cell type. It is important to note that the interrogated neurons are likely terminal in their fate: they will not divide further, contrasting with lymphocytes that, perhaps surprisingly, showed the least amount of DCV despite being a proliferating population. Unlike neurons, proliferating lymphocytes may be similar to stem and progenitor populations that can maintain germline genomes to promote population expansion. By contrast, neurons are by definition post-mitotic, and therefore not subject to this possible requirement. We think it likely that many dividing cells that deviate significantly from the germline genome\u2014and thus would be incapable of further division\u2014are eliminated by cell death and would be removed from the population interrogated for DNA content. Support for this view includes reports on aneuploidies in neuroprogenitor cells, whereby the most extremely aneuploid forms appear to be eliminated by caspase-mediated cell death (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blaschke et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Peterson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Peterson et al., 2012</a>). DNA content changes may therefore be contextual, enabling diverse functions in different cell types. The large differences observed even between brain regions and amongst neuronal nuclei would suggest the existence of distinct neuronal functions produced by DCV, and possibly specific processes or stimuli that can genomically alter neurons."

The consequences of somatic <i>APP</i> amplification in AD may support functionality of other somatically altered genomic loci observed in single neurons that could contribute to the progeric presentation of AD as well as aspects of the disease itself. We further hypothesize that other sporadic or idiopathic brain diseases could arise through altered genomic mosaicism that includes somatic variations at both known and unknown pathogenic loci."

The percent change was calculated from DI values assuming a 2N diploid would have a DI of 1. p values for comparison of mean percent change, skew and coefficients of variation comparisons were determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Linear regression analysis was used to determine age-percent change correlation. For comparison of average percent change from NeuN-positive vs negative cortical nuclei, or NeuN-positive cortical and cerebellar nuclei, p values were determined by unpaired, two-tailed t-test. For standard qPCR analyses, differences in \u0394\u0394Ct \u00b1 SEM of <i>APP</i> in the cortex vs cerebellum were assessed in each individual using an unpaired, two-tailed t-test.

FISH paints against the whole q arm of chromosome 21 and a point probe against a region on the q arm of 21 (21q22.13-q22.2) (Vysis. Downer's Grove, IL) were used. The mounted slides were examined on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and Axiocam CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Approximately, 500 nuclei were blindly counted for each brain, by two independent observers, on 14 samples (5 non-diseased, 9 diseased). Total AD cortical nuclei were examined using a highly liberal protocol for calling aneusomies whereby borderline FISH profiles suggestive of aneusomy were always included in quantitative assessments. All analyses were conducted blind to the identity of samples by interrogating purified nuclei. The ability of this technique to detect aneuploidy was validated using interphase nuclei from a human trisomy 21 brain (<a href=\"#bib70\">Svendsen et al., 1998</a>) revealing three nuclear signals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>)."

Nucleic acid sequences were identified and analyzed in silico to ensure binding to only one specific genomic region on <i>APP</i>. Nine unique probes (4 on exon 3 and 5 on exon 14) were designed and conjugated to a single fluorophore of Alexa-488 (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Specificity of probes was confirmed using dot blot DNA detection paired with immunoblot via antibodies against the Alexa-488 fluorophore (AF-488) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Increasing DNA concentration (1.8, 3.6 and 5.4 \u03bcg) of plasmids containing one copy of each exon (all nine PNA binding sites) was used to verify linear increases in AF-488 signal (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). For the APP copy number curve, DNA concentration remained consistent but plasmids containing 0, 3, 6, and 9 copies of all APP PNA binding sites were used. DNA was denatured in 0.1 M NaCl at 50\u00b0C and dot blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane in distilled deionized water (DDW) and washed in 6\u00d7 SSC. DNA was cross linked to the membrane, and PNA probes were hybridized to the membrane using conditions consistent with probe hybridization to nuclei on slides. Briefly, probes were prepared in 20 mM Tris, 60% formamide, and 0.1 \u03bcg/ml salmon sperm. Probes and membrane were heated 85\u00b0C for 5 min, and probes were added to the membrane and incubated at 85\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by room temperature overnight. Membrane was then washed twice at 60\u00b0C in 2\u00d7 SSC + 0.1% Tween-20, and then in successive washes of 2\u00d7 SSC, 1\u00d7 SSC, and DDW. Probes were visualized on the membrane using a Typhoon fluorescence scanner from General Electric (Fairfield, CT). For quantification, color data were removed, image was inverted, brightness/contrast was adjusted evenly across the entire image, and average pixel intensity was acquired for a region of interest with a standardized area across sample comparisons."

We recognize that assessing levels of <i>APP</i> expression, while logically related to your hypothesis, is not easily done on a single cell level in postmortem brain samples. Even if one assumes that the data is technically sound, there is a major concern that DNA content changes may not be causally related to AD."

We note that in the current publishing environment very few authors write truly critical analyses of their experiments. It was not always that way, and <i>eLife</i> is trying to restore some balance here. We welcome a critical Discussion section, which we believe enhance the reader's ability to judge science. Here is a nice example that illustrates the preceding point: it is from the paper describing the discovery of ubiquitin conjugation as the mark for protein degradation (Hershko A. et al., Proposed role of ATP in protein breakdown: conjugation of protein with multiple chains of the polypeptide of ATP-dependent proteolysis, PNAS, 1980, April 77 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Muotri et al, 2005</a>): 1783-6). After summarizing the evidence that conjugation of APF\u20131 (=ubiquitin) marks proteins for degradation, the authors write: \u201cEvidence that APF\u20131-proteins are intermediates in the breakdown of denatured protein as proposed in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> is indirect and inconclusive at this time.\u201d"

The validation of this premise would provide an impetus to further mechanistic studies in AD as well as suggest strategies for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is important that the premise be validated in a rigorous manner. There are fundamental challenges to this effort, however. Critical to validation of this premise is the establishment of the presence of the additional <i>APP</i> copies in neurons well before the demise of the individual contributing the nuclei of their cortical neurons to the study. An interpretation of the data presented which must be considered is the possibility that the additional DNA present in the nuclei analyzed occurred in the terminal phase of the life of these nuclei shortly before or at the time of death and thus have no direct connection to the pathology experienced by these neurons. Associated with this issue is an understanding of the precise form the observed additional DNA has taken in the analyzed nuclei which would address two questions: first, are complete additional copies of <i>APP</i> genomic DNA in fact present in a contiguous fashion and, second, what mechanistic basis might be associated with the occurrence of these additional copies of <i>APP</i> DNA. A third approach which might be taken to validate the premise would be to carry out studies directed at evaluating <i>APP</i> expression levels in individual neurons to address the presumed pathological consequence of amplification of the <i>APP</i> gene in cortical neurons in AD."

Positive data will strongly support the notion that the increase in amyloid burden can be attributable to the increase in number of active</i> APP <i>gene in neurons within affected regions of sporadic AD patients.</i>"

Our data in fact argue that there are likely to be myriad additional changes to the genome and genes produced by cortical increases in DNA content that represent, on average, hundreds of megabases of additional sequence. It is also a fact that all forms of AD are progeric: even in familial cases, it takes decades to manifest despite the germline presence (for familial disease) of the \u201ccausative\u201d gene mutation. We believe that it is likely that <i>APP</i> gene expression will be increased at some point in the life cycle of an affected AD neuron, however this could occur early in life, or perhaps at the terminal phase of neuronal life\u2014AD is a neurodegenerative disease\u2014which might prevent us from interrogating those neurons with high levels of gene transcription since they would be eliminated by death. This further raises the issue of when, as well as where, one should look for transcriptional changes. It is further possible that there are heterogeneous responses of individual neurons to increased <i>APP</i> copy number that may or may not involve increased gene transcription. Moreover, we also see increases in <i>APP</i> gene copy number in rarer non-diseased neurons, raising the issue of how to interpret the obtained data from AD neurons, especially in a statistically significant manner related to pathogenesis. At this juncture, the genetic linkage with familial AD combined with our mosaic data provides a plausible explanation, with both disease forms awaiting cell and molecular mechanistic detail."

We are unable to find reports of quantitative <i>APP</i> RNA expression in single Down syndrome cells, but are certain there is not uniform expression in all cells that contain the additional copy, underscoring issues of how one interprets the presence or absence of a transcriptional signal in neurons with varied <i>APP</i> copy number."

In our hands, in situ PCR has not proven reliable or quantitative, and this is not a technology that we currently view as appropriate for the questions at hand."
