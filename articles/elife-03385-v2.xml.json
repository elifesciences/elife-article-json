We have used biochemical and genetic analyses to delineate the rules for TAM receptor\u2013ligand engagement and find that the TAMs segregate into two groups based on ligand specificity, regulation by phosphatidylserine, and function. Tyro3 and Mer are activated by both ligands but only Gas6 activates Axl. Optimal TAM signaling requires coincident TAM ligand engagement of both its receptor and the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PtdSer): Gas6 lacking its PtdSer-binding \u2018Gla domain\u2019 is significantly weakened as a Tyro3/Mer agonist and is inert as an Axl agonist, even though it binds to Axl with wild-type affinity. In two settings of TAM-dependent homeostatic phagocytosis, Mer plays a predominant role while Axl is dispensable, and activation of Mer by Protein S is sufficient to drive phagocytosis."

We have used biochemical and genetic analyses to delineate the rules for TAM receptor\u2013ligand engagement and find that the TAMs segregate into two groups based on ligand specificity, regulation by phosphatidylserine, and function. Tyro3 and Mer are activated by both ligands but only Gas6 activates Axl. Optimal TAM signaling requires coincident TAM ligand engagement of both its receptor and the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PtdSer): Gas6 lacking its PtdSer-binding \u2018Gla domain\u2019 is significantly weakened as a Tyro3/Mer agonist and is inert as an Axl agonist, even though it binds to Axl with wild-type affinity. In two settings of TAM-dependent homeostatic phagocytosis, Mer plays a predominant role while Axl is dispensable, and activation of Mer by Protein S is sufficient to drive phagocytosis."

In these settings, TAM signaling regulates multiple functions but two are especially prominent. The first is the \u2018homeostatic\u2019 or silent phagocytosis of the billions of apoptotic cells (ACs) that are generated on a daily basis throughout life (<a href=\"#bib68\">Scott et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lemke and Burstyn-Cohen, 2010</a>).

RPE phagocytosis of the PtdSer-displaying tips of PR outer segments (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ruggiero et al., 2012</a>) requires Mer\u2014mice, rats, and humans that carry loss-of-function mutations in the <i>Mertk</i> gene are blind, due to the cell-non-autonomous degeneration of nearly all PRs (<a href=\"#bib14\">D'Cruz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gal et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duncan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Prasad et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mackay et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nandrot and Dufour, 2010</a>). This cell death results from the accumulation of toxic oxidated proteins that are generated during the course of phototransduction and are removed by phagocytosis. Retinal loss of either the mouse <i>Gas6</i> or <i>Pros1</i> gene alone yields a retina with a normal number of PRs, but the combined loss of <i>Pros1</i> and <i>Gas6</i> results in a PR degeneration phenotype that fully phenocopies the cell death seen in <i>Mertk</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012</a>). While this analysis demonstrated that Pros1 is sufficient to drive Mer-dependent phagocytosis in RPE cells, the presence of Tyro3 in these cells raised the possibility that Pros1 activation of the Mer kinase might be dependent on Pros1 binding to Tyro3."

We find that Gas6 activates all three TAM receptors, but is an especially potent ligand for Axl, with which it has a unique association. In contrast, Pros1 activates Tyro3 and Mer but is inactive as an Axl agonist. Notably, we find that the Gla domains of TAM ligands are dispensable for receptor binding but are critical for optimal receptor activation, and that for Gas6 activation of Axl, this requirement is absolute. We conclude that a complete TAM signaling module is composed of a receptor, a \u03b3-carboxylated protein ligand, and the phospholipid PtdSer, a tripartite arrangement that is unique to the TAM family. Finally, we show that Mer is the functionally predominant TAM receptor in two different settings of \u2018homeostatic\u2019 PtdSer-dependent phagocytosis in vivo\u2013in the retina and the testes\u2013and that Pros1 binding to and activation of Mer alone is sufficient to ensure wild-type levels of phagocytosis in these settings."

Although we were also able to isolate MEF lines expressing Mer, these lines always (for unknown reasons) expressed much lower levels of this receptor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and data not shown). For the Mer-expressing MEF line analyzed in this paper, we used a stable clonal line generated by expressing HA-tagged recombinant mouse Mer under the control of a TetExpress-inducible promoter (Clontech; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

We measured activation of single receptors expressed in MEFs by monitoring their tyrosine phosphorylation 10 min after ligand addition to cells in serum-free medium, using immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the individual receptors (or their C-terminal HA tag) followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We found that both purified human and recombinant mouse Pros1 (hPros1 and rmPros1, respectively) were capable of rapidly activating Tyro3 autophosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). In our hands, purified hPros1 was more stable biochemically and often more potent than rmPros1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and we therefore used the human protein for the majority of the Pros1 experiments described below. However, both the mouse and human ligands were active (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Consistent with these observations, both mouse and human Pros1 were also recently found to be active as ligands for a chimeric receptor comprised of the mouse Tyro3 ectodomain linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the R1 chain of the interferon (IFN)-gamma (\u03b3) receptor (<a href=\"#bib77\">Tsou et al., 2014</a>).

Gla-less Gas6 is deleted for the first 115 residues of the protein, including the Gla domain, but retains all four EGF-like domains and the SHBG-like domain. We found that although both full-length and Gla-less rmGas6 were capable of activating Tyro3, the full-length protein was markedly (\u223c20-fold) more potent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). When we performed this same comparison for Axl-expressing MEFs, we observed an even stronger dependence. Full-length Gas6 was a very potent Axl ligand (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, left 6 lanes), but the Gla-less version was incapable of activating Axl at any concentration tested (up to 750 nM; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, right 6 lanes). We found that this stark disparity was unique to Axl. When we compared the ability of full-length and Gla-less rmGas6 to activate Mer in Mer-expressing Dex-M\u03d5, we observed a pattern similar to that seen for Tyro3. Although both forms of the ligand were capable of activating Mer, full-length Gas6 was \u223c20-fold more potent than its Gla-less counterpart (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Thus, the TAM receptors fall into two groups based on features of their ligand and PtdSer activation profiles: Tyro3 and Mer are activated by both Gas6 and Pros1, whereas Axl is activated only by Gas6; and while Gla-less Gas6 is a substantially weaker ligand for Tyro3 and Mer, it is effectively dead as a ligand for Axl."

These properties suggest that a crystal structure of the Axl ectodomain bound to Gla-less Gas6 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sasaki et al., 2006</a>) represents a ligand-occupied but inactive Axl configuration. In related work, we have found that these properties are also exceptionally important to Gas6\u2013Axl binding and signaling in tissues in vivo, where Gas6 appears to be specifically and constitutively bound to Axl without significant activation of the receptor (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zag\u00f3rska et al., 2014</a>).

This is in spite of the fact that PtdSer is largely confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer of non-apoptotic cells through the action of a set of P<sub>4</sub>-ATPases\u2014so-called flippases (<a href=\"#bib80\">van Meer et al., 2008</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the PtdSer-binding protein Annexin A5 antagonized Gas6 activation of Tyro3 in Tyro3_TAM TKO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We therefore probed for the presence of PtdSer in MEF cultures directly. We co-incubated MEFs (grown under the same conditions we used for activation studies) with propidium iodide (PI) and the fluorescent Annexin B12 derivative pSIVA, a polarity-sensitive biosensor that fluoresces only when bound to PtdSer (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ruggiero et al., 2012</a>), and then analyzed the cells by flow cytometry. We detected significant number of pSIVA<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>\u2212</sup> apoptotic cells and pSIVA<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>+</sup> late apoptotic/necrotic cells in the culture medium and even a measurable number of pSIVA<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>\u2212</sup> and pSIVA<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>+</sup> cells in the adherent MEFs on the plate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that there are PtdSer-displaying membranes present in the MEF cultures. It is important to note that the molecular weight of PtdSer is \u223c385 g/mol, while Gas6 and Pros1 have molecular weights of \u223c80,000 g/mol, and that the crystal structure of the prothrombin Gla domain bound to lyso-PtdSer contains only a single molecule of this phospholipid (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2003</a>). Thus, a relatively low level of PtdSer can easily be in molar excess over the Gla domain-containing proteins with which it interacts. In this regard, the addition of either PtdSer-displaying enveloped viruses (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</a>) or PtdSer-displaying apoptotic cells (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zag\u00f3rska et al., 2014</a>) has been found to markedly shift the dose\u2013response curves for Pros1 activation of Mer and Gas6 activation of Axl/Mer to lower ligand concentrations."

This chimeric receptor was also expressed well in clonal TAM TKO MEF lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The activation profiles of both rmGas6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and hPros1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) were similar for MEF lines expressing equivalent levels of wild-type Tyro3 or the chimeric Tyro3\u2013Axl hybrid. We found that specificity resides within the two N-terminal Ig-like domains of the receptors, and that both of these domains are required: a hybrid receptor composed of the two Ig-like domains of Tyro3 linked to the remaining domains of Axl (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) was, like Tyro3, potently activated by Pros1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lanes 5\u20138), whereas a chimera that contained only the first Ig-like domain of Tyro3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) was refractory to activation by Pros1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lanes 1\u20134).

First, Gas6 alone is capable of binding to and activating Tyro3, Axl, and Mer when these receptors are expressed in isolation and is especially potent as a ligand for Axl. Second, Pros1 alone is capable of binding to and activating Tyro3 and Mer but does not function as a ligand for Axl. Third, the PtdSer-binding Gla domain of Gas6, PtdSer itself, and calcium are all required for optimal receptor activation but none is required for receptor binding. Fourth, ligand binding does not translate into receptor activation: Gla-less Gas6 binds as well to Axl as does its full-length counterpart, but is dead as an activator, and full-length Gas6 binds to Axl in the presence of EDTA but does not activate. Fifth, receptor heterodimerization is not an essential feature of TAM activation, since the TAM receptors can be activated by purified single ligands when expressed as single receptors in MEFs in the absence of any other TAM receptor, and in the retina, Mer activation in wild-type and Tyro3-deficient RPE cells is equivalent. Sixth, in the two settings of PtdSer-dependent \u2018homeostatic\u2019 phagocytosis\u2014by RPE cells in the adult retina and Sertoli cells in the adult testes\u2014Mer is the functionally predominant TAM receptor. And seventh, in these settings, Pros1 binding to and activation of Mer alone is sufficient to ensure wild-type levels of phagocytosis."

Gla-less Gas6 is dead as a ligand when assayed against Axl in isolation.

This is best illustrated in the case of Gas6 activation of Axl, which is uniquely dependent on Gas6 for activation. Both full-length Gas6 and a Gla-less Gas6 variant that lacks its PtdSer-binding Gla domain bind to Axl with the same sub-nanomolar equilibrium dissociation constant, yet the former is an extremely potent Axl agonist while the latter is inactive, whether assayed in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, full-length Gas6 cannot activate Axl in the presence of EDTA, which disrupts the binding of the Gas6 Gla domain to PtdSer. In a related study (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zag\u00f3rska et al., 2014</a>), we have found that just as Axl is uniquely dependent on Gas6 for activation, so is Gas6 uniquely dependent on Axl for its stable localization in several different tissues in vivo. We find that Axl is constitutively pre-bound to Gas6 in these tissues but that this binding does not result in significant Axl activation (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zag\u00f3rska et al., 2014</a>). Together, all of these observations suggest that the induced exposure of PtdSer is actually the regulated trigger for TAM activation and that the TAM receptor\u2013ligand pair is in reality a PtdSer detector. They also suggest that a crystal structure of the two Ig-like domains of the Axl ectodomain bound to two molecules of Gla-less Gas6 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sasaki et al., 2006</a>) reflects the structure of an inactive complex."

This configuration is unique to the TAMs. In this regard, it is important to note that all settings of TAM-dependent \u2018homeostatic phagocytosis\u2019 are strictly co-dependent upon the exposure of PtdSer on the surface of the phagocytic target (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shiratsuchi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ruggiero et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lemke, 2013</a>). In the case of RPE cell phagocytosis of juxtaposed PR outer segment tips, PtdSer is locally exposed only on these outer segment tips (i.e., not on the remainder of the photoreceptor) and only during the narrow window after subjective dawn in which phagocytosis occurs each day (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ruggiero et al., 2012</a>). The activity of Gla domains is also Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, as these ions both stabilize the folded structure of the domain and also interact with PtdSer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bandyopadhyay, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huang et al., 2009</a>). Thus, the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases represent a novel addition to the set of enzymes, such as protein kinase C, whose activities are regulated by both calcium and lipid binding (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lemmon, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leonard and Hurley, 2011</a>). The key difference for the TAMs is that neither the lipid nor the calcium binds the kinase directly. Instead, they bind the TAM ligands, which are outside the cell."

At the same time, our studies here, related work in the immune system (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zag\u00f3rska et al., 2014</a>), and prior analyses (<a href=\"#bib68\">Scott et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rothlin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Seitz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carrera Silva et al., 2013</a>) all demonstrate that distinct normal functions are preferentially assumed by individual TAM receptors and ligands in macrophages, dendritic cells, Sertoli cells, endothelial cells, and RPE cells. Our delineation of the rules of engagement for TAM signaling (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) therefore has important implications for the therapeutic application of inhibiting and activating TAM modulators, particularly with respect to their target specificity and the avoidance of possible treatment side effects in the immune, visual, and reproductive systems."

Supernatant was collected for analysis, and adherent cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 0.25% trypsin briefly, and collected in FACS buffer (0.5% BSA/0.1% Na azide/PBS supplemented with either 2 mM CaCl2 or 10 mM EDTA). Supernatant and cell samples were incubated with pSiva-IANBD and Propidium iodide (PI) (Imgenex) for 30 min on ice. Samples were sorted on a Becton-Dickinson LSR II (Salk Institute Flow Cytometry Core Facility) and data analyzed using FloJo software (Treestar)."

As the authors state that only half the physiological amounts of protein S is needed in vivo to activate TAMs, a partial thrombin cleavage might not show strong effects in a stimulation experiment. Likewise, it would be good to use in addition a lower protein S concentration for the stimulation to see a dose dependence, as well as to study also Mer phosphorylation in the same setup. In addition, it is not clear to me why the authors have used mouse proteinS for this experiment whereas most other are performed with human protein S."

Using purified ligands and MEFs engineered to express single TAMs (a clear and elegant system for these studies), they show that Gas6 functions as a ligand for Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. They argue that Axl is most potently activated (see point1 and 2 below). On the other hand, the authors show that Pros1 activates Tyro3 and Mer, but argue that it does not activate Axl ( see point 1 and 3 below). They further show that the Gla domain is important for activation \u2013 but not necessarily for receptor binding, and Axl appears most dependent on the presence of the Gla domain in Gas6 (see point 4 below). The observed differences appear to track with the Ig domains of the receptors. Finally, the data supporting Pros1/Mer signaling in retinal phagocytosis are quite compelling, and isolate that signaling axis impressively in an <i>in vivo</i> setting, and seem to support separate signaling functions of each receptor/ligand pair."

They found that Gas6 can elicit signaling through all TAM receptors, while protein S can only do so through Mer and TYRO3. Using chimeric receptors, they demonstrated that the extracellular Ig domains of the receptors determine the ability of the receptors to elicit signaling in response to protein S. They also found that interactions between the Gla domain of protein S/Gas6 and phosphatidylserine are necessary for optimal signaling. They analyzed the roles of protein S, Gas6, and TAM receptors in phagocytosis in the retina and testis, using various types of knockout mice. Based upon analysis of knockout mouse phenotypes and their data from <i>in vitro</i> analysis of the signaling mechanisms, they claim that Mer and protein S play a predominant role in phagocytosis in the retina and testis.

The \u2018some activation\u2019 of Axl by Pros1 mentioned by Reviewer 2 reflects lower molecular weight bands that are seen specifically in \u03b1-pY blots for Axl-expressing MEFs only when Axl is <i>not</i> activated by exogenous Gas6 \u2013 they consistently disappear when Axl is activated, and they do not increase in intensity with increasing concentrations of either rmPros1 or hPros1. (See <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> panel D, lane 8; panel E, lanes 1 and 8-11; and panel F, lanes 8-14.) We have clarified the nature of these bands (which may reflect a low basal level of phosphorylation due to MEF production of endogenous Gas6) in the legend to the revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. These new data are consistent with our original data, and clearly demonstrate that neither hPros1 nor rmPros1 can activate Axl.

In addition, preparation of human protein S differed from that of murine protein S and Gas6; human protein S was purified from human serum, and both murine and human protein S were generated as His-tag-conjugated recombinant proteins.

We show that blocking PtdSer with annexin V inhibits Tyro3 activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and that depletion of calcium ions that are required for PtdSer-Gla domain interaction inhibits Axl activation but not binding by full-length Gas6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, E</a>). The phagocytosis of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells in the testis and of outer segment membranes by RPE cells in the retina \u2013 the two systems we analyze genetically in our paper \u2013 have both been previously shown to be entirely dependent on the exposure of PtdSer, and in the case of the retina this exposure cycles during the day and is light-induced (Ruggiero et al., <i>PNAS</i> 109: 8145-8 (2012)).
