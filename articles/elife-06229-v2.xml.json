That the larva uses the same strategy to respond to a variety of stimuli suggests navigation may be mediated by a single circuit that combines input from the various sensory organs. Alternately, this apparent commonality might result from the larva's limited repertoire of motor outputs with which to implement a navigational response. Perhaps, independent circuits mediate the \u2018decision\u2019 portion of each navigational algorithm and only converge at the motor output level (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frye and Dickinson, 2004</a>)."

Typically in reverse-correlation experiments, rapidly changing uncorrelated stimulus intensities are provided (e.g. by choosing random binary values, random normally distributed values, or values from an M-sequence). Because of regression to the mean, these sequences have derivatives that are anticorrelated on time scales longer than the update period. Thus, if we provided uncorrelated stimulus intensities and larvae turned in response to an increase in light, we would expect an average decrease in light after turns. This would complicate analyses of decisions, like whether to accept or reject a head sweep, the larva makes following a turn. We therefore chose a stimulus optimized for analysis of the larva's response to derivatives, a Brownian random walk, whose derivatives (on all time scales) are independent identically distributed Gaussian variables."

In all cases, the results for the two halves of the experiments were similar enough to justify using all 20 min of data in our analyses.

For approximately 10\u201315 s prior to the start of large turns, there was an average gradual increase in blue light levels for visual experiments, and an average gradual decrease in red light levels for <i>Or42a&gt;CsChrimson</i> and <i>Or42b</i>&gt;<i>CsChrimson</i> experiments. Over the same time period, for small turns, there was a slight average decrease in blue light and increase in red light. Interestingly, immediately prior to the initiation of a turn, the average change in stimulus was the same for large and small turns. Thus, larvae consider the change in light intensity and attractive odor concentration over the previous 10\u201315 s when deciding the size of their turns, but the size of the stimulus change that leads the larva to actually initiate a turn appears not to influence turn size. In contrast, for <i>Gr21a</i>&gt;<i>CsChrimson</i> larvae, the size of a turn was determined by the magnitude of the increase immediately preceding a turn."

Head-sweeps in favorable directions are more likely to be accepted, beginning a new run in that direction. Head-sweeps in unfavorable directions are more likely to be rejected, resulting in one or more additional head-sweeps. To characterize the larva's decision to accept or reject a head-sweep, we measured the head-sweep triggered average, aligned to the start of a head-sweep, separately for rejected and accepted head-sweeps (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). All head-sweep triggered averages show a large change immediately before the start of the head-sweep; this is the stimulus change that triggered the larva's decision to turn. We found that during accepted head-sweeps, average blue light levels and Gr21a activity decreased and Or42a and Or42b activity increased, all favorable changes. During rejected head-sweeps, the reverse was true: average blue light and Gr21a activity levels increased and Or42a and Or42b activity decreased.

Thus the independent pathways model, which sums separate rates for light and odor changes, predicts that in response to conflicting favorable and unfavorable changes (iv and viii), the larvae will still significantly increase their turning. Instead, conflicting changes in odor and light cancel each other out, as predicted by the early linear combination model. That larvae turn in response to increases in blue light (iii, v) but decreases in red light (ii, v) further confirms that the two light sources are activating different sensory pathways. For instance, if blue light were primarily activating CsChrimson, we would expect that decreasing blue and red light together (viii) would provoke more turning than decreasing red light alone (ii), but in fact <i>increasing</i> blue light while <i>decreasing</i> red light (v) provokes the largest increase in turning."

For instance, if a larva initiates a turn due to an increase in light, might it prioritize light changes over odor changes in deciding whether or not to accept the turn's first head-sweep? To test this, we re-examined the head-sweep acceptances and rejections from the multi-stimulus white noise experiments, sorting them based on the favorability of light and odor changes preceding the turn start (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). For instance, in quadrant II, larvae turned following a recent favorable odor change and unfavorable light change. If an unfavorable light change caused otherwise neutral larvae to attend more strongly to light, we would expect that following a quadrant II turn, larvae would be more attentive to light changes than average. Alternately, if some larvae in the population were already attending to light more strongly than odor, we would expect them to be over-represented in the group of larvae turning in response to unfavorable changes in light coupled with favorable changes in odor. Thus, we would again expect that following a quadrant II turn, larvae would be attending more strongly to light than in the average population. Similarly, following quadrant IV turns, we would expect larvae to be attending more strongly to odor."

In this work, we showed that larvae initiate turns in response to a decrease in activity in Or42a or Or42b receptor neurons, the primary receptors for Ethyl Acetate and Ethyl Butyrate. Additionally, we showed that larvae mainly use only the previous two seconds of receptor activity to decide whether to turn (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

For light and odor, a strong circumstantial case has been made that larvae use information gathered during head-sweeps to bias turn direction: the first head-sweep of a turn is unbiased (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kane et al., 2013</a>) but larvae are more likely to begin a run following a sweep in a direction of higher concentration of attractive odor, lower concentration of carbon dioxide, or lower luminosity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kane et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2014</a>) and larvae with only a single functional odor receptor can still bias turn direction via head-sweeping (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2014</a>).

We previously measured larvae's responses to linear temporal ramps of light intensity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kane et al., 2013</a>), and EtAc and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>). For light and EtAc, larvae changed their rate of turning and the size of their turns in response to changing environmental conditions, but when they were actually engaged in forward movement, their speed of progress was the same whether conditions were improving or declining. In contrast, larvae dramatically decreased their forward run speed in response to increases in the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. Larvae with non-functional CO<sub>2</sub> receptors did not change their speed at all in response to CO<sub>2</sub>, so this modulation was due to a sensory-motor transformation and not to metabolic effects."

The observed CO<sub>2</sub> dependent speed modulation might therefore reflect the presence of a pathway by which Gr21a receptor neuron activity can down-regulate the probability of initiating forward peristaltic waves. In order to accept a head-sweep, that is, transition from head-sweeping to forward movement, larvae must initiate a new peristaltic wave (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lahiri et al., 2011</a>). If an increase in Gr21a activity decreases the probability of initiating such a wave, this would explain why an increase in Gr21a activity <i>prior</i> to head-sweep initiation results in an increased probability of head-sweep rejection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

Consider a simple experiment where a petri dish is divided into light and dark halves and a droplet of attractive odor is placed on the lighted half. If a larva moves towards the odor at the expense of moving out of darkness, is this because the larva naturally places more importance on odor than light regardless of intensity, because the particular concentrations of odor and intensities of light in the experiment favor a move towards odor, or because behavior is variable and larvae often make idiosyncratic choices? In our reverse-correlation experiments, we presented hundreds of larvae with thousands of combinations of light and odor variation and were thus able to resolve these ambiguities. We determined not just how larvae balance an overall attraction to odor and aversion to light, but how they combine transient odor and light signals to make individual navigational decisions."

Using model parameters extracted from reverse-correlation experiments, we were able to predict how larvae would respond to novel perturbations of these neurons' activities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The charcoal darkened the agar and improved contrast in our dark-field imaging setup. The plate was placed in a darkened enclosure and larvae were observed under strobed 850 nm infrared illumination (ODL-300-850, Smart Vision Lights, Muskegon, MI) using a 14 fps 5 MP rolling shutter CMOS camera (Basler acA2500-14gm, Graftek Imaging, Austin, TX) in global-reset-release mode and an 18 mm c-mount lens (54-857, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) equipped with an IR-pass filter (Hoya R-72, Edmund Optics). The experiments of <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a> were recorded using a 4 MP global shutter CMOS camera (Basler acA2040-90umNIR, Graftek Imaging) operating at 20 fps and a 35 mm focal length lens (Fujinon CF35HA-1, B&amp;H; Photo, New York, NY). A microcontroller (Teensy++ 2.0, PJRC, Sherwood, OR) coordinated the infrared strobe and control of the stimulus light source, so stimulus presentation and images could be aligned to within the width of the strobe window (2\u20135 ms). Videos were recorded using custom software written in LABVIEW and analyzed using the MAGAT analyzer software package (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>). Further analysis was carried out using custom MATLAB scripts. <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> gives the number of experiments, animals, turns, and head sweeps analyzed for each experimental condition.

As a check, for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, we also analytically computed the KL divergence between Gaussian distributions with the same means and (co-)variances as the sampled turn-triggered and stimulus ensembles (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pillow and Simoncelli, 2006</a>), and for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>, we numerically calculated the KL divergence between the model predictions and a multivariate Gaussian with the same mean and covariance as the measured turn-triggered density. For the univariate distributions of 3B, we also estimated the divergence using an alternate method based on Szeg\u00f6's theorem (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ram\u0131rez et al., 2009</a>) as implemented by (<a href=\"#bib60\">Szab\u00f3, 2014</a>). These estimates are shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. None of the conclusions of this paper depend on the method of estimation used."

For this analysis they use light and optogenetically induced fictive olfactory stimuli whose derivatives were independent identically distributed Gaussian random variables: a Brownian random walk. In an automated system, they monitor large numbers of larvae to a variety of stimuli and a stimulus combination and apply a Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model. Their Results are consistent with a model where visual and chemical inputs are combined early rather than processed in parallel to effect orienting turns. Their Discussion suggests that the methods used can be generally applied in understanding how neuronal networks effect decisions. The writing is very clear and crisp and the figures well designed. The modeling is well conceived and based on established procedures and it appears competently and prudently applied. The Materials and methods section and the Figure legends are very clear and helpful. These results have important implications for behavioral analysis of decision making in animals and serve as an entry point for further mechanistic studies in the important model system. Moreover, the application of the techniques here can be a model for applications in other systems."

The problem is that <a href=\"#bib29\">Klapoetke et al. 2014</a> were using adult flies, in which blue light is known not to penetrate the cuticle.

If blue light were mainly activating CsChrimson, we would expect a simultaneous increase in blue light intensity to at least partially offset the effects of decreasing red light. Instead, we see that an increase in blue light coupled to a decrease in red light actually causes more turning than a decrease in red light alone (v), and we see that a decrease in blue light offsets, rather than enhances, the effects of a red light decrease (viii). The larvae\u2019s observed responses are entirely consistent with red light providing a fictive odor cue and blue light providing a visual cue, but impossible to reconcile with the hypothesis that, at the intensities used in our experiments, both red and blue light activate CsChrimson to comparable degrees.
