How such successive motor actions are coordinated to form global locomotion trajectories is unknown. We mapped the structure of larval zebrafish swim trajectories in homogeneous environments and found that trajectories were characterized by alternating sequences of repeated turns to the left and to the right. Using whole-brain light-sheet imaging, we identified activity relating to the behavior in specific neural populations that we termed the anterior rhombencephalic turning region (ARTR). ARTR perturbations biased swim direction and reduced the dependence of turn direction on turn history, indicating that the ARTR is part of a network generating the temporal correlations in turn direction. We also find suggestive evidence for ARTR mutual inhibition and ARTR projections to premotor neurons. Finally, simulations suggest the observed turn sequences may underlie efficient exploration of local environments."

How such successive motor actions are coordinated to form global locomotion trajectories is unknown. We mapped the structure of larval zebrafish swim trajectories in homogeneous environments and found that trajectories were characterized by alternating sequences of repeated turns to the left and to the right. Using whole-brain light-sheet imaging, we identified activity relating to the behavior in specific neural populations that we termed the anterior rhombencephalic turning region (ARTR). ARTR perturbations biased swim direction and reduced the dependence of turn direction on turn history, indicating that the ARTR is part of a network generating the temporal correlations in turn direction. We also find suggestive evidence for ARTR mutual inhibition and ARTR projections to premotor neurons. Finally, simulations suggest the observed turn sequences may underlie efficient exploration of local environments."

While these behaviors have been observed in many animals, it is unclear how they are supported by the nervous system.

When such cues are lacking, however, behavior must be structured so that efficient foraging and exploration can continue until cues are found. This behavior often follows optimal algorithms (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stephens, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Charnov, 1976</a>) that must be guided by internal brain activity.

Even without structured external cues, fish remain highly active, swimming and turning in discrete bouts. While this behavior appears random, analysis of turn sequences over time revealed a specific temporal structure: a turn is likely to follow in the same direction as the preceding turn, creating alternating 'chains' of turns biased to one side. Overall, such a pattern generates conspicuous, slaloming swim trajectories. These are distinct from biased random walks, which evolve randomly at any point in time, and instead show a strong dependency on past behavior. Because the timescales of spatiotemporal correlations exceeded the timescales of individual swim bouts, we hypothesized that networks upstream of the peripheral motor system likely govern this unique pattern of spontaneous behavior."

Whole-brain imaging during behavior is a promising method for finding unknown neuronal populations (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Portugues et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vladimirov et al., 2014</a>), which, in contrast to conventional recordings from subsets of brain areas, increases the likelihood that neurons underlying a specific behavior will be discovered. To this end, we combined a fictive version of the spontaneous behavior with light-sheet imaging, enabling fast, volumetric whole-brain imaging at cellular resolution (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vladimirov et al., 2014</a>). By analyzing the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and spontaneous behavior (<a href=\"#bib27\">Freeman et al., 2014</a>), we generated whole-brain activity maps of neuronal and neuropil structures that correlated well with the observed locomotor patterns. We revealed anatomically structured neural populations in the hindbrain with activity fluctuating on slow timescales similar to the periods of directional locomotion that characterize spatiotemporal behavioral patterning. Subsequent circuit perturbations established a link between these populations and self-generated swim statistics. Finally, we showed that these cells are composed of two glutamatergic clusters and two GABAergic clusters that potentially form a mutually inhibitory circuit motif. We suggest that these neuronal populations are part of a network that confers temporal structure to spontaneous behavior to optimize innate spontaneous exploration."

Because larval zebrafish swim in discrete swim bouts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <i>right</i>; on average one bout every 1.22 \u00b1 0.16 s, mean \u00b1 SEM across fish), the behavior could be partitioned into a punctuated series of swim bout locations and turn angles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We observed that fish do not randomly choose a turning direction, but rather string together repeated turns in one direction before stochastically switching to a chain of turns in the other direction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>; overall turn angle distribution shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We quantified this observation by constructing a null hypothesis that the chains of ipsilateral turns arise by chance from a fish choosing randomly to turn left or right independent of turn history. In real fish, correlations in turn direction resulted in an increase in cumulative signed turn direction after a switch in turn direction. This increase was significantly different, for chains of five turns, from that of a model fish swimming left and right randomly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>; see 'Materials and methods').

We conclude that freely swimming fish spontaneously chain together turns biased\u00a0in the same direction for approximately 6 seconds on average (assuming 1.2 seconds/bout) and much longer in some periods (45% of bouts are in streaks of 5 bouts or longer; 14% in streaks of 10 bouts or longer; see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>),\u00a0significantly deviating from a random walk (<a href=\"#bib15\">Codling et al., 2008</a>)."

Anterior and posterior electrodes were at least 12 body segments apart. Motor nerve volleys in the left and right anterior electrodes were used to classify motor events into left turns, right turns and biased forward swims, as in the data presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>. To verify that these turns were classified correctly, fictive waveforms from the anterior and posterior electrodes were then compared. (<b>B</b>) <i>Left,</i> average fictive waveform recorded on the left anterior (<i>red</i>), left posterior (<i>blue</i>), and right anterior (black) electrodes for 868 fictive bouts classified as left turns from 8 fish (using only the anterior electrode signals for classification). The simultaneous rise time of the first burst on the ipsilateral anterior and posterior electrodes is characteristic of a turning maneuver, as turns are typically initiated with simultaneous contractions of ipsilateral musculature. <i>Right,</i> average fictive waveform recorded on the left anterior (<i>red</i>), left posterior (<i>blue</i>), and right anterior (<i>black</i>) electrodes for 1671 fictive bouts classified as biased forward swims from 8 fish (using only the anterior electrode signals for classification). The phase lag between the first burst on the ipsilateral anterior and posterior electrodes is characteristic of a biased forward swim, in which a near-symmetrical wave propagates down the tail. (<b>C</b>) Analysis of single motor events. Colors represent, for individual motor events, whether it is classified as a turn (<i>blue</i>) or forward swim (<i>black</i>) using only the anterior two electrodes. The 2D space represents a dimensionally reduced representation \u2013 using tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) \u2013 of the two electrodes on the left side of the tail (right side for some fish), ignoring the right (left for some fish) anterior electrode. Thus, although the 2D space is built only from features representing the anterior and posterior left tail signals, swims classified by only the anterior signals segregate, forming evidence that only the anterior signals are sufficient for classifying swim direction. (<b>D</b>) The correlation coefficient (R) between the first bursts on the ipsilateral anterior and posterior electrodes within tSNE space. Although R was not used to build the tSNE space, low and high values can be seen to approximately segregate, showing that the overlap \u2013 a proxy for phase \u2013 between anterior and posterior signals is represented in the tSNE space. (<b>E</b>) Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve for a Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on the tSNE separation of turns and swims with 5-fold cross-validation (using drtoolbox, <a href=\"http://lvdmaaten.github.io/drtoolbox/\">http://lvdmaaten.github.io/drtoolbox/</a> and Classification Learner, Mathworks), which classifies bout type with 88.2% accuracy (<b>F</b>). Some of the errors will be due to noise in the recording or suboptimal classification. This result shows that classifying motor events by the anterior electrode signals yields results consistent with considering three electrode signals, showing that the left and right anterior signals contain accurate information for turn direction. (<b>G</b>) Independent experiment for assessing reliability of using fictive recordings for decoding motor events. Schematic of experiment in which both fictive signals and tail motion are monitored in weakly paralyzed fish. Two fictive electrodes record fictive swim patterns, while small undulations in the weakly paralyzed tail are filmed with a high-speed camera. (<b>H</b>) Filmed tail motion for each bout classified into turns and swims based only on the fictive recordings in an example fish, showing that tail movement waveforms are consistently related to fictive turn index. (<b>I</b>) Partially paralyzed tail waveforms colored according to each associated fictive turn index. For ease of visibility, only the first 10 motor events per turn index range are shown. (<b>J</b>) Scatterplot of fictive turn index and maximum tail deflection. Higher amplitude fictive turns are associated with higher amplitude tail deflections. (<b>K</b>) The turn/swim classification error rate for the weakly paralyzed experiment. Motor events with absolute fictive turn angle less than 0.05 were not considered turns. Only 4% of turns are misclassified, the remaining 96% matching between fictive and physical direction. n = 47,58,72,65,25,12,22 turns."

In order to do this, we first determined if similar temporal turning structures could be observed in a paralyzed fish preparation compatible with live microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Fictive turns were decoded using electrical recordings from peripheral motor nerves and an algorithm that compares the signals on the left and right electrodes after normalizing each channel to account for signal strength differences (see 'Materials and methods') (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>). We verified the accuracy of our turn decoding algorithm using two complementary strategies, detailed in 'Materials and methods' and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. First, we used a three-electrode setup to verify that fictive swims that were decoded to have a small angular component indeed consisted of traveling waves along the tail, and that motor events decoded to have a large angular component consisted of concurrent signals along the ipsilateral rostrocaudal extent of the tail during the initial burst (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013F</a>), as in freely swimming fish (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mirat et al., 2013</a>). Second, we used weakly paralyzed fish to record fictive signals and residual tail motion simultaneously, and found an accurate match between decoded fictive turn direction and tail movement (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G\u2013K</a>). We also verified that the fictive swim events did not contain struggles or Mauthner-mediated escapes (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Additionally, although not essential to the subsequent analyses, by matching the distributions of fictive turn angles to the corresponding distributions of freely swimming fish, we generated approximate two-dimensional trajectories in virtual space from the fictive recordings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), as described previously (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>)."

Using transgenic zebrafish expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f or GCaMP6s (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) in most neurons ('Materials and methods'), and a dual-laser light-sheet microscope capable of scanning the entire brain without exposing the retina to the laser beam (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vladimirov et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), we captured whole-brain neuron-resolution activity at 1.87 \u00b1 0.14 (mean \u00b1 SD over all recordings) brain volumes per second during spontaneous behavior (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). To map the relationship between whole-brain activity and behavioral sequences, we constructed a representation of swimming events that allows for nonlinear relationships between neuronal activity and the strength and direction of turns. To generate this representation, fictive recordings were transformed into distinct behavioral events (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, left; 'Materials and methods'), each associated with a particular point in a two-dimensional 'behavioral tuning space', analogous to a visual receptive field. In this space, angle represents turning direction, and radial distance represents the strength of the motor event (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, middle). By regressing whole-brain activity against this representation of behavior (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, right; 'Materials and methods') (<a href=\"#bib50\">Portugues et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Miri et al., 2011</a>), signals from individual voxels (or neurons) were thus described with a tuning field over the behavioral space (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; two example neurons, one tuned to left and the other to right turns)."

                                "text": "To match neural activity to the pattern of spontaneous turning, we generated whole-brain activity maps for individual fish by color-coding each voxel for preferred angle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a>,<a href=\"#media4\">4</a>; 'Materials and methods'; analysis code and example data available online). We encoded the predictability of the response, or <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>, with brightness so that brighter colors mean more significant correlations to behavior (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). These maps revealed the organization of behavioral tuning in both neurons and neuropil. Neurons linked to spontaneous swimming were located in diverse areas of the brain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013G</a>). Anatomical consistency of the functionally identified regions was evaluated using a nonlinear volume registration algorithm (<a href=\"#bib50\">Portugues et al., 2014</a>) that aligned seven brains based only on anatomy; this analysis revealed that, across fish, the most spatially conserved functionally defined cell clusters were in a region in the anterior hindbrain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This region is composed of two bilaterally symmetric clusters of cells on either side of the midline. In a previous study (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>), this area was identified by brain activity alone \u2013 without behavioral readout \u2013 and termed the hindbrain oscillator (HBO). The dynamics of these cells were tightly coupled to the direction of turning and highly antiphasic, such that the majority of the time, cells in only one hemisphere were active (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). The location and dynamics of these cells, which we call the anterior rhombencephalic turning region (ARTR), named according to its salient anatomical and functional properties, was additionally verified using two-photon imaging during fictive behavior (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We manually counted the numbers of neurons in the functional brain maps and found 60 \u00b1 7 neurons in each medial cluster and 33 \u00b1 2 neurons in each lateral cluster (mean \u00b1 SEM, 8 fish). To visualize the relationship between ARTR dynamics at the time of turns, we aligned the neuronal activity traces to individual turns that were followed by five seconds of no turns. At the time of a turn, the ipsilateral ARTR was activated, and after a rise in calcium signal over about 2\u00a0s, decayed to baseline slowly on a timescale of 5\u201310 s (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) The ARTR is more predictive of future turn direction than Rh4-6 cells. Since ARTR activity decays slowly, and the ARTR is able to bias turn direction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), it is expected that future turn direction can be predicted from ARTR activity. To assess this, mean left and right ARTR activity, and mean left and right Rh4-6 activity, both 1 s prior to a turn, were regressed against turn direction. Only turns with 3 s of no prior motor events were included to prevent trivial correlations. Predictive power was assessed by R<sup>2</sup> of the regression. The scatterplot of R<sup>2</sup> from the ARTR prediction and Rh4 prediction shows that the ARTR is a stronger predictor of future turn direction. (<b>C</b>) Temporal dynamics of the ARTR and Rh4-6 cells. Average fluorescence traces for ARTR (red) and Rh4-6 (blue) neurons triggered on turns in the ipsilateral (top) or contralateral (bottom) direction. The ARTR decays on a longer timescale following an ipsilateral turn. In addition, both the contralateral ARTR and the contralateral side of Rh4 neurons decrease in activity following an ipsilateral turn, with a slight delay compared to ipsilateral neuron activation. Only turns with a subsequent period of at least 10 s with no motor events were included to be able to observe the decay dynamics.

The strongest directional tuning was found in the ARTR, Rh4-6, and IO. Directly comparing the directional tuning of the ARTR and Rh4-6, however, revealed that the ARTR was more directionally tuned (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). In addition, the ARTR was more predictive of future turn direction (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). These observations suggest that the ARTR may be more involved in turn patterning. In addition, we compared the temporal dynamics of the ARTR and Rh4-6 and found that the ARTR had slower dynamics than Rh4-6 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), suggesting that the ARTR may be more involved in the slow dynamics of the behavior and Rh4-6 more in direct behavioral output. Further, while the IO was strongly directionally tuned, it projects only to the contralateral Cb (<a href=\"#bib18\">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bae et al., 2009</a>). While we did see directional tuning with flipped laterality in the Cb (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), this signal was only weakly tuned to behavior, and therefore, the IO-Cb circuit may be less directly related to turn patterns. These results led to the hypothesis that the ARTR might generate the slowly fluctuating bias in swimming direction."

To do this, we first functionally identified the ARTR at the single-cell level in each fish, using two-photon imaging and fast analyses of correlated activity patterns ('Materials and methods'). This enabled us to use targeted two-photon laser ablation to lesion one side of the ARTR while keeping the other side intact (19 \u00b1 6 cells [mean \u00b1 SD] in the medial cluster, i.e. about 32% of cells of one medial cluster; 'Materials and methods').

Since the overall turn bias contributes to the distribution of streak lengths, the bias of each model fish must be matched to that of each real fish. Thus, the direction of every turn in each model fish effectively results from a biased coin flip, with the bias matched to each corresponding real fish (e.g. 45% right turns and 55% left turns). Under the hypothesis that the ARTR contributes to temporal correlations in turn direction, the streak length distribution of a post-ablation real fish should be closer to that of its matched model fish than a pre-ablation real fish to its matched model fish. We found that this was indeed the case (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). Specifically, comparing the goodness-of-fit between the matched biased random walks and the observed turn sequences ('Materials and methods'), we found a significant reduction in the normalized root-mean-square error over fish after ablation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, p=0.027, paired signed rank test, N = 13 fish).

The strongly antiphasic activity patterns and the presence of excitatory and inhibitory clusters suggests underlying mutual inhibition, i.e. when one side of the ARTR is active, the other side is suppressed. To probe for such an architecture, we used a combination of calcium imaging and photoactivateable GFP (PA-GFP) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Patterson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ruta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Datta et al., 2008</a>). After functionally identifying the ARTR using a nuclear-localized calcium indicator (H2B-GCaMP6f), we photoactivated PA-GFP in a subset of ARTR cells and traced their projections. Indeed, tracing PA-GFP-activated neurites from the lateral GABAergic clusters revealed projections reaching across the midline toward both contralateral ARTR clusters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>). In contrast, we did not find evidence for neurites from the medial glutamatergic clusters crossing the midline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <i>bottom right</i>). Although these tracing studies cannot prove whether there exists synaptic connectivity between the ARTR clusters, they are suggestive of a mutually inhibitory circuit motif, which could mediate the antiphasic activation necessary for patterning directional motor output."

Photoactivation of the medial ARTR cluster revealed that while some labeled neurites terminated in the IO (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), projections also descended into the MLF and were visible adjacent to reticulospinal neurons RoV3 and RoM3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), of which RoV3 has been shown to be directionally tuned during the optomotor response (<a href=\"#bib48\">Orger et al., 2008</a>). Whether this projection represents a connection that would allow the ARTR to exert a turning bias through excitation of premotor neurons remains to be tested. We also looked at differences in temporal dynamics between ARTR activity and vSPN activity. We found that both sets of neurons were directionally tuned (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), but that the ARTR exhibited slower dynamics in the fluorescence signal than the vSPNs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>).

Because correlated directional locomotion results in a unique spatial pattern over time, we posited that it may reflect a baseline foraging strategy when external guiding cues are scarce. This idea is supported by engineering literature wherein chaotic oscillators driving autonomous agents (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tlelo-Cuautle and Ramos-L\u00f3pez, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mobus and Fisher, 1999</a>) produce winding trajectories that efficiently and evenly cover a space, without diffusing into faraway regions. Although the ARTR is probably not a chaotic oscillator, it does exhibit stochastic transitions between states. To study the properties of correlated trajectories produced by the ARTR, we constructed a simple phenomenological model to generate model fish trajectories, realizing that Markov models have often been used to study exploration strategies and transitions between behavioral states (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Codling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Korobkova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gallagher et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miller et al., 2005</a>). This two-state Markov model (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rabiner, 1989</a>), which stochastically switches between a 'left turn' state and a 'right turn' state but exhibits high probabilities of remaining in the same turn state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, 'Materials and methods'), produced behavior similar to that of real fish (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) based only on low-level parameters. Using this Markov model to simulate trajectories through virtual space (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), we show that such a scheme covers a restricted area more efficiently than a model fish turning left and right randomly without turn history dependence, and reduces diffusion into faraway regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). This strategy presents two distinct advantages. First, rapid spatial diffusion may lead the fish into unknown and potentially unsafe territories; this should be prevented. Second, given this preference to remain local, covering an area efficiently in the search for food cues represents an energetically favorable program that ensures no nearby resources have been missed. Thus, we speculate that the ARTR is part of a circuit that implements a foraging strategy that discourages travel into uncertain territory, instead favoring efficient and even exploration of the local environment."

Activity on one side of the ARTR biases turn direction by subthreshold excitation of reticulospinal neurons by the medial cluster of cells. When the fish turns in the direction where the ARTR is active, a motor copy feeds back on the ipsilateral ARTR and re-activates it, which also suppresses the contralateral ARTR through contralateral inhibition. Next, ARTR activity decays slowly, again biasing turns to the same direction. This scheme could generate sequences of turns in the same direction. Switches in turn direction might arise from spontaneous activity in the\u00a0ARTR population, from spontaneous or evoked input from neurons upstream of the ARTR, or when ARTR activity has decayed sufficiently so that it no longer exerts a bias on turning direction. To test this model, synaptic connections between ARTR clusters and between the ARTR and vSPNs need to be established, and ARTR activation and decay dynamics must be carefully characterized using electrophysiology. It should also be determined, for example with the aid of optogenetic silencing, whether the ARTR operates autonomously or whether it relies on interactions with other populations, such as cells in Rh4-6."

Lacking a priori hypotheses regarding the location of circuits governing a behavior, the near-complete coverage of this approach helps ensure that neurons with response properties of interest, if present, will likely be identified (depending on the sensitivity of the activity reporter [<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2013</a>] and the design of computational approaches [<a href=\"#bib27\">Freeman et al., 2014</a>]). Thus, while inputs to the identified neural populations certainly shape circuit activity, our measurements and analyses suggest that the identified cells are likely to be the primary set of neurons consistently involved in generating directional behavior. Of these neurons, we decided to causally interrogate the ARTR because of its strong stereotypy across fish, tight correlations to the slow switching structure of spontaneous behavior, and its pattern of projections to the premotor reticulospinal system. We identified, by ablation and stimulation, the ability of the ARTR to bias turning direction. The properties of the ARTR, including\u00a0its morphological projections, activation after a turn, ability to bias turns, and slow decay time, together with the change in the temporal structure of behavior following ARTR lesions, establishes the ARTR as an important candidate for the circuit generating temporal structure in spontaneous turn sequences. However, the\u00a0ARTR may also be part of a larger circuit performing this operation. The contribution of other functionally identified regions, which were mapped carefully across fish utilizing the Z-brain atlas, will be explored in future studies."

Here, we observed differences between the fictive behavior and freely swimming behavior, such as an approximately 1.4- to 2.4-fold difference in swim frequency, but these differences were modest enough for the essential properties of the behavior to persist, allowing the underlying signals to be analyzed. Since the length of behavioral sequences was similar when analyzed over number of swim bouts, it is possible that the time constant of the ARTR was slightly longer in the fictively behaving fish, potentially due to influences such as a lack of proprioceptive feedback. However, the persistent similarity of behavioral sequences and other behavioral kinematics (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4D,E</a>) between fictively and freely swimming fish suggests that the function of neural circuits underlying behavior remain largely intact under the microscope.

While the MLR has yet to be identified in the larval zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib58\">Severi et al., 2014</a>), the midbrain tegmental nMLF has been shown to\u00a0regulate swimming (<a href=\"#bib58\">Severi et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib65\">Thiele et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wang and McLean, 2014</a>).

Furthermore, motor-related signals were present, albeit weakly, in other areas including in the forebrain; it will be exciting to discover whether these areas, or even the ARTR itself, are homologous to structures known to be involved in motor control in other species but have not yet been located in the larval zebrafish. That being said, while we have reported a causal role of the ARTR in spontaneous swim patterns, we do not claim that the initial command for motion originates from the ARTR. Rather, we suggest that the ARTR exerts a bias on the direction of swim bouts initiated by other circuits. This view is supported data presented in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <i>bottom</i>, which shows that additional turns are not recruited by ARTR stimulation.

In principle, signals from other motor modalities as well as sensory systems could be integrated into ARTR activity fluctuations. In feature-poor environments, the ARTR system may interact with sensory systems in such a way that ARTR control of exploration is preserved but biased by the influence of weak sensory inputs. When stronger sensory cues are encountered, navigation systems purely driven by sensory stimulation may take over. For instance, all or part of the cell population may be involved in the optomotor response, as the ARTR responds to whole-field motion, and turns in the direction of motion persist after visual stimuli disappear (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In the context of phototaxis, navigational strategies have been observed in larval zebrafish that also exhibit strong temporal correlations in turning direction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen and Engert, 2014</a>), potentially involving the ARTR. Furthermore, preliminary observations show that eye movements (<a href=\"#bib45\">Miri et al., 2011</a>) and turning are correlated in larval zebrafish, and activity in the vicinity of the abducens and oculomotor nuclei is correlated to turning and ARTR activity (albeit much more weakly than the strength of correlation between the ARTR and turning, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Thus, it is possible that multiple motor patterns are represented in and coordinated by the ARTR.

Swim trajectories (fish center of mass over time) were first smoothed with a 400 ms Gaussian kernel (~40% inter-bout interval) with \u03c3 = 70 ms to reduce noise in recorded center of mass. Swim events were then marked at time points where instantaneous linear velocity crossed a threshold that minimized false positives and negatives. Because measurements of instantaneous velocity depend on spatial resolution and pixel noise, this threshold was adjusted for each type of recording: 3.3 mm/s for Pike camera experiments at 200 fps and 1.0 mm/s for Mikrotron camera experiments at 100 fps. For a subset of experiments (4/19 fish), fish position was recorded as the darkest point on the fish (i.e. one eye). Because this introduced an additive baseline velocity during swim events, a threshold of 4.5 mm/s was used for these experiments. Visual inspection of heading direction traces showed that each threshold yielded consistent turn classification. Turn angle was calculated as the change in heading angle during a swim bout, calculated as the difference between the heading angle 250 ms after and 250 ms before peak swim velocity."

The cumulative sum of signed turn sequences triggered on a switch in turn direction (that is, sequences of 1 and -1, with positive values representing turns in the same direction as the switch) were then averaged over all such sequences for a given fish. To determine the last turn from a triggered switch in direction that was reliably in the same direction as the first (i.e. the average length of a turn state), we looked for where the change in turn direction within a sequence across all fish was no longer significantly different from 0 (p&gt;=0.05, signed rank test), which corresponds to the expected value for a fish turning left and right randomly with or without a bias. This point can also be seen as the turn (from a switch) where the average cumulative angle plateaus. Streak length was defined as the number of turns executed in the same direction before a turn in the opposite direction.

(2012)</a> and the directional decoding strategy is as in <a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al. (2013)</a> with minor improvements. Larval zebrafish (5\u20137 dpf) were paralyzed by immersion in a drop of fish water with 1 mg/ml alpha-bungarotoxin (Sigma-Aldrich) and embedded in a drop of 2% low melting point agarose, after which the tail was freed by cutting away the agarose around it. Two suction pipettes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0of diameter 45 \u03bcm\u00a0\u2013\u00a0were placed on the tail of the fish at intersegmental boundaries, and gentle suction was applied until electrical contact with the motor neuron axons was made, usually after about 10 min. These electrodes allowed for the recording of multi-unit extracellular signals from clusters of motor neuron axons, and provided a readout of intended locomotion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Masino and Fetcho, 2005</a>). Extracellular signals were amplified with a Molecular Devices Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier and fed into a computer using a National Instruments data acquisition card. Custom software written in C# (Microsoft,\u00a0Redmond\u00a0WA) recorded the incoming signals. Fictive swim bouts were processed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">2013</a>), separately for the left and the right channels, so that the filtered signal consists of the standard deviation of the raw signal in 10 ms time bins. Subsequently, the channels were normalized by dividing the filtered signal by the average filtered signal amplitude during swim events, to account for different signal strengths that may arise from differences in the quality of the left and right recordings. Prior to averaging, each swim bout was weighted by a normalized rising exponential function, to take into account the fact that turns affect the start of swim bouts more heavily than the end of swim bouts, so that weighting the ends of swim bouts more heavily will reduce the effect of turning and lead to more robust normalization of the two channels. To determine fictive turn amplitude and distance, filtered left and right fictive signals at swim bouts were first weighed with a decaying exponential function (\u03c4 = [bout duration] / 3) to emphasize the initial bursts that determine overall turn direction. The power of the right channel was then subtracted from the power of the left channel to arrive at turn amplitude and direction, and the powers were summed to provide a measure of swim vigor or distance. We then analyzed turn history and streak length from these processed turn sequences, as outlined in <i>Spontaneous swimming experiments</i> above. For reconstructing the virtual swim trajectories, we assumed similar distributions of turn angles in the fictive and freely swimming cases, and thus converted the raw fictive turn amplitudes and directions to turn angles via normalization to an estimate of the maximum turn angle observed in freely swimming fish (150\u00b0, from the data used for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Virtual distance units were defined as the square root of the summed fictive power, which approximated the distribution of bout lengths observed in freely swimming fish. Together, these virtual turn and distance units were used to calculate a sequence of virtual fish positions before and after each fictive turn bout."

We verified that bilateral fictive recordings contain sufficient information for decoding turn direction using two complementary methods. First, using recordings from three points along the tail \u2013 two anterior electrodes and one posterior electrode \u2013 we verified that turns decoded from the two anterior electrodes showed an overlap between the initial burst on the anterior electrode the ipsilateral posterior electrode (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013F</a>). This is analogous to turning in freely swimming fish (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mirat et al., 2013</a>), where turns are characterized by a bend to one direction at overlapping time points along the length of the tail, whereas forward swims comprise a traveling wave along the tail with a phase offset between ipsilateral anterior and posterior tail bends. Second, we performed fictive recordings in weakly paralyzed fish that were still able to move their tails and found that fictive turn direction, as decoded only from the electrical recordings, generated a reliable classification of the direction of physical tail movement (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G\u2013K</a>; 4% discrepancy between physical and fictively decoded turn direction). We also verified that the fictive behavior did not contain struggles or Mauthner-mediated escapes (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Our data set also includes one\u00a0<i>Tg(elavl3:GCaMP5G)</i> fish (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>). Zebrafish larvae were embedded in a custom made chamber that allowed for electrical recordings of fictive swimming from the tail and access to light-sheet excitation laser beams from the lateral and frontal direction of the fish. The lateral beam was used to scan over the majority of the brain, while the frontal beam scanned over the region between the eyes that was inaccessible to the lateral beam, thus covering most of the brain at single-cell resolution. The detection objective was moved with a piezo so that the light sheets were always in the focal plane of the objective. Using this technique, the imaging rate was about 2 brain volumes/s (1.87 \u00b1 0.14 s), that\u00a0is every cell was imaged roughly every 0.5 s. Importantly, the lateral beam rapidly switched off whenever it was located inside a circular exclusion region around the eye, so that whole-brain imaging could be performed without directly shining the laser beams into the eye. Average laser power was set to the dimmest viable average power of 44 \u03bcW (66 \u03bcW with a sweep duty cycle of 67%) (below the range considered in ref. [<a href=\"#bib73\">Wolf et al., 2015</a>]), and red background illumination was provided to mimic the freely swimming light levels as well as provide a luminous environment to mask the blue laser. The red background illumination was provided to the fish by projecting homogeneous red light with a mini projector onto a screen underneath the fish (see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib69\">Vladimirov et al., 2014</a> for details). Each experiment lasted between 30 and 60 min and thus contained 3000\u20136000 whole-brain stacks."

We then developed a regression analysis to capture the extent to which neuronal responses were predicted by directionally specific behavior. First, two one-dimensional parameters were derived from the fictive swim signals: one capturing the instantaneous amplitude of swimming (strictly positive), and another capturing the instantaneous direction (positive for right, negative for left). We noted that, across many experiments, these two parameters tended to fall within the same region of a two-dimensional space (after normalizing amplitude to have a maximum of 1) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To compute neuronal tuning within this space, we expanded the instantaneous value of the two signals into a nonlinear basis; intuitively, this corresponds to dividing the two-dimensional space into several small wedges each corresponding to a range of directions and amplitudes. We used a polar basis, separably and evenly tiling amplitude (three bins) and angle (four bins). Each basis had a flat top and raised cosine transition region, with 50% overlap; see <a href=\"#bib60\">Simoncelli et al. (1992)</a> and <a href=\"#bib26\">Freeman et al. (2011)</a> for the parameterization of this basis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Freeman and Simoncelli, 2011</a>), which is more commonly used to tile the two-dimensional Fourier domain. With this basis, we represented instantaneous behavior with 12 predictor time series, each 1 x <i>T</i>, where <i>T</i> is the duration of an experiment. These predictors were each convolved with an impulse kernel <i>k</i> intended to reflect typical calcium dynamics; the kernel had a linear rise of 1 s and a linear decay of 5 s; variations of the kernel both in shape (e.g. exponential decay) and timing (0.5 s rise and 2 s decay) yielded qualitatively similar maps. Along with a constant offset term, this yielded a 13 x <i>T</i> predictor matrix <b>X</b>. We then used ordinary least squares regression to infer the best fitting coefficients <i>b</i>:"

Next, 10 to 20 ARTR neurons (19 \u00b1 6, mean \u00b1 SD, i.e. about 32% of the total number of neurons in the medial cluster) were selected from either the left or right medial cluster and ablated with a two-photon laser (850 nm, 120\u2013135 mW). During the exposure, the laser beam spiraled over a circle of 1 \u03bcm diameter. To improve the specificity of ablation, laser exposure was minimized (typically 0.1\u201310 s, depending on e.g. the expression level of the fluorophore in the neuron) by a feedback control system using custom software: large and sudden brightness increases, which indicate successful lesions, were detected automatically and used to terminate the laser exposure. We estimated by eye that in each experiment, no more than two neurons outside of the set of targeted neurons were unintentionally damaged. For the sham ablation group, 8\u201310 neurons in the vicinity of the ARTR, but not in the pool of neurons activated in synchrony with ARTR neurons, were chosen randomly, and these were ablated using the same procedure described above."

Due to a higher noise level and lower frame rate in these Pike recordings, swim trajectory was used to calculate turn angle, and a threshold of 0.17 radian per turn was applied (without threshold change in bias: p=0.006, signed rank test). In order to compare the streak distribution of each fish before and after ablation to a random distribution of streaks, we used the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) to assess goodness-of-fit. For each fish before and after ablation, we used the overall turn bias (# of left turns/# total turns) to generate a binary sequence of left and right turns equal in length to the number of recorded turns in the real data set. Individual turn identities in these sequences were determined by generating a random number between 0 and 1 and comparing its value to the overall turn bias. For instance, if the overall bias was 0.4, any random number less than or equal to 0.4 was called a left turn, and any random number greater than 0.4 was called a right turn.

Next, the pipette was advanced further into the ARTR, and test electrical pulses were delivered while ARTR activation was monitored with the two-photon microscope. The pipette was moved in the dorsal-ventral direction, rostral-caudal direction and further towards the midline until a point was reached where maximal ARTR activation to the test pulse was observed. The distance from the initial position at the edge of the ARTR was typically in the range of 20 \u03bcm and maximally 40 \u03bcm (note that the dorsal-ventral extent of the ARTR is about 80 \u03bcm). A brief electrical shock train (duration: 0.2\u20132 ms, inter-pulse-interval: 20\u201350 ms, number of pulses: 5\u201310, voltage 10\u201330 V) was delivered through the pipette to activate the ARTR neurons."

The fish were imaged under a two-photon microscope at 930 nm in the ARTR region. Several planes about 2 \u03bcm apart were imaged in order to find a plane where all four clusters of the ARTR were visible. The ARTR was functionally identified as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>. Individual cells of either the medial or lateral cluster were selected on one side of the brain. Cells were selected using custom written software and PA-GFP was activated at 780 nm (250 ms pulses, 10 cycles, 15 min apart for 2 hr). The fish were then released from the agarose, euthanized with an overdose of MS-222 (tricaine) and transferred to a dish containing 10mM EGTA in PBS for 1\u00a0hr. The fish were then fixed overnight in 4% PFA-PBS pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C. Fixed fish were then dissected to expose the brain and processed for immunohistochemistry using published protocols (<a href=\"#bib42\">McLean and Fetcho, 2004</a>). A primary antibody to GABA (1:400; Sigma A2052, St Louis, MO) was used to label GABA in neurons. At the end of the procedure, fish were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame\u00a0CA) and imaged on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope using a 20x or 40x objective."

The authors present convincing evidence that two bilateral clusters of neurons in the anterior rhombencephalon (ARTR) are asymmetrically active during runs of same direction turns. In a uniformly lit clueless arena, free-swimming larvae tend to make runs of turns in the same direction and switch stochastically to runs of turns in the opposite direction. Such turning bias can be observed in fictive swim preparations. Ipsilateral neuron clusters in the ARTR are coactive with runs of turns to the same side. One of the clusters is shown to be GABAergic and the other glutamatergic. The GABAergic cluster projects contralaterally and is hypothesized to set up mutual inhibition between bilateral clusters. A minimal network model based on positive feedback to the ipsilateral cluster when a turn is made that decays slowly and mutual inhibition across the midline can reproduce the observed switching turn bias. A two state Markov model based on this minimal model can reproduce behavioral tracks."

In this regard the authors may want to eliminate the modeling, holding it back for a future Research Advance paper.

We agree that our submission contained both a characterization of neural populations involved in driving turning behavior, and an interpretative part, embodied by a semi-mechanistic model, that was more speculative. The editor and reviewers suggested to focus on the former part and phrase the results more as a demonstration of the capabilities of the experimental and analytical system in uncovering populations involved in turning. It was also suggested that we spend more time on testing the validity of the model for a follow-up publication, which we plan to do. We have therefore removed the reduced network model from the manuscript, and recast the narrative and discussion concerning the relationship between the ARTR and temporal correlations in turn sequences as a hypothesis that still needs to be tested."

When taking this number into account, the effect of the ablation and stimulation experiments is actually not so small. When about 32% of medial-cluster cells are ablated (about 19 out of about 60), turning shifts to the opposite direction by about 18%, and when similar numbers of cells are stimulated (an area with 15-20 cells), turning increases by about 29%. It also appears we caused confusion about claiming sufficiency and necessity \u2013 we phrased it as \u201csuggesting\u201d sufficiency and necessity, but agree that using these words is confusing. We now simply say that the ARTR is able to bias turn direction, which we believe is strongly supported by the ablation and stimulation experiments. We are not sure we understand why ablation of the lateral cluster should have a bigger effect than ablation of the medial cluster, but we agree this is an important experiment to do.

Regarding the explanation in the Discussion, we have now removed this, as well as the related paragraph that followed.

Thus we were able to interpret the fictive as directional turns with high reliability. We applied 9 different decoding strategies and checked which ones separated behavioral events elicited by left- and rightward moving gratings the best. We found that a weighted difference of summed power was the most reliable (decoder #7 in panel A of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> of the Frontiers paper). On the other hand, the relative difference in the width of the first burst (decoder #1) was less reliable, most likely because this measure is less robust to noise in the data. Of course we did observe that the width of the first burst on the side of the turn was wider, but measurement of this quantity was noisier than that used by decoder #7"
