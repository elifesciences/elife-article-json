In a virus, a life history strategy is largely manifested in its replication mode. Here, we develop a stochastic mathematical model to infer the replication mode shaping the structure and mutation distribution of a poliovirus population in an intact single infected cell. We measure production of RNA and poliovirus particles through the infection cycle, and use these data to infer the parameters of our model. We find that on average the viral progeny produced from each cell are approximately five generations removed from the infecting virus. Multiple generations within a single cell infection provide opportunities for significant accumulation of mutations per viral genome and for intracellular selection."

In a virus, a life history strategy is largely manifested in its replication mode. Here, we develop a stochastic mathematical model to infer the replication mode shaping the structure and mutation distribution of a poliovirus population in an intact single infected cell. We measure production of RNA and poliovirus particles through the infection cycle, and use these data to infer the parameters of our model. We find that on average the viral progeny produced from each cell are approximately five generations removed from the infecting virus. Multiple generations within a single cell infection provide opportunities for significant accumulation of mutations per viral genome and for intracellular selection."

Schulte, Draghi et al. used mathematical modeling to create computer simulations of the number of polioviruses in a cell that take into account these time and space constraints. By including random elements in the model, the simulated behavior more accurately follows experimentally recorded data than previously used models."

This means that in a single infected cell there are multiple generations of RNA, and each generation may undergo distinct mutations that are passed on to the next set of RNA copies. In fact, Schulte, Draghi et al. found that the average virus released from an infected cell is the great-great-great-granddaughter of the original virus that infected the cell. With so many different generations of virus coexisting in a cell, there are a lot of opportunities for new genetic combinations to occur and for viruses to evolve new abilities."

They replicate quickly and have extremely high mutation rates, orders of magnitude greater than those of most DNA-based life forms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Drake, 1993</a>). While this combination of traits creates the potential for rapid adaptation, it necessitates a life history strategy that balances the need for explosive, exponential growth with the requirement to maintain genomic integrity. The life history strategies of viruses are largely reflected by their mode of intracellular replication. Two classic replication modes have been described for single-stranded RNA viruses: the \u2018stamping machine\u2019 mode (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stent, 1963</a>) and the \u2018geometric replication\u2019 mode (<a href=\"#bib29\">Luria, 1951</a>). In the stamping machine mode (SM), templates made from the original infecting genomes are used for the production of all progeny genomes. In the geometric replication mode (GR), newly made progeny genomes are used to create further templates for additional rounds of replication within a single cellular infection cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Progeny produced from stamping machine replication are all a single generation away from the parental strand whereas progeny generated from geometric growth represent a distribution of generations from the parental strand, often resulting in a fractional mean number of generations (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The iterative nature of GR creates branched genealogies that allow for expansive exploration of sequence space and results in a mutation distribution that differs from the SM mode (<a href=\"#bib29\">Luria, 1951</a>). Recent studies with population-genetic models (<a href=\"#bib13\">Draghi et al., 2010</a>) and RNA enzyme populations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>) have shown that differences in the distribution of mutants can significantly impact the adaptability of a population. Recent studies with poliovirus (PV) have also demonstrated that mutational differences within a population can have dramatic effects on pathogenicity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</a>) as well as fitness, virulence, and robustness (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lauring et al., 2012</a>)."

However, despite decades of mechanistic studies and recent revelations of the importance of population structures, the replication mode and resulting mutation distribution have yet to be determined. PV therefore proves an excellent candidate for the rigorous construction of a computational model of virus replication to predict population structure and mutation distribution. A major feature of PV intracellular dynamics is that the genome participates in multiple reactions: translation, replication, and encapsidation. Its 7.5 kb genome contains a single open reading frame, which encodes 7 nonstructural proteins and 4 capsid proteins. Translation produces a single polyprotein, which is cleaved into individual functional viral proteins. Replication of the positive-sense genome by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase produces a negative-sense strand, which is used as a template for further genome synthesis. Evidence suggests that the initial, infecting positive-sense genomes must be translated before they can replicate (<a href=\"#bib31\">Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994</a>). The switch from translation to replication appears to be dependent on the concentration of a viral protein product, 3CD, which stimulates a transition from a linear, translating RNA to a noncovalently associated \u2018circular\u2019 RNA competent for replication (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gamarnik and Andino, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Herold and Andino, 2001</a>). Encapsidation is thought to result from protein\u2013protein associations of capsid pentamers with the RNA replication machinery and protein\u2013RNA association of capsid pentamers with viral RNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pfister et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nugent and Kirkegaard, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). Actively replicating genomes are preferentially encapsidated and packaging is biased to exclude negative-sense strands, although the mechanism of this is not understood (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nugent et al., 1999</a>). Although multiple ribosomes can translate a genome at the same time and multiple viral polymerases can replicate a genome at the same time, the processes are mutually exclusive (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gamarnik and Andino, 1998</a>). Similarly, neither translation nor replication can occur after a genome is packaged into a virion."

These studies have raised mechanistic and evolutionary questions about the life cycle of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, but most have not produced models that can be directly compared to data. Several previous models are deterministic in nature (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krakauer and Komarova, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Regoes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Martinez et al., 2011</a>) and assume a well-mixed, spatially uniform cellular environment (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krakauer and Komarova, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Regoes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sardany\u00e9s et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Th\u00e9baud et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Martinez et al., 2011</a>). Experimental evidence suggests that each of these assumptions is problematic and do not reflect the biological constraints and properties of viral replication. The small numbers of the critical molecules that initiate an infection suggest that a stochastic model would more accurately describe early reactions and could make distinct predictions from previous deterministic approaches (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastavawz et al., 2002</a>). Often infections begin with relatively few virions that release their genomes into the cell and continue with the translation of these few initial genomes. Random variation in the switch from translation to replication is amplified by the subsequent exponential phase of the infection, and this amplification is likely to bias the mean dynamics of a set of infections. Indeed, recent single-cell studies demonstrated the significant impact of stochastic effects on poliovirus infections (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schulte and Andino, 2014</a>)."

The role of each parameter in poliovirus replication and in the mathematics of our model are diagrammed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and described in detail in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. We chose to use measurements of positive- and negative-sense RNA at multiple time points for three multiplicities of infection (1, 10, and 100), as well as measurements of virion numbers at multiple times for MOI 10; this amounted to 27 measured means, with three data points for each mean. Strand-specific qRT-PCR was performed to quantify positive-sense and negative-sense poliovirus RNA against in vitro transcribed standard RNAs of each sense (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burrill et al., 2013</a>). Along with cell counts, this allowed for temporal measurements of the average positive-sense and negative-sense poliovirus RNA copies per cell. Negative-sense RNA was not detectable until 2 hr post infection for MOIs 10 and 100 and 3 hr post infection for MOI 1. Positive-sense RNA was clearly quantifiable for all time points at the MOI 10 and 100 but did not rise above background levels until 3 hr post infection for MOI 1. Using a newly developed virion immunoprecipitation assay (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burrill et al., 2013</a>), we observed de novo virion assembly between 2 hr and 3 hr post infection. Along with total positive-sense RNA measurements from this time course, we obtained a percentage of genomes encapsidated in quadruplicate at 3 hr, 4 hr, and 5 hr post infection. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> illustrates this data alongside projections from inferred parameters from the second round of SMC (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>)."

First, we measured the mean error of parameter sets when compared to the data for each multiplicity of infection independently; we asked if performance at one MOI predicted performance at the other two.

Surprisingly, pairwise correlations between mean error at one MOI and another were very weak: Spearman's rho is 0.031 for MOIs 1 and 10, \u22120.092 for MOIs 1 and 100, and 0.129 for MOIs 10 and 100.

Variability among replicate sets of twenty single-cell simulations is substantial, correlated across a time series, and greatest for the smallest MOI. Further inferential effort could improve either the accuracy of the mean predicted dynamics or the precision of replicate simulation dynamics, though <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> suggests that such improvements could only be modest. This variability is expected due to the stochastic nature of the simulations, and it may better reflect the biological noise of the infection (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schulte and Andino, 2014</a>)."

Due to the complex nature of intracellular dynamics, assessing the mode of replication of viruses is a difficult task (but see <a href=\"#bib8\">Chao et al., 2002</a>). Here, we built on decades of mechanistic studies and recent modeling efforts to construct a stochastic computational model coupled with new Bayesian inference methods. We combined these mathematical and computational techniques with accurate temporal data to produce a detailed picture of viral infection. We found that positive- and negative-sense RNA measurements made across multiple MOIs, along with quantitative data on virion packaging, are sufficient to infer that poliovirus replication occurs in several layers of intermediate replication, in contrast to the oft-assumed \u2018stamping machine\u2019 model. The implications of the inferred geometric replication mode are as follows: (1) error rates per-replication are considerably lower than measured rates from full-replication-cycle in vivo studies, (2) for a given viral polymerase error rate, mutation will progressively accumulate in both genome and anti-genome RNAs, which should result in a more accentuated departure from the master sequence, allowing a better exploration of the available sequence space during a single infection cycle, and (3) there exists a significant potential for intracellular selection and competition among related genomes, even in infections initiated by only a single genome."

While estimates of mutation rates exist for nearly two dozen viruses, estimates of replication modes exist for only a few (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sanjuan et al., 2010</a>). Calculating per-replication event mutation rates from observed mutant frequencies is not possible, or even meaningful, without knowledge of the replication mode. Thus, estimates of poliovirus per-replication event mutation rates can vary over 10-fold depending on the assumed replication mode (<a href=\"#bib14\">Drake, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sanjuan et al., 2010</a>). By inferring the mode of replication, we have been able to link estimates of per-replication event mutation rates to published mutant frequencies. The most extensive poliovirus mutant frequency data set estimated an average mutant frequency of 2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acevedo et al., 2014</a>). Using our inferred value of approximately five intracellular generations, we calculate a per-replication event mutation rate of 2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>/5 \u00d7 2 = 2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, which is in agreement with the average estimates of poliovirus mutation rates calculated in vivo from lethal mutation frequencies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acevedo et al., 2014</a>). Rates of specific types of mutations, such as transversions and transitions, could each be inferred from their mutation frequencies by the same approach. Our inference of five intracellular generations is also in line with previous inferences of replication mode using the Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test null-class method (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sanjuan et al., 2010</a>). However, our results highlight some limitations for inferring mutation rates from frequencies: intracellular selection may strongly affect mutation frequencies, and the strong stochastic nature of virus replication appears to deeply modulate minor allele distribution, which in turn will result in imprecise estimates of the expected frequency. In particular, assuming that mutation frequency can be modeled as a Poisson process will lead to inappropriate confidence in measured frequencies. As a consequence, multiple empirical mutation frequencies measurements will be required to obtain a more precise determination of true mutation frequencies."

On the other hand, a mutational event that occurred early in replication and conveyed an intracellular replication advantage could potentially give rise to hundreds or thousands of descendant virions in a single generation. If the mutation distribution data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> were displayed as a tree (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), it would contain over 7000 terminal nodes, too many to resolve in a figure. Hence, the apparent potential for mutant interactions is vast. These results suggest that the evolutionary fate of mutations may depend strongly on their intracellular competitive ability, even when multiplicities of infection are low. Additionally, studies that rely on bottlenecks to reduce selection in viral mutation studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib11\">de la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2000</a>) may be allowing more selection than anticipated. Future population dynamics studies should consider the implications of the intracellular expansion of mutant phenotypes."

While <a href=\"#bib31\">Novak and Kirkegaard (1994)</a> demonstrate a requirement of the initial, infecting genomes to be translated before replication can occur, their data did not implicate that all genomes produced at any time during infection must be translated before replicating. Our study suggests that newly synthesized positive-sense genomes may or may not disperse to nucleate new replication complexes within a single cellular infection, allowing us to model intracellular dynamics in a novel way by permitting a portion of newly made positive-sense strands to immediately act as templates for replication without the requirement of translation."

More quantitative data, including data on the formation and number of replication compartments, would further inform the model.

The ultimate goal is to generate a comprehensive model incorporating mechanistic replication dynamics learned from virology with selection and complementation dynamics learned from population genetics.

We assume that positive-sense genomes that remain in the complex are immediately competent for replication. We were unable to fit the sharp transition to exponential growth seen in our strand measurement data without allowing for this third option. Allowing newly synthesized positive-sense genomes to remain in the complex and act immediately as replication templates is consistent with previous reports indicating a coupling between translation and replication as we still require initial, infecting genomes to be translated before transitioning to replication (<a href=\"#bib31\">Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994</a>).

To account for the evidence that deficiencies in capsid proteins can be complemented in <i>trans</i>, we allowed capsid proteins to diffuse freely throughout the cell.

This method consists of several rounds of parameter selection which form successively better approximations of the posterior distribution. In each round x, a population of size n<sub>x</sub> parameters sets is generated iteratively by choosing a parameter set from the preceding round x \u2212 1, perturbing its values, then accepting or discarding the new parameter set based on the distance of its measured summary statistic from the summary statistic representing the data. Parameter sets with distances less than \u03b5<sub>x</sub> are accepted; a diminishing series of thresholds, \u03b5<sub>1</sub> &gt; \u03b5<sub>2</sub> &gt; \u03b5<sub>3</sub>, etc, progressively focuses the search on those parameter values that best match the data.

In practice, we identified a trade-off based on the scaling of these perturbations; smaller perturbations lead to increased acceptance rates but more positively skewed importance weights; because the weighting of each accepted parameter set is normalized relative to the highest observed importance weight, this strong skew effectively dilutes the inferential power of the analysis. We found that using the standard deviation of each parameter as the standard deviation for the perturbation balanced this trade-off adequately for our model: the weights of the 1135 sampled parameter sets had an entropy of 10.01 bits, compared to a maximal value of 10.15 bits. This high entropy confirms that any remaining skew in the importance weights does not severely diminish the effective sample size."

This last decision turned out to be crucial; inferring based on the mean of a larger number of replicates (n \u2265 1000) tended to select parameter sets with highly variable behavior. Reducing <i>n</i> led to a higher rate of parameter set rejection but more biologically plausible dynamics. A simple explanation for this pattern is that a number of parameter sets produce acceptable mean behavior, but differ in the degree of stochastic variation around that mean in a way that does not reflect measured stochastic variation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schulte and Andino, 2014</a>). We therefore chose to accept parameter sets that passed a given \u03b5 for multiple, sequential sets of <i>n</i> replicates. For round 1, one thousand parameters sets were accepted based on five sets of <i>n</i> = 20 replicates at MOI = 10 only with \u03b5 = 12. For round 2, 1135 parameters sets were accepted based on five sets of <i>n</i> = 20 replicates at MOI = 1 with \u03b5 = 16, five sets of <i>n</i> = 20 replicates at MOI = 10 with \u03b5 = 12, and five sets of <i>n</i> = 20 replicates at MOI = 100 with \u03b5 = 7.

These results are plotted as 1/(1 + mean error) to show an intuitive goodness-of-fit measure, where high values indicate similarity to the data. <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a> shows that the \u2018best\u2019 parameter set is at or near a local maximum for goodness-of-fit for eight of ten parameters; the effects of the remaining two parameters, c<sub>pack</sub> and com<sub>max</sub>, appear to be minimal for this parameter set. These results suggest that convergence of the posterior distributions is linked to the sensitivity of the model to each parameter, which supports the effectiveness of the ABC algorithm."

The model fits data best with a geometric increase of RNA (no surprise) with about 5 generations occurring intracellularlly (before cell death?). The large number (ten or so) of parameters were explored by an Approximation Bayesian Computation method, not all were independent, and some having no major impact. While I cannot comment on the math, most of the assumptions of the model seem plausible and the predictions seem to fit the limited data. The model then is used to predict the distribution of mutations, with good correspondence to data."

Also very helpful would be a summary table listing the various parameters and the steps they refer to. Overall, the reader needs to have a clearer vision of the replication cycle than is accessible from the introductory material here. As another example, the description of the necessity for \u201ccircularization\u201d of the RNA, and the drawing in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, leave the non-expert reader with the strong impression that the circles referred to are covalently bound RNA-only structures, rather than RNA-protein complexes, as the authors have nicely shown in previous work."

The use of different notation here made reading more difficult, for sure. Second, the use of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to mutations seems oversimplified and inaccurate, because the kinetics of accumulation of different types of mutants will depend very strongly on how and where they act, whether in cis or trans to the genome, whether they affect one protein (e.g. missense mutations) or others (nonsense mutations), etc. If and how the authors included these issues in their simulations is not made clear.

One would think that the larger scale dynamics of the virus are determined by the cells producing more viruses, in particular, in a geometric growth model</i>."

The use of different notation here made reading more difficult, for sure. Second, the use of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to mutations seems oversimplified and inaccurate, because the kinetics of accumulation of different types of mutants will depend very strongly on how and where they act, whether in cis or trans to the genome, whether they affect one protein (e.g. missense mutations) or others (nonsense mutations), etc. If and how the authors included these issues in their simulations is not made clear.
