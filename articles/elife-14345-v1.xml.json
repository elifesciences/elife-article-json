Like in other multi-cellular organisms, the hypoxic response in <i>C.\u00a0elegans</i> begins with the inhibition of the oxygen sensor EGL-9. This sensor adds hydroxyl groups to proteins that contain the amino acid proline, so when it is inhibited, a transcription factor called HIF-\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor \u03b1) is less likely to be hydroxylated. This, in turn, increases the expression of the genes necessary for adapting to a low-oxygen environment."

However, when they encounter a persistent low-oxygen environment, the frequency with which the nematodes reverse direction is reduced. As a result, the random walk is replaced with a roaming form of motion that allows the nematodes to escape from the low-oxygen environment. This response requires a variant of the EGL-9\u2009oxygen sensor, called EGL-9E, but it does not require HIF-\u03b1. The neurons that control locomotion in <i>C. elegans</i> contain a receptor protein called GLR-1\u2009at their synapses. To sustain the random walk behavior, GLR-1\u2009recycling and trafficking to the synaptic region must be maintained."

Hypoxia, on one hand, inhibits the phosphorylation of EGL-9\u2009by a p38\u2009MAP kinase, thus inhibiting the oxygen sensor and triggering the pathway by which HIF-\u03b1 increases gene expression. On the other hand, inhibiting p38\u2009MAP kinase initiates roaming-like behavior in the worms because it interferes with the trafficking and recycling of GLR-1. Park and Rongo also show that p38\u2009MAP kinase activity declines with age even when plenty of oxygen is available, which impairs GLR-1\u2009recycling."

This stabilizes the transcription factor HIF-\u03b1, which promotes the expression of several genes that help the nematode to adapt to hypoxic conditions. Right: Inhibiting p38 MAP kinase also inhibits EGL-9E (which is an isoform of EGL-9). This causes EGL-9E to dephosphorylate and dissociate from a scaffold protein, which ultimately prevents the recycling of GLR-1 at the synapses of the neurons that control locomotion. The end result is that the worm starts to roam, rather than performing a random walk, which increases its chances of escaping from a hypoxic region."

The work of Park and Rongo now suggests that when hypoxia lasts for minutes or hours, varied responses are orchestrated by the EGL-9\u2009oxygen sensor working in concert with different downstream effector molecules. Furthermore, this longer-lasting hypoxia primarily affects the phosphorylation of EGL-9E by p38\u2009MAP kinase. However, the mechanism by which sustained hypoxia affects p38\u2009MAP kinase activity is an open question: does sustained hypoxia directly affect protein thiol groups, which are sensitive to oxidation? Or does it have an indirect effect whereby the generation of reactive oxygen species impacts kinase activity?"
