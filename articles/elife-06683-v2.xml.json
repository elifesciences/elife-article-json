Here we show that neuropeptides could regulate feeding in mutants that lack neurotransmission from the motor neurons that stimulate feeding muscles. We identified <i>nlp-24</i> by an RNAi screen of 115 neuropeptide genes, testing whether they affected growth. NLP-24 peptides have a conserved YGGXX sequence, similar to mammalian opioid neuropeptides. In addition, morphine and naloxone respectively stimulated and inhibited feeding in starved worms, but not in worms lacking NPR-17, which encodes a protein with sequence similarity to opioid receptors. Opioid agonists activated heterologously expressed NPR-17, as did at least one NLP-24 peptide. Worms lacking the ASI neurons, which express <i>npr-17</i>, did not response to naloxone. Thus, we suggest that <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> has an endogenous opioid system that acts through NPR-17, and that opioids regulate feeding via ASI neurons. Together, these results suggest <i>C. elegan</i>s may be the first genetically tractable invertebrate opioid model."

These receptors can also bind to similar molecules called opiates (such as morphine); opiates are amongst the oldest drugs used by humans and have diverse effects ranging from pain relief to addiction. While the activities of opiates and opioid neuropeptides have been studied in mammals, relatively little is known about opioid signaling in simpler animals."

The feeding behavior of <i>C. elegans</i> is no exception. This worm feeds by contracting and relaxing its pharyngeal muscle to move food into its gut. When the worms sense that food is available, this \u2018pharyngeal pumping\u2019 is regulated by one type of nerve cell. Slow pharyngeal pumping also continues in starved worms when food is not available, possibly to encourage them to eat new potential sources of food. However, this slow pumping does not require the same type of nerve cell."

The experiments uncovered a molecule called NLP-24 that promotes the slow pharyngeal pumping. This molecule is similar to opioid neuropeptides found in mammals. Worms that made less NLP-24 than normal grew more slowly; this suggests that they had problems feeding. Moreover, the levels of NLP-24 were found to increase in normal worms soon after they were deprived of food. Further experiments revealed the identity of the receptor for this molecule, which is also similar to mammalian opioid receptors."

Galanin is a peptide that stimulates feeding in satiated rats after intraventricular or intrahypothalamic injection. Opioids are also involved in controlling food intake, and they have many other biological effects (e.g., analgesia, drug addiction, and immune response). For example, the opioid agonist morphine increases food intake in mammals while the opioid blocker, naloxone, significantly decreases food intake (<a href=\"#bib52\">Martin et al., 1963</a>)."

Enkephalins, dynorphins, and \u03b2-endorphin peptides are produced by proteolytic cleavage of large protein precursors known as preproenkephalin, preprodynorphin, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC), respectively. These peptides form the opioid family. All opioid peptides share a common N-terminal YGGF signature sequence, which interacts with opioid receptors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Holtzman, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akil et al., 1998</a>). Many researchers have shown that the opilioid system modulates food intake. \u03b2-endorphin stimulates food intake when administrated directly into the VMH (ventromedial hypothalamus) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Grandison and Guidotti, 1977</a>). Selective agonists for the \u03bc receptor (DAMGO), the \u03b4 receptor (DADLE), and the \u03ba receptor (U50448) also increase food intake (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tepperman and Hirst, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gosnell et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Jackson and Cooper, 1986</a>). Furthermore, \u03b2-endorphin levels are associated with overeating in genetically obese mice and <i>fa/fa</i> rats (<a href=\"#bib51\">Margules et al., 1978</a>). There is abundant pharmacological evidence that the opioid system is present and controls feeding in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harrison et al., 1994</a>). A simple invertebrate model system would be a useful starting point for understanding more complex ones. Furthermore, it might shed light on the evolutionary origin of the opioid system. However, no opioid system has yet been molecularly identified in invertebrates."

However, the functions of most neuropeptides remain unknown. Here we show that, like humans, <i>C. elegans</i> has opioid peptide signals that regulate feeding. We found that morphine and naloxone, respectively, stimulate and inhibit feeding in starved wild-type worms, but not in worms lacking the G-protein coupled receptor NPR-17. Our genetic screens identified NLP-24-derived peptides as possible endogenous opioid ligands on which feeding motions that occur in the absence of food may depend and NPR-17 as the opioid receptor on which they act. To our knowledge this is the first genetically tractable invertebrate opioid model."

The food stimulates the MC neuron, which fires at the beginning of each pump, triggering a muscle action potential that makes the muscle contract. But a starved worm continually pumps at a low rate even in the absence of food. This pumping does not require MC neurons. This MC-independent pumping makes worms viable without MC, although they pump slowly, grow slowly, and are small and pale. We were curious how worms continue to pump without MC."

Comparing the sequence of NLP-24 peptides with that of human neuropeptides, we noted that the YGGY sequences are similar to the conserved YGGF sequence motif of endogenous opioids in humans (<a href=\"#bib67\">Snyder and Pasternak, 2003</a>). Thus we hypothesize that <i>nlp-24</i> potentially encodes endogenous opioids in <i>C. elegans</i>. Although no <i>C. elegans</i> opioid signaling system has been reported, a study identified NPR-17, a G protein coupled receptor, as most closely related to a predicted <i>Brugia malayi</i> ORL1 opioid receptor-like protein with 68% identity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harris et al., 2010</a>). They found that <i>nlp-3</i>, a neuropeptide gene, and <i>npr-17</i> regulated avoidance behavior, suggesting NLP-3 and NPR-17 together could mediate a signal to control pain in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harris et al., 2010</a>). In BLAST searches, we verified their finding further; NPR-17 is similar to human nociceptin receptor (28% identity), MOR (23% identity), DOR (23% identity) and to the KOR (24% identity) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

First, we treated starved wild type and <i>npr-17</i> mutants with opioid agonist morphine and blocker naloxone and measured the pumping rate. As predicted, morphine stimulated pumping whereas naloxone suppressed pumping in wild type. Drugs get into intact worms inefficiently, both because the wild-type cuticle is poorly permeable (<a href=\"#bib60\">Partridge et al., 2008</a>) and because foreign chemicals are actively pumped out (<a href=\"#bib14\">Broeks et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ardelli and Prichard, 2013</a>). For instance, although 1 \u03bcM serotonin maximally stimulates pumping in dissected pharynxes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Niacaris and Avery, 2003</a>), roughly 10 mM is necessary to produce similar effects in intact animals (<a href=\"#bib39\">Horvitz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hobson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Raizen et al., 2012</a>). Thus we were not surprised that high concentrations of morphine (0.5 mM) and naloxone (10 mM) were necessary to produce these effects. Specificity was demonstrated by the observation that these effects were completely abolished by <i>npr-17</i> mutations, showing that NPR-17 mediated the effects, suggesting it could be an opioid receptor in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). We tested two different alleles (<i>tm3210</i> and <i>tm3225</i>) of <i>npr-17</i> and both alleles gave the same results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together these results indicate that opioids stimulate <i>C. elegans</i> pumping and that NPR-17 might be a worm opioid receptor."

Because the pumping rate regulated by <i>nlp-24</i> is also food-related and the receptor NPR-17 is known to be expressed in ASI, we tested whether ASI neurons are important for opioid signaling. When we treated worms whose ASI neurons were genetically ablated with naloxone, there was no naloxone-induced reduction in pumping (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Thus the opioid blocker controlled pumping through ASI neurons. Next, to examine whether ASI neurons are the site of action of NPR-17, we expressed it in ASI using the ASI specific promoter, <i>gpa-4</i>. Expression of NPR-17 only in the ASI neurons completely restored the pumping reduction induced by naloxone treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>npr-17</i> is also expressed in intestine. We therefore also tested the effect of naloxone on worms engineered to express NPR-17 only in the intestine (using the <i>ges-1</i> promoter).

In the absence of drug, <i>npr-17</i> mutants pumped at the same rate as wild type, while they pumped faster than wild-type worms in the presence of naloxone. This would suggest that naloxone is an agonist rather than a blocker, but this is inconsistent with the known effect of naloxone of opioid receptors, as well as the measured effect on heterologously expressed NPR-17 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). An alternate hypothesis is that <i>npr-17</i> worms, having lacked the receptor all their lives, had adapted to its absence. One of these adaptations was an increase in the basal pumping rate. In wild-type worms, in contrast, NPR-17 had always been around supporting basal pumping. When we suddenly removed this support by adding naloxone, the pumping rate went down. This hypothesis predicts that the chronic effects of naloxone on wild type should resemble those of the mutation. We thus grew wild-type worms to adulthood on naloxone, then measured the pumping rate after starvation either with or without naloxone. As predicted, wild-type worms grown and tested in the presence of naloxone pumped at the same rate as worms grown and tested without (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Furthermore, after chronic naloxone treatment worms tested in its absence showed a withdrawal effect: they pumped slightly faster. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in vivo as in vitro, naloxone acts as an NPR-17 blocker."

This suggests that NLP-24 peptides may be secreted by and act on ASI neurons in an autocrine manner. We also suspect that NLP-24 is secreted by other cells and acts hormonally on ASI neurons, because, NLP-24::GFP expression is increased in intestine after starvation (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). An NLP-24::mCherry fusion protein accumulates in coelomocytes (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), specialized cells for endocytosis and degradation of secreted proteins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fares and Grant, 2002</a>), which have been found to accumulate other secreted peptide signals (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sieburth et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lee and Ashrafi, 2008</a>).

But what is the purpose of pumping in the absence of food? Following a suggestion by David Raizen (personal communication), we suggest that this pumping helps worms discover food in the environment, even when their external senses are unable to reliably detect it. According to this hypothesis, opioids help worms survive starvation by increasing the probability of catching food. In essence, food-independent pumping is (or facilitates) exploration. This is consistent with the finding that in many animals, including <i>C. elegans</i>, starvation increases exploration (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dallman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Torres et al., 2002</a>)."

Our results confirm previous indications that opioids have a long evolutionary history. Several researchers have found evidence that the opioid system might exist in invertebrates: peptides encoding opioids or opioid receptors were detected, and drugs such as naloxone that act on opioid receptors induced biological responses (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harrison et al., 1994</a>). We confirm these results in <i>C. elegans</i> and add a crucial control: a mutant lacking the receptor fails to respond. Furthermore, like vertebrate opioids, worm opioids have a role in feeding behavior. <i>nlp-24</i> encodes endogenous opioids and <i>npr-17</i> an opioid receptor, and together they act to regulate feeding behavior. Opioids also participate in the immune system and pain mechanisms in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib53\">McCarthy et al., 2001</a>). <i>nlp-24</i> and <i>npr-17</i> may have related functions in <i>C. elegans</i>. <i>nlp-24</i> expression is down regulated by a pathogenic bacterium, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and a fungus, <i>Drechmeria coniospora</i> (<a href=\"#bib72\">Troemel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pujol et al., 2008</a>). <i>npr-17</i> mediates ASH-mediated aversive behavior (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harris et al., 2010</a>), a <i>C. elegans</i> model for pain."

Likewise, food deprivation and feeding changes endogenous opioid activity in mammals. In rats, food deprivation induces complex changes in the level of brain endogenous opioids, especially in the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib73\">Vaswani and Tejwani, 1986</a>). In addition, opioid signaling may be involved in altering the hedonic taste/palatability of food in mammals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bodnar, 2004</a>)."

In a well-fed worm, pumping depends on MC motor neurons, which are active only in the presence of food. But opioids modulated pumping independent of MC neurons: naloxone decreased pumping in <i>eat-2</i> mutants, which lack MC neuromuscular transmission (<a href=\"#bib54\">McKay et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We speculate that, like a baby whose first response to any new object is to put it in its mouth, the worm cannot be sure if there is food around without taking some in. A well-fed worm avoids this dangerous test, but a starving worm continually pumps at a low rate even in the absence of food in order to detect any that might appear. Consistent with this, we found that opioids motivate worms to seek food by stimulating locomotion as well as pumping."

This enhancement is particularly striking for M4 and M5, the motor neurons that synapse on TB (terminal bulb) muscle (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chiang et al., 2006</a>). We also screened for suppressors of the slow pumping and growth phenotypes of <i>eat-2</i>; <i>egl-3</i> mutants. 7/15 suppressors were new <i>slo-1</i> mutations. These results are consistent with the possibility that M4 might be involved in the opioid signaling response. We do not know yet how ASI neurons communicate with pharyngeal neurons. The pharyngeal and extrapharyngeal nervous systems are connected only by a bilateral pair of gap junctions between the extrapharyngeal RIP neurons and the pharyngeal I1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</a>), and I1s are not necessary for MC-independent pumping (<a href=\"#bib4\">Avery and Horvitz, 1989</a>).

Among the three, loperamide induced nose muscle contraction similar to that caused by fluoxetine (<a href=\"#bib19\">Choy and Thomas, 1999</a>), so that we could not measure the pumping rate. U69593 increased pumping in wild-type worms but not <i>npr-17</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These results suggest that NPR-17 might be similar to the KOR but do not exclude similarity to \u03bc as well. Vertebrate opioid receptors are about 60% identical to each other (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 1993</a>). In BLAST results, NPR-17 showed 23% identity with MOR-1 and DOR-1 and 24% identity with KOR-1. The three vertebrate receptors almost certainly diverged from each other well after any common ancestor of nematodes and vertebrates, so NPR-17 is probably an ortholog of all three. Clearly, NPR-17 is not a close homolog of any particular vertebrate opioid receptor. Rather, we suggest that NPR-17 and the vertebrate receptors collectively derive from a common ancestor in which the outlines of opioid system function had already appeared. Further, NPR-17 appears to be functionally closer to vertebrate opioid receptors than any other molecularly characterized invertebrate receptor is."

In fact, of the six predicted NLP-24 peptides, YGGYGamide alone activated MOR-1 and KOR-1 expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells. But, to our surprise, YGGYGamide did not detectably activate NPR-17 in the same system. In fact, the only peptide that worked was GPYGYGamide. By itself, this result might cast doubt on the idea that NLP-24 and NPR-17 are components of the <i>C. elegans</i> opioid system. The extreme version of this doubt would argue that NLP-24, like POMC, is a precursor for multiple peptides that act on distinct unrelated receptors, and that it is essentially coincidence that the NPR-17 ligand GPYGYGamide shares a precursor with the opioid YGGYGamide. But this idea fails to explain multiple lines of data suggesting NPR-17 is a bona fide opioid receptor, namely: (1) Heterologously expressed NPR-17 responds to opioid receptor agonists and the blocker naloxone. (2) Naloxone blocks the response of NPR-17 to GPYGYGamide. (3) <i>npr-17</i> is necessary for the behavioral response of worms to opioid agonists and naloxone. (4) NPR-17 has sequence similarity to opioid receptors. A more parsimonious explanation of the discrepancy is that in the HEK-293 expression system, where we asked a single <i>npr-17</i> product to work entirely through vertebrate proteins, we failed to completely reconstitute its in vivo activity. Of course, these ideas are not mutually exclusive. It may be that in the worm some form of NPR-17 does respond to YGGY-containing NLP-24 products, and that NLP-24 produces products that act on other receptors as well."

As you expected we could see ASI expression in <i>nlp-24::SL2::GFP</i> transgenic worms (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 2C</a>). That suggest that <i>nlp-24</i> may operate in an autocrine manner. We also added a starvation experiment (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). <i>nlp-24</i> expression is increased by starvation. We didn\u2019t see a big difference in <i>nlp-24</i> expression in ASI neurons. Therefore we think that nlp-24 may also operate in an endocrine manner. These new data <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 3</a> are now discussed in the Results section (in the subsection headed \u201cASI neurons are required for opioid signaling and NPR-17 in ASI neurons is sufficient for opioid signaling\u201d) of the revised manuscript."
