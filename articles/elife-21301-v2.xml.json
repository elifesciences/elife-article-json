Achieving accuracy is challenging, as the molecular signals that dictate a protein\u2019s cellular destination are often promiscuous. A salient example is the targeting of an essential class of tail-anchored (TA) proteins, whose sole defining feature is a transmembrane domain near their C-terminus. Here we show that the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway selects TA proteins destined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) utilizing distinct molecular steps, including differential binding by the co-chaperone Sgt2 and kinetic proofreading after ATP hydrolysis by the targeting factor Get3. Further, the different steps select for distinct physicochemical features of the TA substrate. The use of multiple selection filters may be general to protein biogenesis pathways that must distinguish correct and incorrect substrates based on minor differences."

Achieving accuracy is challenging, as the molecular signals that dictate a protein\u2019s cellular destination are often promiscuous. A salient example is the targeting of an essential class of tail-anchored (TA) proteins, whose sole defining feature is a transmembrane domain near their C-terminus. Here we show that the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway selects TA proteins destined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) utilizing distinct molecular steps, including differential binding by the co-chaperone Sgt2 and kinetic proofreading after ATP hydrolysis by the targeting factor Get3. Further, the different steps select for distinct physicochemical features of the TA substrate. The use of multiple selection filters may be general to protein biogenesis pathways that must distinguish correct and incorrect substrates based on minor differences."

Understanding how protein-targeting pathways achieve accurate membrane protein localization has been challenging for multiple reasons. First, topogenic signals that define a protein\u2019s final destination tend to be degenerate and lack consensus motifs (<a href=\"#bib54\">von Heijne, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zheng and Gierasch, 1996</a>), which demands targeting machineries to be adaptable and able to recognize a diverse set of signals. Second, minor differences in targeting signals distinguish proteins that belong to alternative pathways or organelles (<a href=\"#bib11\">Emanuelsson and von Heijne, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">von Heijne, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang and Shan, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zheng and Gierasch, 1996</a>). Thus, protein-targeting pathways must also evolve robust selection mechanisms that can detect these minor differences. Furthermore, hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) on membrane protein substrates are prone to irreversible aggregation that can lead to mislocalization and proteostatic stress, requiring targeting machineries to also effectively shield the TMDs during targeting (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shao and Hegde, 2011</a>). Except for a few systems (see [<a href=\"#bib39\">Randall and Hardy, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang and Shan, 2014</a>]), the molecular mechanisms by which protein targeting machineries overcome these challenges are not well understood for most pathways."

                        "text": "A salient example of these challenges is an essential class of tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins, defined solely by a single TMD near the C-terminus. TA proteins comprise 3\u20135% of the eukaryotic membrane proteome and play essential roles in numerous processes including membrane fusion/fission, vesicular trafficking, protein translocation, quality control, and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beilharz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hegde and Keenan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kalbfleisch et al., 2007</a>). TA proteins are found in nearly all membranes in eukaryotic cells including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM), and peroxisomes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kutay et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yabal et al., 2003</a>). To a first approximation, sequences near the C-terminus of TA proteins (including the TMD) are necessary and sufficient to direct their proper localization to diverse organelles (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beilharz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Whitley et al., 1996</a>). Previous work further showed that modulation of the TMD and basic residues at the extreme C-termini alter the localization of TA proteins to the ER or mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beilharz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Borgese et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rapaport, 2003</a>). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which these sequences are recognized and decoded by protein targeting machineries remains poorly defined."

                        "text": "Recent advances in deciphering TA protein targeting pathways provide an opportunity to address this question. Biochemical and genetic analyses have identified the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway, which targets TA proteins destined to the ER through a series of substrate handoff events (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schuldiner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). The co-chaperone Sgt2 initially associates with the TMDs of TA proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). A scaffolding complex, comprised of Get4 and Get5 (Get4/5), bridges Sgt2 and the central targeting factor, the Get3 ATPase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chartron et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Get4/5 also preorganizes Get3 into the optimal conformation and nucleotide state for TA binding (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gristick et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rome et al., 2013</a>) and thus facilitates the transfer of TA substrates from Sgt2 to Get3 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). TA loading on Get3 drives Get3\u2019s dissociation from Get4/5 and also activates Get3\u2019s ATP hydrolysis activity (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rome et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2013</a>). After ATP hydrolysis, the Get3\u2022TA complex associates with the Get1/2 receptor complex on the ER membrane, via which the TA protein is released from Get3 and inserted into the membrane (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schuldiner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2014</a>)."

Nevertheless, it is unclear how the GET pathway distinguishes TAs destined to different organelles and selects the correct set of substrates; it is also unclear how Sgt2, Get3, or the target membrane contributes to this selection. Here, we address these questions by systematically varying the TA protein and quantitatively analyzing how individual molecular steps in the GET pathway sense and respond to these variations through a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological studies. Our results show that the GET pathway selects ER-destined TA proteins using multiple steps in the pathway, and different steps are capable of recognizing distinct physicochemical features in the TA protein. The combination of these mechanisms together ensures accurate substrate selection by the GET pathway."

A comprehensive analysis of the Grand Average of Hydropathy (GRAVY) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kyte and Doolittle, 1982</a>) scores of TAs shows that: (i) the TMD of TAs span a wide range of hydrophobicity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, GRAVY Score); (ii) among these, established GET substrates (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mateja et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schuldiner et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, highlighted in black) are enriched in the range of higher hydrophobicity; (iii) mitochondrial TAs tend to span a range of lower hydrophobicity, but exhibit significant overlap with that of GET substrates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig1\">1A</a>). These observations suggest that features in addition to TMD hydrophobicity also dictate the localization of TAs. A potential distinguishing feature is the basic residues C-terminal to the TMD, which has been shown to direct proteins to outer mitochondrial membrane in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marty et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Borgese et al., 2001</a>). As natural amino acid variations tend to change multiple physicochemical properties, additional features of the TMD besides hydrophobicity could also contribute to the localization of TA proteins."

Increasing the number and density of basic residues in the CTE of Bos1 (Bos1-RR, Bos1-FisC, and Bos1-RRRR) also substantially reduced Get3-dependent translocation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). Reciprocally, reducing the positive charges in the CTE of Fis1-FisC by replacing it with the Bos1 CTE (Fis1-BosC) or with two arginines (Fis1-RR) enhanced TA insertion into ER, whereas replacing the Fis1 CTE with four arginines (Fis1-RRRR) further reduced the level of ER insertion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a>).

In contrast, the translocation of Bos1-CTE mutants saturated at\u00a0\u22640.5 \u00b5M Get3 and was not further improved by higher Get3 concentration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This suggests that distinct mechanisms are used to reject a suboptimal TMD versus CTE of TA substrates; this hypothesis is supported by in-depth analyses below. Second, substrates containing a Fis1 TMD exhibited Get3-independent insertion into ER microsomes, and insertion was also abolished by a highly charged CTE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, substrates containing the Fis1p TMD can be targeted to the ER by alternative pathways, and importantly, a positively charged CTE serves as a general feature to reject TA proteins from the ER in both GET-dependent and GET-independent pathways."

The ability of a basic CTE to help direct TA proteins to mitochondria has also been well documented (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borgese et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Marty et al., 2014</a>). However, whether a basic CTE can in addition serve as an \u2018ER-avoidance\u2019 sequence in vivo is unclear. To address this question, we examined the in vivo localization of GFP fused to the TMD and CTE variants of Fis1. As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib17\">Habib et al., 2003</a>), the TMD and basic CTE of Fis1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, Fis1-TMD-CTE) were sufficient to direct GFP exclusively to the OMM. Deletion of the CTE led to a loss of specific mitochondrial targeting and accumulation of Fis1-TMD in the ER, as shown by the co-localization of GFP with the ER marker Sec63 tagged with tdTomato (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, Fis1-TMD). We next probed the minimal charge requirement of the CTE that provides mitochondrial specificity and excludes the Fis1-TMD from the ER. To this end, we created variants of Fis1-CTE with increasing numbers of arginine residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, Fis1-TMD-nR) and quantified their co-localization with Sec63-tdTomato and mitochondrially targeted TagBFP (mito-TagBFP). These data showed that there is a significant reduction in the ER localization of protein when the number of positive charges on the CTE is\u00a0+3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, Fis1-TMD-RRR). When the number of charges in the CTE reached\u00a0+4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, Fis1-TMD-RRRR), equivalent to that of the native Fis1-CTE, specific mitochondrial localization was fully restored. Thus, in agreement with the results of the in vitro experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>), a highly basic CTE plays an important role in excluding mitochondria-destined TA proteins from the ER."

This suggests that a combination of hydrophobicity and helical propensity in the TMD dictates substrate recognition by Sgt2. On average, the TMDs of most OMM TA proteins are lower in helical content compared to ER-targeted TAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, Agadir Score), providing independent support that helical propensity of the TMD may serve as another distinguishing feature between ER and mitochondrial TAs."

We first measured FRET when the transfer reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium at varying concentrations of Get3<sup>BDP</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These titrations showed that the apparent equilibrium of TA transfer between Sgt2 and Get3, quantified empirically by the concentration of Get3 required for 50% transfer (<i>K</i><sub>1/2</sub>), ranged from 3.7\u201310 nM for various substrates in the presence of 150 nM Sgt2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

The modest variation of this transfer equilibrium (&lt;3 fold) among Bos1 and 2AG\u20135AG indicates that the relative preference of Get3 for this set of TA variants closely parallels those of Sgt2, such that TA transfer from Sgt2 to Get3 is largely isoenergetic among these substrates. Real-time measurements of the TA transfer reaction showed that, although the transfer kinetics is complex and exhibited bi-phasic behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), Bos1 and 2AG\u20135AG were all rapidly transferred from Sgt2 to Get3, with reaction halftimes\u00a0(t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 5\u201317 s (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>).

The Fis1-TMD is responsible for the absence of observed transfer, as Fis1-BosC was also strongly discriminated during this reaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <i>navy</i>), whereas Bos1-FisC was not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>, <i>blue</i>). During the transfer experiment, the TA proteins could partition between multiple routes including transfer onto Get3 (observed by the FRET assay), dissociation from Sgt2, and potentially other off-pathway processes not observed in the FRET assay. The absence of any observed FRET in these measurements indicates highly unfavorable partitioning of Fis1-BosC and Fis1-FisC into the transfer reaction compared to the alternative routes. It is unclear whether the absence of observed transfer arises exclusively from the rapid dissociation of these substrates from Sgt2, or whether substrate transfer to Get3 imposes a higher barrier for TA proteins containing suboptimal TMDs. Nevertheless, these observations are consistent with the Get3-independent targeting of substrates containing the Fis1-TMD in complete targeting and translocation assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and indicates that these substrates are completely rejected at steps upstream of TA loading onto Get3."

To reconstitute this step, we generated <sup>35</sup>S-methionine labeled TAs during in vitro translation in the presence of Sgt2, Get4/5, and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Get3, and affinity purified Get3\u2022TA complexes using Ni-NTA. Purified complexes were presented to ER microsomes derived from <i>\u2206get3</i> yeast, and the efficiency of targeting and insertion was assessed by glycosylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Measurement of the reaction time courses showed that 2AG was targeted and inserted with similar kinetics and efficiency as Bos1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Compared to Bos1, the insertion of 3AG\u20136AG were also rapid, but 5AG showed a small reduction in insertion efficiency at steady state, and 6AG showed a marked reduction in the level of insertion at steady state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a>). On the other hand, Bos1-FisC, Bos1-RR, and Bos1-RRRR exhibited significantly slower rates to reach steady state compared to Bos1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a>), mirroring their translocation defects observed in the complete yeast lysate. We note that although the absolute insertion efficiency of each substrate could vary with different yRM preparations, the <i>change</i> in TA insertion kinetics and steady-state level caused by the TMD and CTE variants are consistent across different yRM preps (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

First, the Get3\u2022TA complexes were purified via the affinity tag on Get3 for the experiments above; the presence of excess free Get3 could trap the Get4/5 complex during purification. The Get3\u2022TA complex must dissociate from Get4/5 to interact with the Get1/2 receptors at the ER during the observed insertion reaction (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gristick et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rome et al., 2014</a>), and this dissociation could be slower with the charged CTE variants compared to Bos1. To address this possibility, we re-purified Get3\u2022TA complexes for Bos1, Bos1-FisC and Bos1-RRRR via the 3xStrep tag on the TA substrate. The Get3\u2022TA complexes purified through this procedure were free of Get4/5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Targeting and insertion reactions with these complexes showed that the observed insertion reactions with Bos1-FisC and Bos1-RRRR remained significantly slower than those of Bos1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>) even without Get4/5 present. Second, ATP hydrolysis by Get3 precedes the disassembly of Get3\u2022TA complex and insertion of TA by Get1/2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rome et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2011</a>); as the TA substrate stimulates the ATPase activity of Get3 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rome et al., 2013</a>), the CTE variants could be defective in this ATPase stimulation. To rule out this possibility, we tested the targeting and insertion of Get3\u2022TA complexes without ATP present. Although the absence of ATP reduced the overall amount of insertion, as anticipated from the role of ATP in enabling efficient Get3 turnover for multiple rounds of targeting (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mariappan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rome et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stefer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2011</a>), the targeting and insertion of Bos1-FisC remained significantly slower than those of Bos1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C versus E</a>).

We found here that TA substrates with increasing number of Ala/Gly replacements in the TMDs form less stable complexes with Sgt2, consistent with previous work showing that addition of four leucines to the Fis1-TMD confers strong interaction with Sgt2 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). The strong correlation between the TA capture efficiency of Sgt2 and the helical content of the TMD variants tested here was unexpected and suggests that overall hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant for recognition by Sgt2. Although a structure of the TA binding domain of Sgt2 is not available, these data suggest that this domain might be able to recognize secondary structure features such as a TMD helix. The overall lower helical content of the TMDs of OMM TAs compared to ER-targeted TAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) provides further support that recognition based on helical propensity could provide an effective mechanism to distinguish between ER and mitochondrial TAs. On the other hand, Sgt2 is insensitive to enrichment of basic residues at the extreme C-terminus that characterizes some mitochondrial TAs, suggesting that this property must be detected by other mechanisms."

The basic CTE from Fis1p was also well tolerated during this handover, suggesting that analogous to Sgt2, Get3 does not recognize the positive charges in the CTE. It is unclear whether the lack of observed transfer for substrates containing the Fis1 TMD could be attributed solely to the lower kinetic stability of the Sgt2\u2022TA complex with these substrates, or whether the TA handover event poses an additional selection filter for substrates with the Fis1-TMD. Nevertheless, the combination of the results from the Sgt2-TA capture and TA transfer experiments shows that substrates containing the Fis1-TMD are rejected before loading onto Get3; this explains the lack of Get3-dependence observed for these substrates in the overall targeting and insertion reactions in cell lysates."

Our results show that two mechanisms can lead to further rejection of suboptimal substrates at this stage. TA proteins with suboptimal TMDs, such as 6AG, dissociate from Get3 more quickly than those with more hydrophobic TMDs; the rapid disassembly of the targeting complex could outcompete productive targeting and insertion processes. Importantly, this step provides the major mechanism to reject TA proteins with highly basic CTE, which are inserted into ER more slowly than those without (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, step 3; and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013C</a>, blue). As the charged CTE compromised both Get3-dependent and Get3-independent TA insertions into ER, enrichment of basic residues in the CTE provides a general feature that enables TA proteins to escape insertion into the ER. In principle, transporting charges across a hydrophobic environment poses a high energetic barrier (<a href=\"#bib12\">Engelman and Steitz, 1981</a>); this barrier could be imposed using either the phospholipid environment at the ER and/or translocases whose interior provide no compensation for these charges. In contrast to the ER, the mitochondrial membrane is enriched in anionic phospholipids such as cardiolipin (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gebert et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">van Meer et al., 2008</a>) and might better tolerate a basic CTE on the TA protein. Finally, a four leucine substitution in the Fis1 TMD could compensate for its charged CTE and re-direct Fis1 to the GET pathway (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that TA localization is specified by a combination of multiple physicochemical properties."

After TA proteins are loaded onto Get3, substrates can further partition between disassembly from Get3 and productive insertion into ER, during which authentic substrates partition more favorably into the productive insertion reaction compared to suboptimal substrates. As this partitioning occurs <i>after</i> irreversible ATP hydrolysis on Get3, it is analogous to proofreading mechanisms observed during rejection of near cognate tRNAs by the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rodnina and Wintermeyer, 2001a</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2001b</a>). Although each mechanism provides a modest discrimination, the use of multiple, sequential selection steps allows the GET pathway to distinguish TA proteins destined to different organelles while accommodating a variety of amino acid sequences in the substrate protein. This principle has been observed with DNA and RNA polymerases (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sydow and Cramer, 2009</a>), in translation elongation by the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ogle and Ramakrishnan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rodnina and Wintermeyer, 2001b</a>), and in co-translational protein targeting mediated by the signal recognition particle (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), and may represent a general principle by which key biological processes attain a high degree of fidelity."

Although the substrate preferences of Get3 parallels those of Sgt2, the differences in substrate binding affinity of Get3 may not be fully realized in the GET pathway to generate effective selection.

As a result, TA proteins that modestly destabilize the Get3\u2022TA complex may not be effectively rejected based on differential binding (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Sgt2 could help overcome this problem by rejecting a fraction of GET-independent substrates prior to loading onto Get3. As Sgt2 forms less stable complexes with TA proteins than Get3, a borderline substrate bound to Sgt2 could more readily equilibrate with alternative machineries in the cytosol than if the same substrate were bound to Get3 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>).

Here, the authors use an elegant in vitro approach to examine the role of distinct steps in the GET pathway, leading to a model where multiple steps contribute to fidelity. They also identify features of the targeting signals (hydrophobicity, helical content, C-terminal positive charge) that may be distinguished at different steps in the pathway."

Are these surprisingly low helical content values explained by the choice of Agadir as the algorithm? The Agadir webserver lists three parameters (ionic strength, pH, temperature) that can be specified. The authors should indicate what parameters were used for their calculations and explicitly state that the calculated content is for a peptide in an aqueous environment. It seems odd that introducing a single glycine into 2AG reduces the helical content from 12% (2AG) to less than 1% (3AG). The reviewers also suggested that the authors test other algorithms that predict helical propensity."

The only significant effect is observed with Fis1-BosC and Fis1-FisC substrates, which raises two concerns: 1) these substrates were barely captured by Sgt2 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). It wasn't clear how the complexes were even obtained for this experiment, or whether the complexes resembled those obtained with the optimal substrates. Were the TA segments of Fis1-BosC in a helical conformation and were they bound to the same surface of Sgt2? 2) More importantly, in yeast, Fis1 only binds Sgt2 indirectly, via heat shock proteins that bind to the Sgt2 TPR domain (Wang et al., 2010). Thus, in vivo, it never engages the C-terminal, met-rich substrate binding domain of Sgt2 and therefore never has a chance to transfer to Get3. The reviewers appreciate that the in vitro experiment described here lacks the yeast chaperones, but the physiologic significance of the result is unclear. It would be more compelling if a substrate that is efficiently captured by Sgt2 was transferred less efficiently to Get3. Instead, it seems that the vast majority of discrimination of Fis1-BosC and Fis1-FisC occurs upstream of the transfer reaction (i.e., at the initial Sgt2 loading step). For these reasons, the reviewers feel that this conclusion is not well supported, most likely not physiologically relevant, and should be de-emphasized in a revised version of this manuscript."

Here, excess positive charge in the C-terminal region is proposed to slow the rate of membrane insertion (k-insert), thereby increasing the window of time for suboptimal substrates to dissociate from Get3 (k-nonproductive). This is an interesting proposal, but it was not clear whether the authors have considered other factors that might slow the insertion step. Suboptimal sequences may slow or prevent dissociation of Get3-substrate complexes from Get4/5 after transfer. The authors should test whether Get4/Get5 co-purify with Get3 TA protein complexes that contain optimal and non-optimal substrates. Could suboptimal sequences fail to activate the Get3 ATPase following dissociation of the complex from Get4/5? These possibilities would need to be checked before concluding that C-terminal charges slow the actual insertion step."

Among the main points are the suggestions to use a trap strategy to minimize direct loading onto Get3, to prove that the in vitro transfer reaction is really Get4/5-dependent, to establish that the Sgt2 material is of sufficient quality, and to more systematically analyze the behavior of a cleaner set of substrates.

This question is particularly relevant for the distinction between TA proteins targeted to the ER or mitochondria. Previous work has provided evidence that positive charged following the hydrophobic sequence are required for targeting to mitochondria, although the lack of such charges can be compensated for by changes in the hydrophobic region (Beilharz et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2010). In the present paper, the authors use different versions of the anchor sequence to investigate the effect of hydrophobicity and of the charged C-terminus on various steps of the GET pathway that is involved in TA protein integration into the ER. They conclude that Sgt2, the first component in the pathway, discriminates TAs on the basis of hydrophobicity. In addition, less hydrophobic TAs are only slowly transferred to Get3, the next component in the pathway. Finally, there is discrimination at the last step, the insertion of TAs into the membrane, in part because less hydrophobic TAs rapidly dissociate from Get3. At this point, TAs with positive charges also seem to be rejected."

The 4AG constructs is said to bind in a different conformation to Get3 based on a different steady state FRET level (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7A,B</a>), so it may not be easily compared with other constructs. 6AG behaves very different from the other constructs in its dissociation rate from Get3 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Finally, only one construct with a change of the C-terminal charge is tested (Bos1-FisC). Why wasn't the C-terminus varied in the same way as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>? It is also surprising that no experiments were done with the actual mitochondrial protein Fis1.

By comparison, we know relatively little about mechanisms that make accurate protein sorting decisions on the basis of small differences in the biophysical properties of signal sequences. The basic steps by which TA proteins are guided to the ER membrane for insertion (GET pathway) but it remains poorly understood how they are sorted away from mitochondrial TA proteins. In yeast, Sgt2 and Get3 sequentially recognize ER signal sequences on TA proteins (partly in the TA transmembrane domain or TMD) but the raison d'etre for multi-step signal recogntion remains unclear. An appealing hypothesis is that Sgt2 can also transfer TA proteins for ubiquitination if they are not captured efficiently by Get3 and in doing so increase sorting fidelity. Intriguingly, Bag6 is a mammalian protein that scaffolds mammalian Sgt2 (SGTA), mammalian Get3 (TRC40, via interactions with additional pathway components), and a ubiquitin ligase that marks TA proteins for degradation in competition with TRC40-TA complex formation. By contrast, yeast lack an apparent Bag6 homolog or equivalent and there is a need for a better mechanistic framework describing how this organism achieves TA protein targeting fidelity."

This is an interesting observation but it warrants more supporting experiments because 4AG might be behaving differently from the other TAs in these in vitro assays for other reasons. Specifically, there are two independent concerns. First, the authors argue that \"4AG was bound in a different conformation on Get3 compared to Bos1 and 2AG\", and refer to their immunoprecipitation data in Figure S4 to argue that comparable amounts of Bos1, 2AG, and 4AG are transferred from Sgt2 to Get3. However, the blot images in Figure S4A seem to show that Get3 co-purifies significantly less 4AG than Bos1 or 2AG and are inconsistent with the quantitation in Figure S4B. More to the point, it is not shown that Sgt2 is even required for TA protein binding to Get3 under these in vitro conditions. Without repeating the experiment in the absence of Sgt2, the claim that these data support the conclusions about TA transfer from Sgt2 to Get3 based on the FRET assay is unsupported. One way to obtain corroborating evidence that TA transfer at equilibrium is the same for 4AG as Bos1 is to repeat this experiment with a photocrosslinking approach using a tRNA amber suppressor to introduce a photocrosslinker instead of a fluorophore and monitoring TA transfer from Sgt2 to Get3 (at different concentrations) by photocrosslinking. In fact, this approach could also be used to independently monitor the rate of TA transfer even on relatively short timescales because timepoints can be snap frozen and then crosslinked in the frozen state."

This rate, together with the rate of TA protein rebinding to Sgt2 complicates interpretation and might lead to in vitro effects that are not relevant in vivo because they are measured without competing cellular factors (e.g. factors for mitochondrial TA targeting).

Were the TA segments of Fis1-BosC in a helical conformation and were they bound to the same surface of Sgt2? 2) More importantly, in yeast, Fis1 only binds Sgt2 indirectly, via heat shock proteins that bind to the Sgt2 TPR domain (Wang et al., 2010).

The reviewers appreciate that the</i> in vitro <i>experiment described here lacks the yeast chaperones, but the physiologic significance of the result is unclear. It would be more compelling if a substrate that is efficiently captured by Sgt2 was transferred less efficiently to Get3. Instead, it seems that the vast majority of discrimination of Fis1-BosC and Fis1-FisC occurs upstream of the transfer reaction (i.e., at the initial Sgt2 loading step).

These procedures ensured that an Sgt2-TA complex was presented to Get3 during the measurement. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> shows that TA capture is completely lost with Sgt2\u25b3CTD, so these substrates are bound to Sgt2-CTD, but they are likely bound in a different conformation from that of a good TA substrate. Nevertheless, TA dissociation from Sgt2 is probable during the FRET measurement, in which the complex was diluted to an Sgt2 concentration of 150 nM (see more discussion in the next paragraph). Regarding the second question (Hsp70 vs Sgt2), we would like to point out that pull down experiments reflect the steady state distribution of the substrate on different factors in the cell or cell extract. By forcing Fis1 onto Sgt2 and watching its fate, our experiments attempt to understand, in part, the mechanism by which that steady state is achieved. Our results show that Fis1 bound Sgt2 weakly and even if it did, does not flux into the GET pathway; this is consistent with the steady-state observations of Fis1 accumulation on Hsp70 instead of Sgt2."

This could arise from more rapid dissociation from Sgt2, less efficient transfer to Get3, or both. In the case that the absence of observed transfer arises exclusively from the lower kinetic stability of the Sgt2-TA complex, the mechanism becomes redundant with rejection at the Sgt2-TA binding step.

Finally, as natural amino acid substitutions tend to alter multiple physicochemical features, the larger set of TMD variants allowed us to perform an initial correlation analysis of capture efficiencies of Sgt2 with various features of the TMD. The result, surprisingly, indicated that hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant, and pointed at a significant role of the helical content of the TMDs in TA recognition by Sgt2. Collectivelly, the larger set of substrates corroborated some of the previous conclusions and gave unexpected new insights."

                    "text": "We provide two new pieces of data that address this concern. First, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> shows both the Get4/5-dependent and Get4/5-independent TA transfer reactions from Sgt2 to Get3; the latter is much slower than the former. As also shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, most of the TAs we tested (except for Fis1-TMD containing substrates) were transferred within 15 seconds and much faster than the Get4/5-independent reaction; thus these measurements reflect Get4/5-dependent TA transfer. Second, we re-performed the TA transfer reaction in the presence of \u0394get3 lysate, and found that transfer still occurred efficiently and rapidly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). We did not use the suggested Sgt2\u0394N \u2018trap\u2019 for two reasons: (i) there is no Sgt2\u0394N in vivo, and we feel that the complete yeast lysate is a better mimic for TA transfer under physiological conditions; (ii) control experiments showed that Sgt2\u0394N is not a passive trap for TA dissociation; instead, it significantly catalyzed TA release from Sgt2. The implication of this observation in terms of the mechanism of TA transfer is beyond the scope of this study, and we will pursue and publish it separately. But the bottom line is that we agree that re-examining TA transfer under more physiological conditions is a good concept, and did so using an alternative approach."

In addition, we have maintained a constant, excess amount of Sgt2 in all TA transfer assays ([TACm] ~ 50 nM and [Sgt2] = 150 nM). For TA substrates that are captured inefficiently by Sgt2, excess Sgt2 was also included during the washes and elutions during purification of the Sgt2\u2022TA complex to maintain TA solubility prior to the assay. These optimizations in the procedure did improve the efficiency of the TA transfer reactions. As described above, we observed rapid TA transfer from Sgt2 to Get3 with favorable equilibrium (half-complete transfer at 5-10 nM Get3) and high FRET efficiency (~70-80%) for most of the substrates tested (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6C-G</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In addition, gels for the purified Sgt2\u2022TA complex are shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5C and D</a>."

The only significant comment I would address upfront is Reviewer 2\u2019s suggestion to use an alternative, crosslinking approach instead of FRET to measure TA transfer from Sgt2 to Get3. This is conceptually the same experiment and, as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, most of the Get4/5-dependent transfer reactions are rapid and complete within the timescale of reliable manual mixing (\u03c4 ~5-15 sec); so it is necessary to use a continuous fluorescence assay coupled to rapid mixing devices to accurately make these measurements. Finally, the Get4/5-independent TA transfer reaction corroborated that the observed FRET is due to TA loading on Get3, rather than the TA being close to Get3 in a TASgt2-Get4/5-Get3 transfer complex."
