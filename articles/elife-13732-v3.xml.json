                    "text": "Distributed neural activity patterns are widely proposed to underlie object identification and categorization in the brain. In the olfactory domain, pattern-based representations of odor objects are encoded in piriform cortex. This region receives both afferent and associative inputs, though their relative contributions to odor perception are poorly understood. Here, we combined a placebo-controlled pharmacological fMRI paradigm with multivariate pattern analyses to test the role of associative connections in sustaining olfactory categorical representations. Administration of baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist known to attenuate piriform associative inputs, interfered with within-category pattern separation in piriform cortex, and the magnitude of this drug-induced change predicted perceptual alterations in fine-odor discrimination performance. Comparatively, baclofen reduced pattern separation between odor categories in orbitofrontal cortex, and impeded within-category generalization in hippocampus. Our findings suggest that odor categorization is a dynamic process concurrently engaging stimulus discrimination and generalization at different stages of olfactory information processing, and highlight the importance of associative networks in maintaining categorical boundaries."

                    "text": "Distributed neural activity patterns are widely proposed to underlie object identification and categorization in the brain. In the olfactory domain, pattern-based representations of odor objects are encoded in piriform cortex. This region receives both afferent and associative inputs, though their relative contributions to odor perception are poorly understood. Here, we combined a placebo-controlled pharmacological fMRI paradigm with multivariate pattern analyses to test the role of associative connections in sustaining olfactory categorical representations. Administration of baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist known to attenuate piriform associative inputs, interfered with within-category pattern separation in piriform cortex, and the magnitude of this drug-induced change predicted perceptual alterations in fine-odor discrimination performance. Comparatively, baclofen reduced pattern separation between odor categories in orbitofrontal cortex, and impeded within-category generalization in hippocampus. Our findings suggest that odor categorization is a dynamic process concurrently engaging stimulus discrimination and generalization at different stages of olfactory information processing, and highlight the importance of associative networks in maintaining categorical boundaries."

Importantly, sensory systems must generalize across different objects sharing similar features, but at the same time maintain the specificity of individual objects and categories (<a href=\"#bib60\">Roach, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 2000</a>). Mechanisms of pattern recognition have been proposed to underlie the neural basis of object categorization, which requires a balance between generalizing inputs across a certain range of variations (known as <i>pattern completion</i>) and discriminating between distinct inputs (known as <i>pattern separation</i>) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Haberly, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wilson and Sullivan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chapuis and Wilson, 2012</a>).

In the olfactory system, information in a whiff of scented air is transformed into distributed patterns of neural activity in the piriform cortex, with both animal and human studies demonstrating that different odor objects evoke distinguishable ensemble activity patterns without spatial topography (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wilson and Sullivan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gottfried, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Stettler and Axel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Howard et al., 2009</a>). Recent work has revealed that fMRI multivariate patterns in posterior piriform cortex (PPC) encode not only odor identity, but also category information (e.g., minty or woody), whereby odor patterns belonging to the same category are more similar (more overlapping) than those across different categories (<a href=\"#bib31\">Howard et al., 2009</a>). Despite these insights, the mechanisms by which olfactory inputs are organized into categorical percepts through their associations with olfactory cortical areas are poorly understood."

As the largest subregion of primary olfactory cortex, the piriform cortex receives afferent (bottom-up) inputs from the olfactory bulb through the lateral olfactory tract, and extensive associative (top-down) inputs from higher-order association areas such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carmichael et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Johnson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haberly and Price, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Insausti et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Insausti et al., 2002</a>). This convergence of bottom-up and top-down projections, along with the presence of dense recurrent collaterals, is thought to support olfactory pattern recognition and associative learning (<a href=\"#bib25\">Haberly, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Haberly and Bower, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wilson, 2009</a>). For example, when confronted with highly overlapping odor mixtures, rats can learn to discriminate or ignore detectable differences between these mixtures, with piriform activity patterns exhibiting either separation (enhanced discrimination) or completion (enhanced generalization), respectively (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chapuis and Wilson, 2012</a>). Evidence from humans has also pointed to PPC as a substrate for odor discrimination (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2008</a>) and categorization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Howard et al., 2009</a>). Together these findings suggest that piriform cortex is capable of modulating pattern representations along a discrimination-generalization spectrum in order to encode behaviorally adaptive meaning through perceptual experience."

In a previous fMRI study, human subjects were deprived of afferent sensory input for one week, resulting in a reduction of odor-evoked mean activity in PPC, without alteration of pattern-based piriform representations of odor categories (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). Here we address the inverse question, namely, how attenuation of piriform associative connections influences odor category coding in primary sensory regions and higher-order cortical areas."

Baclofen selectively suppresses synaptic transmission of association fibers into piriform cortex, but leaves afferent inputs from the olfactory bulb unaffected (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tang and Hasselmo, 1994</a>). In vivo local application of baclofen in the piriform cortex of anesthetized rats modified the strength of odor-evoked responses of pyramidal neurons, by blocking broadly-tuned neurons and increasing odor-selective responses (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poo and Isaacson, 2011</a>). In behaving animals, injection of baclofen into the piriform cortex following an olfactory fear conditioning session resulted in fear memory generalization, indicating that piriform associative connections are essential for consolidation of stimulus-specific memories (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barnes and Wilson, 2014</a>)."

Given that odor object codes take the form of distributed ensemble patterns, we used multivariate fMRI analyses to characterize baclofen effects in olfactory areas found to represent categorical information. The placebo group served as a control to account for session-effect confounds between pre- and post-drug phases of the study. As such, we examined the effects of baclofen by comparing pre-to-post changes relative to those observed in placebo subjects (i.e., group-by-session interaction). We predicted that baclofen would disrupt associative connections, leading to perceptual and neural reorganization of odor categories in piriform cortex and in olfactory downstream areas including OFC, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus."

We first used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify brain areas where odor category information is represented, among several anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs) including piriform cortex, higher-order areas that directly project to piriform (olfactory subregion of OFC, amygdala, entorhinal cortex), and hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). This analysis was conducted for all subjects in the pre-drug session, in order to constrain our investigation of baclofen-induced drug effects to those ROIs that had robust odor category coding at baseline (thus independent of drug administration). We trained the SVM classifier on patterns evoked by one pair of odors belonging to different categories (e.g., C1 vs. M1), and then tested the classifier on patterns evoked by the complementary pair of odors from the same categories (e.g., C2 vs. M2; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Importantly, because training and test sets were based on data evoked by different odor identities, significant above-chance decoding is only possible if fMRI patterns encode category information independent of the specific odor identities. Across all subjects in the pre-drug session, we found significant above-chance decoding accuracy in PPC (t<sub>31</sub> = 2.05, P = 0.024), OFC (t<sub>31</sub> = 1.96, P = 0.029), amygdala (t<sub>31</sub> = 3.17, P = 0.0017), and posterior hippocampus (pHIP, t<sub>31</sub> = 1.90, P = 0.034; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>).

The significant group \u00d7 session interaction implies that the natural process of within-category pattern separation in controls was disrupted in the presence of baclofen. For example, PPC pattern representations of the two citrus odors became more distinct under the control condition, but failed to diverge under baclofen. We speculate that piriform associative input normally supports the separation of patterns corresponding to unique identities of individual odors, especially those sharing perceptual features and associated with the same semantic labels. This mechanism would be compatible with prior work showing that perceptual learning enhances discriminability of within-category odor pairs, with concomitant fMRI changes in PPC as well as OFC (<a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2006</a>)."

Various rodent paradigms of olfactory associative learning have shown that the direction of piriform pattern changes can flexibly match the behavioral requirements for either odor discrimination (i.e., pattern separation) or odor generalization (i.e., pattern completion). In the current experiment, subjects were asked to perform an odor categorization task, in which differences across categories, but not within category, were emphasized. As such, our experimental design might have helped stabilize category-specific differences in PPC, even in the presence of baclofen, though at the expense of within-category odor separation. The fact that categorical representations of citrus, mint, and wood odors were already highly familiar to the subjects also could have created further stability against across-category pattern changes. Thus, it is fair to say that while we have no evidence to support baclofen-induced disruption of across-category codes, the nature of our task leaves open the possibility that in a different task where categorical distinctions were less relevant, baclofen might have a modulatory influence on across-category differences."

That is to say, pattern representations of the same odor could differ depending on whether the preceding odor belonged to the same category (category repetition, e.g., C1 preceded by C2) or a different category (non-repetition, e.g., C1 preceded by M1). This repetition factor could induce short-term \u2018learning\u2019 or adaptation effects that involve local synaptic interactions mediated by GABA(B) receptors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brenowitz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Ziakopoulos et al., 2000</a>), and thus could be susceptible to baclofen manipulation. Examination of our data indicates that across subjects and pre/post sessions, there were 39.3 \u00b1 0.6 (mean \u00b1 SE) category repetition trials as opposed to 121.5 \u00b1 0.9 category non-repetition trials. That the majority (~75%) of trials in our experiment belonged to non-repetition trials suggests that category repetitions would not have had a pronounced effect on the findings. In additional analyses (see Materials and methods), the proportion of category repetition versus non-repetition trials (per imaging run) was not associated with the strength of pattern categorization effects in PPC, and PPC patterns evoked by <i>the same odor</i> under repetition and non-repetition conditions were not significantly different.

Indeed, baclofen had no perceptual effect on categorical discrimination, and we would argue that such a finding would have been unlikely, presumably due to high familiarity and discriminability of odor categories. However, to the extent that the existence of an odor category necessitates an association between an olfactory stimulus and semantic conceptual knowledge, these results are consistent with the recognized integrative role of OFC in guiding olfactory-based behavior. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated that OFC patterns can differentiate between odor objects and categories (<a href=\"#bib31\">Howard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Critchley and Rolls, 1996</a>).

For example, single-unit recordings from the hippocampus have identified neurons in both humans and monkeys that are able to categorize visual information (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kreiman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hampson et al., 2004</a>), and fMRI activity in human hippocampus is selectively increased when memory performance relies on perceptual generalization across stimuli (<a href=\"#bib58\">Preston et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Shohamy and Wagner, 2008</a>). Considered in this framework, the trend effect of <i>decreased</i> within-category separation in pHIP in placebo subjects may reflect the role of hippocampus to generalize, or to make inferences, across shared odor features, essentially bringing odors of the same category closer together, and creating more separation between different categories (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). It is interesting to note that both piriform cortex and hippocampus have long been regarded as canonical models of autoassociative networks where pattern separation and pattern completion computations can be flexibly achieved (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wilson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Leutgeb and Leutgeb, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hunsaker and Kesner, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">LaRocque et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</a>). That the effect of baclofen was to impede within-category <i>discrimination</i> in PPC, while simultaneously impeding within-category <i>generalization</i> in pHIP, highlights a unique functional difference between these two anatomically homologous regions, and may help bring new mechanistic understanding of the contributions of piriform cortex, hippocampus, and piriform-hippocampal interactions to human olfactory processing and perception."

While it is possible that the 50-mg dose may not have been potent enough to exert a physiological effect, the study medication schedule was similar to those used in other human studies that administered baclofen to induce reliable changes in brain activity or behavior (<a href=\"#bib69\">Terrier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Franklin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Young et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Franklin et al., 2011</a>). In our study, we did not find evidence of drug effect on odor categorization behavior, in spite of significant changes in fMRI pattern representations. There are at least three possibilities to account for this discrepancy. One possibility is that our behavioral tests were simply not sensitive enough to detect changes in perceptual performance. Across both placebo and baclofen groups, there was a general trend towards improved performance, likely reflecting effects of training and exposure. As such, any further subtle effect of baclofen on perception may not have emerged beyond these training effects per se. Related to this, even if the three-way forced-choice pinene triangle test was arguably the most \u2018sensitive\u2019 or difficult test of odor discrimination, this test might not have revealed a significant change if the perceptual learning effects had been confined to those odors presented repeatedly during the fMRI. A second possibility is that because all of the subjects were explicitly informed of the categorical features of the odor stimuli, there may have been an implicit tendency to anchor their perceptual responses to semantic categorical attributes. Moreover, even at baseline, all of the odors were easy to discriminate and highly familiar, and subjects were regularly called upon to make category judgments of the odors throughout the experiment. Thus, even though there was reorganization of categorical representations in PPC, these factors could have obscured our ability to observe perceptual plasticity across the set of odors. Finally, while changes in piriform odor representations might have induced parallel changes in perception, it is possible that other brain areas would be able to compensate for these perturbations, helping to stabilize olfactory perceptual performance. For example, in the placebo group, increased within-category pattern separation in PPC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) would be counteracted by decreased within-category pattern separation in pHIP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>), resulting in no detectable change at the behavioral level."

Therefore, to establish that our findings were specific to the olfactory system, and to ensure that baclofen did not disrupt general semantic processing and object categorization, subjects also performed a visual categorization fMRI task in which they viewed pictures rather than smelled odors. This control study confirmed that our pharmacological manipulation induced both regional and modality specificity, thus ruling out possible confounds such as altered global attention, arousal, or hemodynamic reactivity. As an added way to minimize mere drug effects, we explicitly focused our imaging analyses on the interactions between group (baclofen/placebo), session (pre/post), and category level (within/across), effectively cancelling out any other session-related confounds."

While our findings demonstrate regionally selective treatment effects in PPC, it is not possible to confirm that these changes were due to the direct action of baclofen solely at piriform cortex. There are at least three mechanisms by which baclofen could affect categorization in the olfactory network, none of which are mutually exclusive. First, baclofen might directly target the layer 1b synapses in piriform cortex where associative intracortical and extracortical inputs predominate. This would most closely mirror what has been tested using focal baclofen injections in animal models (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poo and Isaacson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barnes and Wilson, 2014</a>), and would underscore the idea that categorical odor representations rely on associative information processing within this layer of piriform cortex. Second, baclofen might target neurons in OFC, entorhinal cortex, and other associative brain areas that project onto piriform cortex. Given that the fMRI BOLD response is thought to reflect local dendritic processing and population activity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Logothetis and Wandell, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hipp and Siegel, 2015</a>), our findings could reflect a distant action of baclofen on OFC (or other areas), which in turn alters distributed fMRI patterns measured in piriform cortex. Third, the changes seen in PPC could theoretically have arisen in the olfactory bulb, where GABA(B) receptors have also been described (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nickell et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Palouzier-Paulignan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Okutani et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wachowiak et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Isaacson and Vitten, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Karpuk and Hayar, 2008</a>). In this instance, one might have predicted a more profound olfactory perceptual deficit, including impairments of odor threshold, identification, and perceived intensity, though such a profile was not found in our study. Irrespective of the specific mechanism or mechanisms, these findings establish a critical role of the GABA(B) receptor in modulating categorical representations in PPC and OFC, with specificity for the olfactory modality."

                        "text": "In summary, our study provides a foundation for understanding the contribution of afferent and associative inputs to odor categorical perception in the human brain. Of note, this work forms a counterpoint to an earlier study from our lab in which subjects underwent a 7-day period of odor deprivation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wu et al., 2012</a>): by reducing olfactory afferent input, we were able to show that multivariate pattern representations of odor category were selectively altered in OFC, without any pattern-based changes observed in PPC. By comparison, in the current study, we were able to test the inverse manipulation, using baclofen to reduce olfactory associative input. In this instance, we again observed a disruption of odor categorization in OFC, but also an interference of session-related pattern changes in PPC and pHIP. The fact that within-category pattern changes in PPC were complementary to those in pHIP, in conjunction with the different course of across-category changes in OFC, underscores the idea that odor categorization is a dynamic process involving multiple stages of an extended olfactory network. We surmise that under normal conditions, the ability to refine discriminability of within-category odors in PPC through experience helps to improve perceptual acuity and decision making, and to prevent perceptual generalization from becoming maladaptive. With the interruption of associative input, in the setting of experimental baclofen or even perhaps as the consequence of a neurological disorder, within-category boundaries can become obscured, leading to perceptual over-generalization that can result in detrimental choices. As such, our findings may point toward an important mechanism by which associative networks regulate perceptual processing. Whether such mechanisms are restricted to the olfactory modality, or apply more widely across different sensory systems, remains to be determined."

In the pre-drug session, there were no systematic differences in peak flow (F<sub>3.4,105.52</sub> = 1.44, <i>P</i> = 0.23, repeated measures ANOVA) or duration (F<sub>3.97,123.18</sub> = 0.89, P = 0.47) across odors, but the inhalation volumes were different (F<sub>3.93,121.88</sub> = 3.27, P = 0.014). Therefore the inhalation volume was included in the fMRI analysis as a nuisance regressor (see below)."

In this analysis, performed in each subject, the percent of category repetition trials was calculated for each odor in each run, and then these values were regressed against the corresponding measure of PPC categorization strength (indexed as across-category minus within-category pattern distances) for each run. The resulting correlation values from each subject were then submitted to one-sample t-tests or repeated-measures ANOVA across subjects.

This procedure enabled us to directly separate the odor trials into category repetition and non-repetition conditions, and offered a way to test whether patterns evoked by a given odor under the repetition condition were significantly different from the non-repetition condition. Data pre-processing included extraction of fMRI signal intensity from each voxel in PPC for each scanning run, temporal de-trending with a high pass filter (cut-off frequency at 0.01\u00a0Hz), and assembly into linear vectors of trial-specific voxel activity. Trial-by-trial pattern vectors were then sorted into \u2018repetition\u2019 and \u2018non-repetition\u2019 conditions for each of the 6 odors. For example, C1 trials preceded by a same-category trial (either C1 or C2) were assigned as repetition (rep) conditions; C1 trials preceded by a different-category trial (either M1, M2, W1, or W2) were assigned as non-repetition (non-rep) conditions. This procedure was independently applied to each of the 6 odors in turn. Then, for a given odor (e.g., C1), pair-wise correlation coefficients were calculated (1) between all pairwise repetition conditions (e.g., C1<sub>rep</sub> versus C1<sub>rep</sub>), and (2) between repetition and non-repetition conditions (e.g., C1<sub>rep</sub> versus C1<sub>non-rep</sub>). All possible pair-wise correlations were calculated, and then averaged across odors and comparisons. The main prediction was that if trial repetition had an impact on pattern category coding in PPC, then the correlation in (1) would significantly differ from the correlation in (2). Group-wise statistical analysis indicated that there was no difference between the two types of correlations in PPC in the pre-drug session (paired-sample t-test, t<sub>31</sub> = 0.42, P = 0.68), nor did a mixed three-way ANOVA reveal any difference in the interaction of order condition (within/between) \u00d7 session \u00d7 group (two within-subject factors of order condition and session; one between-subject factor of group; F<sub>1,30</sub> = 0.51, P = 0.48)."

For example, one might expect that the MVPA would be very different to C1 after C2 than after W1 for example. This sort of short term \"learning\" or familiarity effect may be highly dependent on local synaptic interactions and thus susceptible to pharmacological manipulation. I would like to know that this ordering effect is either not present (or controlled for) and more importantly that the drug effect is independent of any ordering effect. Or not. If there is such an interaction, there is nothing wrong with that, but it would be an important factor in the interpretation."

If I understand the design correctly, the subjects saw the odors for the first time pre-drug, then for the second time, post-drug. So the odors are novel and then familiar, if they are the same odors. Even if new odors are used the second time around, then the categories are still somewhat novel and then familiar. Either way, novelty is potentially confounded with drug effect. If the odors were not pre-exposed somehow in a serious way on a prior day (i.e. not same day as scanned), then I think this is important to note. This also brings into play effects of drug on consolidation of the initial exposure experience. I actually first thought of this when looking at the data on hippocampus. There is an effect of drug there, but really it looks like it is due to a loss of the normal decline in within-category pattern separation in the hippocampal BOLD response no? It seems to me that this may reflect a hippocampal generalization, essentially bringing closer together odors that are normally spaced far apart (i.e. diff categories) by virtue of their co-occurrence in the scanner/testing situation. Anyway again some consideration of this may be in order."

Thus you might have changes in pattern from one odor to the next in a session or between the sessions (even independent of novelty). Eliminating this factor might give you a much clearer picture of what is happening it seems to me. And the authors have the perfect data to address this in the form of \"same odor\" contrasts. That is, if they analyzed the patterns evoked by the same odor from trial to trial and then took that as a baseline, they should control for such drift. Additionally, the classifier would perform a bit better at this than at within category comparisons. This would validate that there actually is a price to be paid for changing the odor within category. And again, it would be worthwhile to see that there was no effect of drug on this measure. Or to identify if there is an effect, since again this would impact the interpretation I think."

That is, none of the figures show the full set of 8 data points (e.g., bars) in a single figure. Rather, the effect is unpacked via other analyses that involve some subtraction of conditions from one another. In particular, I think the \"categorization index\" might be eliminated altogether (e.g., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Even for 5C (which uses a pre-post subtraction), I think it would be better to start with a figure that shows all of the data (i.e., the 8 bars) and then show the subtracted data. Showing the full set of data would also allow the reader to actually see the relative size of within category and between category distance effects (this is currently 'hidden' because all measures that are shown are pre minus post)."

But, as I note above, I find the categorization index to be a bit confusing and potentially misleading. It reflects the fact that, in PPC, the distance of within-category exemplars decreased relative to across-category exemplars. But I don't see how this is equivalent to \"enhanced odor category coding.\" As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, between-category distances did not change at all as a function of drug condition. This comes up again in the Discussion: \"the net effect of baclofen was to enhance overall categorization in PPC [\u2026] \u201cbut that conclusion does not obviously follow from the findings."

As the authors note in the Discussion (third paragraph), the fact that subjects were tasked with making category-level decisions, but not within-category discriminations, during fMRI scanning may well have been a factor in the observed results. This limitation is not necessarily a critical problem, but it does raise the possibility that baclofen would reduce between-category differences were that distinction not relevant. Thus, while it is safe to conclude that baclofen changed the structure of representations in PPC, it is more difficult to conclude that baclofen selectively alters within-category distances. This caveat may warrant greater emphasis in the Discussion."

Of note, this alternative conceptualization \u2013 greater pattern separation over time in the control subjects \u2013 is in close accordance with an earlier olfactory perceptual learning study from our lab, where prolonged passive exposure to one target odor increased its discriminability from categorically related odors (Li et al., Neuron, 2006).

Across both placebo and baclofen groups, there was a general trend towards improved performance, likely reflecting effects of training and exposure (e.g., thresholds and similarity ratings). As such, any further subtle effect of baclofen on perception may not have emerged beyond these training effects per se. Related to this, even if the three-way forced-choice pinene triangle test was arguably the most \u201csensitive\u201d or difficult test of odor discrimination, this test might not have revealed a significant change if the perceptual learning effects had been confined to those odors presented repeatedly during the fMRI experiment (as opposed to the pinene stimuli which were encountered much less frequently)."

Moreover, even at baseline, all of the odors were easy to discriminate and highly familiar, and subjects were regularly called upon to make category judgments of the odors throughout the experiment. Thus, even though there was reorganization of categorical representations in PPC, these factors could have obscured our ability to observe perceptual plasticity across the set of odors, either for the placebo group or the baclofen group, despite significant group-by-session interactions in PPC."

This procedure enabled us to directly separate the odor trials into category repetition and non-repetition conditions, and offered a way to test whether patterns evoked by a given odor under the repetition condition were significantly different from the non-repetition condition. Data pre-processing included extraction of fMRI signal intensity from each voxel in PPC for each scanning run, temporal de-trending with a high pass filter (cut-off frequency at 0.01Hz), and assembly into linear vectors of trial-specific voxel activity. Trial-by-trial pattern vectors were then sorted into \u201crepetition\u201d and \u201cnon-repetition\u201d conditions for each of the 6 odors. For example, C1 trials preceded by a same-category trial (either C1 or C2) were assigned as repetition (rep) conditions; C1 trials preceded by a different-category trial (either M1, M2, W1, or W2) were assigned as non-repetition (non-rep) conditions. This procedure was independently applied to each of the 6 odors in turn. Then, for a given odor (e.g., C1<sub>rep</sub>), pair-wise correlation coefficients were calculated (1) between all pairwise repetition conditions (e.g., C1<sub>rep</sub> versus C1<sub>rep</sub>), and (2) between repetition and non-repetition conditions (e.g., C1<sub>rep</sub> versus C1<sub>non-rep</sub>). All possible pair-wise correlations were calculated, and then averaged across odors and comparisons. The main prediction was that if trial repetition had an impact on pattern category coding in PPC, then the correlation in (1) would significantly differ from the correlation in (2)."

If I understand the design correctly, the subjects saw the odors for the first time pre-drug, then for the second time, post-drug. So the odors are novel and then familiar, if they are the same odors. Even if new odors are used the second time around, then the categories are still somewhat novel and then familiar. Either way, novelty is potentially confounded with drug effect. If the odors were not pre-exposed somehow in a serious way on a prior day (i.e. not same day as scanned), then I think this is important to note. This also brings into play effects of drug on consolidation of the initial exposure experience. I actually first thought of this when looking at the data on hippocampus. There is an effect of drug there, but really it looks like it is due to a loss of the normal decline in within-category pattern separation in the hippocampal BOLD response no? It seems to me that this may reflect a hippocampal generalization, essentially bringing closer together odors that are normally spaced far apart (i.e. diff categories) by virtue of their co-occurrence in the scanner/testing situation.

Additionally, the classifier would perform a bit better at this than at within category comparisons. This would validate that there actually is a price to be paid for changing the odor within category. And again, it would be worthwhile to see that there was no effect of drug on this measure.
