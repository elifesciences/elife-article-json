Previously, we found that complete <i>Foxc1</i> loss leads to aberrations in proliferation, neuronal differentiation and migration in the embryonic mouse cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib9\">Haldipur et al., 2014</a>). We now demonstrate that hypomorphic <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mice have granule and Purkinje cell abnormalities causing subsequent disruptions in postnatal cerebellar foliation and lamination. Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobule which echoes the posterior vermis DW 'tail sign' observed in human imaging studies. Lineage tracing experiments in <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mouse cerebella indicate that aberrant migration of granule cell progenitors destined to form the posterior-most lobule causes this unique phenotype. Analyses of rare human del chr 6p25 fetal cerebella demonstrate extensive phenotypic overlap with our <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mouse models, validating our DWM models and demonstrating that many key mechanisms controlling cerebellar development are likely conserved between mouse and human."

Previously, we found that complete <i>Foxc1</i> loss leads to aberrations in proliferation, neuronal differentiation and migration in the embryonic mouse cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib9\">Haldipur et al., 2014</a>). We now demonstrate that hypomorphic <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mice have granule and Purkinje cell abnormalities causing subsequent disruptions in postnatal cerebellar foliation and lamination. Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobule which echoes the posterior vermis DW 'tail sign' observed in human imaging studies. Lineage tracing experiments in <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mouse cerebella indicate that aberrant migration of granule cell progenitors destined to form the posterior-most lobule causes this unique phenotype. Analyses of rare human del chr 6p25 fetal cerebella demonstrate extensive phenotypic overlap with our <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mouse models, validating our DWM models and demonstrating that many key mechanisms controlling cerebellar development are likely conserved between mouse and human."

We previously reported that mice homozygous for a <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i>hypomorphic allele are viable as adults and have abnormal cerebellar foliation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>).

By e17.5, however, in <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> mice, <i>Lmx1a-cre</i> marked cells remained restricted to the posterior vermis yet the RL retained an excess of labeled cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Many streams of <i>Lmx1a</i>-lineage marked cells were also aberrantly located within the core of the developing cerebellum in addition to cells normally traversing into the External Granule Layer (EGL) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, arrows). By P0, labelled EGL cells had ectopically migrated anteriorly to the secondary fissure, the anterior boundary of lobule IX in the <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We also observed large numbers of <i>Lmx1a</i>-fate mapped cells along a residual posterior ventricular zone in <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, yellow arrow).

No posterior fossa anomalies were detected either by prenatal ultrasound or autopsy in these control cases. Low magnification images of the H and E stained cerebellar vermis from the control cases indicated\u00a0normal development of the folia. All histogenic layers of the developing cerebellum appeared normal. The EGL was of uniform thickness across the cerebella and the Purkinje cells formed a continuous multilayer Purkinje cell plate under the EGL from the anterior to posterior lobes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). In all del chr 6p25 cases, striking foliation defects of varying severity were observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). In the cerebellum with the least severe DWM phenotype, DW1, the posterior-most lobule, lobule X, was only partially formed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,G</a>). However, the anterior lobules appeared relatively normal. The defects in cerebellar foliation were far more severe in the other two del chr 6p25 cases, DW2 and DW3. In both cases, the vermis was hypoplastic with the most severe hypoplasia and dysplasia readily evident in the posterior vermis, despite obvious artefactual tissue damage. Yet, even the lobules in the anterior vermis were not readily distinguishable, with rudimentary fissures defining several lobules of variably indistinct identity. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Although the posterior-most vermis was missing in DW3, the remaining posterior surface of DW3 was remarkably flat with no recognizable fissures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

These were particularly prominent in DW1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,G\u2013I</a>). For example, at the base of the fissure between lobules IV and V, an ectopic calbindin+ Purkinje cell cluster was evident. Just above this, numerous proliferating Ki67+ Pax6+ GCPs were also apparent. Similar ectopic clusters of Purkinje cells and GCPs were also observed in the other two DW cases (data not shown). A closer analysis of lamination and cellular morphology using calbindin immunohistochemistry to mark Purkinje cells revealed extensive disruptions in all 3 DW cases. In the control cases, the Purkinje cell layer was well-defined, consisting of a distinct multilayer band of cells beneath the molecular layer, above the internal granule layer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). In all three del chr 6p25 cases, Purkinje cells were located in a highly disorganized diffuse layer beneath the EGL. This was most marked in the posterior vermis, although in the more severe cases (DW2 and DW3), Purkinje cells were disorganized anteriorly as well (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013I</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). Higher magnification of calbindin-stained sections revealed that in all 3 DW cases, Purkinje cells also lacked their characteristic dendritic arborization, indicating at least a delay in Purkinje cell development. This was consistent with delayed fissure formation in DW2 and DW3. This may indicate a more fundamental abnormality, since Purkinje cell development was abnormal even in DW1 where global developmental delays in foliation were less apparent (Compare <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a> with D-F).

A few genes have been implicated in rare cases of DWM (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aldinger and Doherty, 2016</a>). Of these, <i>FOXC1</i> is the best studied (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Haldipur et al., 2014</a>), with mutant mouse data demonstrating several important roles for <i>Foxc1</i> in early mouse cerebellar anlage development. Notably, <i>Foxc1</i> expression is largely limited to the posterior fossa mesenchyme rather than the developing cerebellum itself. Complete loss of <i>Foxc1</i> in mice (homozygous null animals) leads to loss of <i>Foxc1</i>-dependent expression of SDF1\u03b1, a secreted factor in the posterior mesenchyme. We previously showed that SDF1\u03b1 acts via its receptor, Cxcr4, which is expressed in cerebellar radial glial cells and is required for both proliferation of these VZ progenitors in addition to maintenance of their radial fibers, which are the migration scaffold for cerebellar GABAergic neurons to reach the cerebellar cortex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Haldipur et al., 2014</a>). Notably, the <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> phenotype is much more severe than that seen in human DWM patients (del chr 6p25), who harbor a deletion of the <i>FOXC1</i> gene, yet retain one intact copy on an unaffected chromosome (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Delahaye et al., 2012</a>). <i>Foxc1<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice have no cerebellar phenotype, however, <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> are postnatal viable and have disrupted cerebellar morphology (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>). We have now shown that <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> mutants display a unique posterior vermis foliation defect that is strikingly similar to that shared with all human del chr 6p25 DWM patients. Using lineage fate mapping in mouse models, we demonstrated that embryonic migration abnormalities of the\u00a0posterior-fated cerebellar RL descendants causes this phenotype in both <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> and <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice and showed that <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> mice also display defects in postnatal cerebellar lamination. Finally, we directly compared the developing mouse <i>Foxc1</i> mutant phenotypes with very rare human del chr 6p25 fetal cases, the first reported in-depth analysis of fetal DWM samples. Strikingly, the human fetal DWM cases and our mouse models share very similar developmental pathogenesis, validating our mouse models and demonstrating that many of the key developmental mechanisms are conserved between the two species."

This \u2018tail sign\u2019 has recently been proposed to be a pathognomonic feature for all DWM (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernardo et al., 2015</a>), irrespective of those with a\u00a0known genetic cause, such as del chr 6p25. Strikingly, the human DWM tail is highly reminiscent of the partially formed,\u00a0unpaired posterior lobule we observed in the postnatal <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> mutant mouse cerebellar vermis. This phenotype appears to be unique as we are unaware of any other mouse mutant with this foliation defect. Through lineage tracing experiments, we showed extensive ectopic migration of posterior-fated cerebellar RL descendants in both <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> and <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. These ectopic paths included the mutant VZ. Cerebellar progenitor fate switches have been implicated in human cerebellar agenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Pascual et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Millen et al., 2014</a>). We therefore tested if the mutant ectopic RL derived cells in the VZ or anlage showed evidence of a RL to VZ fate switch. However, all <i>Lmx1a-cre</i> lineage labeled cells maintained Pax6 expression indicative of a RL lineage identity. We conclude that the <i>Foxc1</i> mutant posterior vermis phenotype is mostly due to misguided migration of RL-derived cells."

We have demonstrated that loss of SDF1\u03b1 can rescue <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cerebellar phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Haldipur et al., 2014</a>). At e12.5, when Foxc1 expression is initiated in the posterior fossa mesenchyme overlying the cerebellum, SDF1\u03b1 expression is significantly downregulated in both <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> embryos at e12.5 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Since SDF1\u03b1 is expressed in the\u00a0mouse posterior fossa mesenchyme prior to e12.5 ([<a href=\"#bib12\">Lein et al., 2007</a>], Website: \u00a9 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas [Internet]. Available from: <a href=\"http://mouse.brain-map.org.\">http://mouse.brain-map.org.</a>), we conclude that <i>Foxc1</i> is required to maintain, but not initiate, SDF1\u03b1. This maintenance role is key to understanding the increased vulnerability of the posterior vermis in <i>Foxc1</i> mouse mutants and human del chr 6p25 DWM. Previous studies have shown that SDF1\u03b1 secreted by embryonic meningeal cells embryonically acts as a chemoattractant, regulating the tangential migration of Cxcr4+ GCPs away from the RL to form the EGL (<a href=\"#bib23\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Haldipur et al., 2014</a>). The cerebellar RL generates assorted glutamatergic brain stem nuclei and cerebellar nuclei in\u00a0the mouse at\u00a0e10.5 and anteriorly fated GCPs just before e12.5 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Machold and Fishell, 2005</a>). By e12.5, only posterior vermis-fated GCPs and unipolar brush cells remain in the RL to emerge over the remaining days of mouse embryogenesis. Our new data clearly demonstrates that these late derivatives are absolutely dependent on continued SDF1\u03b1 expression which itself is dependent on <i>Foxc1</i>. Our data also confirm previous studies showing a role for SDF1\u03b1 as a chemoattractant in the developing pia to maintain GCPs within the proliferating outer zone of the developing\u00a0EGL adjacent to the pial surface (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hartmann et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Wiegand et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Zou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Reiss et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Zhu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Vilz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Tiveron and Cremer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Yu et al., 2010</a>). In <i>Foxc1</i> mutants, SDF1\u03b1 is not maintained at appropriate levels, leading to an additional phenotype of ectopic proliferating EGL cells within the cerebellar anlage in both the anterior and posterior vermis. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that the posterior fossa mesenchyme, through SDF1\u03b1 expression, preserves the structure of both the RL and the nascent EGL. By ensuring that cells correctly exit the RL and remain within the GCP niche of the EGL, the mesenchyme regulates the\u00a0proper formation and lamination of cerebellar folia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

In the wild-type cerebellum, mesenchymal Foxc1 controls the expression of chemokine SDF1\u03b1 which binds to its receptor Cxcr4 which is strongly expressed in the RL, EGL, and VZ. SDF1\u03b1 functions as a chemoattractant to Lmx1a+ (red) and Lmx1a- (blue) GCPs exiting the RL to form the EGL, ensuring that these progenitors exit the RL and remain confined to the EGL underneath the pial surface. SDF1\u03b1 also controls the\u00a0migration of cells out of the VZ, acting as a chemoattractant. It is also required for the maintenance of radial glial fibers, which act as scaffolds for this migration. (<b>B</b>) In the <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></i> mice, deletion of <i>Foxc1</i> leads to a significant downregulation of mesenchymal SDF1\u03b1 by e12.5.

Direct comparisons between developing human fetal tissue with known genetic lesions and mouse developmental models of comparable genotypes are extremely rare in literature. All three human del chr 6p25 fetal DWM fetal cases we assessed here exhibited a striking dysplasia of the posterior vermis and also had ectopically located GCPs and Purkinje cells and dysmorphic and sparse Bergmann glial fibers. The phenotypes observed in the del chr 6p25 cerebella are similar to those observed in the <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse, providing ample evidence of the validity of our <i>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> DWM models."

First, it is clear that some of the mechanisms we have attributed to posterior vermis hypoplasia in human DWM based on our <i>Foxc1</i> mouse models have not been directly validated in the human cerebellum. The human fetal DWM cases presented here are snapshots of three separate dysmorphic cerebella at specific stages of development (18\u201321 gw). Given the clinical constraints of human fetal tissue research and the rarity of genetically defined malformation cases, a thorough study of multiple stages of abnormal prenatal cerebellar development will be nearly impossible. We cannot define the developmental progression of these specific cases with their respective phenotypes, nor can we predict their phenotypic outcomes if the pregnancies had continued. Further, since DWM is not currently readily diagnosed by imaging until 18 gw, it is likely impossible to obtain earlier cases. However, human fetal analysis, as we have presented here, is essential because it is the only analysis that is possible. Animal models are required to investigate potential mechanisms and our current work clearly validates our <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mouse models. Since our mouse models indicate that human del chr 6p25 DWM is largely due to a disruption of early mesenchymal signaling and aberrant rhombic lip development, a long term goal is to develop human fetal imaging technology and protocols targeted to these phenotypes to facilitate earlier detection and perhaps provide therapeutic intervention."

We show that early disruption in mesenchymal signaling has immediate effects, including mismigration of Purkinje cells and GCPs from both the RL and EGL. There are both direct and indirect repercussions on later developmental events that lead to abnormal foliation, posterior vermis hypoplasia, developmental delays, and abnormal layering of Purkinje cells. Together our human and mouse analyses provide compelling evidence to support our model of Foxc1 control of cerebellar development and developmental pathogenesis of <i>FOXC1</i>-dependent DWM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Notably, however, human del chr 6p25 DWM cases are rare. An essential question remains as to whether the key features and mechanisms we have elucidated for <i>Foxc1</i>-dependent DWM are generalizable to all forms of DWM, regardless of the underlying genotype."

The authors have identified a previously uncharacterized migration defect of granule cell progenitors in <i>Foxc1</i> mutant mice suggesting that <i>Foxc1</i> regulates expansion and foliation of the posterior lobe via signals originated from the posterior fossa mesenchyme in mice and humans. This study is novel by providing in-depth and direct comparisons between the human fetal brain and mouse models for disease DWM and is also valuable for insight on the degree of conservation in mechanisms controlling cerebellar development between humans and mice. Therefore, it is worthy of consideration for publication in <i>eLife</i>. However, there are a number of specific concerns shared by the reviewers primarily related problems in the depth of the characterization of mouse <i>Foxc1</i> mutant cerebella that must be addressed before publication can be considered."

The reviewer is correct in pointing out that the tail sign described by Bernardo et al. is not linked to posterior vermis hypoplasia in their study.
