                    "text": "A common strategy by which bacterial pathogens reside in humans is by shifting from a virulent lifestyle, (systemic infection), to a dormant carrier state. Two major serovars of <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, Typhi and Typhimurium, have evolved a two-component regulatory system to exist inside <i>Salmonella</i>-containing vacuoles in the macrophage, as well as to persist as asymptomatic biofilms in the gallbladder. Here we present evidence that SsrB, a transcriptional regulator encoded on the SPI-2 pathogenicity-island, determines the switch between these two lifestyles by controlling ancestral and horizontally-acquired genes. In the acidic macrophage vacuole, the kinase SsrA phosphorylates SsrB, and SsrB~P relieves silencing of virulence genes and activates their transcription. In the absence of SsrA, unphosphorylated SsrB directs transcription of factors required for biofilm formation specifically by activating <i>csgD</i> (<i>agfD</i>), the master biofilm regulator by disrupting the silenced, H-NS-bound promoter. Anti-silencing mechanisms thus control the switch between opposing lifestyles."

Two major serovars of <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, Typhi and Typhimurium, have evolved a two-component regulatory system to exist inside <i>Salmonella</i>-containing vacuoles in the macrophage, as well as to persist as asymptomatic biofilms in the gallbladder. Here we present evidence that SsrB, a transcriptional regulator encoded on the SPI-2 pathogenicity-island, determines the switch between these two lifestyles by controlling ancestral and horizontally-acquired genes. In the acidic macrophage vacuole, the kinase SsrA phosphorylates SsrB, and SsrB~P relieves silencing of virulence genes and activates their transcription. In the absence of SsrA, unphosphorylated SsrB directs transcription of factors required for biofilm formation specifically by activating <i>csgD</i> (<i>agfD</i>), the master biofilm regulator by disrupting the silenced, H-NS-bound promoter. Anti-silencing mechanisms thus control the switch between opposing lifestyles."

Previous studies have uncovered a regulatory system that controls the decision in <i>Salmonella</i>, which is made up of two proteins called SsrA and SsrB. To trigger the disease-causing lifestyle, SsrA is activated and adds a phosphate group onto SsrB. This in turn causes SsrB to bind to and switch on disease-associated genes in the bacterium. However, it was less clear how the biofilm lifestyle was triggered."

A human-restricted serovar of <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, serovar Typhi, causes typhoid fever and continues to be a dangerous pathogen throughout the world. <i>Salmonella</i> lives as a facultative pathogen in various natural and artificial environments as independent planktonic cells, cooperative swarms (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harshey and Matsuyama, 1994</a>) or as multi-cellular communities called biofilms (see <a href=\"#bib40\">Steenackers et al., 2012</a> for a review). Upon successful invasion of host cells, <i>Salmonella</i> is phagocytosed by macrophages, where it resides in a modified vacuole in a self-nourishing niche called a Salmonella-Containing Vacuole (SCV). This intracellular lifestyle eventually adversely affects the host. <i>Salmonella</i> also resides as multi-cellular communities on intestinal epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boddicker et al., 2002</a>), gallstones (<a href=\"#bib36\">Prouty et al., 2002</a>) and tumors (<a href=\"#bib12\">Crull et al., 2011</a>). It is believed that biofilms in the gall bladder are important for maintaining the carrier state, allowing <i>Salmonella</i> to persist (<a href=\"#bib11\">Crawford et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "Each of these lifestyles of <i>Salmonella</i> are regulated by two-component regulatory systems (TCRS). TCRSs are comprised of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. The virulence genes of <i>Salmonella</i> are encoded on horizontally acquired AT-rich segments of the genome called Salmonella Pathogenecity Islands (SPIs), and are also tightly regulated by TCRSs. For example, the SsrA/B TCRS is essential for the activation of the SPI-2 regulon genes encoding a type-three secretory needle and effectors that are involved in formation of the SCV (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cirillo et al., 1998</a>). Interestingly, the SsrA/B system itself is regulated by upstream two-component systems such as EnvZ/OmpR and PhoP/Q, which regulate gene expression in response to changes in osmolality, pH and the presence of anti-microbial peptides (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fields et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miller et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Feng et al., 2003</a>). The <i>ssrA</i> and <i>ssrB</i> genes are present on the SPI-2 pathogenecity island adjacent to each other and are regulated by a set of divergent promoters (<a href=\"#bib15\">Feng et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ochman et al., 1996</a>). Under acidic pH and low osmolality, the <i>ssrA</i> and <i>ssrB</i> genes are transcriptionally activated by the binding of OmpR~P and PhoP~P to their promoters (<a href=\"#bib15\">Feng et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bijlsma and Groisman, 2005</a>; Walthers and Kenney unpublished) whose levels are in turn regulated by the respective sensor kinases, EnvZ and PhoQ. SsrA is a tripartite membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase that undergoes a series of intra-molecular phosphorylation reactions before it transfers the phosphoryl group to the N-terminal aspartate residue of the response regulator, SsrB."

The X-ray crystal structure of NarL revealed that the C-terminal DNA binding domain was occluded by the N-terminus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baikalov et al., 1996</a>), and phosphorylation was predicted to relieve this inhibition. Full-length SsrB is unstable in solution, but an isolated C-terminal domain of SsrB, SsrBc, is capable of binding to the regulatory regions of nine genes belonging to the SPI-2 regulon, including <i>ssrA</i> and <i>ssrB</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feng et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Walthers et al., 2007</a>) and activating transcription. A role for SsrB~P was identified by its dual function as a direct transcriptional activator and as an anti-silencer of H-NS-mediated repression (<a href=\"#bib42\">Walthers et al., 2007</a>). The Histone like Nucleoid Structuring protein H-NS is involved in silencing many of the SPI-2 regulon genes in accordance with its role in binding to xenogenic AT-rich sequences and repressing their expression (<a href=\"#bib42\">Walthers et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Navarre et al., 2006</a>). H-NS binding to DNA leads to the formation of a stiff nucleoprotein filament which is essential in gene silencing (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Winardhi et al., 2015</a>).

This switch is achieved merely by the ability of unphosphorylated SsrB to function as an anti-repressor of H-NS and the additional role of SsrB~P in activating SPI-2 transcription (<a href=\"#bib43\">Walthers et al., 2011</a>)."

After seven days, each of the 14028s and <i>ssrA</i> mutant plates showed the appearance of rough, dry and red macrocolonies. However, the <i>ssrB</i> null strain exhibited a smooth, wet and pale brown morphotype which showed a poor ability to exhibit a multicellular phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The absence of Congo Red staining in the <i>ssrB</i> strain also indicated that there were greatly reduced levels of extracellular curli fibers in the macrocolony. These fibers form one of the key components of the extra-cellular matrix of a <i>Salmonella</i> biofilm. To examine the levels of cellulose, the other main component of the extra-cellular matrix, the three strains were grown on Calcofluor plates. The macrocolonies formed by 14028s and <i>ssrA</i> appeared white under UV, as cellulose binds the Calcofluor fluorescent dye (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The dull and non-white macrocolony produced by the <i>ssrB</i> null strain was starkly different, indicating again a poor extracellular matrix."

After allowing the cells to attach for 1h, flow commenced and the growing biofilms were monitored daily for six days. Each day, the flow cell was removed, and the glass-attached cells were stained with SYTO-9 green, a fluorescent dye that stains nucleic acids. The cells were then imaged using fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The figure clearly shows that for the wild type strain, the attached biomass not only increased progressively in size, but also in its complexity of design. This correlated with the appearance of typical mushroom-like constituent microcolonies by around 2 days. Such type of mature biofilms were never observed in the <i>ssrB</i> null strain and even after 6 days it failed to form biofilms, as evident by fewer and thinly attached clusters of SYTO-9 green-labeled cells."

SsrA is a tripartite sensor kinase that is presumably autophosphorylated by ATP at His405, followed by intra-molecular phosphorylation reactions at Asp739 and His867, based on homology to other tripartite kinases. His867 would then participate in the transfer reaction of the phosphoryl group to Asp56 in the N-terminus of SsrB. To confirm that SsrA-dependent phosphorylation was not required for SsrB-mediated regulation of biofilms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013G</a>), we examined biofilm formation of <i>Salmonella</i> strains possessing H405Q, D739A and H867Q mutations in <i>ssrA</i> (Walthers and Kenney unpublished) and compared them to the wild type, <i>ssrA</i> and <i>ssrB</i> null mutants.

We noted that the SsrA/B system also responded to similar environmental conditions such as acidic pH and low osmolality. Furthermore, H-NS, a known repressor of SPI-2 genes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Walthers et al., 2007</a>), was also known to regulate the expression of <i>csgD</i> in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S.</i> Typhimurium (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ogasawara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gerstel et al., 2003</a>).

Normalized levels of <i>csgD</i> transcripts were highly up-regulated in the <i>ssrB hns</i> double mutant compared to the <i>ssrB</i> null strain, indicating that the loss of H-NS repression rescued the defect in <i>csgD</i> expression in the absence of SsrB. Expression of <i>csgD</i> was slightly higher than the wild type levels in the <i>hns</i> single mutant and the <i>ssrB hns</i> double mutant, which also correlated with their biofilm capabilities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Since the levels of <i>csgD</i> transcripts were equal in the <i>hns</i> and <i>ssrB hns</i> null strains, it seemed likely that SsrB influenced <i>csgD</i> expression by silencing H-NS-mediated repression and not by direct activation of transcription, which requires phosphorylation for a productive interaction with RNA\u00a0polymerase (<a href=\"#bib43\">Walthers et al., 2011</a>)."

Thus, it was of interest to determine how SsrB relieved H-NS silencing at <i>csgD</i>. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize the <i>csgDEFG-csgBAC</i> intergenic region and examined the effect of addition of full-length SsrB, D56A SsrB and SsrBc (DNA binding domain alone). Surprisingly, we observed binding of SsrB, D56A SsrB and SsrBc to distinct regions of the <i>csgD</i> regulatory region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). Binding occured at low protein concentrations, suggesting high affinity interactions and showed that unphosphorylated SsrB was capable of binding <i>csgD</i>. An SsrB mutant, K179A, that was incapable of binding DNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carroll et al., 2009</a>) did not bind <i>csgD</i> even at 300 nM, indicting that binding was specific (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E and F</a>). Closer examination revealed a sharp curvature at the regions where SsrB was bound to <i>csgD</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, arrows). This result indicates that, like its NarL homologue (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maris et al., 2002</a>), SsrB bends DNA upon binding, as predicted (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carroll et al., 2009</a>). We estimate that on average, binding of SsrB to the <i>csgDEFG-csgBAC</i> intergenic sequence occurred with a bending angle of around 82\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> for naked DNA). The observation that SsrB bending was more severe than NarL (82\u00b0 compared to the 42\u00b0 of NarLc at its cognate palindrome) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maris et al., 2002</a>), likely contributes to its ability to promote anti-silencing."

Interestingly, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A(ii)</a> also indicates that H-NS continued to form straight nucleoprotein complexes in regions devoid of SsrB (yellow line), i.e. H-NS was still bound to some regions of DNA when SsrB was also bound. Similar binding behavior with D56A SsrB and SsrBc at the H-NS-bound <i>csgD</i> regulatory region was also observed (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>), and similar binding patterns were observed in solution AFM (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>).

Thus, unphosphorylated SsrB can bind to the <i>csgD</i> regulatory region when it has been coated with the repressor H-NS. Anti-silencing results from SsrB-induced local topological changes in the DNA, in part as a result of its bending ability (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

Successful acquisition and integeration of laterally acquired genes into the native genome of pathogens leads to novel capabilities enabling their survival in a wide range of environmental stresses.

This event controls the fate of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium, resulting in either acute or chronic, but asymptomatic infection.

SsrB binding and bending at the <i>csgD</i> promoter causes a sufficient change in the DNA secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>) that likely enables access for RNA polymerase, stimulating <i>csgD</i> transcription. It is interesting to note that SsrB is located on the SPI-2 pathogenicity island, and thus was acquired as <i>Salmonella enterica</i> diverged from <i>Salmonella bongori</i>. However, the capability to form biofilms is an ancestral trait, as phylogeny studies have shown that most of the natural or clinical isolates of <i>Salmonella</i> belonging to all the five sub-groups form rdar colonies (<a href=\"#bib45\">White and Surette, 2006</a>). The SsrB response regulator can control two distinct lifestyle choices: the ability to assemble a type three secretory system and survive in the macrophage vacuole or the ability to form biofilms on gallstones in the gall bladder to establish the carrier state."

Our early experiments indicated that SsrA and SsrB were uncoupled from one another (i.e., SsrB was present in the absence of SsrA) and <i>ssrA</i> transcription was completely dependent on OmpR (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feng et al., 2004</a>). The EnvZ/OmpR system is stimulated by a decrease in cytoplasmic pH when <i>Salmonella</i> enters the macrophage vacuole (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chakraborty et al., 2015</a>). This may also be the stimulus for activating SsrA, since the <i>Salmonella</i> cytoplasm acidifies to pH 5.6 during infection and the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (EnvZc) was sufficient for signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chakraborty et al., 2015</a>). Previous reports also identified a role for PhoP in <i>ssrA</i> translation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bijlsma and Groisman, 2005</a>), which would further add to fluctuating SsrA levels. The present work describes a novel role for the unphosphorylated response regulator SsrB in de-repressing H-NS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We show that under biofilm-inducing conditions, unphosphorylated SsrB is sufficient to activate the expression of <i>csgD</i>.

Because the anti-silencing style of gene regulation is indirect and does not rely on specific DNA interactions, searching for SsrB binding sites has not been informative in uncovering this type of regulation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tomljenovic-Berube et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Worley et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shea et al., 1996</a>).

Furthermore, previous microarray studies disrupted both <i>ssrA</i> and <i>ssrB</i>, which would not uncover a distinct role for SsrB in gene regulation under non SPI-2-inducing conditions in the absence of the SsrA kinase. It is worth mentioning here that in our AFM images, it was apparent that H-NS was still bound to some regions of the <i>csgD</i> promoter when SsrB condensed the DNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A(ii)</a>). Thus, H-NS does not have to be completely stripped off the DNA for de-repression to occur, a finding that was also evident in our previous studies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2010</a>) and others (<a href=\"#bib46\">Will et al., 2014</a>)."

This DNA binding property of SsrB is distinct from H-NS, which forms rigid nucleoprotein filaments and thus straight DNA conformations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A(i)</a>). Bent DNA is therefore an energetically unfavorable substrate for H-NS binding, and a likely mechanism of SsrB-mediated anti-silencing of H-NS repressed genes. SsrB-dependent displacement of H-NS is more energetically favored to occur predominantly at the ends of H-NS-bound filaments, which requires disruption of fewer H-NS protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Winardhi et al., 2015</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In an equal mixture of H-NS and SsrB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A(ii)</a>), we do not see evidence of sharply bent filaments. This is expected because H-NS dissociation is likely restricted to the filament ends. Such events occur due to the cooperative nature of H-NS binding that results in a chain of linked H-NS proteins. Hence, H-NS displacement by SsrB likely occurs progressively from the filament end. This behavior has been observed in our single-molecule stretching experiments with H-NS filaments in the presence of SsrB. This ability of H-NS to re-orient on the DNA without being released would also promote its re-binding and silencing when SsrB or other anti-silencers are released (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

SsrB is in the NarL/FixJ subfamily, which possess a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in the C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baikalov et al., 1996</a>). NarL was the first full-length structure of a response regulator and it showed that the N-terminal phosphorylation domain physically blocked the recognition helix in the HTH motif (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maris et al., 2002</a>). Thus, phosphorylation is required to relieve the inhibition of the N-terminus. In the results presented herein, it is apparent that SsrB has adapted to relieving H-NS-silencing and that phosphorylation is not required for this behavior, nor is it required for DNA binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

This leads to the production of CsgD, the master regulator of biofilms. It is noteworthy that a laterally acquired gene product, SsrB, has evolved the job of regulating the levels of <i>csgD,</i> a transcriptional regulator encoded by the core genome. For this activity, phosphorylation of SsrB was not required, which is rare amongst response regulators. Furthermore, we identify H-NS as a repressor of <i>csgD</i> in <i>Salmonella</i>, instead of an activator (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerstel et al., 2003</a>). This unifies the regulation of CsgD by H-NS in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ogasawara et al., 2010</a>) and <i>Salmonella</i>. This work places SsrB at a unique decision point in the choice between lifestyles by <i>Salmonella</i> and makes it crucial for the entire gamut of pathogenesis, i.e., biofilms and virulence."

First we learn that SsrA is not required for the biofilm phenotype. So it could be unphosphorylated B or B could be phosphorylated by an alternate donor. Then we learn that general donors like acetyl-P are not involved. So it could be unphosphorylated or there could be some sort of unknown cross talk with another sensor kinase. Finally we learn that Asp56, the residue phosphorylated by SsrA, can be mutated to an alanine and the protein still functions with respect to biofilm formation (but not SPI2 gene activation). This is good genetic evidence that the protein induces biofilm formation in an unphosphorylated form."

They then analyzed the colonies formed in a microfluidic chamber in M9 medium in a flow cell and in cholesterol coated eppendorf tubes to further substantiate the biofilm phenotype. The authors provide support for the lack of phosphorylation of SsrB being what is necessary for SPI2 regulation of curli genes responsible for biofilms by using SsrB phosphorylation deficient bacteria, with mutations in SsrA and the ability to produce acetyl phosphate. The requirement of SsrB to form biofilms was repressed by deletion of H-NS providing in vivo evidence that SsrB could act by competing or silencing H-NS based repression. The authors then provide evidence that SsrB/HNS bind to the Csg promoter responsible for the synthesis of curli. The results add to our knowledge of <i>Salmonellae</i> gene regulation of biofilm formation, but do not really define where and how this may occur in vivo and/or what specific environmental conditions would lead to activation but not phosphorylation of SsrB."

They then analyzed the colonies formed in a microfluidic chamber in M9 medium in a flow cell and in cholesterol coated eppendorf tubes to further substantiate the biofilm phenotype The authors provide support for the lack of phosphorylation of SsrB being what is necessary for SPI2 regulation of curli genes responsible for biofilms by using SsrB phosphorylation deficient bacteria, with mutations in SsrA and the ability to produce acetyl phosphate. The requirement of SsrB to form biofilms was repressed by deletion of H-NS providing in vivo evidence that SsrB could act by competing or silencing H-NS based repression. The authors then provide evidence that SsrB/HNS bind to the csg promoter responsible for the synthesis of curli.

This DNA binding property is distinct from H-NS, which forms rigid nucleoprotein filaments and thus straight DNA conformations. Bent DNA is therefore an energetically unfavorable substrate for H-NS binding, and a likely mechanism of SsrB-mediated anti-silencing of H-NS repressed genes. In a mixture of 600 nM H-NS and 600 nM SsrB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), we do not see evidence of sharply bent filaments. This is expected because H-NS dissociation is likely restricted to the filament ends. Such events occur due to the cooperative nature of H-NS binding that results in a chain of linked H-NS proteins. Hence, H-NS displacement by SsrB likely occurs progressively from the filament end. Indeed, we observed slow progressive H-NS filament dissociation in the presence of SsrB in single-molecule stretching experiments.

The main novel aspects of the findings described in the manuscript are: 1. Demonstration that the SsrB response regulator is a molecular switch, reciprocally controlling two sets of traits associated with virulence (the expression of a type III secretion system) and biofilm formation; (2) Defining an active function for an un-phosphorylated response regulator; (3) Elucidation of a novel regulatory mechanism for a response regulator activity (anti-silencing) by DNA bending and (4) evolutionary implications for acquisition of a regulatory system by horizontal gene transfer, controlling the expression of core, chromosomal genes. Overall, this paper contains substantial amount of new results (in quality and in quantity) and represents information with broad interest to those readers who are interested in new molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, strategies of pathogenic organism capable of causing acute and chronic infections and their evolution. This is important work, established a new paradigm for two-component signaling. The only concern is with a few technical points related to certain experiments and a need for a few additional controls.</i>"
