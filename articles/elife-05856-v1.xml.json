Moreover, gene expression noise would seem to impede the evolution of accurate gene regulation, and previous investigations have provided circumstantial evidence that natural selection has acted to lower noise levels. By evolving synthetic <i>Escherichia coli</i> promoters de novo, we here show that, contrary to expectations, promoters exhibit low noise by default. Instead, selection must have acted to increase the noise levels of highly regulated <i>E. coli</i> promoters. We present a general theory of the interplay between gene expression noise and gene regulation that explains these observations. The theory shows that propagation of expression noise from regulators to their targets is not an unwanted side-effect of regulation, but rather acts as a rudimentary form of regulation that facilitates the evolution of more accurate regulation."

These experiments revealed that, contrary to expectation, most lab-evolved promoters had low levels of noise. On the other hand, many natural promoters had high levels of noise. Wolf et al. also found that noisy promoters tend to be highly regulated by transcription factors: the proteins that control gene expression by binding to promoter regions. Together, these results imply that unregulated promoters start by having low noise as a default state. Selection pressures must then have caused some <i>E. coli</i> promoters to become regulated by transcription factors and raise their noise levels.

However, transcription factors are themselves noisy, and this noise necessarily propagates to their target genes. Wolf et al. have now developed a general theory showing that this noise-propagation can often benefit an organism. This explains why natural selection can favor an increase in noise levels for regulated genes. Importantly, by showing that the main role of a transcription factor can be to increase the noise of its targets, it suddenly becomes very easy to see how new gene regulatory interactions can evolve from scratch. The next steps in understanding of how gene expression noise evolves will involve manipulating the expression noise of a gene, and measuring how selection acts on such changes."

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as \u2018expression noise\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blake et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Raser and O'Shea, 2005</a>). Much progress has been gained in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying noise in gene expression, and noise in transcription in particular (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib30\">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</a>). In the simplest scenario, basic thermodynamic fluctuations and Brownian motion of the molecular players would cause transcription initiation at a given promoter to occur with a constant probability per unit time, and the corresponding mRNAs to decay with a constant probability per unit time, leading to a Poissonian steady-state distribution in the number of transcripts. Although such Poissonian fluctuations are observed for some genes, most genes exhibit much larger fluctuations in their mRNA copy number. It is generally believed that such increased variability originates in promoters stochastically switching between different states that are associated with different transcription initiation rates. In the simplest scenario, promoters stochastically switch between an \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 state, producing \u2018bursts\u2019 of transcript while in the on state, and this would lead to increased noise as has been well understood theoretically (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kepler and Elston, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Paulsson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Shahrezaei and Swain, 2008</a>). However, events such as the stochastic binding and unbinding of transcription factors (TFs), or modifications of the local chromatin state, would generally cause most promoters to switch between a much larger number of different states. Moreover, the extent of promoter state switching would be expected to depend on the specific promoter architecture. Indeed, several studies have shown that different promoters show different amounts of gene expression noise, and that these differences are, at least to some extent, encoded in the promoter sequence (<a href=\"#bib24\">Newman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hornung et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Silander et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jones, et al., 2014</a>)."

On the one hand, it can be argued that in each condition there is an optimal expression level for each protein, such that variations away from this optimal level are detrimental to an organism's fitness, implying that selection will act to minimize noise. Indeed, by investigating the association between expression noise and various statistics that can be considered proxies of organismal fitness, several studies have provided evidence that selection generally acts to minimize noise (<a href=\"#bib24\">Newman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barkai and Shilo, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lehner, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lehner, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Silander et al., 2012</a>). In this interpretation, genes with lowest noise have been most strongly selected against noise, whereas high noise genes have experienced much weaker selection against noise. On the other hand, gene expression noise generates phenotypic diversity between organisms with identical genotypes, and there are well-established theoretical models showing that such phenotypic diversity can be selected for in fluctuating environments (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bull, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</a>). In support of such theoretical models, a number of studies provided examples in which there is a positive association between expression noise and growth (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blake et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bishop et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ackermann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). It is thus possible that some of the genes with elevated noise may have been selected for phenotypic diversity."

To address this, we evolved a large set of synthetic <i>Escherichia coli</i> promoters de novo in the laboratory using an experimental protocol in which promoter sequences were selected on the basis of the mean expression level they conferred, while experiencing virtually no selection on their noise properties (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We synthesized a pool of random DNA sequences, 100\u2013150 base pairs in length, and cloned these upstream of a sequence containing a strong ribosomal binding site and the open reading frame of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Beginning with a library of more than 1 million random promoter clones, we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to select cells expressing specific levels of GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). After sorting, we used PCR mutagenesis to input more genetic variation into the library of promoters and repeated the sorting. After the initial FACS sort, this strategy of mutagenesis followed by FACS was repeated four times. The result was a genetically diverse collection of functional promoters that conferred expression close to a pre-specified target level. We selected a subset of 479 synthetic promoters from the third and fifth rounds of FACS selection, choosing equal numbers of promoters from each of six replicate lineages we evolved (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We then used flow cytometry, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib33\">Silander et al., 2012</a>), to measure the distribution of fluorescence levels per cell for each synthetic promoter, as well as for all native <i>E. coli</i> promoters (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zaslaver et al., 2006</a>). We used quantitative Western blotting to confirm that the mean fluorescence levels were directly proportional to GFP molecule numbers (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>), which allowed us to express fluorescence levels in units of numbers of GFP molecules."

We evolved populations of synthetic promoters by performing five rounds of selection and mutation on this library. In each round we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to select 2 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells that lie within a gate comprising the 5% of the population closest in fluorescence to a given target level. Next, plasmids were isolated from the selected cells and PCR mutagenesis was used to introduce new genetic variation into the promoters. We then re-cloned the mutated promoters into fresh plasmids and transformed them into a fresh population of cells. We performed this evolutionary scheme on three replicate populations in which we selected for a target expression level equal to the median expression level (50th percentile) of all native <i>E. coli</i> promoters and three replicate populations in which we selected for a target expression level at the 97.5th percentile of all native promoters (referred to here as medium and high expression levels, respectively).

First, the only differences between the different constructs are the promoter sequence inserts. Consequently, the mRNAs of the different reporters are almost identical, varying only by the short sequence segment between the transcription start site and the constant part of the construct. Second, the reporters were constructed specifically to measure transcription, and feature a constant 5\u2032 UTR part upstream of the start codon of the GFP gene, including a strong ribosomal binding site (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zaslaver et al., 2006</a>). Using qPCR we confirmed that protein levels were determined primarily by mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). Because protein decay and dilution rates are identical for all reporters, this implies translation rates vary little across the reporters. Although we have not explicitly measured mRNA decay rates of the reporters, we presume that, because the mRNAs are nearly identical, and because translation rates vary little across the reporters, mRNA decay rates likely vary also only moderately across the reporters. Finally, we note that noise levels were reproducible across biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), and noise levels estimated using microscopy were consistent with those measured by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

We next aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of these two observations. Perhaps the simplest interpretation of the observation that natural selection must have increased the noise levels of some promoters is that these promoters were directly selected for increased noise. Several theoretical treatments have shown that phenotypic variability may be selectively beneficial when environments change in ways that cannot be accurately sensed or are too rapid for organisms to respond (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bull, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haccou and Iwasa, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</a>), with the phenotypic variability acting as a \u2018bet hedging\u2019 strategy. Thus, it is conceivable that selection has directly selected for increased noise as a bet hedging strategy for a subset of promoters, and more recent theoretical work shows that increasing gene expression noise may indeed increase population growth rates in some scenarios (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tanase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</a>). However, this interpretation does not explain the association between noise and regulation. On the contrary, one would naively expect that bet hedging strategies function as an alternative to gene regulation, that is, when implementing sensing and regulation would be either too difficult or too costly to evolve (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</a>)."

Indeed, any regulator will have some noise in its expression or activity, and this noise will be propagated to its target genes. Consequently, this \u2018noise-propagation\u2019 effect will cause an increase in expression noise of the targets (<a href=\"#bib38\">Thattai and van Oudenaarden, 2001</a>). Although noise-propagation is a plausible explanation for the general association between noise and regulation, its effects are detrimental to the accuracy of expression regulation, and one might thus expect natural selection to have acted to minimize its effects, for example, by minimizing the expression fluctuations in regulators. It would thus appear difficult to reconcile our observation that high noise promoters must have experienced selection to increase their noise levels with the assumption that selection has acted to minimize noise-propagation. Instead, our observations would be better explained by a scenario in which noise-propagation is positively selected for."

In its natural habitat, the population experiences a number of different environments <i>e</i> that may require the gene to express at different levels and we assume that the fitnes of an individual cell, that is, its growth or survival rate, is a function of its gene expression state. Indeed, recent work has confirmed that expression fluctuations in single cells can affect their instantaneous growth rates (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kiviet et al., 2014</a>).

As an example, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> assumes there are three environments (red, gold, and green), with the green environment requiring up-regulation of the expression and the red environment requiring down-regulation of the expression. The fitness in each environment corresponds to the fraction of cells with expression levels within the selected range, that is, the unregulated promoter has reasonably high fitness in the gold environment but very low fitness in the green and red environments. Since the overall fitness is the product of the fitness in each environment, a poor overlap between the expression distribution and selected range in any one environment leads to low overall fitness.

If we additionally assume that selection has tuned the signal-to-noise of the regulators to optimize the amount of noise-propagation, then the final noise level of the promoter is predicted to equal <math id=\"inf7\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mtext>tot</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2212</mo><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mtext>var</mtext><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><msup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#app3\">Appendix 3</a>). This expression can be interpreted as saying that, of the original mismatch <i>Y</i><sup>2</sup>, a fraction <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>Y</i><sup>2</sup> is accounted for by the condition-response, whereas the remaining fraction (1 \u2212 <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>)<i>Y</i><sup>2</sup> is accounted for by the noise-propagation. This implies that both the expression plasticity, which is given by the variance in the promoter's mean across conditions (i.e., <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>Y</i><sup>2</sup>), and the noise level (i.e., (1 \u2212 <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>)<i>Y</i><sup>2</sup>) are proportional to the original expression mismatch <i>Y</i><sup>2</sup>. Our model thus predicts that the expression plasticity and noise level should be correlated."

More specifically, our model predicts that, in a given condition, the noise level of a promoter is determined by the noise levels of the TFs that regulate it. To test this prediction, we used a very simple linear model that assumes that the excess noise level of a gene is equal to the sum of the noise levels of the TFs that regulate it (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Although this simple model is very crude, that is, assuming noise-propagation to be of equal size for all targets of a given TF, and assuming that fluctuations in TF activities are all independent, it was nevertheless able to explain a substantial fraction of the variance in excess noise levels across promoters (17%). The top five TFs most significantly associated with elevated noise levels of their targets were CRP, H-NS, ArcA, ilvY, and GadX (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Of these, GadX and H-NS were also identified, using a simpler method, in the data of our previous study (<a href=\"#bib33\">Silander et al., 2012</a>). The appearance of H-NS is interesting since it is a histone-like nucleoid-associated protein that acts as a silencer (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dorman, 2004</a>), that is, somewhat analogous to the role of nucleosomes in eukaryotes, and in eukaryotes nucleosome positioning at promoters has been shown to be a major determinant of transcriptional noise (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blake et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cairns, 2009</a>). The TFs ArcA and GadX are involved with responses to low oxygen and acid stress, respectively, and it is plausible that these TFs may be partially activated in the conditions in which our experiments are performed. Our cells are grown in M9 minimal media with glucose in micro-titer plates, and measurements are taken late in the exponential phase. It is well-known that in micro-titer plates oxygen limitation can become a major stress late in the exponential phase, and this may result in the activation of fermentation reactions which in turn cause acid stress. The appearance of CRP is consistent with our observation in <a href=\"#bib33\">Silander et al. (2012)</a> that promoters of genes involved in carbon metabolism are over-represented among high noise promoters. In summary, modeling of excess noise levels in terms of known regulatory interactions shows that, in accordance with our model, a substantial amount of the variation in noise levels can be explained by noise-propagation from noisy regulators, and the regulators we identify as most significantly propagating noise are consistent with existing biological knowledge regarding our growth conditions."

Here we have shown that, by comparing naturally observed variation in a particular trait with variation observed in synthetic systems that were evolved under well-controlled selective conditions, definite inferences can be made about the selection pressures that have acted on the natural systems. In particular, by evolving synthetic <i>E. coli</i> promoters de novo using a procedure in which promoters are strongly selected on their mean expression and not on their expression noise, we have shown that native promoters must have experienced selective pressures that increased their noise levels, and that promoters with elevated noise are highly regulated by TFs."

                        "text": "To account for this, we have developed a theoretical model that provides a simple mechanistic framework for understanding how selection acts on regulatory interactions. The key ingredient of the model is that it recognizes that a regulatory interaction affects the target's expression in two separate ways: the condition-response effect through which the mean expression of the target becomes a function of the mean activity of the regulator, and the noise-propagation effect through which the noise of the target is increased in proportion to the noise of the regulator. Our model elucidates that not only the condition-response effect but also the noise-propagation effect is often a <i>functional</i> consequence of the regulatory interaction; that is, instead of being just an unavoidable side-effect of regulation, noise-propagation is often beneficial and can be considered to act as a rudimentary form of regulation. Our framework vastly expands the evolutionary conditions under which novel regulatory interactions can evolve. Instead of assuming that regulators and their targets must evolve in a tightly coordinated fashion, noise-propagation alone may provide a sufficient benefit for a new regulatory interaction to evolve. This regulation can then be smoothly mutated along a continuum in which noise-propagation and condition-response are acting in concert, slowly lowering noise, and increasing the accuracy of the condition-response, eventually leading to highly accurate regulation. In this way our model provides a plausible scenario for how accurate regulatory interactions can evolve de novo from a state without regulation. Finally, our model shows that unless regulation is very precise, regulatory interactions that act to increase noise are beneficial. Thus, elevated levels of expression noise can be expected whenever the accuracy of regulation is limited."

Each sequence had defined 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends to allow PCR amplification. Within these constant regions, restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI were present. The intervening sequence was made up of 157 bp of random nucleotides (5\u2032-CCTTTCGTCTTCACCTCGAG-(N157)-GGGATCCTCTGGATGTAAGAAGG-3\u2032). However, as coupling of base pairs during oligonucleotide synthesis is not always successful and strand breaks can frequently occur in long oligonucleotides, many oligonucleotides were shorter than 200 bp in length. We used PCR to generate double-stranded DNA from the single-stranded oligonucleotides using forward and reverse primers matching the defined 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. We gel-purified the double-stranded PCR product and double-digested it using BamHI and XhoI. After column purification, sequences were ligated into a version of the low-copy plasmid pUA66, which contains a gfpmut2 open reading frame downstream of a strong ribosomal binding site (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zaslaver et al., 2006</a>). The vector was modified to remove a weak <i>\u03c3</i>70 binding site present 24 bp upstream of the GFP open reading frame (two point mutations, A \u2192 G and T \u2192 G, were introduced, changing the putative <i>\u03c3</i>70 binding site from TAGATT to TGGATG, with the consensus <i>\u03c3</i>70 binding site being TATAAT).

We collected data for at least 50,000 events. We then gated this data as outlined in <a href=\"#bib33\">Silander et al. (2012)</a>, identifying approximately 5000 cells most similar in forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC). We then calculated the mean and variance in log-fluorescence using these cells, using a Bayesian procedure that accounts for outliers (<a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). We randomly selected 479 promoters from the evolved set (72 medium expressers and 72 high expressers after three rounds of selection; 168 medium expressers and 167 high expressers after five rounds of selection) and quantified mean and variance in fluorescence. We used the same measurement procedures to calculate mean and variance for all promoters contained in a library of <i>E. coli</i> promoters also placed upstream of the gfpmut2 open reading frame on the pUA66 plasmid (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zaslaver et al., 2006</a>). We refer to the promoters from this library as native <i>E. coli</i> promoters. For 288 promoters, we quantified fluorescence in three independent cultures and found that both mean and variance in expression were reproducible across replicate biological experiments (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Additionally, we sequenced 378 sequences from our set of 479 promoter sequences, which showed that even after five rounds of selection, the promoters were quite diverse (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To confirm the sensitivity and accuracy of the FACS measurements, we selected 10 promoters and used fluorescence microscopy to measure their mean and variance in fluorescence. The cells were grown in the same conditions described above, placed on 1% agarose pad, and images were obtained using a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Photometrics) connected to a DeltaVision Core microscope (Applied Precision) with a UPlanSApo 100\u00d7/1.40 oil objective (Olympus). Image-processing was done in soft-WoRx v3.3.6 (Applied Precision) and fluorescence values were extracted based on DIC image-mediated cell detection in MicrobeTracker Suite (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sliusarenko et al., 2011</a>). For each cell, we calculated fluorescence per cell volume by summing all pixel values and dividing by the volume of the cell as estimated by MicrobeTracker. Cells undergo substantial phenotypic changes when they are put on agar, including changes in the distribution of cell sizes. Consequently, it is problematic to compare absolute variance measurements directly between FACS and microscope. We therefore compared the relative noise levels of different promoters. The 10 selected native promoters consist of five pairs with almost identical mean expression values (as measured by FACS) but with noise levels that vary by different amounts. For each of the five pairs we calculated the ratio of the noise levels of the higher and the lower noise promoter as measured by both FACS and the microscope. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, with the exception of one pair of promoters that showed almost equal noise levels in FACS but a 50% difference in noise in the microscope, all other pairs showed good correlation of the relative noise levels in FACS and in the microscope, confirming that relative noise levels are similar in FACS and microscope measurements."

Of the 1816 promoter fragments, 1718 could be unambiguously associated with a gene that was immediately downstream, and the 1718 promoter fragments were associated with 1137 different downstream genes (for some genes there were multiple or repeated upstream promoter fragments). We used the operon annotations of RegulonDB (<a href=\"#bib29\">Salgado et al., 2013</a>) to extract, for each promoter, the set of additional downstream genes that are part of the same operon as the first downstream gene. We obtained known regulatory interactions between TFs and genes from RegulonDB and counted, for each <i>E. coli</i> gene, the number of TFs known to regulate the gene. We defined the number of regulatory inputs of a promoter to equal the average of the number of inputs for all genes in the operon downstream of the promoter. We sorted promoters by their excess noise and, as a function of a cut-off on excess noise level, calculated the mean and standard error of the number of regulatory inputs for all promoters with excess noise level above the cut-off. We obtained genome-wide gene expression measurements from the Gene Expression Database (<a href=\"http://genexpdb.ou.edu/\">http://genexpdb.ou.edu/</a>). For each <i>E. coli</i> gene, we obtained 240 log fold-change values <i>x</i> corresponding to the logarithm of the expression ratio of the gene in a perturbed and a reference condition. We defined the variance in expression of a gene as the average of <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> across the 240 experiments. We again sorted promoters by their excess noise and, as a function of a cut-off on excess noise level, calculated the mean and standard error of gene expression variances for all promoters with excess noise above the cut-off."

In this regime the noise distribution results from a combination of fluctuations in background fluorescence and in protein numbers (which may be correlated because part of these fluctuations may result from fluctuations in cell size) and our noise model (<a href=\"#equ67\">Equation 67</a>) breaks down. In the following we will focus on those promoters with fluorescence due to GFP at least as large as the background fluorescence, that is, with mean log-fluorescence larger than 7."

Second, we do not observe promoters with high excess noise, even though their fitness would easily allow it. For example, a promoter with mean expression near the optimum 8.11 but excess noise as high as 0.25 (i.e., significantly higher than observed for any of the clones) would have higher fitness than any promoter with mean less than <i>\u03bc</i> = 7.76 or larger than <i>\u03bc</i> = 8.47 (independent of their noise), and we do observe many promoters with means that deviate this far from the optimum. The fact that we do not observe high excess noise promoters, even though they would not be selected against, strongly suggests that such high noise promoters are uncommon a priori, that is, among all random sequences that drive expression at a medium level, the large majority have low excess noise levels and high noise promoters are rare. Moreover, note also that, for promoters that are not near the optimum, the optimal excess noise level is typically <i>larger</i> than those of the observed clones, for example, the optimal excess noise for a promoter with mean <i>\u03bc</i> = 7.5 is <i>\u03b7</i> = 0.22.

Similarly, the effect of selection on excess noise levels seems to be opposite on the populations of round 3 and round 5 (center and right panels in <a href=\"#fig15\">Appendix 2\u2014figure 5</a>). We suspect that there are some systematic experimental fluctuations that make measured excess noise levels vary across days, and that the observed distributions of excess noise levels are more a reflection of experimental variability than of true shifts in the distribution.

Already the synthetic promoters at the third round of selection are tightly concentrated in a low noise band, even though selection does not select against noise, and promoters with mean away from the optimum would benefit from having higher noise. Two additional rounds of mutation and selection on the promoters from the third round do not substantially change the distribution of noise levels, confirming that there are no substantial fitness differences among promoters with different noise. Similarly, performing additional rounds of selection (be it very stringent, normal, or lenient) also does not substantially change the observed noise levels of the selected promoters. Thus, our results show that promoters selected from a large collection of random sequences naturally display low noise levels. Importantly, this implies that the native promoters with substantially higher noise levels must have experienced some selective pressures that caused them to increase their noise."

Moreover, there might be many environmental changes that affect the optimal expression levels but that cannot be sensed by any of the regulators, and this will constrain the extent to which regulators can optimize their activities to match the desired levels of their targets.

Briefly, from a mechanistic perspective, it is well accepted that, because a given promoter is only present in one or a few copies within a single cell, and because all molecules in the cell are subject to Brownian motion and thermal fluctuations, the sequence of transcription initiation events from a given promoter is inherently stochastic. In the simplest scenario both transcription initiation and mRNA decay occur at a constant probability per unit time, leading to a Poissonian distribution of transcript numbers, with variance equal to mean. However, many promoters have been shown to exhibit variance in expression that is larger than their mean, which is generally quantified using the Fano factor (ratio of variance to mean). Moreover, this Fano factor has been shown to vary significantly across different promoters. Mechanistically, this additional noise is generally understood to arise from promoters stochastically switching between different \u2018states'. In the simplest models, there is only an \u2018on\u2019 and an \u2018off\u2019 state, with promoters producing bursts of transcripts in the \u2018on\u2019 state only (indeed some authors simply identify the Fano factor with \u2018burst size\u2019). However, Fano factors larger than one result whenever promoters switch stochastically between different states that have different transcription rates associated with them. Such general state changes are likely associated with events such as the binding and unbinding of different transcription factors, local changes to the state of the chromatin, and so on. Moreover, since the concentrations of TFs may vary from cell to cell, the rates of switching between different states may vary from cell to cell as well. Thus, these mechanistic considerations suggest that the level of transcriptional noise may, at least to some extent, be encoded in the sequence of the promoter. Indeed, several recent works have established this to be the case. Consequently, transcriptional noise is thus subject to evolution through natural selection, and the main question that we set out to investigate in this work is how selection has shaped noise properties of promoters."

The key insights that our model provides is that both of these effects can be beneficial, and that there is a continuum of possible regulatory strategies in which these two effects act in concert, varying from strategies in which all benefits come from the noise-propagation effect, to strategies where all benefits derive from the condition-response effect. In this way, our model clarifies that apparently complementary explanations such as \u2018noise as a side-effect of regulation\u2019 versus \u2018noise selected as a bet hedging strategy\u2019, are really just different parameter regimes within one unified theoretical frame work."

First, we note that it would be very difficult to make quantitative predictions about what precise levels of noise would be expected for which promoters in which conditions, because this would depend on the details of how gene expression fluctuations affect fitness in different environments in the wild, which are almost impossible to know at this point. However, the model does explain the general trends observed in our <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. In particular, we now discuss in some detail why our model predicts that positive correlations should be expected both between noise and the number of regulatory inputs, as well as between noise and expression plasticity."

In the revision we now present a simple computational model that models the noise of a promoter as a linear function of the noise levels of the regulators that are known to target the promoter. We show that this model, although very crude, can explain a substantial fraction of the variation in observed noise levels. This simple model also identifies which TFs are most strongly contributing to noise levels, and we briefly discuss that the \u2018noisy TFs\u2019 that we identify are consistent with the biology of the growth conditions in which our experiments were done."

In particular, the discussion that we added in the revision covers the following points. First, we note that the reporter constructs we use were designed with the aim of measuring transcriptional noise, i.e. attempts were made to miminize the variation in the translation rates, the mRNA life-time distributions of the constructs, and the protein decay rates. Regarding the latter, since the GFP protein is long-lived, the protein decay is dominated by dilution, which, since all constructs show virtually identical growth rates, are virtually identical for all constructs."

As a result, the mRNAs transcribed from different constructs vary only in the few nucleotides between the TSS and the insertion site. In addition, downstream of the insertion site, is a fixed 5' UTR with a strong ribosomal binding site, intended to ensure similar translation rates of all constructs. To confirm that translation rates vary little across the constructs we performed qPCR experiments that show a high correlation between protein and mRNA levels. Since dilution/decay rates of proteins are constant, this implies that translation rates indeed vary little across the constructs, as we detail in <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>. Although we did not directly measure the variation in mRNA decay rates across the constructs, the fact that the mRNAs only vary in the initial few nucleotides downstream of TSS, and the fact that these variations do not appear to significantly affect translation rates, suggest that the variations in mRNA decay rates are likely also modest."

This is not to say that other fluctuations do not contribute to the noise, indeed all constructs are subject to noise in translation, to fluctuations in growth rates, to fluctuations in the copy number of the plasmid, and so on. However, these all contribute the same amount of noise for each construct. Indeed, we observe a fixed minimal amount of extrinsic noise that is exhibited by all our constructs. However, the differences in the noise levels across constructs are most likely due to differences in transcriptional noise, for the reasons given above. The fact that there is a very significant association between noise level and the occurrence of binding sites for particular TFs further supports this interpretation."

First, and most importantly, our experiments show that promoters which were only selected to show a particular (constant) expression level in one given condition, without selecting on their noise properties, and starting from completely random sequence, naturally exhibit low noise. This is what we mean when we say that promoters have low noise \u2018by default\u2019. Second, our analysis of the noise levels of the native promoters shows that native promoters that have no known regulatory sites beyond the sigma-factor binding site of the polymerase, also tend to show low noise levels. This is what we call \u2018constitutive\u2019 promoters, i.e. not regulated by specific TFs. In the revision these points have been clarified."
