Despite these functional exchanges during perception, there is little shared activity between early and late visual regions at rest. How interactions emerge between regions encompassing distinct levels of the visual hierarchy remains unknown. Here we combined neuroimaging, non-invasive cortical stimulation and computational modelling to characterize changes in functional interactions across widespread neural networks before and after local inhibition of primary visual cortex or FEF. We found that stimulation of early visual cortex selectively increased feedforward interactions with FEF and extrastriate visual areas, whereas identical stimulation of the FEF decreased feedback interactions with early visual areas. Computational modelling suggests that these opposing effects reflect a fast-slow timescale hierarchy from sensory to association areas."

Despite these functional exchanges during perception, there is little shared activity between early and late visual regions at rest. How interactions emerge between regions encompassing distinct levels of the visual hierarchy remains unknown. Here we combined neuroimaging, non-invasive cortical stimulation and computational modelling to characterize changes in functional interactions across widespread neural networks before and after local inhibition of primary visual cortex or FEF. We found that stimulation of early visual cortex selectively increased feedforward interactions with FEF and extrastriate visual areas, whereas identical stimulation of the FEF decreased feedback interactions with early visual areas. Computational modelling suggests that these opposing effects reflect a fast-slow timescale hierarchy from sensory to association areas."

This work has demonstrated that task demands play an important role in determining the nature of the\u00a0interactions between early and late visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilbert, 2013</a>). For example, studies combining fMRI with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during performance of visual tasks have shown that stimulation of the FEF can modulate neural activity in several visual areas, including the primary visual cortex (area V1) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bressler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ruff et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2008</a>). Increments in the strength of excitatory TMS over the right FEF have been shown to increase neural activity in early retinotopic cortex representing the peripheral visual field, and to reduce activity in central visual-field representations (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ruff et al., 2006</a>). This neurophysiological effect confers a perceptual advantage for detection of stimuli in the visual periphery relative to the fovea (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ruff et al., 2006</a>)."

Across two separate imaging sessions, we employed continuous theta-burst TMS (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2005</a>) to inhibit intrinsic neural activity either within the right occipital pole or within the right FEF. We recorded resting-state brain activity immediately before and after TMS, and examined the influence of this perturbation on functional and effective\u00a0connectivity between the targeted regions and the rest of the brain. We also employed computational modelling to provide candidate mechanisms for expected changes in interactions between cortical regions following local stimulation. Based on recent empirical (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hasson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Murray et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bassett et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lerner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Honey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gauthier et al., 2012</a>) and computational (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gollo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</a>)\u00a0work we tested the hypothesis that a temporal hierarchy of timescales, recapitulating the hierarchical organization of neuronal receptive fields, can explain the effects of local stimulation on inter-regional connectivity. According to the model, activity in higher regions such as FEF fluctuates at a slower temporal scale than activity in early sensory regions such as V1/V2 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murray et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Honey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</a>). We simulated the effects of local inhibition of early and late visual areas to test whether the proposed temporal gradient from sensory areas (fast) to association areas (slow) matched the observed changes in connectivity following local cortical perturbations in human participants. Our experimental and modelling results suggest that local inhibition of early visual cortex reduces the discrepancy in endogenous synchronization between lower and higher levels of the visual cortical hierarchy, whereas inhibition of FEF increases the discrepancy. Our work provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie the effects of local inhibition on large-scale brain dynamics."

The number of participants was decided based on previous work adopting a similar experimental design (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cocchi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eldaief et al., 2011</a>). A schematic representation of the complete experimental protocol is presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> (details in the Materials and methods). After exclusion of data from two participants due to excessive head motion or medication, we analyzed resting-state data from 21 of the participants (11 female mean age 27.7, S.D.\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 years) acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. Immediately following an initial rsfMRI session, continuous (inhibitory) theta-burst TMS (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2005</a>) was applied over one of two different cortical regions of interest (ROIs). A repeat rsfMRI scan was acquired from each participant immediately following TMS stimulation. The anatomical locations of the two TMS targets were: (1) Right early visual cortex \u2013 the posterior aspect of the medial occipital lobe (MNI centroid x\u00a0= 25, y\u00a0= \u221292, z\u00a0= \u22129), corresponding with areas V1/V2; and (2) Right FEF (MNI centroid x\u00a0= 31 y\u00a0= \u22122, z\u00a0= 47) \u2013 a brain hub within the frontal cortex (see Materials and methods for target region identification). The exact locations of the stimulation sites for each participant are shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. During TMS, participants closed their eyes and were seated to ensure a relaxed muscle state. This procedure ensured that local stimulation was delivered with participants in a state of rest and in the absence of structured visual input.

DCM contributes to the analysis by modelling how one region exerts influence over another (i.e., effective connectivity, [<a href=\"#bib18\">Friston and Harrison, 2003</a>]), which is not possible using traditional functional connectivity analysis. To this end, we generated two models comprising bidirectional links between the V1/V2 or FEF seed regions and the clusters showing significant changes in connectivity following TMS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, details in the Materials and methods). DCM analyses of model parameters (pre- versus post-TMS) suggested that stimulation of V1/V2 altered the feedforward influence of V1/V2 on the right occipito-parietal cortex (details in <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file\u00a01</a>, paired t-test p=0.04). Conversely, stimulation of FEF significantly decreased the feedback influence of this region upon V1/V2 (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, p=0.0026 for the right cluster and p=0.0012 for the left cluster). Thus, for both V1/V2 and FEF, modulation of effective connectivity induced by focal TMS spread from the stimulation site to distant cortical regions."

Conversely, reduced positive correlations following FEF stimulation were driven by a <i>reduction</i> in feedback connectivity (i.e., a reduced influence of FEF on V1/V2). Based on evidence from empirical and computational work (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hasson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Murray et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lerner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Honey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gauthier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gollo et al., 2015</a>), we hypothesized that these opposing effects of inhibitory TMS on widespread connectivity might be accounted for by the different timescales at which sensory brain regions and network hubs fluctuate in their levels of activity. To test this hypothesis, we used the Kuramoto model of coupled heterogeneous oscillators, constrained by knowledge of whole brain anatomical connectivity and then adjusted to maximally match the acquired resting-state data at baseline (see Materials and methods for details). The effect of inhibitory TMS was simulated by slowing down (by a variable amount) the intrinsic frequency of the target region. This decision was motivated by the observation that changes in connectivity induced by inhibitory TMS were related to a reduction in the power of the local BOLD signal. Such an energy decrease is embodied in our oscillatory model by a slowdown in the intrinsic oscillatory frequency. The model simulates the dynamics of the whole brain at a relatively high resolution (513 uniformly sized cortical and sub-cortical regions). We focused on the differences in functional connectivity between the two regions targeted by TMS (V1/V2 and FEF) and the rest of the brain. Simulation results showed that virtual inhibition of right V1/V2 within the model increased the positive correlations between this region and the rest of the brain (red in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), consistent with the group effects we observed following actual TMS over this region in our participant group. This increase in connectivity was robust across a broad range of parameters (i.e., slowing of intrinsic frequencies, omega, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Importantly, we found that the simulated effect of local V1/V2 inhibition was due mainly to a significant <i>increase</i> in connectivity between this node and other nodes encompassing occipito-temporal and frontal areas of the right hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Conversely, simulated inhibition of FEF, again by slowing its intrinsic frequency, was associated with the reduction of\u00a0correlations in this region\u2019s connectivity with the rest of the brain (blue in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This significant effect involved right frontal areas surrounding FEF, and occipito-temporal cortices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). Overall, the effects observed within the model were consistent with the effects observed following actual TMS of V1/V2 and FEF in the experimental participants."

Our results support previous work by showing a functional segregation between early and late areas within the visual cortical hierarchy at rest. This finding is consistent with the notion that task-induced changes in sensory visual areas may drive the emergence of functional integration between levels of the visual cortical hierarchy (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ekstrom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Roelfsema, 2006</a>)."

Previous studies have investigated intrinsic reconfigurations of large-scale neural systems following focal perturbations of peripheral sensorimotor regions (e.g.,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib11\">Cocchi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">O'Shea et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grefkes and Fink, 2011</a>). In line with our results, fMRI studies have shown that local perturbation of primary motor areas can lead to recruitment of related areas (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Shea et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grefkes and Fink, 2011;</a> <a href=\"#bib11\">Cocchi et al., 2015</a>). For example, inhibitory TMS of the primary motor cortex in healthy adults has recently been shown to increase the strength of resting-state\u00a0functional connectivity within the sensorimotor system (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cocchi et al., 2015</a>). Our finding that unilateral inhibition of early visual cortex increases the positive coupling with FEF and other visual areas adds to a growing literature suggesting that local perturbations of neural activity in peripheral nodes recruit functionally related brain regions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cocchi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">O'Shea et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grefkes and Fink, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bestmann et al., 2010</a>). Specifically, our computational modelling suggests that the effect of inhibitory TMS of early visual cortex might be due to slowing of intrinsic timescales within V1/V2, so that they become closer to the slow intrinsic fluctuations of higher cortical regions such as the parietal cortex and FEF (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murray et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Honey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gollo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</a>)."

Results from the DCM analysis suggest that such functional decoupling was related to a significant decrease in feedback signals from FEF to early visual cortex. In keeping with the neural mechanism proposed to explain increased connectivity following the inhibition of V1/V2, results from our computational model suggest that the observed reduction in feedback modulation from FEF to V1/V2 can be explained by a further slowing of local FEF dynamics by TMS. The observed changes in connectivity following inhibitory TMS may therefore be explained in terms of a reduction in synchronization discrepancy following local stimulation of V1/V2 and an increase in synchronization discrepancy following stimulation of FEF. Within this broad context, preliminary analyses suggest that there are a host of topographical specificities and nuances that accompany virtual simulations. Further work is needed to address the specificity of our model and the source of possible discrepancies between virtual and empirical findings."

DCM is a computational framework for inferring effective connectivity between cortical regions. Model estimation rests on the Bayesian inversion of state space models by combining dynamic models of neural states with biophysical models of hemodynamics (<a href=\"#bib19\">Friston et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, stochastic DCM allows inverting models with uncertainty about the temporal specification of inputs. Because these inputs can represent intrinsic fluctuations, stochastic DCM is particularly useful for model inversion of resting-state data (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stephan et al., 2010</a>). For each participant, timeseries were extracted from regions of interest defined by the seed-to-voxel analysis of functional connectivity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For both stimulation sessions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) we used a 7.5\u00a0mm spherical seed on targeted regions and main clusters showing a significant TMS effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This resulted in two distinct models (one for each session) with bidirectional connections between the respective TMS target region (V1/V2 or FEF) and the selected clusters. The models were subsequently inverted to estimate subject-specific parameters. At the group level, the model parameters between the pre- and post-TMS brain states were compared using pairwise two-tailed t-statistics."

The Kuramoto model thus provides a good trade-off between complexity and plausibility, incorporating key anatomical constraints and modelling functional elements (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hellyer et al., 2015</a>). This model is particularly suitable to assess signal correlations between distinct network nodes and, importantly, is capable of reproducing our experimental results. The model yields a simulation of whole-brain dynamics in which the (consistent) local effect of inhibitory TMS can be represented by reducing a single parameter, as described in detail below. Hence, our simulations allowed us to test the hypothesis that the distinct effects of early- versus late-visual TMS on widespread functional connectivity rely on an intrinsic timescale of neural processes that has been suggested to represent a general organizing principle for the primate cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murray et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gollo et al., 2015</a>)."

Probabilistic tractography was used to estimate the average number of white matter tracks connecting all pairs of brain regions (513 x 512= 262,656 connections; details in Roberts et al. [<a href=\"#bib46\">Roberts et al., 2016</a>]). The resulting structural connectivity matrix was normalized. Probabilistic tractography combined with the relatively large sample size allowed an estimation of the average connectivity strength of pairwise regional connections in the adult population. To ensure that the findings of our model were robust to possible inaccuracies in streamline reconstruction, however, we ran the model using (i) a sparser structural connectivity matrix (30% density vs. original densely connected matrix), and (ii) a correction for the reconstruction of long-range connections (division of the original weights by the fiber distance between any two regions). These analyses replicated the original result showing that TMS of FEF increases the discrepancy between activity in this brain region and V1/V2, whereas TMS of V1/V2 decreases the discrepancy. This robustness is largely explained by the fact that FEF consistently has a high degree (i.e., is a hub) whereas V1/V2 is consistently a peripheral node with a comparatively low degree."

The modeling work indicates that these changes are related to the intrinsic timescales of these regions. This is a truly impressive study. The multi-methodology approach and research question is very novel and the results have important implications for understanding the neural processes facilitating interactions along the cortical hierarchy."

One possibility is that it's just a thresholding issue (e.g., 2b would show V1/V2 at a slightly more liberal threshold).

In brief, the key conclusion seems to be: inhibitory TMS leads to a local slowing of the timescale (frequency of dominant oscillations) at which an area operates; TMS of V1/V2 decreases and TMS of FEF increases the discrepancy in oscillatory frequencies between these two levels of the visual hierarchy; this explains why the former leads to increased bottom-up connectivity and the latter leads to reduced top-down connectivity. The authors get to this on fourth paragraph in the Discussion, but do not make it as explicit as I think they should. Moreover, it would help if this interpretation and the underlying hypothesis would be pointed out more clearly earlier in the paper, e.g. in the Introduction."

They find that cortical stimulation of posterior visual cortex (V1/V2) leads to an increase in BOLD correlations with FEF, but stimulation of FEF leads to a decrease in BOLD correlations with posterior cortex. The modeling work indicates that these changes are related to the intrinsic timescales of these regions. This is a truly impressive study. The multi-methodology approach and research question is very novel and the results have important implications on the neural processes facilitating interactions along the cortical hierarchy. The manuscript is well written. Several aspects of the data that could affect the interpretation of the results need clarification. Specifically, the authors should evaluate potential influences of the underlying functional organization on the observed interactions, and address the differences between the imaging and modeling results. In addition, I have concerns on the specificity of the localization for both the imaging data and TMS. Conceptually, the authors also need to better address the relation of positive/negative BOLD correlations to increased and decreased connectivity."

The authors should better address whether such variability had an affect on the correlations. e.g., the authors could show something similar to <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, but color code the FEF TMS sites based on the changes in correlation with V1/V2 (and vice versa).

The Ruff studies found that interactions between early visual cortex and FEF vary depending on the topographic sub-region within early visual cortex. Aside from methodological differences, those data suggest heterogeneity in early visual-frontal interactions (there is also substantial evidence from monkey studies showing heterogeneity of anatomical connections and function within both FEF and V1). It's unclear to me how any such heterogeneity can be directly accounted for by the current study's broad short and long timescale differences in early visual cortex and FEF, respectively. More so, it actually seems that their model predicts the opposite (lack of heterogeneity). I think an argument potentially could be made that any heterogeneity in correlations reflects the heterogeneity in connections, though it's not clear to me what that mapping would be, and their data do currently do not speak to this."

This means that the clusters of voxels in FEF (V1/V2 seed analysis) and early visual cortex (FEF seed analysis) were similar but not identical. The absence of a significant anticorrelation between the FEF seed and early visual cortex at baseline may therefore be due to the fact that the FEF seed (red in the figure below) is located slightly laterally and posteriorly relative to voxels showing the highest anticorrelations with the V1/V2 seed (light blue in the figure below, Z= 50 as per <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).
