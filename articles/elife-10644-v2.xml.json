Here, we provide evidence that this activity at a distance depends on both sites of high kinase concentration and the bistability of a coupled kinase-phosphatase system. We reconstitute this bistable behavior and hysteresis using purified components to reveal co-existence of distinct high and low Aurora B activity states, sustained by a two-component kinase autoactivation mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate these non-linear regimes in live cells using a FRET-based phosphorylation sensor, and provide a mechanistic theoretical model for spatial regulation of Aurora B phosphorylation. We propose that bistability of an Aurora B-phosphatase system underlies formation of spatial phosphorylation patterns, which are generated and spread from sites of kinase autoactivation, thereby regulating cell division."

Here, we provide evidence that this activity at a distance depends on both sites of high kinase concentration and the bistability of a coupled kinase-phosphatase system. We reconstitute this bistable behavior and hysteresis using purified components to reveal co-existence of distinct high and low Aurora B activity states, sustained by a two-component kinase autoactivation mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate these non-linear regimes in live cells using a FRET-based phosphorylation sensor, and provide a mechanistic theoretical model for spatial regulation of Aurora B phosphorylation. We propose that bistability of an Aurora B-phosphatase system underlies formation of spatial phosphorylation patterns, which are generated and spread from sites of kinase autoactivation, thereby regulating cell division."

Then, the pairs of copied chromosomes are separated and pulled towards opposite ends of the cell and, finally, the cell splits in two. These steps are mainly regulated by modifications to proteins, and enzymes called protein kinases play an important role because they add phosphate groups to, or phosphorylate, so-called 'substrate' proteins to change their activities. Other enzymes called phosphatases are also important because they remove the phosphate groups from the substrates to reverse the effects."

This kinase is enriched in specific locations within the cell, for example at the centromere regions of the chromosomes as they line up at the cell\u2019s center. However, Aurora B phosphorylates substrates located at distant sites on the chromosome, with less phosphorylation at sites farther from the centromere. The level of phosphorylation also changes as chromosomes become aligned. Aurora B can activate itself and this ability was suspected to help this spatiotemporal regulation. However, it was not clear how the observed gradients of kinase activity might form."

This revealed that this kinase-phosphatase system is 'bistable', meaning that it has two stable states, low or high kinase activity, and that these states could switch in response to small changes in enzyme concentrations. Further experiments showed that this system has a kind of memory such that the level of activity (low or high) persists for a range of concentrations and depends on the system\u2019s prior history."

At the sites of highest concentration at the centromere, Aurora B can overcome inhibition by phosphatase and activates itself, as in the test tube. This activity spreads to more distant locations as active kinase molecules activate neighboring kinase molecules, establishing the areas with a high state of activity. As the local Aurora B concentration decreases further from the centromere, the phosphatase switches Aurora B into the low activity state, establishing a steep gradient of kinase activity in a region where its substrates that are important for chromosome segregation are located. Importantly, the shape and location of this gradient are predicted to depend on forces that stretch the lined chromosomes apart, offering a plausible mechanism to explain phosphorylation changes in response to tension. These theoretical insights and experimental approaches could be used to study other coupled kinase-phosphatase systems."

Accumulating evidence indicates that Aurora B is capable of phosphorylating substrates that are located at a significant distance from its major binding sites. In anaphase, a long-range phosphorylation gradient is established around the spindle midzone (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fuller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tan and Kapoor, 2011</a>), but extending well beyond major sites of kinase localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This phosphorylation gradient controls the stability and length of the central spindle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ferreira et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Uehara et al., 2013</a>), chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reassembly (<a href=\"#bib2\">Afonso et al., 2014</a>). Similar distance-dependent phosphorylation is observed prior to anaphase onset, but at this stage Aurora B localizes to chromatin with highest concentration at the inner centromere, where CPC binding sites are enriched. During metaphase the primary targets for Aurora B, such as the microtubule-binding protein Hec1/Ndc80, are located hundreds of nanometers away at the outer kinetochore. As in anaphase, phosphorylation is lower on substrates positioned farther from Aurora B binding sites, indicating existence of a gradient of Aurora B activity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Keating et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Welburn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DeLuca et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, changes of position of as little as 30\u201350 nm are associated with different levels of phosphorylation of both endogenous and exogenous Aurora B substrates at kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib79\">Welburn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>), indicating that the spatial regulation of Aurora B activity is very precise."

At the outer kinetochore, for example, the observed gradient of substrate phosphorylation could correspond to the outermost region of the localization gradient of chromatin-bound kinase (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2009</a>), or reflect the ability of Aurora B to reach these substrates by an elongated INCENP tether, the CPC component that directly binds Aurora B and is important for its mitotic functions (<a href=\"#bib56\">Samejima et al., 2015</a>). In this view, the less abundant but proximally located Aurora B pool plays a more physiologically important role than the distant centromeric pool. Support for the kinetochore pool model comes from experiments in budding yeast, which show that the centromere localized pool of Aurora B (Ipl1) can be removed without major consequences for mitotic progression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell and Desai, 2013</a>). In several other systems, however, disrupting CPC targeting to centromeres leads to strong mitotic defects (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vader et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tsukahara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yamagishi et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that the centromere-localized pool is essential for normal cell division."

Cytosolic gradients of another mitotic regulator, RanGTP, play important roles in regulating spindle assembly (<a href=\"#bib50\">O\u2019Connell and Khodjakov, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kalab and Heald, 2008</a>), and a similar mechanism could contribute to long-range Aurora B activity. In this reaction-diffusion model, activation of Aurora B takes place at sites with high kinase concentration, such as the inner centromere or anaphase spindle midzone (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lampson and Cheeseman, 2011</a>). These sites exchange quickly with a cytosolic pool (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Miranda et al., 2010</a>), so they could serve as a source of active kinase, which has been proposed to spread to distant targets via diffusion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fuller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). However, it is not clear whether a gradient based only on the diffusion of soluble activated kinase from the inner centromere could account for changes in Aurora B substrate phosphorylation within the length scale of the kinetochore (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krenn and Musacchio, 2015</a>). In contrast, bistable reaction-diffusion systems can in principle exhibit complex spatial patterns and support sharp boundaries of system components (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kapral and Showalter, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lobanova and Ataullakhanov, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liehr, 2013</a>). Bistable homogeneous systems (i.e., with mixing) can switch between the alternative states, characterized by high and low activity, with no intermediate states. Furthermore, unlike in regular trigger systems, in bistable systems the high and low states can co-exist, leading to hysteresis, when the output of the system depends on its prior history (<a href=\"#bib44\">Martinov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Angeli et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tsyganov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Noori, 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "Published results indicate that Aurora B kinase could in principle engage in complex non-linear behaviors. Most importantly, Aurora B can activate itself via phosphorylation of its activation loop and of a conserved TSS motif in the C-terminus of INCENP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bishop and Schumacher, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Honda et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yasui et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sessa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kelly et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). Conversely, phosphatase can inactivate the kinase by dephosphorylating sites on Aurora B and INCENP (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sessa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kelly et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rosasco-Nitcher et al., 2008</a>), which could potentially help to shape the spatial gradient of Aurora B activity. Whether these reactions can lead to bistability in a coupled Aurora B-phosphatase system has not been investigated. Here, we examine the mechanisms that control Aurora B activity using cellular and simplified in vitro systems and mathematical modeling. First, we designed a novel molecular system to control Aurora B localization in cells, to directly test the importance of the centromeric pool of Aurora B in long-range activity. Second, we used purified components to reconstitute a simplified coupled Aurora B kinase-phosphatase system in vitro\u00a0and showed that it exhibits bistability and hysteresis in the physiological range of Aurora B concentration. Because the complex, non-linear dynamics of reaction-diffusion systems and their spatial behavior are not intuitive, we constructed quantitative models to assist analysis of homogeneous biochemical reactions and formation of phosphorylation patterns in cells. We then developed experimental methods to analyze bistability and hysteresis of Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation in live mitotic cells, linking our biochemical findings with Aurora B regulation in cells. With these multiple approaches we provide strong evidence for a model in which spatiotemporal regulation of Aurora B is governed by a bistable reaction-diffusion mechanism."

We made a cell line that inducibly knocks down endogenous INCENP, while expressing an INbox construct that can bind and activate Aurora B (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sessa et al., 2005</a>) but does not interact with other CPC components. The Aurora B\u2013INbox complex is sufficient for enzymatic activity but does not localize to any particular intracellular structure because it does not form the full CPC. To control localization, we used rapamycin-based dimerization (<a href=\"#bib51\">Putyrski and Schultz, 2012</a>), with FRB fused to INbox and FKBP fused to the centromere protein CENP-B (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

When endogenous INCENP is replaced with INbox, which is freely diffusing in the cytosol, phosphorylation is uniformly low, indicating that the cytosolic kinase pool on its own is incapable of maintaining high kinase activity along chromosome arms. Addition of rapamycin led to INbox recruitment to centromeres within minutes, accompanied by sensor phosphorylation; importantly the signal was visible all over the chromatin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). For these experiments cells were arrested in mitosis with a kinesin-5 inhibitor, so that chromosomes were positioned radially around a monopolar spindle with centromeres oriented toward the center (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mayer et al., 1999</a>). With this arrangement of chromosomes, a transient phosphorylation gradient was evident extending from centromeres, similar to previous experiments in which Aurora B activity was manipulated by global inhibition (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Similar results were observed for cells arrested with nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

At high kinase concentration the chemosensor becomes depleted quickly, so we modified our assay to uncouple the Aurora B autophosphorylation reaction from the activity measurement with the chemosensor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). With 4 \u00b5M kinase, kinase activity increased strongly with time, and the best-fit curve based only on in cis autoactivation provided a poor fit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), confirming the presence of the in trans component.

We constructed a quantitative model for such a coupled kinase-phosphatase system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which takes into account the determined molecular constants for two-component Aurora B autoactivation and a Michaelis\u2013Menten mechanism for a phosphatase with variable enzymatic constants. Solving the differential equations describing this system\u00a0in silico (see Materials and methods) reveals that at high kinase concentration three steady-state solutions could coexist (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows region of bistability in the parametric plane of Aurora B kinase-phosphatase concentrations. Bistability arises when Aurora B kinase concentration exceeds 4 \u03bcM, and further increasing Aurora B concentration broadens the range of permissible phosphatase concentrations. In this region, a homogeneous mixture of kinase and phosphatase can exist in one of two stable states with different kinase activity, high or low, depending on initial conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This prediction is important because, as we will show later, bistable behavior is essential for accurate regulation of Aurora B kinase activity away from sites of high kinase concentration."

Hysteresis becomes evident at intermediate levels of phosphatase concentration (e.g. 0.4 \u03bcM in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), when almost the entire kinase pool can be either phosphorylated (high kinase activity state) or dephosphorylated (low kinase activity state) depending on the prior state of this reaction mixture.

We combined Aurora B kinase (8 \u03bcM), ATP (4 mM) and variable concentrations of \u03bb phage phosphatase, such that both Aurora B activation and inactivation could take place simultaneously. Importantly, these reactions were carried out for two different initial conditions: using either the active kinase or active kinase pretreated with phosphatase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). All other reactants in these two mixtures were adjusted to achieve the same final concentrations for all components, including the phosphatase. The progress of these reactions was followed by taking samples at the indicated times; phosphatase inhibitor was then added to stop kinase dephosphorylation and kinase activity was measured via the initial rate of chemosensor phosphorylation. As expected, at low phosphatase concentration (0.25 \u00b5M) the partially active kinase gradually activated itself, reaching a steady-state with high activity, while the active kinase slightly lost its activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, top graph). At high phosphatase concentration (0.5 \u00b5M, bottom graph) the active kinase was overpowered by the phosphatase and became gradually inactivated, reaching a level close to the fully dephosphorylated kinase. Importantly, the model accurately predicted the behavior for these two reactions and when intermediate phosphatase concentration was used (lines in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). At 0.45 \u00b5M phosphatase, the kinase that was initially active robustly retained its high state (red data points, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>,\u00a0middle graph), while the activity remained low for the kinase that was initially in the low state (blue data points, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> middle graph). These outcomes demonstrate bistability because in both of these enzyme mixtures the final concentrations of all components were identical and the reactions were allowed to proceed long enough to reach the steady-states (120\u2009min). Similar experiments were carried out for additional phosphatase concentrations, and the steady-state levels of active Aurora B were obtained by averaging measurements for \u226560\u2009min incubation times. These data, plotted as a function of phosphatase concentration in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, define the bistable region for the homogeneous system in vitro, in quantitative agreement with model predictions. In this range of concentrations, the coupled kinase-phosphatase system exhibits hysteresis, with different activity levels observed depending on the initial conditions."

First, we tested whether the endogenous Aurora B\u2013phosphatase system can exhibit bistability, using a FRET-based phosphorylation sensor targeted to centromeres by fusion to CENP-B (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fuller et al., 2008</a>). If the system is bistable, this sensor should reveal that Aurora B exists in either a high or low activity state and that these states can co-exist under the same experimental conditions. We manipulated Aurora B activity by incubating mitotic cells with varying concentrations of its specific inhibitor, ZM447439. Cells were imaged live, and the average FRET ratio was calculated for each individual cell, representing the overall phosphorylation state of that cell. Analysis of a population of cells expressing the centromere-targeted sensor shows that the distribution of phosphorylation states is clearly bimodal, with distinct high and low FRET states (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In the absence of inhibitor, all cells are in the high phosphorylation (low FRET ratio) state, as expected. As the inhibitor concentration increases, the distribution shifts so that a greater fraction of cells is in the low phosphorylation state, but intermediate phosphorylation states are rare. Importantly, for some intermediate concentrations of Aurora B inhibitor, both peaks are observed in the same cell population, likely because individual cells differ slightly in their parameters, for example in membrane permeability to kinase inhibitor. Similar results were obtained for the sensor targeted to chromatin by fusion with histone H2B (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fuller et al., 2008</a>). Here, cells were blocked in mitosis with either monastrol or nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that these results do not depend on which sensor is used or how cells are arrested."

We designed an experiment to manipulate Aurora B activity in a similar manner as in our in vitro experiments, in which hysteresis was observed. Cells were first incubated with low (0 \u00b5M) or high (1.5 \u00b5M) concentration of the Aurora B inhibitor to establish two different initial conditions of either high or low kinase activity, respectively. From these initial conditions, the inhibitor concentration was switched following one of four protocols: low to high (0 to 1.5 \u00b5m) or high to low (1.5 to 0 \u00b5M), as experimental controls, and low to intermediate (0 to 0.6 \u00b5M) or high to intermediate (1.5 to 0.6 \u00b5M) to reach identical final conditions. If hysteresis is present, cells that end up at the same intermediate inhibitor concentration will show different phosphorylation levels depending on their past history, i.e., whether they we preincubated with initially high or low inhibitor concentration. Cells were then imaged live to track changes in phosphorylation of the chromatin targeted FRET sensor. Switching from low to high inhibitor concentration led to kinase inhibition and sensor dephosphorylation, and conversely switching from high to low led to kinase activation and sensor phosphorylation, as expected. When the inhibitor concentration was switched to the intermediate level, however, kinase activity remained in the initial state in these mitotic cells: high if the initial condition was low inhibitor (0 to 0.6 \u00b5M) and low activity if the initial condition was high inhibitor (1.5 to 0.6 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). In addition, we found that cellular localizations of Aurora B and PP1\u03b3 phosphatase were not affected by treatment with this inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with a previous report for Aurora B localization (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ditchfield et al., 2003</a>). Together, these results strongly indicate that bistability and hysteresis of Aurora B phosphorylation in mitotic cells are driven by the intrinsic properties of Aurora B kinase coupled with the inactivating phosphatase(s)."

This model simplifies or leaves out many mitotic features while focusing on molecular processes that are essential for Aurora B kinase activity in cells. Specifically, we used deconvolved intensity profiles for Aurora B localization at the centromere and along chromosome arms to define the spatial distribution of Aurora B binding sites on chromatin (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Peak Aurora B concentration at the centromere is estimated at 10 \u00b5M, dropping down to 1.5 \u00b5M along chromosome arms and 1\u20132 \u00b5M in the kinetochore area (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In the model soluble kinase molecules bind and unbind these sites dynamically to achieve the steady-state fractions of the bound and diffusing soluble kinase pools of 75% and 25%, respectively (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mahen et al., 2014</a>). Soluble kinase in the model behaves identically to our in vitro experiments, activating itself via the two component mechanism with the kinetic constants listed in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. The activity of chromatin-bound Aurora B is not known, but the elongated flexible structure of the INCENP subunit is thought to permit some mobility for the tethered Aurora B kinase (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krenn and Musacchio, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Samejima et al., 2015</a>). We therefore assume that chromatin bound Aurora B kinase can interact with soluble Aurora B molecules freely (with the same kinetic constants as in\u00a0<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, but phosphorylation in trans between the chromatin-bound molecules is limited (see Materials and methods). Both bound and soluble Aurora B molecules can be inactivated by a phosphatase, which for simplicity is assumed to be soluble and diffusive.

Consistent with our theoretical analysis of the homogeneous system, bistability was predicted for a range of phosphatase concentrations, overlapping with the physiological kinase concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Aurora B inhibition was then simulated using the published relationship between ZM447439 concentration and Aurora B activity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ditchfield et al., 2003</a>). The steady-state Aurora B activity was examined starting from two different initial conditions: when all cellular kinase had enzymatic activity of the fully active kinase or it was inactive. The inhibitor concentration was varied in 10-nM steps, and the spatial distribution of Aurora B kinase activity was calculated and averaged to represent the overall fraction of active kinase for each initial condition and inhibitor concentration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lines). As in the homogeneous system (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the <i>K<sup>P</sup><sub>M</sub></i> value for phosphatase affected the exact shape and position of this theoretical hysteresis plot. The enzymatic constant for phosphatase acting on Aurora B kinase in cells is not known, but <i>K<sup>P</sup><sub>M</sub></i> = 0.16 \u00b5M provided an excellent match with experimental measurements in cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus, Aurora B hysteresis in mitotic cells can be reproduced using the molecular and biochemical features which form the basis for our model and reasonable values of model parameters."

Importantly, all other model features and the values of all other parameters were unchanged, such that Aurora B autoactivation and its inhibition by phosphatase were still present. With this modification, the bistable region could only be observed at much higher kinase and phosphatase concentrations, while bistability in the range of physiological Aurora B concentrations was lost (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). When this modified model was used to mimic the ZM447439 inhibition experiment, it predicted a reasonably good match to the gradual decrease in Aurora B activity in experiments with increasing inhibitor concentration. However, when calculations were done starting from the inactive kinase and the inhibitor was 'washed out', the model prediction did not change, indicating a lack of hysteresis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Thus, bistability of the underlying biochemical pathways is required to explain hysteresis that we detected with the Aurora B phosphorylation sensor in cells."

Previous experiments using cells arrested in mitosis found gradients of Aurora B phosphorylation spreading from centromeres, along chromosome arms, after Aurora B was inhibited with ZM447439 and then the inhibitor was washed out (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Analogous images were obtained in this work after inducible clustering of Aurora B at the centromere (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), emphasizing that these large scale phosphorylation patterns are triggered by Aurora B localization and activation at the centromere. We modeled the kinase inhibitor washout experiment to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of activated Aurora B kinase, then calculated the resulting phosphorylation patterns for a chromatin-bound substrate (see Materials and methods). Consistent with the in vivo experiment, the model exhibited spatially non-uniform large-scale distributions with phosphorylation high at the centromere and gradually decreasing along chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In the model, and in cells, these gradients are transient, as Aurora B signal propagates from the centromere, eventually leading to uniformly high Aurora B phosphorylation of all chromatin bound substrates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This spreading appeared similar to a trigger wave, a hallmark feature of a bistable medium (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kapral and Showalter, 1995</a>). Importantly, self-sustained trigger waves propagate at a constant speed, which discriminates them from other mechanisms of signal propagation in systems with diffusion. Indeed, the predicted plot for the timing of Aurora B activation as a function of distance from the centromere was linear, implying a constant rate of spreading (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). To test this model prediction we plotted the time of phosphorylation as a function of distance from centromeres for the chromatin bound FRET sensor, from experiments in which ZM447439 was washed out. This dependency was also linear, strongly suggesting that phosphorylation along chromatin propagates as a trigger wave (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). As expected, the model with no bistability in the concentration range of chromatin bound Aurora B predicted very different kinetics of phosphorylation spreading with a non-linear rate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>)."

Previous measurements in metaphase using Aurora B phosphorylation sensors targeted to different molecular locations at kinetochores revealed different phosphorylation levels at sites separated by only 10s of nm, indicating a sharp gradient of Aurora B activity (<a href=\"#bib79\">Welburn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>). With our model, we calculated the fraction of activated kinase as a function of distance from the centroid (midway between the sister kinetochores) for the unstretched centromere, corresponding to the microtubule-free kinetochores in prometaphase. Almost the entire centromere-bound pool of prometaphase Aurora B kinase is predicted to be active, with the fraction of active kinase decreasing slightly at the kinetochore (bounded by CENP-A and Ndc80) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We then stretched this mechano-biochemical system to mimic the ~2-fold increase in distance between sister kinetochores seen in metaphase HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wan et al., 2009</a>). In stretched chromatin the distance between Aurora B binding sites increased correspondingly, as indicated with the white mesh in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. As a result, the local concentration of chromatin-bound kinase decreased, and a region of bistability emerged at the kinetochore, hundreds of nm away from the centroid (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As we have shown earlier, the bistable kinase-phosphatase system exhibits a highly nonlinear behavior. In the chromatin meshwork, these threshold-dependent reactions created a stable and steep gradient of Aurora B kinase activity. In contrast, in the model with no bistability, stretching induced a much more gradual gradient of Aurora B activity, reflecting a gradual decrease in density of centromere-bound Aurora B kinase (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,D</a>)."

First, we use a rapamycin-induced targeting system to examine the immediate effects of concentrating Aurora B at centromeres. This approach represents an advance over previous manipulations of Aurora B localization, such as depleting CPC components, comparing different mutant forms of INCENP, or inhibiting mitotic kinases that control CPC localization (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vader et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tsukahara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yamagishi et al., 2010</a>). In the experiments reported here, Aurora B localization is controlled by rapamycin addition, while keeping other components of the system constant, so indirect effects from these manipulations are less likely. Importantly, in the absence of rapamycin, the cytosolic Aurora B/INbox protein complex shows little activity toward chromatin-localized targets. However, recruiting the same complex to centromeric binding sites leads to phosphorylation of the chromatin-localized probe within minutes, demonstrating that the highly-concentrated centromeric pool of Aurora B is essential for phosphorylation at other cellular locations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This result from mitotic cells suggests that specialized mechanisms enable long-range regulation of Aurora B kinase activity in mitosis."

Testing such biochemical models requires knowledge of the underlying feedbacks and specific enzymatic constants and parameters values. In this work we build a quantitative foundation for such a mechanism using a reconstituted system with purified components. First, our work defines a quantitative biochemical mechanism for Aurora B autoactivation (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Previous experiments have suggested that Aurora B is activated in trans (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bishop and Schumacher, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Honda et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sessa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kelly et al., 2007</a>). We confirm these initial findings, but we also find that only the active, already phosphorylated Aurora B kinase can activate in trans. The analogous reaction by the unphosphorylated kinase is not as productive and is carried out in cis. This newly revealed cis component dominates at initial stages of Aurora B kinase activation, when the majority of kinase molecules are still unphosphorylated. The cis step may reflect autophosphorylation of the activation loop, as shown for Aurora A (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dodson et al., 2013</a>), while the TSS motif of INCENP is phosphorylated in trans. The significance of the in cis reaction is not fully understood, but we show that its rate has a large impact on the bistable region of the Aurora B-phosphatase system, as discussed below."

Thus, although our simplified reconstitution in vitro used the non-physiological \u03bb phosphatase, the model suggested that these nonlinear regimes could exist in a physiological cell context, where Aurora B kinase is coupled with its native phosphatase partner(s). Indeed, we were able to recreate bistability and hysteresis for Aurora B substrate phosphorylation in live mitotic cells. Our cellular experiments relied on sensors at different locations (centromere or chromatin) and used three methods to synchronize cells (monastrol, nocodazole, or the proteasome inhibitor MG312). Because these different experimental tools led to consistent results, our findings in cells likely reflect the same basic non-linear mechanisms that we recapitulated in vitro. We therefore explain the distinct phosphorylation states in mitotic cells as arising from the threshold-dependent autoactivation of the highly concentrated pool of centromere-localized Aurora B, propagated at long distance via the chromatin-bound and cytosolic pools of Aurora B. As in vitro, the high kinase activity state in cells can be sustained over a range of input signals, which in cells were generated using different concentrations of a specific Aurora B inhibitor. As the inhibitor concentration was increased, the system switched to the low kinase activity state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), just as happened in vitro\u00a0and in our model when the threshold was crossed. Moreover, these 'high or low' kinase activity states persisted in populations of mitotic cells under the same conditions, depending on the initial state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). The consistency between our findings in vitro and in vivo indicates that we have captured key features of the Aurora B-phosphatase system that underlie cellular behaviors."

                        "text": "This conclusion is also supported by our ability to describe the in vivo results for bistability and hysteresis using a spatial model of Aurora B kinase activity in mitotic cells. Since the cellular environment for Aurora B regulation is complex and many constants for the underlying biochemical and molecular reactions in cells are not known, it is currently not possible to provide a detailed quantitative description of Aurora B phosphorylation in cells. However, using reasonable assumptions and values for unknown model parameters, we were able to recapitulate our findings of hysteresis in live cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Moreover, the model made a strong prediction for the propagation of self-sustained trigger wayves of kinase phosphorylation. Long-range propagation of Aurora B phosphorylation has been observed previously (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2011</a>), but it was thought to be caused by simple diffusion of activated Aurora B released from the sites of concentration. We quantified these waves and found that they propagate at constant speed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), strongly implying that they are sustained by a more complex reaction-diffusion mechanism in a bistable system. Additionally, we demonstrate that a highly similar reaction-diffusion model, which also includes kinase autoactivation coupled with inactivating phosphatase but lacks bistability in the range of physiological Aurora B concentrations, fails to reproduce the trigger waves and other results in cells. We conclude that bistability of the coupled kinase-phosphatase system is an essential feature of Aurora B kinase regulation in cells."

Based on our findings, we propose that bistability of a coupled Aurora B-phosphatase system enables formation of an excitable medium, in which a source of localized active kinase can trigger complex spatial patterns, orchestrating Aurora B phosphorylation in a time and location-dependent manner. Specifically, our work offers a plausible physico-chemical mechanism to explain long-distance regulation of phosphorylation at the mitotic kinetochore in response to tension. We view the centromeric chromatin as a mechanical medium that is capable of sustaining biochemical reactions via a spatially non-uniform distribution of Aurora B kinase. Activity of this kinase in different chromatin areas depends on both the local concentration of chromatin-tethered Aurora B molecules and on the activity of the soluble Aurora B pool. Importantly, our work clearly shows that the level of Aurora B activity in each local area also depends on Aurora B activity in more distant locations of this mechano-biochemical medium. This is because in areas with higher kinase concentration, such as the inner centromere, kinase is strongly activated due to the two component autoactivation mechanism. This activity then propagates to more distant areas with lower kinase concentration via phosphorylation in trans by neighboring chromatin-tethered kinase molecules and via their cross-talk with diffusing soluble kinase. Since the concentration of chromatin-bound kinase decreases from the inner centromere to the outer kinetochore, this reaction-diffusion system can establish a gradient of kinase activity even if the underlying biochemical pathways are not bistable (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, we demonstrate that when the bistable coupled kinase-phosphatase system is incorporated into this stretchable mechanical matrix, the resulting phosphorylation gradients can be much steeper. Moreover, the steep part of the gradient arises only upon kinetochore stretching and coincides with the outer kinetochore area, where the concentration range for Aurora B kinase causes its bistability. Thus, bistability affords versatile control of the position and steepness of the resulting gradient, which is thought to be essential for regulation of kinetochore-microtubule interactions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krenn and Musacchio, 2015</a>)."

In addition to the bistable system described here, other mechanisms may also regulate spatial patterns of Aurora B activity, such as changes in Aurora B enrichment at centromeres as chromosomes align (<a href=\"#bib55\">Salimian et al., 2011</a>) and localized phosphatase activity at different cellular locations, such as kinetochores or centromeres or on chromatin (<a href=\"#bib66\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kitajima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Riedel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Foley et al., 2011</a>). Localization of both PP1 and PP2A at kinetochores depends on microtubule attachment and tension, and changes in these local phosphatase activities may modulate the location of the bistable region of Aurora B activity or exert direct effects on substrates located in the immediate vicinity. These additional mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and future experiments, building on our developed in vitro system and quantitative model, should examine how these mechanisms contribute to the establishment and maintenance of gradients at the appropriate spatial scales."

The template for the PCR reaction was a PGEX-6P plasmid containing a bicistronic message of full length Aurora B and INCENP<sup>790-856</sup> (a gift of Dr. Stukenberg). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the <i>Bam</i>HI/<i>Not</i>I sites of a pRSF duet vector customized to have a GST tag in frame with Aurora B, separated by a TEV cutting site. The Aurora B:INCENP<sup>790-856</sup> complex was expressed in <i>E. coli</i> strain BL21 (pLys) and purified in two steps. First, conventional affinity chromatography was used with glutathione beads, and the protein complex was eluted by cutting with TEV protease (as in <a href=\"#bib59\">Sessa et al., 2005</a>). Second, size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex S-200 column was used.

This sensor contains a peptide with the consensus recognition sequence for Aurora kinases (RRF-S-L) conjugated with a Sox fluorescent probe. Upon phosphorylation of serine residue, the Sox probe binds soluble magnesium and experiences chelation-enhanced fluorescence. Emission at 485 nm was monitored (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) with a Fluoromax 3 spectro-fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Horiba,\u00a0Edison, NJ) or with a 814 Photomultiplier Detection System (Photon Technology International,\u00a0Edison, NJ) using a quartz fluorimeter cuvette (105.251-QS,\u00a0Hellma Analytics,\u00a0M\u00fcllheim, Germany); the excitation wavelength was 400 nm. In routine experiments, the fluorescence of 10 \u00b5M chemosensor was measured for at least 10\u2009min in 50 \u00b5l kinase assay buffer: Tris-HCL (pH 7.5) 50 mM, NaCl 50 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 12 mM, ATP 4 mM, phosphonoacetic acid 10 mM (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#284270), DTT 2 mM, Brij23 0.01%, EGTA 0.5 mM, BSA 0.5 mg/ml. Aurora B kinase was added at 10 nM final concentration (unless stated otherwise) and the cuvette was sealed to avoid evaporation. Final concentration of glycerol did not exceed 1%. To determine fluorescence intensity of the phosphorylated chemosensor (product), the phosphorylation reaction was observed to reach a plateau, such that the product concentration was assumed to equal the initial concentration of the unphosphorylated chemosensor. Standard curves for substrate and product were used to convert fluorescence intensity counts per second (cps) into peptide concentrations; the slopes of these curves were 6520 \u00b1 80 and 15,000 \u00b1 400 cps/\u00b5M, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

Since the partially active kinase was highly inefficient in phosphorylating the chemosensor substrate, at low kinase concentration the changes in kinase activity due to autophosphorylation were examined directly in the presence of chemosensor. Partially active Aurora B kinase was diluted to 0.16, 0.5 or 1.5 \u00b5M in the 'kinase assay' buffer without BSA and EGTA ('activation' buffer), which caused full phosphatase inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

As a control, the fully active kinase was first preincubated in the 'inactivation' buffer with no phosphatase, then incubated in the 'activation' buffer, as done with the partially active Aurora B. Both, experimental and control samples were subjected to dialysis in 3,500 MWCO mini dialysis units (Slide-A-Lyzer, Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 30\u00b0C in 100 ml of activation buffer with glycerol 3% and MnCl<sub>2</sub> 25 \u00b5M. Dialysis was required to avoid ATP depletion during Aurora B autoactivation. The degree of Aurora B activation at different times was determined by taking an aliquot of the autoactivation reaction diluted in 'kinase assay' buffer to obtain 10\u201380 nM of final Aurora B concentration. This dilution essentially stopped all autoactivation reactions, so the initial rate of chemosensor phosphorylation (&lt; 10% phosphorylation), could be determined. The initial rate in samples with partially active kinase was compared with the initial rate in control samples taken at the same time, and the concentration of active kinase was determined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

When phosphatase concentration is low, nearly all kinase is active, as expected for autoactivation. With increasing phosphatase concentration, the steady-state concentration of active Aurora B decreases. When total concentration of Aurora B is low this decrease is monotonic. However, for total concentration of Aurora B&gt;3.9 \u00b5M, 3 steady state solutions can be seen, demonstrating bistability. The region of parameters for which three steady states coexist (region of bistability) is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>."

Kinetic behavior of the system of equations 4 was analyzed using different Aurora B kinase and phosphatase concentrations and ODEs solver of PEFT software. In the region of bistability, the steady-state concentration of active Aurora B depends on the relationship between initial conditions and threshold value. Presence of the threshold is evident from the behavior of this system when initial conditions are chosen close to threshold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and in response to perturbations of the steady state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Calculations for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> started from 8 \u00b5M of partially active Aurora B and the systems achieved the steady state with low Aurora B activity. We then simulated additions of small amounts of active Aurora B of different concentration (indicated with arrows in this graph). The first two additions of active Aurora B (0.3 and 0.4 \u00b5M) did not increase the fraction of active Aurora B, as the injected active kinase was rapidly inactivated. The last addition of 0.5 \u00b5M active Aurora B pushed the system above the threshold, and it rapidly transitioned into the steady state with high activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). To examine theoretically whether this system exhibits hysteresis, solutions for system (4) were found for various levels of phosphatase. Calculation with active Aurora B started from 0 \u00b5M phosphatase. Phosphatase concentration was then gradually increased up to 1 \u00b5M, then decreased down to 0 \u00b5M with the same speed (shown with arrows in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The slow speed of these transitions ensured that the system reached quasi steady state at all phosphatase concentrations. The total calculation time for one such cycle equaled 100\u2009hr of the reaction time. The resulting graph in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> shows that trajectories for the motion toward high and low phosphatase concentrations superimposed completely in the areas where the system has a single steady state. In the bistable region, the trajectories bifurcate: when phosphatase concentration is increasing, the system follows the upper branch, but it follows the lower branch when phosphatase is reduced, giving rise to a hysteresis loop."

As expected, the two sites model provides a good description to these experimental data with unconstrained best fit constants (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). To describe autoactivation of 4 \u00b5M Aurora B without chemosensor, we put <i>S</i> = 0 and calculated concentration of active Aurora B as a sum of concentrations of <i>A<sup>#</sup></i> and <i>A<sup>##</sup></i> forms (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). To model hysteresis experiments in vitro we supplemented the two sites model (5) with phosphatase reactions. Here, we assumed that kinase forms <i>A<sup>#</sup></i> and <i>A<sup>##</sup></i> could be dephosphorylated by a phosphatase with Michaelis-Menten like kinetics and that these reactions took place in the reverse order relative to the reactions of phosphorylation: <i>A<sup>##</sup></i> could only be converted to <i>A<sup>#</sup></i>, which was then converted to <i>A:</i>"

We therefore tested if the one site model can be considered as a limiting case of the two sites model. We significantly (500-fold) increased the rate of conversion of <i>A<sup>#</sup></i> into <i>A<sup>##</sup>,</i> thereby reducing the maximal concentration of the intermediate kinase form down to few percent of the total (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). We then identified the set of model parameters (limiting case, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) that produced a good match to experiments in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> panels B and E. Remarkably, the limiting case parameter values were nearly identical to those we obtained with a one site model (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This analysis strongly justifies our use of a simplified model with only one phosphorylation site, as this model can be interpreted as a two site model with a rapidly converting Aurora B form with one phosphorylated site."

Additionally, it incorporates spatial distribution of Aurora B binding sites to mimic Aurora B localization to chromatin in prometaphase and metaphase cells. Aurora B distribution along the centromere-kinetochore axis was derived from the Aurora B fluorescent intensity profile seen at metaphase kinetochores ( Figure 2B in <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). The experimental distribution was deconvolved using a point spread function with a width 0.5 <i>\u03bb/NA</i> = 210 nm, where <i>\u03bb</i> = 594 nm is the excitation wavelength and <i>NA</i> = 1.4 is the objective numerical aperture. Normalized fluorescence intensity was converted into concentration using the estimated average concentration of the chromatin-bound Aurora B pool, as described below in section 'Choice of model parameters'. The resulting function <i>profile1</i>(x) is shown in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. Aurora B distribution along the chromosome arms, <i>profile2</i>(x) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) was obtained by measuring intensity of chromatin-bound signal in monastrol-arrested HeLa cells expressing GFP-Aurora B (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> panels D and E)."

This corresponds to interkinetochore distances 1.4 \u00b5m and 0.8 \u00b5m in metaphase and prometaphase, respectively,\u00a0as in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wan et al., 2009</a>).

Therefore, demonstrating this using an unphysiological phosphatase at potentially unphysiological kinase concentrations may not be so valuable to understand the problem. Although the apparent hysteresis in response to Aurora B inhibitor is very interesting, if localization of Aurora B and relevant phosphatase are affected by Aurora B inhibitor then this phenomenon may be nothing to do with a bistability observed in vitro."

The authors use a combination of mathematical modelling, biochemical reconstitution and in vivo inducible-targeting to show that Aurora B has to be concentrated at centromeres to become active, that it activates in cis, and that this behaviour is predicted from measuring Aurora B activation in vitro. They further show that in the presence of a phosphatase Aurora B activity exhibits bi-stability that depends on kinase but not phosphatase concentration. Thus the authors support the idea that concentrating Aurora B at centromeres is important to set up the Aurora B gradient, and that in the presence of a phosphatase Aurora B activity will exhibit bi-stable behaviour."

The mechanisms of autoactivation of the kinase were investigated using the chemosensor system, and the data are very useful in determining the mechanism of kinase autophosphorylation. However, even though it has been shown that at least two (and perhaps more) phosphorylations on the aurora-INbox construct (Sessa et al. 2005, Mol Cell, 18, 379) are necessary for full activation, the authors compare two mechanisms of auto phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B, C</a>), both of which are single phosphorylation events. Further, it is possible that the two sites are phosphorylated through different mechanisms. Indeed, structural study by Sessa et al. suggested that INCENP phosphorylation at the TSS motif, which enhances Aurora B activity, must be mediated by a <i>trans</i> mechanism. Since the <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>used here is measured by fully activated form of Aurora B-Inbox (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 2</a>), it is not clear how fully activated A* can be achieved by the purely in cis model as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. The conclusions drawn from the analysis of the phosphorylation curves are therefore incomplete and need further modeling. Additional experiments using phosphorylation site mutants would help resolve this pint. Furthermore, tracking down the kinetics of Aurora B phosphorylation and INbox phosphorylation (perhaps by phostag gel) would be necessary. This is important since \u201cthe dephosphorylated Aurora B kinase was two orders of magnitudes less active than the phosphorylated Aurora B\", but this partially active Aurora B appears to contain substantial amount of phosphorylated INCENP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

It would thus be more useful to fit each of the curves independently to y=k(A) t2 and then plot log (k(A)) vs A. The plot log (k(A)) vs. A should be a straight line with slope of one for the <i>cis</i> activation mechanism and two for the <i>trans</i>-activation mechanism. The plot might also indicate a fractional slope, indicating that both mechanisms are operative and further would indicate the significance of each of the mechanisms. To distinguish between these models, additional data using different Aurora B concentration are required. This approach would also avoid the complications of using the parameter obtained by fully activate kinase (<i>K<sub>M</sub></i>and <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> from <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

The differential equations in both equation set 1 and equation set 2 contain processes of two vastly different time scales. Substrate binding to enzyme is usually on the order or milliseconds, and enzymatic activity is on the order of minutes in this case. Using these two time scales in the same ODE simulation will necessarily lead to very unstable results. For example, the value of <i>k<sub>f</sub></i> from <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 2</a> is 0.38 \u00b5M-1s-1 is orders of magnitude less than usual substrate binding constants obtained from stop-flow spectrophotometry (e.g. Bowman et al. 1992, J. Biol. Chem, 267, 5346). A wrong estimate would affect the predictions of all the other systems modelled using these parameters. Since substrate concentrations are far higher than enzyme concentrations (10 nM enzyme compared to 7.5 \u00b5M sensor), the quasi-steady state approximation may be applied to substrate binding (Segel &amp; Slemrod 1989, SIAM Review, 31, 446; Rao &amp; Arkin 2003, J. Chem. Phys, 118, 4999) to avoid simulations on vastly different time scales and simplify the process considerably. This would mean that concentration [SA*] is constant in time. This assumption would reduce the three variables <i>k<sub>f</sub>, k<sub>r</sub></i> and <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>to just two variables <i>K<sub>M</sub></i>and <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> and reduce three differential equations to one analytical expression in eq 1."

To explain the gradients under physiological concentration using the bistability proposed by the authors, the concentration of kinase over the entire gradient would have to lie in the bistable region, i.e. greater than 4 \u00b5M. Even though it is possible that the local concentration at the centromere and the anaphase spindle midzone may possibly be high enough, it would be unlikely that the remaining kinase is enough to maintain such high concentrations over the entire gradient, especially in anaphase. The authors may argue that Aurora B becomes quickly inactivated upon diffusing out of the bistability regime, but if so, significance of bistability (or hysteric behaviour) of the Aurora B-phosphatase system in the reaction-diffusion model is not apparent. To sufficiently demonstrate significance of the bistable behaviour, the authors would need to address this issue."

If the kinase amount of the centromere changes, it is hard to argue that this is bistability, since the kinase inhibition affects not only kinase activity but also the local concentration of the kinase itself. Furthermore, PP1 at the kinetochore can be regulated by Aurora B, as shown by the Lampson lab. Thus, the process is far more complex than discussed here. 2) Correlated with the point 1, it is not obvious if the concentration of the inhibitor and the kinase activity is linear. If not, it is very difficult to prove the bistability. To examine this point, it would be critical to measure local concentration of active Aurora B (perhaps using anti-phospho Aurora B) over a wide range of Aurora B inhibitor concentrations."

They further show that in the presence of a phosphatase Aurora B activity exhibits bi-stability that depends on kinase but not phosphatase concentration. Thus the authors support the idea that concentrating Aurora B at centromeres is important to set up the Aurora B gradient, and that in the presence of a phosphatase Aurora B activity will exhibit bi-stable behaviour.

Both PP1 and PP2A have been associated with Aurora B (e.g., Sugiyama et al. 2002, Oncogene), but their relative importance and the relevant regulatory subunits are not known. The regulatory subunits are particularly important because they provide substrate specificity for the catalytic subunits, so using the catalytic subunit alone would not make the reconstitution more physiological. Additionally, the phenomenon of bi-stability in our coupled kinase-phosphatase system does not necessarily depend on the identity or specific characteristics of the phosphatase. Indeed, our theoretical analysis (\u201cAnalysis of bistability dependence on catalytic constants for phosphatase\u201d subsection of part III of the Materials and methods: Theoretical modeling of experiments in vitro) demonstrates that the kinetics of Aurora B kinase autoactivation is the driving force for this bi-stable system, while phosphatase characteristics are not as important. As one reviewer pointed out, the phosphatase in our reconstitution simply provides \u201cfriction for the kinase to work against\u201d, so we believe that the current lack of knowledge about the identity of physiological phosphatase is not detrimental. Finally, we are not aware of any published in-depth analysis, theoretical or via reconstitution, of bistability of Aurora B kinase with any phosphatase, so our work discovering and characterizing this phenomenon represents a conceptually novel advance.

We also show that a reconstituted system of only two components, Aurora and phosphatase, exhibits the same behavior (bistability and hysteresis) in vitro in a similar range of Aurora B concentrations. Our logic is simply that bistability in cells could reflect an intrinsic property of Aurora B kinase opposed by some cellular phosphatase(s). This hypothesis is not only the most straightforward, but we put it forward in the absence of any other model that could explain bistability and hysteresis observed in cells. Indeed, these non-linear phenotypes strongly imply that the underlying molecular reactions are also bistable. The reviewers have suggested that changes in localization of kinase or phosphatase at different ZM447439 concentration could be responsible. Our experiments, however, have not found any changes in localization of these components (new <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, see also critical point 9d). An additional hypothesis suggested by the reviewers was that bistability in cells could be due to a specific dependency between ZM447439 concentration and Aurora kinase activity, but we argue that this also cannot explain our cellular results (see critical point 9e). Finally, our newly added quantification of the propagation of Aurora B activity waves following ZM447439 washout shows that it is characterized by a constant speed, a hallmark feature of bistable systems, which we have now documented in a physiological context (i.e., in living cells) (new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

We have now built a mechanistic molecular model for spatial regulation of Aurora B activity in the cell, incorporating the enzymatic constants we measured for Aurora B autoactivation in vitro (see new sections in main text). New experiments were conducted to collect some missing parameter values for this model (the distribution of Aurora B along chromosome arms in new <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panels B, C). First, we demonstrate that this model is quantitatively consistent with bistibility and hysteresis observed in experiments in cells with varying ZM447439 concentrations (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Second, we modeled two spatial phenomena: propagation of Aurora B phosphorylation along chromosome arms and distribution of active Aurora B kinase at the kinetochore in prometaphase and metaphase. Next, we measured the rate of phosphorylation propagation in live cells and found that it is constant (indicating that the underlying molecular system is bistable) and quantitatively consistent with model prediction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Moreover, a variation on our model, which included Aurora B kinase autoactivation (positive feedback) and opposing phosphatase but not bistability in the physiological concentration range, failed to describe this experiment. Finally, our modeling of the distribution of Aurora B activity at the centromere and kinetochore clearly demonstrates that bistability of an Aurora B kinase-phosphatase coupled system is essential to establish a steep gradient of Aurora B activity at the sites where its microtubule-binding substrates are located (new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To explain the gradients under physiological concentration using the bistability proposed by the authors, the concentration of kinase over the entire gradient would have to lie in the bistable region, i.e. greater than 4 \u00b5M. Even though it is possible that the local concentration at the centromere and the anaphase spindle midzone may possibly be high enough, it would be unlikely that the remaining kinase is enough to maintain such high concentrations over the entire gradient, especially in anaphase. The authors may argue that Aurora B becomes quickly inactivated upon diffusing out of the bistability regime, but if so, significance of bistability (or hysteric behaviour) of the Aurora B-phosphatase system in the reaction-diffusion model is not apparent.

This range is similar to what we use in our in vitro experiments. We explain how the concentration profile in this figure was generated in Materials and methods section IV. Importantly, Aurora B kinase is tethered to chromatin via an elongated INCENP (Samejima et al., 2015, JBC), so one kinase molecule can reach other molecules located 30 nm away or farther. Thus, the bound kinase is likely to be able to activate in trans in a concentration dependent manner. This becomes a very complex system, because chromatin-associated kinase is also in a dynamic equilibrium with a soluble pool. According to our calculations, chromatin bound kinase becomes completely active (on state) throughout the centromeric chromatin in prometaphase. In metaphase, when the centromere is stretched and the local kinase density is decreased, the model predicts an area with bistability near the outer kinetochore region, where a steep activity gradient is predicted (new <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C, E</a>). We demonstrate the significance of the bistable behavior by considering a model with modified Aurora B kinase, in which bistability is observed at concentrations that exceed those that are found at the centromere (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This model also predicts a gradient of Aurora B kinase activity, which simply reflects the distribution of its binding sites (new <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B, D, F</a>). Importantly, the gradient in the model with no bistability lacks the steep region coinciding with the outer kinetochore. Moreover, this gradient does not change significantly in response to kinetochore stretching in metaphase, while the bistable model shows the expected loss of phosphorylation at the outer kinetochore in metaphase. We believe that these new data illustrate clearly the essence of a new concept that we propose for spatial Aurora B kinase regulation, in which bistability plays an essential role."

We believe, however, that our work does represent a major advance towards addressing this important problem. As an analogy, spatial gradients of Aurora B activity in anaphase were first reported by Lampson and colleagues (Fuller et al. 2008, Nature) years before the functional significance of such gradients were revealed (Uehara et al. 2013, JCB; Ferreira et al. 2013, JCB; Afonso et al. 2014, Science).
