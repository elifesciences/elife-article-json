Despite the importance of MeCP2 levels to brain function, little is know about its regulation. Here, we report eleven individuals with neuropsychiatric disease and copy-number variations spanning <i>NUDT21</i>, which encodes a subunit of pre-mRNA cleavage factor Im. Investigations of <i>MECP2</i> mRNA and protein abundance in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells from one <i>NUDT21</i> deletion and three duplication cases show that <i>NUDT21</i> regulates MeCP2 protein quantity. Elevated <i>NUDT21</i> increases usage of the distal polyadenylation site in the <i>MECP2</i> 3'UTR, resulting in an enrichment of inefficiently translated long-mRNA isoforms. Importantly, normalization of <i>NUDT21</i> via siRNA-mediated knockdown in duplication-patient lymphoblasts restores MeCP2 to normal levels. In this study, we identify <i>NUDT21</i> as a novel candidate for intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disease, and elucidate a mechanism of pathogenesis by MeCP2 dysregulation via altered alternative polyadenylation."
