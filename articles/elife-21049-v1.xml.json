We demonstrate that Notch signaling is an integral part of the Wnt and Fgf signaling feedback loop coordinating cell migration and the self-organization of rosette-shaped sensory organs in the zebrafish lateral line system. We show that Notch signaling acts downstream of Fgf signaling to not only inhibit hair cell differentiation but also to induce and maintain stable epithelial rosettes. Ectopic Notch expression causes a significant increase in organ size independently of proliferation and the Hippo pathway. Transplantation and RNASeq analyses revealed that Notch signaling induces apical junctional complex genes that regulate cell adhesion and apical constriction. Our analysis also demonstrates that in the absence of patterning cues normally provided by a Wnt/Fgf signaling system, rosettes still self-organize in the presence of Notch signaling."

We demonstrate that Notch signaling is an integral part of the Wnt and Fgf signaling feedback loop coordinating cell migration and the self-organization of rosette-shaped sensory organs in the zebrafish lateral line system. We show that Notch signaling acts downstream of Fgf signaling to not only inhibit hair cell differentiation but also to induce and maintain stable epithelial rosettes. Ectopic Notch expression causes a significant increase in organ size independently of proliferation and the Hippo pathway. Transplantation and RNASeq analyses revealed that Notch signaling induces apical junctional complex genes that regulate cell adhesion and apical constriction. Our analysis also demonstrates that in the absence of patterning cues normally provided by a Wnt/Fgf signaling system, rosettes still self-organize in the presence of Notch signaling."

Additionally, these cell behaviors must be coupled with mechanisms that regulate the final size of the organ for correct integration into the organism. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these phenomena is a major focus of modern biology. Even though the intracellular mechanisms leading to cell shape changes are fairly well understood, we are only beginning to elucidate how signaling pathways coordinate cell shape changes with the development of a whole tissue or embryo. Additionally, the importance of multicellular, epithelial rosettes in <i>Drosophila</i> axis elongation and retina development, mouse pre-implantation embryo morphogenesis, pancreas development, brain tumors or the neural stem cell niche has only fairly recently been recognized (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bedzhov and Zernicka-Goetz, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Blankenship et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Harding et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Wippold and Perry, 2006</a>)."

                        "text": "The zebrafish lateral line is a powerful model to study sensory organ morphogenesis, as it develops superficially in the skin and is amenable to experimental manipulation and in vivo imaging. The lateral line is a sensory system for the detection of water movements and consists of rosette-shaped sensory organs (neuromasts) that are arranged in lines along the body of the animal. Each neuromast is composed of sensory hair cells surrounded by support cells. Lateral line hair cells are homologous to vertebrate inner ear hair cells and are specified by the same molecules (<a href=\"#bib63\">Nicolson, 2005</a>). The lateral line system on the trunk develops from an ectodermal placode posterior to the ear that migrates to the tail tip. The migrating placode (now called primordium) periodically deposits clusters of cells that mature into neuromasts, thus forming a line of sensory organs. This migrating primordium consists of a mesenchymal leading region and a trailing region in which cells apically-basally polarize and then apically constrict to form garlic bulb/rosette-shaped proneuromasts (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib27\">Harding et al., 2014</a>]). The two domains are maintained by a feedback mechanism between the Wnt and Fgf pathways (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aman and Piotrowski, 2008</a>). Activation of the Wnt pathway in the leading region induces Fgf ligands that activate the Fgf pathway in the trailing region. Fgf ligand expression is uniform in the leading region but then becomes restricted to one central cell as organs (proneuromasts) begin to form. Fgf ligand expression by a central proneuromast cell that activates Fgf signaling in surrounding cells is crucial for proneuromast formation and maintenance (<a href=\"#bib18\">Durdu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ernst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Harding and Nechiporuk, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lecaudey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</a>). Fgfr-Ras-Mapk signaling is thought to directly induce apical constriction and rosette formation via the activation of the actin-binding protein <i>shroom3. shroom3</i> leads to apical localization of Rock2a kinase that phosphorylates non-muscle myosin II (pNMII) driving actomyosin constriction (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ernst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Harding and Nechiporuk, 2012</a>)."

The only manipulation described that causes an increase in neuromast size is the upregulation of Wnt signaling, while the size of the primordium increases after inhibition of the Hippo pathway member <i>amotl2a</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwala et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Head et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wada et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wada and Kawakami, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jacques et al., 2014</a>). The Hippo pathway controls organ size via a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of the transcriptional co-activators Yap/Taz (<a href=\"#bib84\">Sun and Irvine, 2016</a>). In the absence of pathway activation, Yap/Taz are translocated to the nucleus where they activate proliferation and survival genes. The Wnt pathway affects organ size via controlling proliferation, which, at least partially, is regulated by <i>amotl2a</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwala et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, loss of the transcriptional co-activator <i>yap1</i> rescues the <i>amotl2a</i> overproliferation phenotype but does not interact with the Wnt pathway. Thus, the details of how Wnt, <i>amotl2a</i> and <i>yap1</i> are integrated to affect proliferation are not well understood. Here we describe how the upregulation of Notch signaling by overexpression of the Notch1a intracellular domain (ICD; NICD, [<a href=\"#bib76\">Scheer and Campos-Ortega, 1999</a>]) in the primordium, leads to a significant increase in neuromast size. The increased neuromast size in both Notch and Wnt overexpressing embryos is <i>yap1</i>-independent, and in case of NICD the organ size increase is even proliferation-independent."

We demonstrate that Fgf-dependent Notch signaling cell-autonomously, and downstream of Fgf signaling upregulates adherens and tight junction molecules. These molecules together form an apical junctional complex associated with a circumferential actomyosin belt (<a href=\"#bib64\">Niessen, 2007</a>). Thus, Notch signaling increases organ size independently of proliferation by coordinating actomyosin activation and cell adhesion."

Consequently, ectopic activation of Notch signaling generates an initially larger primordium at the expense of the ganglion, which could explain the increase in neuromast size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Indeed primordium size limits how large NICD neuromasts can grow. NICD primordia become increasingly smaller during migration and NICD neuromasts accordingly decrease in size the further posterior they are located along the trunk of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O and P</a>). However, by 32 hpf NICD and sibling primordia consist of the same number of cells but NICD primordia still deposit larger L3 neuromasts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O and P</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Also, heat-shock activation of Notch signaling after the primordium and ganglion have separated significantly increases the neuromast cell number (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Q\u2013R\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). These results indicate that, although the primordium size determines the maximum size of an enlarged neuromast, the increased NICD neuromast size is independent of the early role of Notch in allocating cells to the primordium."

In addition, <i>yap1</i> morpholino injections inhibit the ectopic proliferation in the primordium that is induced by loss of <i>amotl2a,</i> phenocopying the <i>yap1</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwala et al., 2015</a>). We therefore injected <i>yap1</i> morpholino into NICD and <i>apc</i> embryos and counted the number of cells in the deposited neuromasts, as well as migrating primordium. <i>yap1</i> morpholino reduces the number of primordium cells in its expression domain in the leading 2/3 of wildtype, <i>apc</i> and NICD primordia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). As morpholino injections can cause cell death in the lateral line (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aman et al., 2011</a>), we injected the <i>yap1</i> morpholino into homozygous <i>p53</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>). The primordium cell number decreases from approximately 100 to 80, which is similar to what we find in <i>yap1</i> morpholino-injected wildtype embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), suggesting that the decrease in cell number is not caused by morpholino-induced <i>p53</i> activation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kok et al., 2015</a>). Although <i>yap1</i> downregulation significantly reduces the size of the primordium, it does not rescue neuromast size in <i>apc</i> or NICD embryos to a wildtype level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). The reduction in NICD L1 and L2 pro-neuromast size in <i>yap1</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F and G</a>) can be attributed to the role of <i>yap1</i> in primordium size regulation and that the primordium size limits the number of cells available for allocation into forming neuromast (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O and P</a>).

Therefore, the reduction in the number of leading region cells is equally insufficient to explain the increase in organ size. The last potential cell fate switch that could contribute to the organ size increase is the loss of future interneuromast cells from the primordium. Future oblong-shaped interneuromast cells are located at the periphery of the primordium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M\u2019</a>, arrow) but their number is not affected in NICD embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4O\u2013P</a> arrows, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Q</a>). The only significant difference we detected between NICD and sibling primordia is that NICD primordia possess on average fewer, larger proneuromasts at the expense of a normal-sized proneuromast (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M and M\u2019</a>, grey cells, and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4R</a>).

It has therefore been proposed that the Fgf-expressing central cell in a proneuromast acts as a signaling center that recruits surrounding support cells by inducing Fgf signaling in these cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lecaudey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</a>). We therefore tested if in NICD proneuromasts, Fgf ligand expression or Fgf signaling is increased.

Subtracting the constriction volumes of R2 from R3 of WT and <i>mib1</i> proneuromasts reveals that the difference is positive for wildtype proneuromasts, whereas it is negative for <i>mib</i> proneuromasts. Therefore, the constriction volumes decrease in <i>mib1</i> as they mature and before they are deposited. These observations support the findings by Matsuda et al., that <i>mib1</i> proneuromasts fall apart (<a href=\"#bib58\">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</a>). The disintegration of apical constrictions becomes more apparent between 32\u201336 hpf, as the loss of Notch signaling in <i>mib1</i> mutants becomes progressively more severe, likely because of depleted maternal stores (<a href=\"#bib58\">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</a>)."

The conclusion that the loss of Fgf signaling in NICD primordia is mostly caused by Notch-mediated repression of Wnt signaling is confirmed by our finding that Fgf signaling (<i>pea3</i>) can be activated in NICD primordia by activating Wnt signaling with the GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor BIO (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8S,S'</a>).

Wnt signaling upregulates proliferation in deposited neuromasts, whereas Notch signaling induces an increase in organ size as they form within the primordium in a proliferation-independent manner. Accordingly, cell cycle inhibition in NICD embryos does not rescue the neuromast size, in line with our previous study that demonstrated that proliferation does not influence wildtype neuromast size (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aman et al., 2011</a>). Likewise, although inhibition of the Hippo pathway component <i>amotl2a</i> causes an increase in proliferation in the primordium (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwala et al., 2015</a>) and <i>yap1</i> morpholino injections reduce the primordium size, neither manipulation affects the size of the forming sensory organs in wildtype, <i>apc</i> or NICD embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013H</a>; [<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwala et al., 2015</a>]). Thus, primordium size and lateral line organ size are regulated by independent mechanisms. However, in <i>amotl2a</i> mutant embryos on average one more neuromast develops (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwala et al., 2015</a>). Thus, primordium size does not affect neuromast size in a wildtype embryo but rather affects neuromast number. <i>yap1</i> is upregulated and <i>amotl2a</i> is reduced by Notch signaling without affecting the primordium cell number suggesting that <i>yap1</i> also possesses proliferation-independent functions that need to be further explored (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3H\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9A</a>)."

However, transplanted E-cadherin mutant cells do not show a phenotype likely due to redundancy, as the primordium expresses several other adhesion molecules, such as <i>epcam</i> and <i>claudins</i>. Epcam is a calcium-independent, epithelial adhesion molecule and its reduction in mutant zebrafish and cultured cells changes their adhesiveness and induces ectopic, localization of apical junctional complexes (<a href=\"#bib81\">Slanchev et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). <i>epcam (tacstd)</i> is required for zebrafish gastrulation movements, and its loss also does not cause a lateral line phenotype suggesting that it acts redundantly with other adhesion molecules in the primordium.

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the NICD phenotype is caused by the loss of the central hair cell precursor and loss of <i>atoh1a</i> expression because: (a) re-expression of Atoh1a in NICD primordia does not rescue neuromast size (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2019\u2019,F</a>) (b) <i>apc</i> and <i>hs:atoh1a</i> primordia show an increase in <i>e-cadherin</i>, even though <i>atoh1a</i> is robustly expressed, arguing that <i>atoh1a</i> does not inhibit <i>e-cadherin</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7CC</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8CC\u2019\u2019</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), (c) the loss of <i>atoh1a/b</i> by morpholino injection into wildtype embryos does not affect <i>e-cadherin</i> expression and does not lead to larger neuromasts (<a href=\"#bib58\">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</a>).

This suggests that neuromast size in <i>hs:atoh1a</i> embryos is possibly regulated by Notch signaling acting downstream of Atoh1a dependent Delta ligand expression. During zebrafish inner ear development Atoh1b is required for the initial activation of <i>her4</i> (<a href=\"#bib70\">Radosevic et al., 2014</a>).

In the first forming proneuromast <i>fgf3/10a</i> is expressed in all cells, whereas in trailing, more mature rosettes these ligands are restricted to a central cell. This restriction is controlled by Notch signaling that inhibits the proneural gene <i>atoh1a</i> in support cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). In contrast, even though Fgf signaling is active in all cells in the first forming proneuromast, the downstream targets <i>atoh1a</i> and <i>deltaa/b</i> are immediately restricted to a central hair cell precursor. Likewise, <i>wnt10a</i> is only expressed in one central cell. The restriction of <i>atoh1a</i> to a central cell contrasts findings in flies where <i>atoh1</i> is first broadly expressed, marking a prosensory field and only subsequently becomes restricted during cell specification (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jarman et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Millimaki et al., 2007</a>). The mechanisms by which Notch signaling immediately inhibits <i>atoh1a</i>, <i>delta</i> and <i>wnt10a</i> expression in support cells and confines them to a central cell are still unknown. Another difference between signaling in the first forming and trailing proneuromasts has previously been described. Fgf signaling is induced in all cells of the first forming proneuromast by Wnt ligands, possibly <i>wnt10a</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8K</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9A,B</a>). In more trailing proneuromasts, Fgf signaling depends on <i>atoh1a</i>, rather than Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, [<a href=\"#bib58\">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</a>]). Likewise, <i>atoh1a</i> expression becomes Fgf-independent and self-regulatory (<a href=\"#bib58\">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Millimaki et al., 2007</a>). Even though, Fgf and Notch signaling are particularly high in support cells because of lateral inhibition, some Fgf and Notch signaling occurs even in central cells, as evidenced by <i>her4</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1J</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5S</a>, not shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>), as well as <i>notch3</i>, albeit at lower levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

However, lumina only form in the trailing region of the primordium and are not required for Fgf-mediated formation of the first proneuromast (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Our results demonstrate that Fgf signaling is dispensable for rosette formation in the presence of ubiquitous Notch signaling. This finding begs the question why <i>fgf10a</i> production is restricted to a central cell that limits the number of Fgf-responding and Notch-activating cells.

Importantly, we show that Notch signaling acts cell-autonomously and downstream of Fgf signaling in sensory organ rosette formation via the regulation of cell adhesion and tight junction molecules. Therefore, Notch is involved in neuromast rosette self-organization that is analogous to rosettes and that precedes lumen formation in pre-implantation mouse embryos (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bedzhov and Zernicka-Goetz, 2014</a>). Similarly, rosettes self-organize during <i>C. elegans</i> gastrulation but are also characteristic for some brain tumors (<a href=\"#bib69\">Pohl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Wippold and Perry, 2006</a>).

Therefore, our results do not only inform lateral line biology but also contribute to our understanding of morphogenesis of other organs and tissues and how rosettes form in certain brain tumors."

To generate the <i>Tg(\u22128.0cldnB:gal4vp16)<sup>psi8</sup></i>, we used the zebrafish Tol2 kit (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kwan et al., 2007</a>). The 8 kb claudinB promoter fragment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Haas and Gilmour, 2006</a>) was cloned into the 5\u2019 entry vector and combined via a Gateway reaction with the Gal4-VP16 middle entry vector of the Tol2 kit. The DNA was injected into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos to generate transgenic fish. To generate the <i>TgBAC(cxcr4b:H2A-GFP)p2</i> transgenic line, the BAC clone DKEY-169F10 was modified in two ways by recombineering. First, the <i>Tol2</i> sites and the <i>cryaa:dsRed</i> transgenesis marker were inserted into the BAC backbone (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fuentes et al., 2016</a>). Second, a cassette consisting of H2A-GFP flanked by 791 bp and 1042 bp of homology upstream of <i>cxcr4b</i> exon 2, and downstream of the <i>cxcr4b</i> stop codon, respectively, was inserted to replace the <i>cxcr4b</i> coding sequence in <i>cxcr4b</i> exon 2 (amino acid 6\u2013358, the last amino acid before the stop codon) using seamless galK-mediated recombineering (<a href=\"#bib93\">Warming et al., 2005</a>). This transgene expresses the first five amino acids from <i>cxcr4b</i> exon 1 fused to H2A-GFP from the <i>cxcr4b</i> promoter. The final BAC transgene was characterized by SpeI and EcoRI restriction digestion, sequencing of PCR amplicons of the modified locus, and BAC-end sequencing. The DKEY-169F10 BAC library were obtained from ImaGenes GmbH, Germany. BAC transgenes were purified with the nucleobond BAC 100 kit (Clontech). We co-injected 1 nl of 50\u2013250 ng/ml BAC transgene DNA, and 40 ng/ml <i>Tol2</i> mRNA into the lifting cell of the zygote of 0- to 20-minute-old embryos. The <i>Tol2</i> mRNA was transcribed from pCS2FA-transposase (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kwan et al., 2007</a>) using the mMessage Machine SP6 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher). At 4 days post fertilization (dpf), the rate of mosaic expression of the fluorescent protein in the lens was scored. Clutches with 50% or more embryos showing mosaic fluorescent protein expression in the lens were raised to adulthood. Stable transgenic larvae were identified by out-crossing adults injected with the <i>cxcr4b:H2A-GFP</i> BAC transgene, and by raising larvae positive for the fluorescent transgenesis marker in the lens at 4 dpf. We screened 100 or more embryos from eight adults injected with the <i>cxcr4b:H2A-GFP</i> BAC transgene for fluorescent transgenesis marker expression in the lens and identified three founder fish. The full names of the transgenic lines identified are TgBAC(<i>cxcr4b:H2A-GFP; cryaa:dsRed</i>) p1 through p3. All experiments were performed according to guidelines established by the Stowers Institute IACUC review board."

Reads were mapped to the <i>Danio rerio</i> genome version danRer10 from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) using TopHat version 2.0.13, with gene annotations from Ensembl 84. RNASeq analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment analysis was performed in the R environment using the bioconductor packages edgeR, topGO, and biomaRt. Reads counted on Ensembl transcripts from UCSC using HTSeq version 0.6.1 were analyzed with edgeR to generate P values to form comparisons between wildtype and NICD embryos. Of the 32,105 genes detected, only 19,643 genes with a sum across all samples of at least three reads per million were considered for the analysis. P values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method. The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values were generated using Cufflinks version 2.2.1. To define differentially expressed genes in the NICD embryos, genes were selected with the following criteria: log2 ratio\u00a0&gt;0.5 with p value\u00a0&lt;0.01 and log2 ratio\u00a0&lt;\u22120.5 with p value\u00a0&lt;0.01, resulting in 187 genes up- and 502 genes downregulated, respectively. The necessary GO IDs were obtained from Ensembl using biomaRt. Of the 19,643 expressed genes, 11,757 were associated with GO terms. Therefore, only 117 of the 187 genes and 323 of the 502 genes were used in the GO analysis."

Previous studies from the Chitnis lab (Matsuda et al. 2010) described how loss of Notch signaling in mib1 mutants triggers problems in the morphogenesis of the lateral line primordium, including instability of deposited neuromasts and eventual disintegration of the primordium. In contrast to what was shown in this previous study, Kozlovskaja-Gumbriene et al. from the Piotrowski Lab have now shown, using a transgenic line expressing an active form of Notch (NICD), that broad activation of Notch in the primordium formation results in larger and fewer proneuromasts in the migrating primordium. This key observation now reveals a previously unappreciated, more direct role for Notch signaling in determining morphogenesis of epithelial rosettes. While this study confirms many observations made previously by Matsuda et al., the direct comparison of both gain and loss of function effects of Notch signaling allows them to go further by demonstrating the role of Notch signaling in inhibiting Wnt signaling and in acting downstream of FGF signaling to determine morphogenesis of epithelial rosettes."

The study also reveals an important additional role played by Notch ligands expressed in the central Atoh1a expressing cell in both nascent and maturing proneuromasts. In addition to preventing neighboring cells from expressing <i>atoh1a</i>, activation of Notch contributes to formation of stable apical constrictions in neighboring cells. Contrary to previous studies that suggested FGF signaling-dependent <i>shroom3</i> expression is required for morphogenesis of epithelial rosettes, this study shows that Shroom's role is dispensable."

First, the rows of isolated cells in panels A-C are difficult to relate to their counterparts in the intact images. Cell shapes in L1 appear similar in NICD and mib embryos but are quite distinct from wt, yet are described as normal. Cell constrictions in L2 are said to be lost in mib mutants. This is evident in some cells (e.g. blue and pink) but less so in others. And the pink cell in L1 in NICD also appears to lack an obvious apical constriction. Somehow interpretations in this part of the paper seem highly subjective. Note, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> is labeled to direct attention to <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, whereas the text mentions <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E-H</a> marks \"constriction volume\", but it is not clear what this means \u2013 and is this quantitative as the term suggests, or strictly qualitative as the images suggest?

In this case expectations are not discussed, nor is it clear whether data support the \"signaling center\" hypothesis or the \"altered cell adhesion\" hypothesis. With either model, one might expect that the number of wt cells recruited into a neuromast might vary depending on the number of transgenic cells present. Yet there was no attempt to correlate neuromast size with the percentage of wt vs. transgenic cells. Moreover, it is concluded that wt cells were \"never recruited to make neuromasts larger than they would normally be\". The basis for this is unclear. The image in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>\" appears to show a larger than normal neuromast that includes a mix of both wt and NICD cells, in apparent contradiction of the conclusion. Size measurements and cell counts (wt &amp; NICD) are needed to make a convincing argument. Other data in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> are more convincing. On a technical note, the high mag image in 7G' is inverted horizontally relative to the low mag image in 7G."

While in the gain of function experiments many more cells can be recruited to become part of an epithelial rosette, as noted above, this gain of function phenotype does not represent that pattern of Notch activation or epithelial rosette formation seen under normal circumstances, where formation of rosettes is beautifully coordinated by a central cell that becomes the source of FGFs and Notch ligands. Instead, I believe the paper provides excellent evidence for a role for Notch signaling in not only preventing neighboring cells from expressing <i>atoh1a</i> but also in determining formation of stable epithelial rosettes by activating Notch in the neighbors. The size of these rosettes may, under physiological conditions, still be determined by FGF signaling-though, now as we have learnt from this study, not only by <i>shroom</i> or MAPK dependent mechanisms as previously described but in addition by Notch signaling. As the authors themselves state, by determining Notch3 expression, FGF signaling may still play a critical role in determining which how many cells are recruited to become part of the rosette by Notch signaling. The gain of function experiments with NICD do, however, show how in the absence of all patterning determined by interactions between Wnt and FGF signaling systems, Notch signaling can independently determine a particular configuration of epithelial rosettes in the primordium."

One problem is that the broad spread of <i>wnt10a</i> expression seen in <i>apc</i> mutants is only seen following 20 hours of exposure to DAPT. Does it spread with a shorter treatment? If not, I suspect that the expansion of <i>wnt10a</i> expression is the indirect effect of something that takes a while to develop. One possibility is that it is related to progressive slow expansion in the number of <i>atoh1a</i> expressing cells. As Atoh1a inhibits expression of the FGF receptor, it would therefore permit Wnt signaling in this cell, which is so close to the source of Wnt signals. This may explain why transiently or in an oscillatory pattern Wnt10a is expressed in a spot just adjacent to the leading cloud of <i>wnt10</i> expression, where it is expressed under normal circumstances. Before the authors can conclude that the restricted pattern is determined by lateral inhibition they should determine if knock-down of <i>atoh1a</i> prevents the expansion. Alternatively, they can skip the experiment and suggest this alternate hypothesis."

How organ size is regulated by balancing cell proliferation and cell differentiation is an important question and the lateral line has been a good experimental model to address these questions. The authors deepen into them, and here they propose that in contrast to Wnt signaling that increases neuromast cell numbers by increasing cell proliferation, Notch regulates organ size independently of cell proliferation and by regulating cell adhesion and rosette number in the primordium. The authors combine several approaches and provide an extensive analysis of Notch effects. The work provides interesting, but not fully novel data and some of the conclusions are precipitated and not supported by their data. The link between the effects on cell adhesion and NMs size is not clear. On a side, there are several functional experiments addressing NICD effects on NMs size. On another set of experiments, the authors address the effects of NICD on rosette formation analyzing the primordium without showing the effect on deposited NMs size. In overall, the paper is very long, difficult to follow and without a clear-cut idea of the Notch role on NMs size."

The authors claim that the size of NICD NM is independent of primordium size (figure legend, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and this is not fully supported by their data. When overexpressing NICD early by combining cdnB:gal4 with UAS:NICD, the size of the primordium is bigger (while ganglion smaller) and in this condition, the L1 instead of containing approx 35 cells contains 110. Through development, as pLLP decreases its size, the NM size also decreases, indicating that the size of the primordium has an influence on NM size. If NICD is overexpressed after 25 hpf, the L1 or L2 NM only increases its size from 35 cells to 45-55. The authors suggest that as the size of the primordium in this condition is not bigger (due to the effect of ganglion-primordium fate switch) but the NM size is still bigger, the size of the primordium is not the cause of NM increase. However, in this later condition, the effect over NM size is much milder, indicating that if NICD is overactivated early, this has a very strong effect of first neuromasts deposited. How the authors explain that, if the size of the primordium has no effect on NM size, the early effects are much stronger than in the hs:NICD. It is not clear why all the data is shown in embryos in which NICD has been manipulated early instead of hsp:NICD to overcome possible effects of initial primordium size. The authors should also provide data on the size of the primordium in hs:NICD experiments."

But, as the authors mention later, within the primordium, the first forming proneuromast and more trailing proneuromasts are in different stages of cell fate specification due to different activities of FGF signaling. Since Notch affects FGF and Wnt signaling, it is possible that the proneuromast lost is converted to the fate of the other proneuromasts. It is possible that the disappearance of a proneuromast is due to the cell signaling effects and changes of proneuromast commitment stage and not due to increased recruitment of Rock2a that would be secondary.

The conclusion is strong for the little evidences on the cell adhesion and I would suggest to tune-down the conclusions. As in NICD more cells compose a proneuromast, it is obvious that the E-cadherin staining is going to be larger (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Moreover, in the NICD primordium one of the rosette disappears making the proneuromast larger, but if cell adhesivity is increased, why not more rosettes are formed instead?

If data from microsurgery experiments to measure of surface tensions in wt and NICD cells are available, this would be an interesting addition, but is not essential."

Instead, I believe the paper provides excellent evidence for a role for Notch signaling in not only preventing neighboring cells from expressing atoh1a but also in determining formation of stable epithelial rosettes by activating Notch in the neighbors. The size of these rosettes may, under physiological conditions, still be determined by FGF signaling-though, now as we have learnt from this study, not only by shroom or MAPK dependent mechanisms as previously described but in addition by Notch signaling. As the authors themselves state, by determining Notch3 expression, FGF signaling may still play a critical role in determining which how many cells are recruited to become part of the rosette by Notch signaling. The gain of function experiments with NICD do, however, show how in the absence of all patterning determined by interactions between Wnt and FGF signaling systems, Notch signaling can independently determine a particular configuration of epithelial rosettes in the primordium.</i>"

If not, I suspect that the expansion of wnt10a expression is the indirect effect of something that takes a while to develop. One possibility is that it is related to progressive slow expansion in the number of atoh1a expressing cells. As Atoh1a inhibits expression of the FGF receptor, it would therefore permit Wnt signaling in this cell, which is so close to the source of Wnt signals. This may explain why transiently or in an oscillatory pattern Wnt10a is expressed in a spot just adjacent to the leading cloud of wnt10 expression, where it is expressed under normal circumstances.

How organ size is regulated by balancing cell proliferation and cell differentiation is an important question and the lateral line has been a good experimental model to address these questions.

The authors combine several approaches and provide an extensive analysis of Notch effects. The work provides interesting, but not fully novel data and some of the conclusions are precipitated and not supported by their data. The link between the effects on cell adhesion and NMs size is not clear. On a side, there are several functional experiments addressing NICD effects on NMs size. On another set of experiments, the authors address the effects of NICD on rosette formation analyzing the primordium without showing the effect on deposited NMs size.

When overexpressing NICD early by combining cdnB:gal4 with UAS:NICD, the size of the primordium is bigger (while ganglion smaller) and in this condition, the L1 instead of containing approx 35 cells contains 110. Through development, as pLLP decreases its size, the NM size also decreases, indicating that the size of the primordium has an influence on NM size. If NICD is overexpressed after 25 hpf, the L1 or L2 NM only increases its size from 35 cells to 45-55. The authors suggest that as the size of the primordium in this condition is not bigger (due to the effect of ganglion-primordium fate switch) but the NM size is still bigger, the size of the primordium is not the cause of NM increase. However, in this later condition, the effect over NM size is much milder, indicating that if NICD is overactivated early, this has a very strong effect of first neuromasts deposited.

However, our data shows that irrespective of the activation status of Wnt and FGF in NICD primordia, always larger neuromasts form in the presence of Notch. Specifically, neuromasts are equally well formed when FGF is completely depleted in NICD primordia (FGF inhibitor treatments in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E-H</a>\u2019) or upregulated (FGF is elevated upon Wnt overexpression in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M-O</a>).

This shows that Wnt and Notch have an additive effect and therefore affect neuromast size by different mechanisms, namely increasing proliferation and adhesion (subsection \u201cActivated Notch leads to proliferation-independent neuromast growth\u201d, last paragraph."

However, we have previously shown that Wnt and FGF together (Aman et al., 2011) regulate proliferation. Possibly, proliferation is still triggered in NICD primordia, as in NICD primordia both Wnt and FGF are reduced"
