                    "text": "Eco-HAB is an open source, RFID-based system for automated measurement and analysis of social preference and in-cohort sociability in mice. The system closely follows murine ethology. It requires no contact between a human experimenter and tested animals, overcoming the confounding factors that lead to irreproducible assessment of murine social behavior between laboratories. In Eco-HAB, group-housed animals live in a spacious, four-compartment apparatus with shadowed areas and narrow tunnels, resembling natural burrows. Eco-HAB allows for assessment of the tendency of mice to voluntarily spend time together in ethologically relevant mouse group sizes. Custom-made software for automated tracking, data extraction, and analysis enables quick evaluation of social impairments. The developed protocols and standardized behavioral measures demonstrate high replicability. Unlike classic three-chambered sociability tests, Eco-HAB provides measurements of spontaneous, ecologically relevant social behaviors in group-housed animals. Results are obtained faster, with less manpower, and without confounding factors."

The system closely follows murine ethology. It requires no contact between a human experimenter and tested animals, overcoming the confounding factors that lead to irreproducible assessment of murine social behavior between laboratories. In Eco-HAB, group-housed animals live in a spacious, four-compartment apparatus with shadowed areas and narrow tunnels, resembling natural burrows. Eco-HAB allows for assessment of the tendency of mice to voluntarily spend time together in ethologically relevant mouse group sizes. Custom-made software for automated tracking, data extraction, and analysis enables quick evaluation of social impairments. The developed protocols and standardized behavioral measures demonstrate high replicability. Unlike classic three-chambered sociability tests, Eco-HAB provides measurements of spontaneous, ecologically relevant social behaviors in group-housed animals. Results are obtained faster, with less manpower, and without confounding factors."

For example, in most studies of autism and sociability in mice, behavioral effects related to anxiety and susceptibility to stress have been overlooked, even though, in humans, both these factors are co-morbid to autism spectrum disorders (<a href=\"#bib39\">Simonoff et al., 2008</a>). In fact, anxiety is the most common cause of social impairments in humans. Since some people with ASD never develop so-called 'associated' anxiety, we can assume that underlying neural mechanisms are at least partially different. Therefore, it is important to model single symptoms, separating them to the largest possible extent from any confounding factors in order to understand the brain pathology underlying the observed effects. Reliable behavioral tests allowing for differential diagnosis are the first necessary step on the long path to disentangling the complex neural background of specific pathologies."

Eco-HAB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) consists of four housing compartments, occupying four corners of a larger square, bridged by tube-shaped corridors. These corridors enable mice to travel freely and select preferred areas within the available territory. Two chambers on opposing corners of the square offer access to food and water (<i>ad libitum</i>) and provide shelter and secluded places where mice can sleep and rest. The two other compartments have similar designs except that they contain no food or water and one of the corners is equipped with an impassable, transparent, and perforated partition behind which an olfactory stimulus may be presented. Acknowledging the natural tendency of mice to live in family-based groups having many members (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrzejewski, 2002</a>), Eco-HAB is designed for testing littermate cohorts of up to 12 subjects. Animals are tracked individually by subcutaneously injected microtransponders that emit a unique identification code when mice pass under RFID antennas placed on both ends of each corridor. As Eco-HAB is a computer-controlled system, it eliminates human handling and allows for continuous data collection lasting for days or even weeks with minimal presence of human observers. Since the position of every mouse in an Eco-HAB system can be tracked, a novel in-cohort measure of sociability, based on the tendency of mice for spending time together, can be assessed. The in-cohort sociability score is calculated as described in the Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s6\">6</a>. Notably, results show that both Eco-HAB measures--in-cohort sociability and scent-based social approach--allow similar conclusions about mouse behavior to be reached. The latter measure is equivalent to the most natural social exploratory behavior observed in wild populations of mice."

Mice have developed the ability to learn and remember information associated with olfactory cues as effectively as primates recall visually related cues (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schellinck et al., 2008</a>). It has been shown that unfamiliar rodents in their natural habitats tend to avoid each other and, if forced to interact openly, often become aggressive (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lopucki, 2007</a>). Unfamiliar mice, irrespective of their sexes, are attracted by the scent of a conspecific rather than by its presence (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrzejewski, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lopucki and Szymroszczyk, 2003</a>). For that reason, scents have been previously employed in the 3ChA test (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ryan et al., 2008</a>) although, more commonly, unfamiliar animals are introduced into the social chamber. Even though the latter can be implemented in Eco-HAB, in the following experiments we used olfactory stimuli as a more ecologically pertinent solution. Presentation of odors behind partitions prevents spreading of scented bedding over the whole territory, but allows mice to freely approach olfactory cues (for a detailed apparatus and applied electronics description see 'Materials and methods' and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and its <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We optimized the behavioral protocol with respect to different testing times and measures. We optimized the behavioral protocol, testing times, and measures to fit with mouse preference. Under these optimized conditions, replicable results were obtained. In the final protocol, cohorts of 7 to 12 same-sex mice are subjected to 72-hr testing. During an adaptation phase (first 48\u00a0hr) mice can freely explore the whole apparatus. The odor-based social-preference testing phase starts with simultaneous introduction of two different beddings to two testing compartments. One of the beddings comes from a cage housing a mouse of the same sex, age, and strain as the tested animals ('social' scent), while the other is plain, new bedding from stock. These beddings are placed behind the perforated partitions of the testing compartments (for more details, see the 'Materials and methods'). Mice are allowed to explore both stimuli for 24\u00a0hr. Social approach is measured as the relative increase in time spent in the compartment containing social scent divided by the time spent in the opposite chamber that contains bedding without the social scent."

Experiments were performed on two widely used strains of mice displaying different anxiety levels: C57BL/6 and BALB/c. To obtain low-stress conditions, we used mild lighting and extensively habituated both the subjects and mice used as social stimuli to an experimenter and experimental rooms (for a detailed description of the protocol, see 'Materials and methods'). The results of these tests are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> through <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>. BALB/c mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) showed social preference only in low-stress conditions (n\u00a0=\u00a017), and they avoided social interactions when tested in a typical experimental setting (n\u00a0=\u00a011). In contrast, C57BL/6 mice displayed social preference in both stressful (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and stress reducing (n\u00a0=\u00a038) conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Social preference (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>) was measured as time spent in the chamber containing a social object compared to time spent in chamber with a non-social object. These results show that C57BL/6 mice approach a conspecific mouse more than an inanimate object, regardless of the level of experimental stress while BALB/c mice behave this way only when using stress reducing procedures. In both tested strains, conventional experimental treatment (high stress) reduced locomotor activity which may have attenuated the number of social contacts and influenced their propensity for exploration."

For these tests, social approach in the Eco-HAB system is calculated as the increase in the proportion of time spent in the compartment with social odor during the first hour after its presentation, divided by the proportion of time spent in the compartment with non-social stimulus. In the three-chambered test, social approach is the increase in the proportion of time spent in the compartment with an unfamiliar mouse, divided by the proportion of time spent in the compartment with an unfamiliar inanimate object. We used animals displaying different levels of social interactions, namely valproate-treated (VPA) mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains. Single prenatal valproate exposure is considered a mouse model of an environmental insult (a potential trigger) contributing to development of autism spectrum disorders (<a href=\"#bib31\">Roullet et al., 2013</a>), albeit some recent results report increased sociability of VPA-treated animals (<a href=\"#bib47\">\u0160tef\u00e1nik et al., 2015</a>)."

Automated Eco-HAB testing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) showed that valproate-treated C57BL/6 mice display increased social approach. Interestingly, 3ChA testing revealed the same result when subjects were single-housed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), but no differences between VPA and control animals when subjects were group-housed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In BALB/c mice, despite significant attempts at reducing experimental stress in 3ChA testing, only Eco-HAB revealed a significant increase in social behavior caused by VPA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Manual assessment with the use of the 3ChA showed the same trend in single-housed animals; however, differences were blurred by a huge variability in the scores (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Again, no differences were found between VPA and control, group-housed BALB/c subjects (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Further, to test if the individual sociability measure \u2013 approach to social odor \u2013 is stable in particular subjects, we performed two subsequent replications of Eco-HAB testing in the same cohorts of Fmr1 knockout and wild-type mice. Experiments were separated by a 10-day period of regular housing. Within-subject comparison (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) reveals high reproducibility of sociability assessment in particular subjects over time. Taken together, these studies show that Eco-HAB is a reliable tool that is reproducible for a number of tasks, from assessment of individual sociability, through phenotyping of subsequent cohorts of mice, to cross-laboratory comparisons."

Tube-shaped corridors had the following dimensions: length \u2013 300\u2009mm, inner diameter \u2013 40\u2009mm, outer diameter 420\u2009mm. Perforated partitions were rectangular in shape (width \u2013 115\u2009mm, height \u2013 150\u2009mm) with round bottom edges. Perforations were vertical, rectangular shaped, had soft edges, and began 10\u2009mm above the bottom of the cage. Perforations had the following dimensions: height \u2013 130\u2009mm, width 5\u2009mm, with equal 10\u2009mm spacing between perforations. Circular antennas were placed around corridors 40\u201360\u2009mm from the side walls of housing compartments. Square, stainless steel lids (250\u2009mm long and wide) were fitted for tops of the housing compartments. The two lids placed above the compartments containing perforated partitions were flat, whereas\u00a0the other two had grid trays for food and water bottles. Illumination levels were standardized between all compartments in an effort to reduce light impact on mouse activity. In the compartments with perforated partitions, light intensity was maintained between 79 and 84 lux. In the compartments equipped with food and water, light intensity was between 18 and 25 lux in shadowed areas and between 75 and 80 lux in non-shadowed areas. It is worth mentioning that the Eco-HAB design is easily scalable. With the exception of RFID coils, whose size needs to be adjusted in accordance to the corridor diagonal, there is no need to change applied electronics or software should one want to adapt the system for species other than mice."

During the adaptation phase, mice could freely explore all compartments. During the social preference testing phase, olfactory stimuli including either bedding from the cage of an unfamiliar mouse of the same strain, sex and age (novel social scent) or fresh bedding from a different room (novel non-social scent), were presented. Olfactory stimuli were simultaneously placed behind the perforated partitions of opposite testing compartments (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Mice could freely explore both testing compartments for 24\u00a0hr. Values from the first hour after presentation of the stimulus were used for statistical analysis. We excluded data from the analysis corresponding to the situation in which an animal had not visited chambers where olfactory stimuli had been presented in either adaptation or odor-based social preference testing phase, i.e. we discarded those rare cases in which the animals\u2019 locomotor activity was extremely low. In the course of a\u00a02-year period, we performed at least two biological replications of Eco-HAB testing of each experimental and control group. Although the protocol utilized here lasted 72\u2009hr, it is noteworthy that, when required, Eco-HAB can run continuously even for months with only short technical breaks for cage cleaning (every 7 days). The cages are not connected to the IVC system, so air exchange is not an issue. Moreover, any kind of olfactory stimuli may be presented behind perforated partitions, enabling experimenters to investigate matters such as motivational conflicts (e.g. when animals are allowed to choose between sniffing an odor related to food or the scent of a female)."

The system is based on COTS modules plugged into bread boards. The RFID reader module (UN-MOD3) uses an EM4095 receiver coupled to an ATTINY AVR microcontroller. The microcontroller controls the receiver via SPI interface and extracts the ID number of the RFID transponder. This number is then transmitted to the serial-to-USB transceivers via UART. The computer recognizes the transceivers as virtual ports. Since, by default, all RFID receivers work asynchronously with local ceramic oscillators, they interfere with each other and end up disabling operation of the system. To avoid this, the output of a 4\u00a0MHz crystal oscillator powered by 5V is distributed to all EM4095 IC clock inputs. All USB to serial modules are attached to an USB hub, which also supplies their power."

We have assessed the number of antenna crossings during the first 6\u2009hr period of the dark phase at the beginning of the adaptation phase, when animals are most active and intensely explore a new environment. Videos were recorded in complete darkness. A source of infra-red light placed above the apparatus was used to illuminate the field of view. Measurements were repeated twice on two independently tested cohorts of mice for the purpose of more reliable assessment. Based on these measurements, we concluded that the implemented system of coils can recognize subjects with high sensitivity, far exceeding that obtained with standard video-recognition methods. Due to the built-in internal synchronization system, RFID antennas run independently and do not disrupt each other. All eight coils may be activated simultaneously for an unlimited time."

Data from specific time intervals can be selected by the masking function ehs.mask_data. For example, calling ehs.mask_data(t1, t2) retrieves only those sessions starting after t1 and before t2. It is often convenient for an experimenter to mask data according to specific, well-defined experimental phases. Rather than having to calculate and remember numerical time values at which a given phase started and stopped for numerous phases across many experiments, these values can be quickly defined in a text file. This file can be then used to mask multiple data sets according to easily remembered phase names. Such a file is named config.txt and contains start and stop points for each phase an experimenter wishes to define in the following format:"

For a particular pair of subjects, animal a and animal b, we first calculate the times spent by the mice in each of the four compartments during a chosen experimental period: t<sub>a1</sub>, t<sub>a2</sub>, t<sub>a3</sub>, t<sub>a4</sub> for animal a, and t<sub>b1</sub>, t<sub>b2</sub>, t<sub>b3</sub>, t<sub>b4</sub> for animal b. The total time spent by the pair together in each of the cages is also calculated: t<sub>ab</sub> = t<sub>ab1</sub> + ;t<sub>ab2</sub> + t<sub>ab3</sub> + t<sub>ab4</sub>. All times are normalized by the total time of the analyzed segment, so that each of the quantities fall between 0 and 1. The in-cohort sociability (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2c</a>) is then defined by t<sub>ab</sub> - (t<sub>a1</sub>*t<sub>b1</sub> + t<sub>a2</sub>*t<sub>b2</sub> + t<sub>a3</sub>*t<sub>b3</sub> + t<sub>a4</sub>*t<sub>b4</sub>), which is the total time spent together (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>) minus the time animals would spend together assuming independent exploration of the apparatus (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>)."

This is the time when animals are most active, intensely exploring their new environment, and when aggressive behaviors were most probable as unstable social relations on novel territory are being tested by the animals."

The Eco-HAB apparatus described allows animals to explore a sizable space, the symmetry allows for comparison of different stimuli, and tube connectors may increase mouse comfort in the arena. The authors make an important argument about the need for better reproducibility in social testing, and provide data suggesting that social approach in anxiety-prone balb/c mice is different in the standard 3ChA test under high and low stress conditions. While they did not test the eco-HAB under different lighting or animal handling history conditions (making it not a direct comparison to either the 3ChA comparison or cross-lab variability), data from different time points suggests that the eco-HAB system provides consistent results. The authors further provide empirical data showing the utility of this system in assessing social behavioral differences across multiple variables (including mouse strain, VPA treatment, Fmr1 knockout). Finally, they present a neat metric they call \"in-cohort sociability\" that provides something really different from standard 3ChA testing because it measures social behavior towards known individuals. One might imagine a scenario under which novel animal social cue exploration might decrease but in-cohort sociability would go up, and having both metrics adds a lot to the interest of this setup."

The authors mention that some signals are dropped, and this is a classic issue with RFID reads \u2013 fast moving animals can be missed, and partial tag reads can abound. Depending on the structure of the individual ID tags (unique at only the beginning, end, or all), partial tag reads may or may not be assignable to individuals. Comparisons to hand-scoring of video feed will allow the authors to report estimate how much missing data there is (as analyses reported consist of the subset of the reliable data after dropping conflicting signals. In one note they say that &lt;1% of mice are read as far apart enough that they missed two antennas in a row, however this under-reports the frequency of error. There can be error with no discrepancy in the order of signals detected if, and mice can be missed while moving between adjacent chambers or staying for a long period of time in a single chamber where their entry and exit were both misread. A second method of scoring would put time values to this error (amount or% of time misclassified) as opposed to just frequency of signals being dropped from analysis."

If this is supported (i.e. provided the pair-wise social behavior data in the manuscript were generated by the analysis package), the authors should discuss this potential. For example, a sub-group of cohoused mice could be treated and a subgroup could be untreated, and differences could be assessed within a single testing session. The heat maps of mouse pair interactions could be used to identify more and less social individual mice which could be useful for comparisons to other measures (for example individual differences in specific genes, neural markers, etc.). And presuming other small rodents like prairie or meadow voles could be tested in such an apparatus, stable affiliations could be examined between mates or same-sex peers.

Mouse sociability is assessed within the housing environment, that is, an arrangement of housing boxes connected by corridor tubes. Mice are tracked and localized using RFID technology. The data collected are used to estimate the amount of time each mouse spend within each box, with or without her conspecifics, and also to measure their interest for social odor cues in comparison with non-social odor cues. The authors challenged their system by testing several mouse models of autism. This new system should allow researchers to detect similar social impairments in different mouse models as the classic 3-chambered test. For example, mouse social interest could be analyzed in low-stress conditions. This could also spare time and avoid many confounding factors (such as experimenter biases, housing conditions, habituation to the test apparatus) and while this concept is of high interest for the community (replication is indeed a major issue in the field), I have several comments on this current version of the Eco-HAB."

The social interaction is described as the time spent in which box with whom. This is disappointing given the high potential of the method to generate more precise data (e.g., sub-group formation: is it possible to quantify the number of individuals in the subgroup and how stable in time the subgroups are?). In addition, the supposition that a mouse spends time with another one when they are located in the same case is not clearly shown. The correction of the time spent with another mouse (by subtracting the supposed spontaneous (non-social) exploration to the time spent in the compartment) is not convincing. It would need further analyses and a validation. Indeed, on a few video samples, it might be possible to compare the manual scoring of time spent with another mouse to the amount of time calculated through the method presented. This would allow the authors to check the accuracy of the calculation. The non-social stimuli used in Eco-HAB might also be more elaborated. For instance, the authors use bedding with sent vs. fresh bedding as a test for social vs. non-social stimuli. To align with the 3-chambered test paradigm, for the non-social condition, the authors could use bedding + non-social odor such as lemon or bedding + inanimate object."

But the gist of the concern is: how does the reader know that the two mice are \"spending time together\" when they both occupy the same box? I think this questions whether two mice in one box could be at opposite ends and facing away from each other and yet be counted as socially affiliating. Clearly a formal possibility.

However, I see no comparison now between the number of fights or stress levels in the present setup vs. Weissbrod 2013. The reader is left to assume that, because the setup is inspired in ethologically relevant behavior, it must obviously be true that there is less aggression. In the most beautiful scenario, we would have the wild, open arena and present setup measurements of aggressive encounters. In the next level at least a comparison between open arenas and this set-up. But, to avoid doing new experiments, I think the minimum would be to re-analize the data to measure aggression. Video data was acquired, so it should most probably be possible to analyze this data for aggression encounters."

The data collected are used to estimate the amount of time each mouse spend within each box, with or without her conspecifics, and also to measure their interest for social odor cues in comparison with non-social odor cues. The authors challenged their system by testing several mouse models of autism. This new system should allow researchers to detect similar social impairments in different mouse models as the classic 3-chambered test. For example, mouse social interest could be analyzed in low-stress conditions. This could also spare time and avoid many confounding factors (such as experimenter biases, housing conditions, habituation to the test apparatus) and while this concept is of high interest for the community (replication is indeed a major issue in the field), I have several comments on this current version of the Eco-HAB.</i> "

The system of coils (subsection \u201cEco-HAB - applied electronic solutions\u201d) can recognize subjects with high sensitivity, far exceeding that obtained with standard video- and RFID-recognition methods. These RFID coils have sufficient sensitivity to register even mice moving at high speed. This is all possible because of the internal 4 MHz crystal oscillator synchronization.

The RFID antennas run independently and do not disrupt each other\u2019s workings, regardless of signal\u2019s amplitude. Moreover, all coils may be active simultaneously and register signals for practically unlimited time. Since the system is designed to be highly sensitive in order not to miss animals\u2019 signals when they are running, it is expected that it would generate superfluous readouts (e.g. when animal is sitting under antenna).

However, I see no comparison now between the number of fights or stress levels in the present setup vs. Weissbrod 2013. The reader is left to assume that, because the setup is inspired in ethologically relevant behavior, it must obviously be true that there is less aggression. In the most beautiful scenario, we would have the wild, open arena and present setup measurements of aggressive encounters. In the next level at least a comparison between open arenas and this set-up. But, to avoid doing new experiments, I think the minimum would be to re-analize the data to measure aggression. Video data was acquired, so it should most probably be possible to analyze this data for aggression encounters.</i> "

We assessed aggression encounters during first 6 hour period of the dark phase at the beginning of the adaptation period, the time when animals are most active, intensively exploring new environment and when potential aggressive behaviors were most probable, due to yet unstable social relations on novel territory (description added in Materials and methods section, see subsection \u201cMeasurement of aggressive encounters in Eco-HAB\u201d)."
