In the presence of the disaggregating drug these proteins transit the secretory pathway. When the drug is removed these proteins form electron-dense plaques which we term staples. Unexpectedly, when initially positioned within the cis-Golgi, staples remained at the cis face of the Golgi even after many hours. By contrast, soluble FM-aggregates transited the Golgi. Staples and soluble aggregates placed in cis-Golgi cisternae therefore have different fates. Whereas the membrane staples are located in the flattened, stacked central regions of the cisternae, the soluble aggregates are in the dilated rims. This suggests that while the cisternae are static on the time scale of protein traffic, the dilated rims are mobile and progress in the cis \u2192 trans direction via a mechanism that we term \u2018Rim Progression\u2019."

The greatest distinction among the competing models for anterograde transport (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib26\">Rothman, 2010</a>) is whether the 4\u20136 cisternae typically comprising the Golgi stack are proposed to be static or mobile over the time scale of protein flow across the Golgi (typically 5\u201320 min)."

In order to allow the Golgi stack to retain its resident proteins (such as glycosyltransferases) in the face of continuous cisternal turnover, mobile/cisternal progression models also require concomitant retrograde transport (trans \u2192 cis or Golgi \u2192 ER, or both) of steady-state Golgi resident enzymes, termed \u2018cisternal maturation\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Glick and Luini, 2011</a>)."

On this basis it has been widely accepted by deductive reasoning, as distinct from direct visualization, that whole cisternae must indeed progress across the stack. This of course does not rule out that parallel processes of COPI vesicular transport (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</a>) and/or tubule-based transport (<a href=\"#bib28\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>) could also occur."

For this purpose, we designed reversible membrane \u2018staples\u2019 loosely modeled on the adhesion protein cadherin, which can adhere cells homo-typically. Cadherins consist of tandem repeats of an adhesive unit that binds itself preferentially in trans (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pokutta and Weis, 2007</a>). A similar unit, which additionally is controllable with soluble ligands that can enter cells, is the FKBP mutant termed FM, which according to its crystal packing also interacts in trans (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rollins et al., 2000</a>), with the additional feature that this interaction is disrupted by ligands such as AP21998 even in living cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rivera et al., 2000</a>). This suggests that tandem membrane-anchored repeats of FM domains should mimic cadherin in producing a defined structure (staple) that will reversibly adhere intracellular membranes when it faces the cytoplasm, or in the present application produce intra-lumenal adhesions within Golgi cisternae when the FM repeats are lumenally-oriented. To our surprise, we found that luminal staples and compositionally analogous soluble aggregates placed in cis-Golgi cisternae had entirely different fates. Whereas the soluble aggregates were rapidly transported, the membrane staples remained in place."

This CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> protein should initially reside in the ER oriented with its FM4-containing aggregation domain facing the lumen, and so long as it remains non-aggregated (in the presence of AP21998) should be effectively transported to the cell surface. On the other hand, if AP21998 is removed while in the ER\u2014or at any later stage of transport through the Golgi\u2014then intra-lumenal adhesions are expected to form as CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> aggregates homo-typically in trans, like a cadherin. These staples are expected to remain in the ER if they are planar and too large to be packaged into a small COPII vesicle. Various structural models suggest a planar adhesion plaque will form that closely links two sides of ER lamellae or tubules, with an intra-lumenal separation between the stapled membranes that from first principles could vary from 10 to 23 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), depending on the preferred arrangement of trans-aggregating FM4 domains. In particular, however, if repeat FM domains interact like cadherins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Miyaguchi, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Pokutta and Weis, 2007</a>) primarily via their most-membrane distant module (i.e., at their tips), then we would expect a membrane separation in the stapled state close to 25 nm (model 1 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

When tested by SDS-PAGE, the disaggregating drug increased Triton-X100 solubility (without sonication procedure) of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> in cell extracts by a factor 3.9 \u00b1 0.9 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Note that this relatively modest response of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> to the disaggregating-drug (44% Triton X100-solubility after 4 hr treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) can be attributed to the transient transfection procedure. A large portion of the transfected cells showed a very high level of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> over-expression, and did not respond well to the disaggregating drug. As a consequence CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>, remained aggregated in the ER even during drug treatment. This also explains the apparent moderate efficiency of transport of disaggregated-CD8 when measured by bulk assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Disaggregated CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>, expected to be O-glycosylated (<a href=\"#bib15\">Nilsson et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Lavieu et al., 2010</a>), appeared as an isoform with reduced SDS-PAGE motility (* <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). As expected, Jacalin, a lectin that binds D-Galactose residues, exclusively precipitates this isoform (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In addition, metabolic radiolabeling experiments showed that staples (\u223c5.5 hr half-life) were slightly more stable that disaggregated CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> (\u223c2.5 hr half-life) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Such stability is enough to guarantee the presence of the staples during numerous complete rounds of anterograde transport either from ER to Golgi or across the entire Golgi (around 20 rounds if we assume that one round of transport takes 15 min). Note that staples persist in the ER and in the Golgi (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) for the same time period (5\u20136 hr) before degradation by a cellular machinery that is not yet known."

Golgi retention of the staples is due to controlled aggregation, because this block to transport was removed when the drug was added back, and CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> (disaggregated) now moves from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, lane 3).

We therefore wanted to see if staples deposited in later Golgi cisternae might also be static. To deposit staples throughout the Golgi stack we allowed CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> to enter the Golgi at 20\u00b0C in the presence of drug to maintain it in the disaggregated state. Then, the drug was removed at 20\u00b0C.

To test this, we introduced a well-studied anterograde cargo into cells harboring staples, the VSV-encoded G protein. Specifically, we used a GFP-tagged version of a temperature-sensitive mutant G protein that is retained in the ER at 39\u00b0C, but which can exit the ER and be transported to the cell surface via the Golgi when the temperature is subsequently lowered to 32\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib20\">Presley et al., 1997</a>). In these experiments, the staples were labeled with DsRed (DsRed-CD8<sub>luminal</sub>) and co-expressed with GFP-tagged VSV-G. We estimated by confocal microscopy that &gt;95% of the cells were co-transfected. We used the 39\u00b0C temperature block to retain VSV-G-GFP in the ER, then a fraction of both VSV-G-GFP and disaggregated DsRed-CD8<sub>luminal</sub> (+drug) were partially released into the Golgi at 16\u00b0C, prior to re-aggregating CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> (\u2212drug) at 16\u00b0C into cis-Golgi staples. Only then was the temperature raised to 32\u00b0C for 2 hr to test the transport of VSV-G-GFP (the fraction localized into the stapled cis-Golgi and the fraction that was still into the ER). Surface biotinylation showed that the amount of VSV-G detected at the surface of cells that harbored staples in their Golgi was 91 \u00b1 12% of the amount of VSV-G detected at the surface of cells harboring a normal Golgi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This showed that the stapling procedure did not interfere dramatically with the transport of classical anterograde cargo."

The rate of the release (half-time \u223c 5 min) of PA-GFP-VSV-G from even long-term (4 hr) stapled Golgi was indistinguishable from that measured from a non-stapled Golgi identified with a red-tagged Golgi marker (ST-RFP) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

We used Saos-2 cells, which secrete endogenously produced collagen-I. After transfection with GFP-CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>, Saos-2 cells were incubated at 20\u00b0C in the presence of the disaggregating drug, followed by drug removal to allow the positioning of the staples within the Golgi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> upper panel, lane 1,2 show the glycosylated form of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>). 2 hr after stapling the Golgi membranes, the culture media was removed and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of fresh media containing ascorbate to release collagen-I from the ER. After a 2 hr chase the amount of newly secreted collagen-I was determined by TCA precipitation/immunobloting procedure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Cells harboring stapled-Golgi for 2 hr showed 92.5 \u00b1 13% of freshly secreted collagen-I when compared to cells harboring normal Golgi (set to 100%). This suggests that, as reported above with for VSV-G, anterograde transport of Collagen-I is not altered when staples are positioned within the Golgi. To rigorously assess if Golgi staples had only minor effect on secretion, we further tested the rate of transport of collagen-I and MMP2, two proteins secreted by Saos-2 cells. The kinetics of secretion for both proteins did not show any robust differences whether the Golgi apparatus was stapled or not (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Again, this suggests that the amount of staples that is loaded in the Golgi membranes during the re-aggregation procedure does not poison the anterograde transport function of the Golgi."

This would explain in a satisfying manner why the essential functions of the Golgi (and ER) such as transport and glycosylation are not perturbed by the presence of the staples, since these behave like any cargo or resident protein within the membrane, as further evidenced by the re-distribution of staples (like any other Golgi cargo or resident enzyme) to the ER as a result of BFA treatment."

We noted that these soluble aggregates were concentrated at the rims of the Golgi cisternae, analogous to collagens.

On the one hand, because staples freely diffuse like any other membrane constituent it is hard to imagine how a moderate amount of staples would broadly perturb Golgi transport or function such as glycosylation, and there is no positive evidence from our studies that they do so. On the other hand, because they span and link between two sides of the cisterna, it is easy to see why staples should remain in the thin centers of the cisternae, far from the dilated rims (whose width is too great to accommodate the staples) where transport vesicles bud, and also why staples would be sterically excluded from budding COPI or other vesicles if they did occasionally reach a rim, and thus would remain within the cisterna."

But in retrospect a stricter interpretation of that data would have been to conclude that the \u2018at least some portions\u2019 of the cisterna containing the collagen aggregates (i.e., the rims) are mobile, without reaching any conclusion with respect to the rest of the cisterna. A striking feature of the collagen data is that while the majority of the aggregates are indeed rapidly transported, a sizable minority (\u223c20% [<a href=\"#bib2\">Bonfanti et al., 1998</a>]) remains in the Golgi cisternae, mainly in the centers of the cisternae, consistent with our results and interpretation."

We would imagine that after fission a transiently separated rim would nonetheless remain in register in the stack because its membrane would still be engaged in stacking/tethering interactions. Pulse-chase experiments (<a href=\"#bib30\">Volchuk et al., 2000</a>) showed the appearance of detached rims closely-associated with the edges of the stack that transiently appeared during the transport of soluble aggregates (which we termed mega-vesicles at the time).

We do not wish to conclude that cisternal maturation does not occur in the stacked Golgi of complex plants and animals, or that it may not be important in re-assembly of the Golgi after cell division, only that it does not appear to be required on the time scale of biosynthetic protein transport in interphase in stacked Golgi."

Grids were rinsed and placed on protein A gold (PAG) 10 nm (UtrechtUMC) for 30 min. Double labeled grids were incubated with mouse anti-GFP antibody with 5 nm PAG and then the rabbit anti-Clathrin with 10 nm PAG, or rabbit anti-GFP with 10nmPAG and mouse anti-Gm130 with 5 nm PAG. All grids were rinsed in PBS, fixed using 1% gluteraldehyde, then rinsed and transferred to a UA/methylcellulose drop for 10 min. Samples were all viewed on FEI Tencai Biotwin TEM at 80Kv. Images were taken using Morada CCD and iTEM (Olympus) software."

The amount of plasmid used for the soluble protein was constant, whereas the amount of plasmid for the membrane protein was increased by a factor 3. Intensity of membrane protein expressed alone was set to 1. Using this method we showed that using a 1:1 TMD:Sol plasmid ratio increases the signal by a factor 1.9 (in theory a 2 fold increase is expected). When the TMD:Sol plasmid ratio is 3:1, the signal increased by a factor 2.8, suggesting a 1.8:1 TMD:Sol protein ratio. This \u22452 protein ratio is now reported in the revised manuscript."
