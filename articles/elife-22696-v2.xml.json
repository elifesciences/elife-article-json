During translocation, proteins, threaded through the channel in the inner membrane, are handed over to the import motor at the matrix face. Tim17 is an essential, membrane-embedded subunit of the translocase; however, its function is only poorly understood. Here, we functionally dissected its four predicted transmembrane (TM) segments. Mutations in TM1 and TM2 impaired the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, component of the translocation channel, whereas mutations in TM3 compromised binding of the import motor. We identified residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor. Our results reveal functionally distinct roles of different regions of Tim17 and suggest how they may be involved in handing over the proteins, during their translocation into mitochondria, from the channel to the import motor of the presequence translocase."

During translocation, proteins, threaded through the channel in the inner membrane, are handed over to the import motor at the matrix face. Tim17 is an essential, membrane-embedded subunit of the translocase; however, its function is only poorly understood. Here, we functionally dissected its four predicted transmembrane (TM) segments. Mutations in TM1 and TM2 impaired the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, component of the translocation channel, whereas mutations in TM3 compromised binding of the import motor. We identified residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor. Our results reveal functionally distinct roles of different regions of Tim17 and suggest how they may be involved in handing over the proteins, during their translocation into mitochondria, from the channel to the import motor of the presequence translocase."

More than half of them carry N-terminal presequences and use the TOM and the TIM23 complexes for their translocation across the outer and inner membranes, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bohnert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Endo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Marom et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schulz et al., 2015</a>). Intermembrane space (IMS)-exposed domains of Tim50 and Tim23 serve as receptors of the TIM23 complex that recognize proteins as soon as they appear at the outlet of the TOM complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Marom et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mokranjac et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schulz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tamura et al., 2009</a>). In a membrane potential-dependent step, proteins are then transferred to the translocation channel in the inner membrane formed by membrane-embedded segments of Tim23 and possibly also Tim17 and/or Mgr2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alder et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dekker et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ieva et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Truscott et al., 2001</a>). Complete translocation into the matrix is mediated by the import motor of the TIM23 complex, also referred to as PAM (presequence translocase-associated motor). mtHsp70 is the central component of the import motor. Its ATP-dependent action, regulated by the J and J-like proteins Tim14/Pam18 and Tim16/Pam16 and the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1, drives translocation of proteins across the inner membrane (<a href=\"#bib8\">D'Silva et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Frazier et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kang et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Liu et a., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mokranjac et al., 2003</a>). Tim44 is a peripheral membrane protein that acts as an anchor to recruit the import motor to the translocation channel (<a href=\"#bib7\">D'Silva et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kozany et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schulz and Rehling, 2014</a>). Through its N-terminal domain, Tim44 binds to the components of the import motor, whereas its C-terminal domain binds to Tim17 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banerjee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Schiller et al., 2008</a>)."

Both proteins are predicted to span the inner membrane with four transmembrane (TM) helices. The TMs of Tim17 and Tim23 share limited sequence similarity; however, the two proteins cannot substitute for each other (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ryan et al., 1994</a>). The first two TMs of Tim23 constitute at least part of the translocation channel of the TIM23 complex, and they actively respond to changes in the membrane potential across inner membrane (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alder et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alder et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Malhotra et al., 2013</a>). Mutations of the same segments impair the interaction of Tim23 with Tim17 and thus destabilize the entire TIM23 complex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Demishtein-Zohary et al., 2015</a>). TM3 and TM4 of Tim23 appear to have a\u00a0stabilizing role in the complex as their deletion is not lethal (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pareek et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, essentially nothing is known about the TMs of Tim17."

To this end, wild-type cells and cells carrying <i>ts</i> forms of Tim17 were grown under permissive conditions, mitochondria were isolated, solubilized in digitonin-containing buffer and analyzed by Blue Native (BN)-PAGE. In wt mitochondria, as expected, a dominant ca. 90 kDa complex, consisting of Tim17 and Tim23, was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chacinska et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dekker et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Popov-Celeketi\u0107 et al., 2008</a>).

SDS-PAGE analysis of the same samples (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, lower panel) shows that the levels of Tim17 and several other essential TIM23 subunits are indistinguishable among different mitochondria, demonstrating that the absence of Tim17-containing complexes is not due to instability of the protein but rather due to the involvement of TMs 1 and 2 of Tim17, directly or indirectly, in the interaction with Tim23. This resembles the previous finding that TMs 1 and 2 of Tim23 are important for the interaction with Tim17 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alder et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Demishtein-Zohary et al., 2015</a>).

Similar amounts of Tim23 were bound to the Ni-agarose beads when the two TM3 mutant mitochondria were analyzed, confirming the results obtained by BN-PAGE described above.

Although it is likely that during translocation of proteins into mitochondria Tim44 may reach deep into the membrane (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kanamori et al., 1997</a>), it is generally accepted that the major part of Tim44 is exposed to the matrix, suggesting that its binding site should be found in more matrix-facing regions of Tim17. A binding site of Tim44 has not been found in the matrix-exposed loop between TMs 1 and 2 of Tim17 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ting et al., 2014</a>). Since our mutant analysis suggests an involvement of TM3 in the interaction with Tim44, we examined the predicted loop between TMs 3 and 4 for a potential Tim44 binding site. To this end, we first screened positions 104 to 113 by mutating the first and the second five residues in a row to alanines. The mutant of the first half of the loop resulted in a lethal phenotype, whereas the second mutant was viable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This result suggests that the residues potentially involved in Tim44 binding are found in the region 104\u2013108. Close inspection of this region revealed a highly conserved arginine residue at position 105 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We replaced this arginine with an alanine residue. The R105A mutant was viable but displayed a severely reduced and temperature-sensitive growth even on fermentable carbon source and was barely viable on non-fermentable carbon source (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Submitochondrial localization of the Tim17R105A mutant was indistinguishable from wt (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting that impaired biogenesis and an altered topology of Tim17 were not the reasons behind the severe growth phenotype. Impaired growth was likely due to the impaired protein import via the TIM23 pathway (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Precursor proteins translocated into the matrix or laterally inserted into the inner membrane by the TIM23 complex were imported with reduced efficiencies into mitochondria isolated from <i>tim17R105A</i> cells. Import of a TIM23-independent substrate occurred with an efficiency indistinguishable from wt. A mutant in which arginine was exchanged to lysine, thus keeping a positive charge at this position, showed a very similar growth phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), suggesting that, intriguingly, the charge itself is not sufficient for function."

In wt, Tim44 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Tim17, Tim23 and Tim16, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kozany et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Popov-Celeketi\u0107 et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, in the R105A mutant, the interaction of Tim44 with the TIM23 complex was severely compromised (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, the interaction between Tim17 and Tim23 in the R105A mutant was indistinguishable from that in wt, in agreement with the results of the analysis of GxxxG motifs described above. Lack of Tim44 recruitment also led to an almost complete dissociation of Tim14-Tim16 pair from the Tim17-Tim23 core, supporting the previous finding that Tim44 is the major component that connects the Tim17-Tim23 with the Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kozany et al., 2004</a>). Lack of coprecipitation of Tim44 with Tim23 antibodies from lysates of the R105A mutant mitochondria further supports the notion that Tim17 is the major component for recruitment of Tim44 to the Tim17-Tim23 core (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banerjee et al., 2015</a>). Essentially the same observations were made when Tim17R105K mutant mitochondria were analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), again suggesting that it is not the positive charge per se that is functionally and/or structurally important."

To this end, we introduced an unnatural amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine (BPA) in vivo in several positions along this region using an orthogonal suppressor tRNA and a cognate amino acyl tRNA synthetase pair (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shiota et al., 2015</a>). Upon activation with UV light, BPA crosslinks to any C-H bond in the vicinity and the obtained size shift can be detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. When BPA was introduced at position 106 of Tim17, an additional band was observed upon immunoblotting with Tim44 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This band was present only in UV-treated cells demonstrating the specificity of the crosslink. To unambiguously confirm that this band represents a crosslink between Tim17 and Tim44, cells containing a His-tagged version of Tim17(106BPA) were UV irradiated, solubilized in SDS-containing buffer to break all noncovalent interactions and incubated with Ni-agarose beads (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The crosslinked species was efficiently recovered in the bound fraction, in contrast to the non-crosslinked Tim44. Since this band was recognized by Tim44 antibodies and it bound to Ni-agarose beads, we conclude that it represents a crosslink between Tim17 and Tim44. In the end, we made a version of Tim17 containing both the R105A mutation and BPA introduced at position 106. In this mutant, no crosslink between Tim17 and Tim44 was observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), providing further support for the involvement of R105 in Tim44 binding."

This notion is further supported by the observation that in Tim17, unlike in Tim23 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pareek et al., 2013</a>), TMs 1 and 2 are not sufficient to support the function of the full length protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Our data support a model in which TMs 1 and 2 are involved, directly or indirectly, in the interaction with Tim23 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Previously, TMs 1 and 2 of Tim23 were similarly implicated in the interaction with Tim17 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Demishtein-Zohary et al., 2015</a>). Although the exact arrangement of the TMs remains currently unknown, the available data suggest that the first two TMs in the members of this protein family are involved in formation of higher order structures. A recently identified disulfide bond in Tim17 appears to play a role in this process (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mokranjac, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ramesh et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wrobel et al., 2016</a>). Whether the first two TMs of Tim17 are directly involved in channel formation, as shown for Tim23, awaits future experiments. In addition, we found that the second half of Tim17, and in particular a strictly conserved arginine residue at the matrix-facing side of IM, play an essential role in recruitment of Tim44 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, Tim17 may bridge the translocation channel and the import motor of the TIM23 complex suggesting how the translocating proteins are guided between the two."

The cleared extracts were added to 25 \u03bcl Ni-agarose beads, prewashed and equilibrated with solubilization buffer containing 0.05% digitonin. Samples were incubated on an overhead shaker at 4\u00b0C for 45 min. Unbound material was collected and, after three washing steps, specifically bound material was eluted with Laemmli buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting."

In the present study, the authors performed mutagenesis of the conserved GxxxG motifs in TM1-4 in Tim17, and found that TM1 and TM2 are important for interactions with Tim23, and R105 in the matrix-facing loop between TM3 and TM4 plays a role in recruiting Tim44 to the TIM23 complex. The experiments were carefully and logically performed, and the obtained results are important for further understanding of the structure-function relationship of the TIM23 complex.

We agree with the reviewers that in vitro import experiments into isolated mitochondria may provide important functional insight into differential sorting of proteins and we followed the suggestion to perform these experiments. We did in vitro imports of one matrix targeted preprotein and two laterally sorted preproteins, one that is motor-dependent and one that is motor-independent. In addition, we imported a TIM23-independent preprotein as a control to exclude general defects of mitochondria. To obtain a complete picture, we used isolated mitochondria of all six identified <i>ts</i> mutants in TM1-3 as well as <i>tim17R105A</i> and performed in vitro imports into mitochondria that were preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C prior to import reaction or were left untreated. Overall, the in vitro import experiments recapitulated the import defects observed in vivo \u2013 the reduction of the in vitro import efficiency correlated with the severity of the growth phenotype. Matrix translocation was generally more affected than motor-independent insertion but we observed no obvious difference among the mutants in respect to differential sorting. Importantly, a TIM23-independent precursor protein was imported in all mitochondria with essentially the same efficiency. Import defects via the TIM23 pathway were visible, irrespective of whether mitochondria were exposed to heat shock or not but the exposure to heat shock made them more obvious. We therefore felt that presenting only the data obtained upon pretreatment would be sufficient, however, we can include the other results as well, depending on your decision. in vitro imports into isolated mitochondria from <i>ts</i> mutants in TM1-3 are presented in the newly added <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and the imports into <i>tim17R105A</i> are added to <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.
