How the numerous growth control pathways are coordinated by the ethylene transcriptional response remains elusive. We characterized the dynamic ethylene transcriptional response by identifying targets of the master regulator of the ethylene signaling pathway, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and transcript sequencing during a timecourse of ethylene treatment. Ethylene-induced transcription occurs in temporal waves regulated by EIN3, suggesting distinct layers of transcriptional control. EIN3 binding was found to modulate a multitude of downstream transcriptional cascades, including a major feedback regulatory circuitry of the ethylene signaling pathway, as well as integrating numerous connections between most of the hormone mediated growth response pathways. These findings provide direct evidence linking each of the major plant growth and development networks in novel ways."

How the numerous growth control pathways are coordinated by the ethylene transcriptional response remains elusive. We characterized the dynamic ethylene transcriptional response by identifying targets of the master regulator of the ethylene signaling pathway, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and transcript sequencing during a timecourse of ethylene treatment. Ethylene-induced transcription occurs in temporal waves regulated by EIN3, suggesting distinct layers of transcriptional control. EIN3 binding was found to modulate a multitude of downstream transcriptional cascades, including a major feedback regulatory circuitry of the ethylene signaling pathway, as well as integrating numerous connections between most of the hormone mediated growth response pathways. These findings provide direct evidence linking each of the major plant growth and development networks in novel ways."

To identify the targets of EIN3, Chang et al. exposed plants to ethylene and then used a technique called ChIP-Seq to identify those regions of the DNA that EIN3 binds to. At the same time, they used genome-wide mRNA sequencing to determine which genes showed altered transcription."

The dynamic ethylene physiological response, a rapid growth inhibition independent of the master transcriptional regulator ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), followed by an EIN3-dependent sustained growth inhibition, calls for a temporal study of ethylene transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Binder et al., 2004a</a>). EIN3 has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the ethylene response and accumulates upon a duration of exogenous ethylene gas treatment (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guo and Ecker, 2003</a>). Although hundreds of ethylene response genes have been identified, because some of the targets of EIN3 are transcription factors (<i>e.g. ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1</i> [<i>ERF1</i>]), it is challenging to distinguish immediate early targets from those further downstream. To understand the dynamics of the EIN3-mediated ethylene transcriptional response, we performed a genome-wide study of the ethylene-induced EIN3 protein-DNA interactions using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and simultaneously determined the repertoire of target genes that are transcriptionally regulated by ethylene (mRNA-Seq). Tracing the transcriptional cascade, we asked if EIN3-mediated genes contribute to a component of the ethylene transcriptional response. For a select number of EIN3 targets that are putative transcriptional regulators, DNA-binding motifs were identified using protein binding microarrays (PBM) and the enrichment for these motifs in the promoters of ethylene response genes was determined."

By stringent analysis of the temporal ChIP-Seq data (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we identified 1460 EIN3 binding regions in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome associated with 1314 genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). We refer to genes associated with EIN3 binding regions as EIN3 candidate targets.

Interestingly, many EIN3-R are transcription factors (\u223c14%); EIN3 candidate targets are significantly enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms related to transcription factor regulation, confirming that EIN3 activates a transcriptional cascade (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Maere, 2005</a>)."

EIN3 candidate targets that are not transcriptionally activated may require cofactors to induce a change in expression for a specific environmental response or developmental program. Quantitatively, the changes in EIN3 binding and steady-state transcription upon ethylene treatment do not correlate because the temporal transcription patterns are very diverse (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, relatively high levels of EIN3 occupancy in etiolated seedlings treated with ethylene indeed correspond to increases in steady-state levels of transcription (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In fact, we were able to differentiate the characteristics of EIN3 candidate targets that exhibited a transcriptional response to ethylene from those that do not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). EIN3 candidate targets that exhibit increased occupancy and increased levels of transcription (EIN3-R) are functional targets, enriched in gene families with specific functions, for example BZR, TIFY, and bHLH transcription factor families, which play a role in other hormone pathways (p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The highest percentage of hormone-associated genes occurs in EIN3 candidate targets that are ethylene-regulated (EIN3-R) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, inset), and it is likely that these EIN3-R targets are direct and/or functional.

These waves display distinct temporal transcription behaviors (Hypergeometric p&lt;0.001), and the reduction of transcriptional noise occurs in successive temporal waves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Genes that were enriched in specific biological functions within these four transcriptional waves include RNA binding/translation (Wave 1, Wave 3), cell wall maintenance (Wave 2), and response to endogenous stimulus (Wave 4). The second wave is also enriched for genes involved in cell wall maintenance, and the expression of these genes steadily increases following 1 hr of ethylene treatment, consistent with kinetics of EIN3-dependent growth inhibition (<a href=\"#bib10\">Binder et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Vandenbussche et al., 2012</a>)."

The first wave is highly variable, lower in steady-state levels of transcription, and it also contains the lowest percentage of EIN3 candidate targets and hormone-related genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Previous ethylene growth rate inhibition studies have shown that low amounts of ethylene can result in adaptation and desensitization to subsequent ethylene stimulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Binder et al., 2004a</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2004b</a>) . This first wave may serve as the immediate ethylene response, activating initial ethylene response genes as well as those that serve to desensitize the plant to subsequent ethylene stimulation, but this has yet to be shown. The next three waves of transcription are successively less variable and contain higher percentages of EIN3 candidate targets and hormone-related genes. The four waves of ethylene-induced transcription account for 50% of the transcriptionally ethylene-regulated EIN3 targets (EIN3-R), and the remaining EIN3 candidate targets are distributed among other patterns of transcription that do not contain significant numbers of EIN3 candidate targets in each transcriptional trajectory (Pathway hypergeometric p&lt;10<sup>\u221210</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The expression kinetics and reduction of transcriptional noise we observe in the ethylene-induced waves may be tied to distinct mechanisms of transcriptional control, or they may reflect heterogeneity of the ethylene response in different tissues, which can be resolved using single cell analysis. From the temporal ethylene transcriptional response patterns, it appears that the initial early ethylene transcriptional response is noisy and less focused functionally. During sustained exogenous ethylene application, EIN3 accumulates, and the established ethylene transcriptional response is hormone-focused and less noisy, but feed-forward and feed-back mechanisms mentioned below may serve to establish this functional specificity."

Analysis of the ethylene-regulated EIN3 targets reveals a number of sites of ethylene signaling modulation of which the majority are negative regulators, supporting the idea that EIN3 is at the end of a signal transduction pathway, and that this regulatory logic dictates a negative feedback loop for homeostatic adaptable systems. More specifically, several negative regulators of the ethylene signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kendrick and Chang, 2008</a>) were targets of EIN3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), including three ethylene receptors (ETHYLENE RESPONSE2 [ETR2], ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1/2 [ERS1/2]), as well as REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY1 (RTE1), CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), and the previously mentioned EBF1/2. The induction of ETR2, ERS1/2 by ethylene was previously reported and has been suggested to restore ethylene receptor activity, resensitizing the plant to ethylene (<a href=\"#bib11\">Binder et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Vandenbussche et al., 2012</a>).

Many detailed examples of hormone co-regulation exist in the literature, but often the mechanism(s) of co-regulation is unknown. Previous ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq studies from plants have also revealed cross-regulation within pathways involved in flowering and in roots (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yant et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Iyer-Pascuzzi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Winter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Immink et al., 2012</a>) .

Transcription factor targeting of genes that are homologous, with overlapping and unique functions, can add diversity to the outputs of transcriptional programs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Macquarrie et al., 2011</a>). One of the most striking and surprising example we found was the direct regulation of the three homologs by EIN3, <i>HOOKLESS1</i> (<i>HLS1</i>) and <i>HLS1-LIKE HOMOLOG2</i> (<i>HLH2</i>), and to a lesser extent <i>HLH1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <i>HLH1</i> in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To understand this hormone co-regulation, we generated quadruple mutants for the <i>HLS1</i> gene family and also further characterized their role as regulatory hub signal integrators (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The pleiotropic phenotypes we observed support the role of the <i>HLS1</i> gene family in auxin regulated plant growth and development (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>). We observed severe defects in the embryonic patterning, etiolated seedlings, adult plant morphology, and floral morphology. The adult quadruple mutants display a dwarf phenotype, similar to the auxin mutant <i>axr1</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Leyser et al., 1993</a>), and floral morphology of the quadruple mutants display two stigmas atop a gynoecium, similar to the <i>arf3/ettin</i> mutant floral phenotype (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sessions and Zambryski, 1995</a>). Although <i>HLS1</i> is known to be involved in the differential growth of the apical hook and is necessary for the accumulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2 (ARF2) DNA-binding protein (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ohto et al., 2006</a>), the biochemical function of these putative N-acetyltransferases remains to be determined. Using a genome-wide approach, we found that not only HLS1, but other gene family members are targets of EIN3 and that the requirement of the HLS proteins for hormone responses extends beyond apical hook development to many other processes from embryo patterning to flowering, linking the regulation of growth and development by ethylene to many new biological processes in novel ways."

Temporal protein\u2013DNA interactions are often difficult to reconcile with gene expression profiles and the complexity of regulation that occurs transcriptionally is very challenging to characterize and interpret biologically. Here, by jointly analyzing the temporal expression and genome-wide binding data of one key transcription factor in response to hormone stimulus, we were able to reveal several important properties of the hormone responsive transcriptional program and identify new components in the signaling pathway. We found that upon a timecourse of ethylene treatment, EIN3 binding was induced, resulting in various transcriptional patterns and that the ethylene transcriptional response occurred in waves of transcription that were temporally distinct and could be attributed to different biological functions, variable in the amount of noise, and significantly regulated by EIN3. EIN3 modulated genes were over-represented in hormone co-regulation, and the specific targets in the other hormone pathways, as reported in this study, suggest these \u2018cross-talk\u2019 events may involve multiple levels of regulation. Interestingly, feedback regulation of the ethylene response by EIN3 enabled the identification of the majority of known ethylene signaling pathway components. Moreover, the temporal resolution of steady-state levels of transcription confirmed the role of these genes in the ethylene transcriptional response. Other signaling networks utilize feedback regulation for overall system control/homeostasis, and this type of study may be used to identify novel components in signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rosenfeld et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amit et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tsang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Feng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yosef and Regev, 2011</a>)."

The role of EIN3 in the coordination of the initiation of the ethylene transcriptional cascade, the negative feedback regulation of the ethylene signaling pathway, and the orchestration of other hormone pathways suggests that adaptable system homeostasis in plants requires robust hormone co-regulation."

Although the majority of EIN3 candidate targets were up-regulated by ethylene, consistent with the previously determined role of EIN3 as an activator, a subset of EIN3 candidate targets was repressed upon ethylene treatment; one instance of EIN3 as a repressor has been previously reported (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2009</a>). The correlation of EIN3 binding and ethylene-regulated transcription was calculated at from 4 hr of ethylene treatment (0 hr ethylene as a control), for all EIN3 and EIN3-R (ethylene-induced) targets. The R<sup>2</sup> values were much less than 0.50, suggesting a lack of correlation of EIN3 binding levels and ethylene-regulated steady-state transcription."

The ethylene transcriptional response was further analyzed in context of the dynamic EIN3 binding data. To reconstruct the dynamic regulatory networks that were activated following ethylene treatment, we used the Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ernst et al., 2007</a>). DREM integrates time-series gene expression data with static transcription factor (TF)\u2014gene interaction data to reconstruct these dynamic networks. DREM searches for bifurcation events; places in the time series data where the expression of one set of genes diverges from the expression of another set, and annotates these events with the TFs that can explain them. This allows us to assign a time of activation to static TF-gene interactions data. To obtain the static interaction data we extracted 11,355 TF-gene interactions from the AtRegNet AGRIS database (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yilmaz et al., 2010</a>). In addition, for this work we have extended DREM so that it can utilize temporal EIN3 binding profiles as well as allowing us to identify functional binding events (those with direct impact on expression). This is done by changing the set of targets for EIN3 so that different binding values are used at each time point. For each EIN3 candidate target gene, the average RPKM values from two input control samples at 0 and 4 hr were used as a cutoff to determine whether it was bound by EIN3 or not at each time point. We ran the modified DREM algorithm using the mRNA-Seq data allowing for 3-way splits. We filtered out genes that did not change at least twofold (up or down) at any time point, and we used the default values for all other parameters."

The authors present a coordinated analysis of transcriptional changes and genome-wide binding of the key transcription factor EIN3 (which accumulates upon ethylene treatment and which is both necessary and sufficient for most ethylene responses) during a time course after addition of ethylene. There are very few reports in the literature tracking genome-wide transcription factor binding after a stimulus, and the integration with gene expression measurements greatly increases the inferences that can be drawn from the genome-wide DNA binding studies. This tour de force will set a new bar for the analysis of transcription factor networks."

Important findings are that there are several discrete waves of transcriptional responses; that a negative feedback loop represses ethylene receptor expression; and that much of the previously known cross-talk between hormone pathways involves EIN3 binding to genes regulated by several hormones. The interaction with other hormone pathways is nicely demonstrated with the knockout of a small family of closely related EIN3 targets, which reproduces aspects of phenotypes seen in mutants deficient in the response to another hormone, auxin."

We observed an increased number of rosette leaves in the quadruple mutant (n=21), in comparison to wild-type plants (n=12). This phenotype suggests an enhanced not impaired axillary bud emergence, which is expected because auxin inhibits axillary bud emergence in wildtype plants. Concurrent mutations in HLS1 and its homologs resulted in various floral phenotypes. Mutants flowered earlier (2 weeks long day/3 weeks short day) in comparison to the wild type (4 weeks long day/8 weeks short day). Additionally, the quadruple mutant plants lacked apical dominance, producing numerous inflorescences that were sterile. The increased number of rosette leaves and the early flowering phenotype indicate that the quadruple mutants have an accelerated development rate than that of wild type. Interestingly, we found that ARF2 protein accumulates in the quadruple mutant. <i>arf2</i> mutants were reported to have increased leaf longevity (Lim et al. 2010, J Exp Botany), and as mentioned previously, it appears the quadruple mutant exhibits the converse phenotype, accelerated development. However, the regulatory logic of ARF2 as a repressor of the auxin response is not simple, if it were, the HLS/HLH quadruple mutant resulting in an increase of ARF2 would therefore result in enhanced repression of the auxin response. However, using Biomaps, genes up-regulated in the quadruple mutant were significantly enriched for \u201cresponse to auxin\u201d function (unpublished observation). Finally, it is currently not possible to apply exogenous auxin with the expectation of proper delivery of the hormone and complementation of the many phenotypes observed. Regarding ethylene, the quadruple mutant is partially insensitive to ethylene and thus cannot be rescued by the hormone."
