However, the pathways underlying ILC development remain unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor NFIL3 directs the development of a committed bone marrow precursor that differentiates into all known ILC lineages. NFIL3 was required in the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), and was essential for the differentiation of \u03b1LP, a bone marrow cell population that gives rise to all known ILC lineages. Clonal differentiation studies revealed that CXCR6<sup>+</sup> cells within the \u03b1LP population differentiate into all ILC lineages but not T- and B-cells. We further show that NFIL3 governs ILC development by directly regulating expression of the transcription factor TOX. These findings establish that NFIL3 directs the differentiation of a committed ILC precursor that gives rise to all ILC lineages and provide insight into the defining role of NFIL3 in ILC development."

However, the pathways underlying ILC development remain unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor NFIL3 directs the development of a committed bone marrow precursor that differentiates into all known ILC lineages. NFIL3 was required in the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), and was essential for the differentiation of \u03b1LP, a bone marrow cell population that gives rise to all known ILC lineages. Clonal differentiation studies revealed that CXCR6<sup>+</sup> cells within the \u03b1LP population differentiate into all ILC lineages but not T- and B-cells. We further show that NFIL3 governs ILC development by directly regulating expression of the transcription factor TOX. These findings establish that NFIL3 directs the differentiation of a committed ILC precursor that gives rise to all ILC lineages and provide insight into the defining role of NFIL3 in ILC development."

This idea is supported by expression profiles of key transcription factors known to be involved in ILC development (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Similar to CLP and CHILP, \u03b1LPs do not express transcription factors that specify ILC lineages, such as ROR\u03b3t, GATA3, T-BET and EOMES, suggesting an undifferentiated phenotype.

The majority of \u03b1LPs express ID2 at levels that are markedly lower than those in CHILPs. Because ID2 is virtually undetectable in CLPs, this suggests that \u03b1LPs may represent a transitional stage between CLP and CHILP.

Thus, \u03b1LPs can give rise to all known ILC lineages in vitro and in vivo.

As an alternative, we found that NFIL3 regulates <i>Tox</i> expression in EL4 cells, a mouse lymphoma cell line (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Knockdown of NFIL3 in EL4 cells with two independent shRNA constructs led to dose-dependent down-regulation of <i>Tox</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Conversely, overexpression of NFIL3 in EL4 cells increased <i>Tox</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), indicating that <i>Tox</i> expression is sensitive to NFIL3 levels in EL4 cells in a manner similar to CLPs. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with an NFIL3-specific antibody (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yu et al., 2013</a>) demonstrated that NFIL3 directly bound to the <i>Tox</i> promoter (nt \u22122105 to \u22121867) and that overexpression of NFIL3 enhanced this binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Finally, NFIL3 activated <i>Tox</i> promoter activity as assessed by a luciferase reporter assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)<i>.</i> Thus, NFIL3 activates <i>Tox</i> expression by directly binding to its promoter. EL4 cells are derived from T lymphocytes, a CLP-derived lineage, and thus we cannot exclude the possibility that the regulatory relationship between <i>Nfil3</i> and <i>Tox</i> differs between T lymphocytes and CLPs. Nevertheless, our studies on CLPs and EL4 cells both support the idea that NFIL3 is an activator of <i>Tox</i> expression."

To test this idea, we cloned <i>Tox</i> coding sequences into a bicistronic vector (MSCV-IRES-hCD2), which allowed expression of the native form of TOX and also marked cells with the cell surface marker hCD2. We then delivered the TOX-encoding plasmid or the empty vector into purified <i>Nfil3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> LSK cells (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) by retroviral transduction (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Spencer et al., 2014</a>), followed by transfer of these cells into lethally irradiated wild-type mice (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Compared to the empty vector control, transduction of the TOX-encoding plasmid led to increased numbers of cNK cells in spleen, non-NK ILC1 cells in liver, and ILC2 and ILC3 in the small intestines of recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). We observed that rescue of ILC development from <i>Nfil3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> LSK cells by <i>Tox</i> was largely comparable to rescue by <i>Nfil3</i> in the same setting, supporting the idea that <i>Tox</i> acts downstream of <i>Nfil3</i> in ILC development. Though ILC2 cells developing from <i>Tox</i>-rescued LSK cells were generally fewer than those from <i>Nfil3</i>-rescued LSK cells, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Thus, ILC development is rescued by restoring <i>Tox</i> expression in <i>Nfil3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> progenitors, indicating that NFIL3 drives ILC development in part by regulating <i>Tox</i> expression."

We show that NFIL3 directs the development of bone marrow precursors, derived from the CLP, which give rise to all known ILC lineages including cNK cells.

Since TOX has been shown to direct the development of multiple ILC lineages, including cNK cells and ILC3 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aliahmad et al., 2010</a>), this suggests that activation of TOX expression is a key mechanism by which NFIL3 influences ILC development. This idea is supported by our finding that forced <i>Tox</i> expression in <i>Nfil3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> bone marrow progenitors rescues the ILC developmental defect and restores differentiation of cNK, non-NK ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3.

Extramedullary development of thymic NK cells is also independent of NFIL3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Crotta et al., 2014</a>). In addition, during mouse cytomegalovirus infection, NK cells in <i>Nfil3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice expand to numbers similar to those in wild-type mice through an IL-15-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Firth et al., 2013</a>).

Finally, despite the strict requirement for NFIL3 in bone marrow ILC precursor development (\u03b1LP and CHILP), <i>Nfil3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice appear to have normal lymph nodes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Spits and Di Santo, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Seillet et al., 2014b</a>) and only moderately impaired Peyer's patch development (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)(<a href=\"#bib10\">Geiger et al., 2014</a>).

The finding that NFIL3 is required for the development of committed ILC precursors suggests that precursor differentiation may also be synchronized with diurnal light cycles through a similar mechanism. Future studies will examine whether <i>Nfil3</i> expression is diurnally regulated in the CLP, whether precursor generation is synchronized to circadian light cycles in an NFIL3-dependent manner, and whether disruption of circadian light cycles leads to dysregulated ILC development."

Further, the manuscript significantly extends earlier observations by showing that the ILC progenitor potential in aLP compartment is likely to be contained in the previously identified CXCR6-expressing sub-population. Finally, using a transcriptome survey, the manuscript generates the hypothesis that Tox is a downstream target of Nfil3 relevant for ILC development, and tests it with Tox-specific siRNA and overexpression approaches to correlate Nfil3 expression with Tox, to show that TOX is a downstream target of NFIL3, and to demonstrate that it can rescue ILC development of NFIL3-/- precursors."

Finally, Possot et al. used quantitative RT-PCR to show that <i>Rorc</i> (encoding ROR\u03b3t) expression is undetectable in CXCR6<sup>+</sup> cells from adult bone marrow."
