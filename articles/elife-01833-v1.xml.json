                    "text": "Songbirds use auditory feedback to learn and maintain their songs, but how feedback interacts with vocal motor circuitry remains unclear. A potential site for this interaction is the song premotor nucleus HVC, which receives auditory input and contains neurons (HVC<sub>X</sub> cells) that innervate an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) important to feedback-dependent vocal plasticity. Although the singing-related output of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells is unaltered by distorted auditory feedback (DAF), deafening gradually weakens synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, raising the possibility that they integrate feedback only at subthreshold levels during singing. Using intracellular recordings in singing zebra finches, we found that DAF failed to perturb singing-related synaptic activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, although many of these cells responded to auditory stimuli in non-singing states. Moreover, in vivo multiphoton imaging revealed that deafening-induced changes to HVC<sub>X</sub> synapses require intact AFP output. These findings support a model in which the AFP accesses feedback independent of HVC."

A potential site for this interaction is the song premotor nucleus HVC, which receives auditory input and contains neurons (HVC<sub>X</sub> cells) that innervate an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) important to feedback-dependent vocal plasticity. Although the singing-related output of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells is unaltered by distorted auditory feedback (DAF), deafening gradually weakens synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, raising the possibility that they integrate feedback only at subthreshold levels during singing. Using intracellular recordings in singing zebra finches, we found that DAF failed to perturb singing-related synaptic activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, although many of these cells responded to auditory stimuli in non-singing states. Moreover, in vivo multiphoton imaging revealed that deafening-induced changes to HVC<sub>X</sub> synapses require intact AFP output. These findings support a model in which the AFP accesses feedback independent of HVC."

Hamaguchi et al. used high resolution imaging to show that destroying the LMAN also prevents deafening from altering the structure of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells. Again, this suggests that auditory feedback is not relayed from the HVC to the LMAN; instead the flow of information is in the opposite direction."

The synaptic mechanisms underlying the integration of sensory and motor-related signals remain enigmatic. Songbirds use auditory feedback to learn and maintain their vocalizations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Konishi, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Price, 1979</a>) and possess well-delineated neural circuits for singing (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nottebohm et al., 1982</a>), thus providing an attractive organism in which to identify synaptic mechanisms for auditory\u2013vocal integration. Nevertheless, despite important progress in identifying synaptic mechanisms of auditory-guided song plasticity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mooney, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Olveczky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andalman and Fee, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roberts et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Warren et al., 2011</a>), how auditory feedback is integrated in the brain to affect the neural circuits for singing remains poorly understood."

Within HVC, a distinct type of projection neuron (HVC<sub>X</sub>) provides input to an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) that is necessary for song learning and that is anatomically similar to cortico-basal ganglia pathways in mammals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Farries and Perkel, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doupe et al., 2005</a>). Various studies have shown that the output nucleus of the AFP (the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, or LMAN) is the source of behavioral variations that can adaptively bias song in response to feedback perturbations (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andalman and Fee, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Warren et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Charlesworth et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, LMAN lesions prevent deafening-induced song degradation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andalman and Fee, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Warren et al., 2011</a>), and inactivating LMAN can reverse shifts in syllable pitch induced by distorted auditory feedback (DAF) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andalman and Fee, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Warren et al., 2011</a>). These findings suggest that the AFP has access to feedback-related information about song performance. One potential source of this information is the HVC<sub>X</sub> cell population, because auditory responses that can be detected in the AFP of anesthetized birds disappear when HVC is pharmacologically inactivated (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roy and Mooney, 2009</a>). Moreover, individual HVC<sub>X</sub> cells can fire in remarkably similar patterns during singing and in response to song playback (<a href=\"#bib37\">Prather et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fujimoto et al., 2011</a>). However, the singing-related action potential activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells does not change when auditory feedback is masked by noise bursts (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Prather et al., 2008</a>). These and other observations (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hessler and Doupe, 1999</a>) are consistent with the idea that in singing birds, HVC<sub>X</sub> cells provide the AFP with a motor-related efference copy rather than an auditory feedback signal."

Therefore, a remaining possibility is that HVC<sub>X</sub> cells receive subthreshold feedback signals during singing that modify their dendritic spines and more slowly alter HVC<sub>X</sub> action potential output, and thus AFP activity, over a period of hours to days. One prediction of this model is that synaptic inputs onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells will be acutely sensitive to feedback perturbation. In this study, we tested this idea using sharp intracellular current clamp recordings in freely singing zebra finches exposed to DAF. A second prediction of this model is that the deafening-induced changes in HVC<sub>X</sub> spines will be caused by feedforward changes to HVC\u2019s auditory afferents rather than by AFP-dependent mechanisms that drive deafening-induced vocal plasticity. To test this prediction, we imaged HVC<sub>X</sub> dendritic spines in zebra finches that received LMAN lesions prior to deafening."

HVC<sub>X</sub> cells were identified either by antidromic stimulation methods (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), DC current-evoked firing patterns (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mooney, 2000</a>), or characteristic singing-related hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#bib29\">Long et al., 2010</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib29\">Long et al., 2010</a>), all HVC<sub>X</sub> cells we recorded without current injection showed spontaneous, regular action potential activity when the bird was not vocalizing (8.2 \u00b1 5.8 Hz, mean \u00b1SD), entered a hyperpolarized state within several hundred milliseconds before song onset (baseline \u221258.5 \u00b1 7.1 mV, during singing \u221262.3 \u00b1 7.3 mV), and all except two exhibited one or more action potential bursts during the utterance of the stereotyped sequence of syllables constituting the song motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

We used the first two Slepian sequences (calculated by dpss function in MATLAB) with NW parameter = 4. (2) Features including sound amplitude, mean frequency, Wiener entropy, frequency modulation (FM), and pitch are calculated. A sound event is detected as a continuous sound chunk during which sound amplitude is higher than a threshold (set to \u223c10 times from the baseline noise level). (3) At the end of each sound event, mean and variance of spectral features during the sound event are calculated to identify the pre-target syllable, using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Only two dimensions from the test samples are shown. (4) Once the pre-target syllable is detected, the program starts to detect the onset of target syllables defined as the sound segments that satisfy pre-set conditions for at least 3 ms. If all the conditions are not satisfied for a fixed duration (\u223c100 ms), the program stops detecting the target syllable and starts to look for the pre-target syllable. (5) When the onset of the target syllable is detected, DAF is either executed immediately or suppressed with some probability (usually set to p=0.5)."

To distort the bird\u2019s experience of singing-related auditory feedback, we used a computer-controlled real-time system to detect a specific syllable in the bird\u2019s song motif and trigger sound playback during the production of the ensuing \u2018target\u2019 syllable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Playback sounds included either a 100-ms noise burst or a recorded version of one of the bird\u2019s own syllables; using either of these stimuli to distort singing-related auditory feedback has been shown to induce gradual changes to adult song, indicating the existence of neural circuitry that detects these acute feedback perturbations and induces vocal plasticity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leonardo and Konishi, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andalman and Fee, 2009</a>). To establish the efficacy of this DAF method, we set the sound amplitude slightly above the level that causes song truncation in some initial trials (\u223c65 dB at the center of the cage). To ensure that any changes in subthreshold activity we might detect were driven by feedback perturbations rather than by acute changes in motor-related activity, we excluded from analysis any trials in which DAF triggered truncation or changes in song tempo (see below for a description of subthreshold activity in those DAF trials that evoked acute motor effects; also see <a href=\"#bib42\">Sakata and Brainard, 2008</a>). In separate behavioral experiments, we also confirmed that applying our perturbation protocol in a pitch-contingent manner over a period of days as previously described (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</a>) was sufficient to shift the pitch of target syllables (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; the observed hit rate was 30\u201370%)."

In a subset of cells, we used current injection to strongly hyperpolarize the membrane potential to maximize our ability to detect feedback-dependent changes in inhibitory inputs.

However, we found that DAF-insensitive HVC<sub>X</sub> cells could respond to auditory presentation of the bird\u2019s own song during periods when the bird was not singing, including during the daytime or minutes to hours into the night (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>; 7/8 DAF-insensitive cells showed significant subthreshold responses to BOS playback during the day, and 4/4 DAF-insensitive cells that we tracked across the day\u2013night boundary showed significant sub- and suprathreshold responses during darkness). Moreover, the majority of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells we recorded from, including those in which we did not collect singing-related activity, displayed BOS-evoked auditory activity during the day or night (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, subthreshold responses: n = 15/27 cells in day; 10/11 cells in night; suprathreshold responses: 5/12 cells in day; 7/8 cells in night). Indeed, the increased proportion of auditory-responsive HVC<sub>X</sub> cells we detected during the night is consistent with prior extracellular studies that show auditory responses in the zebra finch HVC are strongly state-dependent (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cardin and Schmidt, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rauske et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nick and Konishi, 2005</a>).

Although prior studies have not described auditory\u2013vocal mirroring in HVC of zebra finches, longer intracellular recordings (&gt;3 hr) that we made in two DAF-insensitive HVC<sub>X</sub> cells revealed clear evidence of auditory\u2013vocal mirroring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Specifically, at later times during the night, we detected BOS-evoked sub- and supra-threshold activity that closely resembled the singing-related activity recorded earlier during the daytime. Moreover, in a larger subset of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in which we recorded singing-related activity with or without DAF during the day and tracked across the day\u2013night boundary, we found that the correlation in membrane potential activity recorded during singing and in response to BOS playback increased at later times in the night (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These findings show that auditory\u2013vocal mirror neurons in the zebra finch HVC are insensitive to auditory feedback perturbation during singing and also suggest that sensorimotor mirroring may be a latent feature of a large cohort of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in this species."

In a small subset of experiments, we made intracellular recordings (n = 14 neurons in 5 birds) in the region immediately ventral to HVC (i.e., HVC shelf, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which is known to receive input from auditory regions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fortune and Margoliash, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vates et al., 1996</a>) that contain DAF-sensitive neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</a>). During singing, we found that most (5/9) HVC shelf cells showed significantly greater subthreshold depolarizing responses in the presence of DAF, consistent with the notion that they receive synaptic input from neurons that exhibit DAF-sensitive action potential output (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C, D</a>; one of these cells also showed a significant suprathreshold response to DAF, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These recordings also revealed that synaptic activity in HVC shelf cells can be modulated during singing, although the pattern of this activity was less stereotyped from one motif to the next than observed in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. HVC shelf: n = 14 cells, C.C. = 0.12 \u00b1 0.03 (SEM). HVC<sub>X</sub> cells: n = 53 cells, C.C. = 0.70 \u00b1 0.02, without time warping).

One expectation of a motor-related signal is that it should precede sound onset during singing. To test this idea, we examined the relationship between the onsets of dPSPs and syllables during bouts of singing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). Population-averaged cross-correlation analysis revealed that dPSP onsets in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells occur on average \u223c25 ms before syllable onsets (n = 53 cells, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), similar to the findings from prior extracellular studies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fujimoto et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, dPSP onsets were not correlated with syllable offsets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), indicating that singing-related synaptic inputs to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are correlated to future, rather than ongoing or past, vocal output. Another expectation of a motor-related signal is that, should change in parallel to changes in vocal output. As previously mentioned, DAF can trigger acute effects, such as truncation or slowing of song tempo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sakata and Brainard, 2008</a>), which are distinct from the slower changes in song that are associated with feedback-dependent error correction mechanisms. In fact, we observed significant changes in membrane potential fluctuations of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells when DAF-triggered song truncation or delays in syllable onsets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,H</a>). Therefore, the intracellular method we used is capable of detecting DAF-related changes in the subthreshold activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, but only when DAF triggers acute vocal motor effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that synaptic inputs to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells do not convey auditory feedback signals during singing and instead encode information about future vocal output, consistent with a motor-related signal."

One possibility is that feedback perturbations are detected by auditory neurons indirectly presynaptic to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, and information from these feedback-sensing cells alters synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells more gradually as a prelude to the AFP-mediated error correction processes that result in vocal plasticity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In this \u2018feedforward model\u2019, disrupting auditory feedback should be sufficient to induce synaptic changes in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells regardless of any downstream processes in the AFP. Another possibility is that deafening-induced changes to synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells depend on downstream processes in the AFP that are known to be critical for feedback-dependent changes to song (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Indeed, contrary to the long-held assumption that activity only propagates from HVC to the AFP, a recent study established that activity could propagate from LMAN through recurrent circuitry to HVC (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hamaguchi and Mooney, 2012</a>). Therefore, a remaining possibility is that deafening-induced changes to synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells depend on LMAN activity and not simply on the removal of auditory feedback to HVC, as predicted by the feedforward model."

As previously described (<a href=\"#bib40\">Roberts et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>), a GFP-lentivirus was injected into HVC to label HVC cells, and a retrograde tracer was injected bilaterally into Area X to facilitate identification of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells. Additionally, we placed bilateral lesions in LMAN with ibotenic acid 4\u20135 days before the first imaging session, which was conducted during the bird\u2019s subjective nighttime (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The morning following the first imaging session, the birds were deafened by bilateral surgical removal of the cochlea, which triggers a form of AFP-dependent song degradation that we confirmed here can be dramatically reduced by prior LMAN lesions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; only syllables that underwent significant degradation within the first 3d post-deafening are shown; p values reported in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> for difference in magnitude of spectral change between LMAN lesion and LMAN intact birds; also see below). Surprisingly, in addition to greatly reducing song degradation, LMAN lesions completely prevented the decrease in HVC<sub>X</sub> cell spine size index that normally follows deafening (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013C</a>; 471 spines from 7 HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons in 3 LMAN lesion-deafened birds; 495 spines from 7 HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in 6 LMAN-intact deafened birds; spine data from LMAN intact-deafened birds were previously reported in <a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>; p=0.001 for difference between groups across all time bins). In fact, the post-deafening spine size index values from HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in deafened birds with LMAN lesions measured here did not differ from values measured from longitudinally imaged birds with normal hearing (data not shown; spine data from birds with normal hearing were previously reported in <a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>). Lesions to LMAN also prevented deafening-induced decreases in HVC<sub>X</sub> cell spine stability, and spine stability measurements from HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in LMAN lesion-deafened birds were significantly higher than those from LMAN intact-deafened HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in all post-song degradation time bins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>; 2401 spines from 7 HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in 3 LMAN lesion-deafened birds; 3562 spines from 14 HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in 9 LMAN intact-deafened birds; spine data from LMAN intact-deafened birds were previously reported in <a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>; p\u22640.02 for difference between groups in last 3 time bins). Therefore, in contrast to a feedforward model of auditory feedback processing by HVC, deafening-induced changes to dendritic spines on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells depend on an intact LMAN."

First, spine dynamics in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells following LMAN lesions but prior to deafening did not differ from values obtained from similarly aged birds with normal hearing and an intact LMAN (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>; HVC<sub>X</sub> cell spine size index: 1.10 \u00b1 0.06 in LMAN lesion group; 1.07 \u00b1 0.03 in LMAN intact group, mean \u00b1SEM, p=0.62; HVC<sub>X</sub> cell spine stability: 94.0 \u00b1 1.1% in LMAN lesion group, 92.0 \u00b1 1.6% in LMAN intact group, p=0.61; LMAN intact data previously reported in <a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>). Second, prior to deafening, LMAN lesions did not affect the mean or variability of syllable entropy or entropy variance (EV), two features that are sensitive to small changes in song\u2019s acoustic structure (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>; Wilcoxon signed-ranks test used to compare pre-lesion to post-lesion values for 25 syllables from 6 birds [includes 3 birds used for imaging]; data shown only for mean entropy and EV; p=0.09 for mean entropy, p=0.92 for coefficient of variation [CV] of entropy, p=0.25 for mean EV, p=0.31 for CV of EV). Third, a post mortem analysis of brain tissue indicated that the lesions we made in LMAN were comparable in volume to those reported in previous studies that have established LMAN\u2019s role in preventing deafening-induced song degradation (40\u2013100% lesion extent, <a href=\"#bib4\">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</a>). Finally, although the LMAN lesions we made largely prevented deafening-induced song degradation, birds that received LMAN lesions still showed extremely subtle but significant song degradation following deafening, as previously reported (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Horita et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, neither the complete abolition of auditory feedback by deafening nor the expression of small amounts of deafening-induced vocal plasticity in LMAN-lesioned birds are sufficient to drive structural changes to HVC dendritic spines."

HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are attractive candidates for providing this information because they provide auditory input to the AFP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roy and Mooney, 2009</a>), receive inputs that are weakened by deafening (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>), and may receive inputs from DAF-sensitive neurons, including HVC interneurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sakata and Brainard, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</a>). Furthermore, some forms of mammalian cortical plasticity initially involve changes to inhibitory rather than excitatory synapses (<a href=\"#bib13\">Froemke et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Keck et al., 2011</a>), raising the possibility that DAF might alter inhibitory input onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells prior to any changes in excitatory input. Therefore, although the singing-related action potential output of HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons is insensitive to DAF (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Prather et al., 2008</a>), the possibility remained that these cells integrate input from feedback-sensing cells during singing at subthreshold levels, which could then trigger slower changes to synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons as a prelude to vocal plasticity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>). By directly measuring synaptic activity in singing birds, we found that singing-related synaptic activity in HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons lacks real-time sensitivity to feedback perturbation. Moreover, many HVC<sub>X</sub> cells that we recorded displayed auditory responses in non-singing states, including a subset of cells that exhibited auditory-motor mirroring, a property which has been theorized to arise through integration of real-time feedback signals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hanuschkin et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, although HVC<sub>X</sub> cells receive fast synaptic inputs from several sources that may have the potential to convey auditory feedback during singing, these inputs appear to be gated to an \u2018off\u2019 position during vocalization in zebra finches (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shea and Margoliash, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cardin and Schmidt, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Coleman et al., 2007</a>)."

Several observations allay this concern. First, the hit rate for applying DAF we used during intracellular recordings (i.e., \u223c50%) has been shown here (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and by others to be sufficiently frequent to drive adaptive changes in pitch (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andalman and Fee, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Charlesworth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2013</a>). Second, all of the analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity we performed were conducted after the bird had been exposed to DAF for at least an entire preceding day, the time required for the bird to habituate to the exposure, as determined by the decreased frequency of song truncations we observed in response to DAF. Finally, because we recorded from individual birds for 1 to 2 weeks and exposed them to DAF throughout much of that time window, many of the cells we recorded from were monitored after the animal had experienced many days or even more than a week of DAF. That is, our intracellular recordings and analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity were made in conditions where the bird\u2019s exposure to DAF was both frequent and prolonged. And although we did not track any single cell\u2019s activity while DAF exposure induced song plasticity, a recent study by <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al. (2013)</a> has shown that singing-related HVC multiunit activity remains unchanged even after contingent DAF is used to drive changes in song pitch. Therefore, we support a model in which auditory synapses onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are always gated off when the bird is singing, while also recognizing that experiments involving longer-term intracellular recordings in birds that are undergoing DAF-induced song plasticity are required to fully resolve this issue."

                        "text": "The absence of any detectable synaptic trace of auditory feedback in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells during singing raises the question of how deafening drives changes to synapses on these cells. One possibility is that auditory feedback information is first transmitted to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells and then to downstream error correction circuits in the AFP, but that this information transfer occurs slowly and only when the bird is not singing. Regardless of the plausibility of such an offline feedforward model, it predicts that removal of auditory feedback independent of downstream error correction processes in the AFP should be sufficient to trigger changes to dendritic spines in HVC. In contrast, we found that LMAN lesions prevent the shrinkage and destabilization of HVC<sub>X</sub> dendritic spines that normally follow deafening. Therefore, deafening-induced changes to HVC<sub>X</sub> spines depend on an intact AFP, rather than resulting simply from the removal of auditory drive to HVC, thus raising the possibility that HVC receives error-correction signals from the AFP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2013</a>). Although the current experiments cannot resolve whether deafening-induced changes in HVC are driven solely by changes in LMAN activity or instead by LMAN acting in concert with the removal of auditory inputs to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, the total insensitivity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells to acute feedback perturbations suggests to us that deafening-induced synaptic changes in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are a consequence rather than a cause of error correction processes mediated by the AFP. The indirect, recurrent pathways that can convey activity from LMAN to HVC (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hamaguchi and Mooney, 2012</a>) provide a substrate over which the consequences of error correction processes in the AFP could be transmitted back to the early stages of the vocal motor hierarchy. Furthermore, because LMAN can access multiple stages of the motor hierarchy in tens of milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hamaguchi and Mooney, 2012</a>) and song may only change in response to altered feedback over hours or days, the consequences of performance evaluation may be widely distributed in the song motor network even before behavioral changes are first evident."

Previous studies have shown that input and output cells of the AFP (HVC<sub>X</sub> and LMAN neurons) are not real-time sensors of auditory feedback (<a href=\"#bib26\">Leonardo, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Prather et al., 2008</a>), and the current study shows that even those feedback-dependent changes that can be detected in HVC depend on the AFP rather than fast synaptic signaling onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells from feedback-sensing auditory neurons. These findings suggest that HVC is downstream of the performance evaluation provided by real-time feedback sensors, and also raises the possibility that these sensors communicate error-related information to the AFP independent of HVC. Notably, the ventral tegmental area provides input to Area X (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lewis et al., 1981</a>) and receives indirect input from several auditory regions, including the HVC shelf, that contain DAF-sensitive cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wild et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fortune and Margoliash, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vates et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</a>). In this scenario, the consequences of error detection would reach the AFP in the form of neuromodulatory signals from the VTA, an arrangement that would buffer the entire song premotor circuitry from the role of acute feedback processing. In fact, this buffered feedback architecture, along with the gating of auditory inputs to HVC, may be necessary when the frequency of motor control is so fast that a relatively slow feedback signal becomes uninformative for the ongoing motor command."

A miniature motor (Part # 0206A001B+02/1 47:1-Y2825; Micromo, FL) was used to move the micropipette attached to the shuttle, and two additional stainless steel screws were used to stabilize the movement of the micropipette. A miniaturized headstage (by IY, equivalent to HS-2A headstage with gain x0.1, Axon Instruments [now Molecular Devices, CA]) was mounted on the back of the base to send signals and receive command current from the intracellular recording amplifier (AxoClamp-2B; Axon Instruments) through a flexible tether cable (Omnetics, MN). The microdrive was surgically implanted over HVC using stereotaxic coordinates. All recordings were made from the right hemisphere.

Before the experiments, a support-vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to define the pre-target syllable (SVM algorithm with a Gaussian kernel using soft margins was written by KH in MATLAB). During the experiment, the same SVM algorithm and the same parameter sets (written in Simulink and xPC Target, MATLAB by KH) were used for the online detection of the pre-target syllable (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, step 3). Once the pre-target syllable was detected, spectral features including sound amplitude, mean frequency, Wiener entropy, FM, and pitch values were measured for a duration \u223c100 ms (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, step 4). Because the occurrence of the target syllable was almost completely predicted by the detection of the pre-target syllable in zebra finch songs, we defined the occurrence of the target syllable simply as the time when sound amplitude crossed a threshold. The occurrence of the target syllable was confirmed in post-hoc analysis. To avoid false positives (triggering DAF by detecting a natural fluctuation of syllable features), the criteria need to be met for more than 3 ms before executing DAF playback; therefore, the minimum latency between the detection of target syllable and the delivery of auditory feedback is 3\u20134 ms. We set the sound amplitude slightly above the level where birds tend to truncate their song (\u223c65 dB at the center of the cage) to establish the saliency of DAF. Birds gradually begin to sing motifs of normal duration and tempo even with DAF, and our analysis is limited to the songs without truncation and delayed syllables except for <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. Song truncation was detected by the absence of expected syllables following DAF onset. Delayed syllables were detected by referencing the expected distribution of the syllable onset timings in catch conditions with the probability p(\u03c4 | catch), where \u03c4 is the syllable onset timings relative to DAF. By randomly selecting the hit trials with the probability of p(\u03c4 | catch)/p(\u03c4 | hit), we made the syllable onset timing distributions in hit and catch conditions equivalent."

The threshold was set relatively high; therefore, our analysis is limited to sharp-rising dPSPs. Other parameter values were set to dt = 4 ms and refractoriness = 5 ms. Because zebra finch songs are highly stereotyped, the onset timing of each dPSP is highly stereotyped across bouts, and dPSP onsets naturally form clusters in dPSP raster plot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To identify each dPSP onset cluster, we used a <i>k</i>-means clustering algorithm to identify dPSP onsets. The number of clusters is given by inspecting the dPSP histogram and raster plots. The time range for this analysis is 20\u2013200 ms after DAF onset.

Undirected song was recorded continuously starting at least 2 days before until at least 1 week after deafening. Wiener entropy and entropy variance (EV) of each syllable in a bird\u2019s song were quantified using Sound Analysis Pro (<a href=\"#bib43a\">Tchernichovski et al., 2000</a>). 30 examples of each syllable were measured on each day, and values from two pre-deafening days were pooled to obtain a baseline distribution for each syllable. The onset of song degradation for each bird was defined as the day on which the distribution of values for either the entropy or EV of any syllable differed significantly from the baseline distribution and remained significantly different on all subsequent days (one-way ANOVA)."

The birds were placed on a reverse day\u2013night cycle 1 week before the first imaging session to minimize effects of imaging on their daytime behavior and were imaged longitudinally starting 1\u20132 nights prior to deafening. On the first night of imaging, birds were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A headpost was affixed to the skull using dental acrylic, and bilateral craniotomies (1\u20132 mm<sup>2</sup>) were made over HVC. The dura was excised, and a custom-cut coverslip (No. 1 thickness) was placed over the pial surface and sealed in with dental acrylic. The birds were placed on a custom stage under a Zeiss Laser Scanning Two-Photon Microscope 510. Only GFP-labeled neurons within a field of retrogradely labeled neurons were classified as HVC neurons and imaged.

Spine size (measured across nights, 24 hr interval) was measured as the integrated optical density of each spine head, background-subtracted (using the optical density of neuropil next to the dendrite) and normalized to the mean brightness of the adjacent dendritic shaft. Spine size index was calculated as the ratio of spine size values measured during imaging sessions separated by 24 hr (time 24 size/time 0 size). Spine stability was calculated as the percentage of spines maintained each night (2 hr interval). Data from LMAN intact, deafened birds and LMAN intact, hearing birds (previously described in <a href=\"#bib45\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>) are reported as raw values (i.e., post-deafening measurements of spine size index and spine stability were not normalized to baseline, pre-deafening measurements for data presentation)."

This is a question that lies at the core of how auditory feedback shapes vocal learning. Over the past several decades, a number of increasingly refined experiments have shown that auditory feedback is necessary for vocal learning and that perturbations of auditory feedback will cause, even the normally stereotyped song of adult zebra finches, to degrade. The time course over which this degradation occurs is not immediate. Depending on the experimental paradigm and the precision with which song is analyzed, changes in song acoustic structure can be observed within hours to days. Because lesions of a specialized basal ganglia circuit (known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP)) prevents song degradation following feedback perturbation (e.g., deafening by cochlear removal or distorted auditory feedback (DAF)), it has been hypothesized and shown that song degradation is an active process that can be prevented by interrupting this basal ganglia circuit, for example with lesions of its output nucleus, LMAN."

It was therefore surprising that these neurons did not shown any changes in firing pattern during DAF even though feedback distortion was sufficient to perturb song."

Several observations allay this concern. First, the hit rate for applying DAF we used during intracellular recordings (i.e., \u223c50%) has been shown here (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 3</a>) and by others to be sufficiently frequent to drive adaptive changes in pitch (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andalman and Fee, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Charlesworth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2013</a>). Second, all of the analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity we performed were conducted after the bird had been exposed to DAF for at least an entire preceding day, the time required for the bird to habituate to the exposure, as determined by the decreased frequency of song truncations we observed in response to DAF. Finally, because we recorded from individual birds for one to two weeks and exposed them to DAF throughout much of that time window, many of the cells we recorded from were monitored after the animal had experienced many days or even more than a week of DAF. That is, our intracellular recordings and analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity were made in conditions where the bird\u2019s exposure to DAF was both frequent and prolonged. And although we did not track any single cell\u2019s activity while DAF exposure induced song plasticity, a recent study by <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al. (2013)</a> has shown that singing-related HVC multiunit activity remains unchanged even after contingent DAF is used to drive changes in song pitch. Therefore, we support a model in which auditory synapses onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are always gated off when the bird is singing, while also recognizing that experiments involving longer-term intracellular recordings in birds that are undergoing DAF-induced song plasticity are required to fully resolve this issue. These potential concerns and the points made above that address them are now considered in the second paragraph of the Discussion, as directed by the Reviewing editor."
