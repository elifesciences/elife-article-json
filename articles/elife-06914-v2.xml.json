                    "text": "Gustatory pheromones play an essential role in shaping the behavior of many organisms. However, little is known about the processing of taste pheromones in higher order brain centers. Here, we describe a male-specific gustatory circuit in <i>Drosophila</i> that underlies the detection of the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone (3<i>R</i>,11<i>Z</i>,19<i>Z</i>)-3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol (CH503). Using behavioral analysis, genetic manipulation, and live calcium imaging, we show that Gr68a-expressing neurons on the forelegs of male flies exhibit a sexually dimorphic physiological response to the pheromone and relay information to the central brain via peptidergic neurons. The release of tachykinin from 8 to 10 cells within the subesophageal zone is required for the pheromone-triggered courtship suppression. Taken together, this work describes a neuropeptide-modulated central brain circuit that underlies the programmed behavioral response to a gustatory sex pheromone. These results will allow further examination of the molecular basis by which innate behaviors are modulated by gustatory cues and physiological state."

However, little is known about the processing of taste pheromones in higher order brain centers. Here, we describe a male-specific gustatory circuit in <i>Drosophila</i> that underlies the detection of the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone (3<i>R</i>,11<i>Z</i>,19<i>Z</i>)-3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol (CH503). Using behavioral analysis, genetic manipulation, and live calcium imaging, we show that Gr68a-expressing neurons on the forelegs of male flies exhibit a sexually dimorphic physiological response to the pheromone and relay information to the central brain via peptidergic neurons. The release of tachykinin from 8 to 10 cells within the subesophageal zone is required for the pheromone-triggered courtship suppression. Taken together, this work describes a neuropeptide-modulated central brain circuit that underlies the programmed behavioral response to a gustatory sex pheromone. These results will allow further examination of the molecular basis by which innate behaviors are modulated by gustatory cues and physiological state."

Several pheromone receptors located in the primary gustatory organs (proboscis, labellum, forelegs) have been identified. Gr32a (<a href=\"#bib36\">Miyamoto and Amrein, 2008</a>) is thought to respond to the male pheromone (7<i>Z</i>)-tricosene (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andrews et al., 2014</a>).

CH503 is transferred from males to females during mating and inhibits courtship from other males (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yew et al., 2009</a>). The pheromone also functions as a potent suppressor of male courtship behavior in other drosophilids (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ng et al., 2014</a>). We show that CH503 is detected by Gr68a-expressing gustatory neurons on the male foreleg and that information is transduced via peptidergic cells to the central brain. Specifically, a cluster of 8\u201310 neurons within the SEZ mediates the pheromone-triggered courtship-avoidance response through the release of the neuropeptide tachykinin."

Since the latency to wing extension did not appear to be affected by CH503, we hypothesized that the pheromone is detected only at close proximity. To determine whether tactile contact with CH503 is necessary for courtship suppression, we positioned a pheromone source separated from the female target at various distances. To prevent contact with the pheromone, a mesh barrier was placed between the courtship chamber and a second chamber containing a piece of filter paper soaked with 64 \u03bcg of CH503. Despite the high dose of pheromone, male courtship was uninhibited when the filter paper was placed 6 or 3 mm away, or on the floor of the courtship chamber (allowing for direct contact). In each case, 100% of male flies initiated courtship towards females (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Potentially, female pheromones act in synergy with CH503 and both cues are needed to inhibit courtship. However, a mixture of female cuticular extract and CH503 applied to filter paper that was placed on the floor of the chamber was ineffective (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We further tested for synergistic effects from female pheromones by using transgenic female flies in which oenocytes, the pheromone-producing cells in <i>Drosophila</i>, were genetically ablated. In the presence of oenocyte-less flies perfumed with CH503, male courtship was still significantly inhibited (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In sum, these results indicate that female-specific pheromones synthesized in the oenocytes do not mediate the detection of CH503. Furthermore, CH503 is effective as an anti-aphrodisiac only when placed on the cuticular surface of females, indicating that sensory cues other than cuticular lipids are required."

We performed a proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay to test whether CH503 is detected by foreleg gustatory receptors. Stimulation of the foreleg with rewarding stimulants such as a sugar solution induces extension of the proboscis (<a href=\"#bib70\">Kimura et al., 1986</a>) while aversive, bitter substances suppress the PER (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lacaille et al., 2007</a>). Exposure of the forelegs to 0.5\u20132.0 \u00b5g of CH503 together with 4% sucrose reduced the frequency of the PER (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, caffeine, a bitter stimulus, also suppressed the PER. In contrast, females did not exhibit a change in the PER when exposed to CH503, indicating that either the pheromone was not detected or that it does not carry a negative valence for females (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further examine whether CH503 is detected as an odorant or tastant, we tested the responses of transgenic males defective in smell or taste perception. Flies lacking the olfactory co-receptor Or83b (<i>Orco</i>) exhibit significant defects in olfactory pheromone detection (<a href=\"#bib32\">Larsson et al., 2004</a>). However, Or83b-defective flies still suppressed courtship in the presence of CH503 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, <i>Voila</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> mutants, which exhibit gustatory defects (<a href=\"#bib6\">Balakireva et al., 1998</a>), continued to court CH503-perfumed females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that CH503 is perceived as an aversive tastant by males and not females and is detected by gustatory receptors on the foreleg."

The courtship behavior of transgenic or mutant males was then tested in the presence of CH503-perfumed females. The synthetic stereoisomer (<i>S</i>, <i>Z</i>, <i>Z</i>)-CH503 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) was used for preliminary screening since it is more potent than naturally occurring (<i>R</i>, <i>Z</i>, <i>Z</i>)-CH503 both in suppressing courtship (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shikichi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ng et al., 2014</a>) and the PER (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and thus, would lessen the likelihood of false positives. Males from 15 of the gustatory <i>Gal4</i> lines displayed normal courtship suppression behavior in the presence of CH503-perfumed females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Four lines exhibited significantly reduced levels of courtship behavior with control females, thus confounding our ability to detect CH503-related courtship suppression. However, males in which the Gr68a-encoding gene was transcriptionally silenced continued to court females in the presence of (<i>S</i>, <i>Z</i>, <i>Z</i>)-CH503 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A similar response was found when males were tested with the natural pheromone at a 333 ng/fly dose using two independent <i>Gal4</i> lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

At this dose, 6 of 9 cells in segments T2\u20134 showed significant responses compared to the control solvent, ranging from \u0394F/F 0.34 \u00b1 0.05 to 1.39 \u00b1 0.46 (mean \u00b1 SEM). At a dose of 50 ng, only 1 cell (T4, Cell a) showed a significant signal increase, with an average \u0394F/F of 1.52 \u00b1 0.37. Gr68-neurons exhibited two general patterns of responses: more commonly, a phasic response is observed where maximum fluorescent intensity occurred immediately after the addition of the pheromone and was followed by a gradual decline to baseline levels after 6 s. A tonic response is also seen where fluorescence gradually increased and peaked after approximately 120 s (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

Additionally, CH503 failed to evoke a physiological response when Gr68a expression was either reduced using RNAi or eliminated in <i>\u0394Gr68a</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In females, the responses to the pheromone from the forelegs were indistinguishable from that of the solvent control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In the case of cells j and s, it may be that the responses are too subtle to be reliably measured without a sample size \u223c100. The functional imaging results are consistent with observations from the appetitive PER assay where females also failed to exhibit a measurable response to CH503 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, direct measurement of neural response in Gr68a-expressing neurons reveals robust functional activation by CH503 in males only.

We measured responses from GCaMP-expressing <i>ppk23-Gal4</i>-labeled cells in the labella and forelegs of both male and female flies.

While most ppk23-expressing neurons typically responded in a phasic manner with a maximum change in \u0394F/F shortly after pheromone addition, some cells exhibited bursting responses with large increases in \u0394F/F that recurred frequently during the time course of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>)."

In contrast, our study shows that Gr68a-impaired males courted females at similar levels to control males and that one ligand for the receptor is the male sex pheromone CH503. Several factors can account for these discrepancies. First, the courtship defect of Gr68a-impaired males is only evident in larger-sized behavioral chambers (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ejima and Griffith, 2008</a>). Our study used smaller chambers (\u2205 = 10 mm) compared to the previous study (30 mm; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bray and Amrein, 2003</a>) hence masking the courtship defect. Second, Ejima and Griffith previously showed that Gr68a is needed to relay motion-related cues that stimulate courtship initiation. The dual sensory role of Gr68a is consistent with its expression pattern in males in separate mechanosensory and gustatory neuron populations (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ejima and Griffith, 2008</a>) and afferent projections to the SEZ and AMMC, a relay center for auditory information. Thus, males' inability to detect motion rather than female pheromones may underlie the previously reported Gr68a-related courtship initiation defects. Taken together with the results of our current study, we propose that excitatory mechanosensory information is integrated with inhibitory CH503 detection via Gr68a neurons and both types of sensory cues shape the decision to initiate and sustain courtship. This model is consistent with our findings that activation of Gr68a-neurons using TrpA1 did not promote courtship suppression. Simultaneous activation of both courtship-promoting and suppressing channels likely resulted in an overall null response. Similar dual functioning neurons integrating chemical information with touch have been described in nematodes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993</a>), mammalian olfactory receptors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grosmaitre et al., 2007</a>), and vertebrate nociceptor systems (<a href=\"#bib7\">Besson and Chaouch, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Woolf and Walters, 1991</a>)."

Our observation that CH503 induces courtship inhibition only when detected on female cuticles has several implications for the underlying mechanisms. Potentially, activation of Gr68a receptors found on other parts of the male body (e.g., other regions of the legs or wings) is needed and occurs only when males assume courtship postures. Alternatively, concurrent detection of a co-factor residing on female cuticles might be required. Though our results show that hexane-soluble molecules on the cuticle are not needed, the possibility remains that cuticular peptides or proteins may help transduce pheromone detection. Previous work indicated that a pheromone binding protein, CheB42a, is found in the lumen surrounding Gr68a-neurons and is needed for detection of female pheromones (<a href=\"#bib41\">Park et al., 2006</a>). While CheB42a mutants are still sensitive to CH503, other families of binding proteins may be used to detect female-specific signals that facilitate the activity of CH503. Lastly, tactile contact might be needed together with chemosensory stimulation. Previously, Kohatsu et al. showed that in <i>Drosophila</i>, contact between the male foreleg and female abdomen was necessary to initiate courtship (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kohatsu et al., 2011</a>). Abdomen contact induced transient activity in the transmidline interneurons of the P1 neuron cluster, a designated \u2018command center\u2019 for courtship behavior that integrates input from multiple sensory modalities (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kimura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kohatsu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>). Information relayed from the upstream targets of Gr68a-expressing neurons could contribute to the silencing of P1 neurons and in this way, lower the probability of sustained courtship behavior. Whether both chemical and tactile cues are mediated by the same receptor or the same cell remains to be determined."

However, the quantity that is transferred to the female during courtship is approximately 60\u2013100 ng based on semi-quantitative mass spectral analysis of recently mated females. Why is there a discrepancy between the amount that is needed for biological activity and the amount that is transferred? It could be that the presence of cVA, another anti-aphrodisiac, reduces the necessity for a large amount of CH503 or that each molecule synergizes the efficacy of the other. Additionally, recent findings indicate that male <i>D. melanogaster</i> have adapted to become less sensitive to CH503 to circumvent the courtship inhibitory response (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ng et al., 2014</a>). While \u223c80 ng is sufficient to inhibit male courtship in other non-CH503 producing drosophilid species, <i>D. melanogaster</i> males (and males of other species that express CH503) have become less sensitive to the molecule in order to avoid chemical coercion from other males (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ng et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is not surprising that males are not sensitive to the amount of CH503 transferred to females."

Though we were able to measure CH503-induced physiological activity from ppk23-expressing neurons on the proboscis and the male foreleg, the responses in the foreleg are not likely to be specific to the natural pheromone since behaviorally inert chemical analogs also caused a change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. It is unclear as well whether the activity of ppk23 and ppk25-expressing neurons contributes to CH503-mediated courtship avoidance since males continue to respond to the pheromone (albeit more weakly) when expression of either channel is suppressed. Since ppk23 neurons co-localize with <i>fruitless</i> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Toda et al., 2012</a>), a master gene that regulates many aspects of courtship behavior (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</a>), whereas Gr68a neurons do not (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), it is clear that Gr68a and ppk23 expression will also be in distinct populations of neurons. Based on previous observations that ppk23 neurons respond to both attractive and aversive sex pheromones, we speculate that they function as general detectors for a subset of chemosensory cues rather than encode information about valence."

Are there distinct loci within the SEZ that differentially process food and pheromonal cues? In the olfactory system of the fly, information from fruit and pheromones appears to segregate into distinct regions of the lateral horn of the protocerebrum (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>) (though some exceptions have been found, see <a href=\"#bib43\">Ronderos et al., 2014</a> and <a href=\"#bib19\">Grosjean et al., 2011</a>). In the SEZ, the distinctions are less clear. The Gr32a, Gr33a, and Gr39a receptors, which are predicted to detect courtship-inhibitory pheromones, overlap with bitter-sensing neurons in the labellum (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Weiss et al., 2011</a>) and have very similar SEZ projection patterns (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kwon et al., 2014</a>). In addition, no obvious differences in receptor expression at the periphery have been found between males and females. In contrast, Gr68a expression is specialized for male forelegs, appearing in both gustatory and mechanosensory neuron populations. Expression in females is largely restricted to cells located next to chordotonal organs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ejima and Griffith, 2008</a>). Moreover, the Gr68a neuron projection pattern to the TAG appears unique amongst the gustatory receptors, perhaps reflecting its dual role in mechanosensation and chemical detection (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kwon et al., 2014</a>). Refined analysis of individual afferent processes in the SEZ will allow us to better understand whether the quality and valence of a tastant is encoded at the level of the sensory receptor or transformed within the SEZ and higher order regions. Intriguingly, the AMMC was recently identified as a higher-order processing target for gustatory projection neurons from the SEZ which convey sweet information (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</a>). Perhaps some AMMC-projecting neurons may exist for bitter or pheromone-specific information."

In this regard, the TK circuitry serves as a point of convergence for multiple, opposing physiological drives which underlie an animal's decision to mate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). TK has been implicated in numerous systemic functions including lipid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib51\">Song et al., 2014</a>), stress resistance (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kahsai et al., 2010</a>), and modulation of aggression levels (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asahina et al., 2014</a>). In addition, the mammalian homolog Substance P controls sexual behavior, stress responses, appetite, and aggression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Argiolas and Melis, 2013</a>). The convergence of aggression and sex within a common neural pathway alludes to the possibility that the choice to fight or court is modulated by TK release which is, in part, regulated by external stimuli such as pheromones. Interestingly, the c929-TK cells identified in this study were shown previously to be involved in water conservation in response to desiccation (named ipc-1 and 2a; [<a href=\"#bib24\">Kahsai et al., 2010</a>]), indicating that physiological stress could inform the decision to initiate and sustain courtship via TK signaling."

Both doses were previously established as the minimum necessary for each stereoisomer to elicit significant courtship suppression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mori et al., 2010</a>). Transgenic flies were generated using the <i>Gal4\u2013UAS</i> system to drive expression of toxin or pro-apoptotic transgenes (<i>UAS</i>-<i>Reaper</i>, <i>UAS</i>-<i>DTI</i>, and <i>UAS-hid</i>, <i>stinger</i>) or transgenes that interfere with synaptic transmission (<i>UAS</i>-<i>Shibire</i><sup><i>ts1</i></sup> and <i>UAS</i>\u2013<i>dORK\u0394C</i>). For <i>Gr-Gal4</i> lines, <i>UAS-Reaper</i> was used since <i>UAS-DTI</i> expression led to low basal courtship activity.

For <i>Gal4</i> lines in which <i>UAS</i>-<i>Shibir</i>e<sup><i>ts1</i></sup> expression led to paralysis, seizures, or low courtship activity, <i>UAS</i>\u2013<i>dORK\u0394C</i> was used as a milder form of neural inhibition. Knockdown of <i>Gr68a</i> expression was performed using an RNAi line since the use of other transgenes resulted in larval lethality. Manipulation of neurotransmitter levels was performed using RNAi to target the respective transporters, receptors, or biosynthetic enzymes.

Virgin 1-day-old male and female flies were starved for 36 hr in a vial containing tissue soaked with water. Flies were mounted with nail polish on the dorsal side onto glass slides and placed in a humidified Petri dish for at least 2 hr prior to the assay. Paper wicks coated in 20 \u03bcl of a test solution were used for bilateral stimulation of the tarsi of mounted flies. One leg was touched with a paper wick soaked in 4% sucrose (in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, wt/vol) while the second leg was simultaneously stimulated with one of the following solutions: (i) 4% sucrose, (ii) 25\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml (<i>R</i>, <i>Z</i>, <i>Z</i>)-CH503 in hexane, (iii) 0.25\u201325 \u03bcg/ml (<i>S</i>, <i>Z</i>, <i>Z</i>)-CH503 in hexane, and (iv) 100 mM caffeine in dH<sub>2</sub>O. Each substance was tested three times with a 2 min rest between stimulations. A response was counted as positive when the fly extended its proboscis for at least 2 of 3 stimulations. The response to each substance was compared to the response induced by 4% sucrose alone using a Fisher's exact probability test. The assays were carried out at the same time each day, and the experimenter was blind to the identity and concentration of stimulants tested in the assay."

Confocal Z-stacks were analyzed using ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>). For <i>Gr68a-Gal4</i>-labeled neurons, \u2206F/F was calculated from single neurons. For <i>ppk23-Gal4</i>-labeled neurons on the foreleg, \u2206F/F was calculated from the total signal from either two adjacent cell bodies or the base of the axon projections. Due to their close proximity to each other, some individual cell bodies could not be differentiated. In some experiments, the maximum \u2206F/F occurred in projections though it could not be discerned from which cell body the projection originated. For proboscis measurements, \u2206F/F represents the averaged values from 14 cells (for CH503 stimulation) or 20 cells (for PBST stimulation), measured from 5\u20136 flies. For all measurements, the averaged, normalized response to the stimulant vs the averaged, normalized response to control solvent was compared using a Student's <i>t</i>-test for equal or unequal variances (Vassar Stats). Comparison of variance was determined with an F-Test (Vassar Stats). Statistical power analysis was performed using G*Power 3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Faul et al., 2007</a>)."

Why is there a discrepancy between the amount that is needed for biological activity and the amount that is transferred? It could be that the presence of cVA, another anti-aphrodisiac, reduces the necessity for a large amount of 503 or that each molecule synergizes the efficacy of the other. Additionally, recent work has shown that male <i>D. melanogaster</i> have adapted to become less sensitive to CH503 to circumvent the courtship inhibitory response (Ng et al., 2014a). In this paper, it was shown that \u223c80 ng of CH503 was sufficient for inhibition in other non-503 producing drosophilid species. However, <i>D. melanogaster</i> males (and males of other species that express CH503) have become less sensitive to the molecule, probably as a strategy to avoid chemical coercion by rival males. Thus, it is not surprising that males are not sensitive to the amount of CH503 found on females. We have added a discussion on the relevance of the dosages (in the subsection headed \u201cInteraction of CH503 with Gr68a\u201d)."

The behavioral and genetic results are consistent with a direct receptor/ligand interaction, but without heterologous expression of Gr68a and demonstration of direct effects of CH503, it is still possible that the interaction is more complex (especially in light of the requirement for it to be presented on a female to be effective). The authors need to acknowledge the potential complexity of the interaction if they cannot provide this type of evidence</i>."

We speculate also that mechano- and chemosensory cues are detected by the same Gr68a cells. Exploring the nature of the ligand-receptor interaction and assessing the response of Gr68 neurons to mechanosensory stimulation will be an important future direction. However, given that no crystal structure is available for gustatory receptors nor successful heterologous expression (to our knowledge), our speculation on the nature of the ligand-receptor interaction is limited."
