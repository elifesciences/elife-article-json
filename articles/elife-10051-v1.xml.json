Here, we used single-molecule FRET to monitor the remodeling of mononucleosomes by the yeast SWI/SNF remodeler, RSC. We observed that RSC primarily translocates DNA around the nucleosome without substantial displacement of the H2A-H2B dimer. At the sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the DNA moves largely along or near its canonical wrapping path. The translocation of DNA occurs in a stepwise manner, and at both sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the step size distributions exhibit a peak at approximately 1\u20132 bp. These results suggest that the movement of DNA across the nucleosome is likely coupled directly to DNA translocation by the ATPase at its binding site inside the nucleosome."

Here, we used single-molecule FRET to monitor the remodeling of mononucleosomes by the yeast SWI/SNF remodeler, RSC. We observed that RSC primarily translocates DNA around the nucleosome without substantial displacement of the H2A-H2B dimer. At the sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the DNA moves largely along or near its canonical wrapping path. The translocation of DNA occurs in a stepwise manner, and at both sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the step size distributions exhibit a peak at approximately 1\u20132 bp. These results suggest that the movement of DNA across the nucleosome is likely coupled directly to DNA translocation by the ATPase at its binding site inside the nucleosome."

Harada et al. used a technique called single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (or single molecule FRET for short) to observe the movement of DNA around the histone proteins. The technique involves placing a green fluorescent dye on the histone proteins and a red fluorescent dye on the DNA. If the red dye is close to the green dye, some of the energy can be transferred from the green dye to the red dye when the green dye is excited by a laser. By looking at the ratio of green and red light emitted, it is possible to tell how far apart they are, and how this changes over time."

This suggests that the ATPase domain drives the motion of DNA across the entire nucleosome. A future challenge is to better understand how chromatin remodeling enzymes cooperate with other molecules in cells to remodel nucleosomes and chromatin."

Consistent with these roles, SWI/SNF remodelers are capable of disrupting nucleosomes in a number of ways, including repositioning the histone octamer along the DNA, ejecting H2A-H2B dimers from the octamer, and ejecting the histone octamer from the DNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bowman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Becker and Workman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Narlikar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartholomew, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lorch and Kornberg, 2015</a>). All SWI/SNF complexes are composed of a catalytic subunit, which harbors a superfamily 2 (SF2) ATPase domain, and a variety of accessory subunits (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>). During remodeling, the ATPase domain contacts the nucleosome at an internal site 20 bp from the nucleosome dyad, referred to as the super-helical 2 (SHL2) site, and translocates DNA (<a href=\"#bib46\">Saha et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Saha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zofall et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dechassa et al., 2008</a>).

The isolated catalytic subunit of a SWI/SNF remodeler has been shown to translocate naked DNA (in the absence of a histone octamer) in ~2 bp steps (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sirinakis et al., 2011</a>). However, DNA translocation around the nucleosome by SWI/SNF holoenzyme complexes has been reported to occur in large steps of ~50 bp in size (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zofall et al., 2006</a>). It is unknown whether this 50-bp step represents the fundamental step size of nucleosome translocation by SWI/SNF complexes. The related ISWI-family of chromatin remodelers move DNA in multi-bp compound steps that are composed of 1-bp fundamental steps (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blosser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Deindl et al., 2013</a>). Although the ISWI-family remodelers share a homologous ATPase domain with the SWI/SNF-family remodelers, they differ in both the domains flanking the ATPase domain on their catalytic subunits and the accessory subunits that associate with the catalytic subunits (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>), and they bind the nucleosome differently (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hota and Bartholomew, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dechassa et al., 2012</a>).

These experiments allowed us to observe transient intermediates of the remodeling process and characterize the motion of the DNA at the nucleosomal edges where the DNA moves into and out of the nucleosome.

In the first labeling scheme, the mononucleosome was flanked by a shorter 6 bp linker on one side and a longer 78 bp linker on the other side. The FRET acceptor dye, Cy5, was attached to the end of the shorter linker and a biotin moiety was attached to the end of the longer linker for immobilization on the microscope slide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The histone octamer was labeled with the FRET donor dye, Cy3, on the C-terminal tail of H2A (position 119).

If RSC engages the SHL+2 site, which we define to be the SHL2 site near the longer linker DNA, RSC will translocate DNA toward the shorter linker. Previous studies of SWI/SNF-family remodelers have shown that the enzyme can translocate DNA around the nucleosome until the end of the DNA reaches the SHL2 site, which is ~50 bp past the edge of the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib17\">Flaus and Owen-Hughes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kassabov et al., 2003</a>). Therefore, this type of action should generate a ~130 bp movement of the DNA toward the shorter linker, moving the Cy5 dye away from the Cy3 dye on the octamer and causing a monotonic decrease in FRET. This action will eventually position the Cy5-labeled DNA end &gt;40 nm from the Cy3 label on the H2A, resulting in zero FRET. On the other hand, if RSC engages the SHL\u20132 site, the SHL2 site near the shorter linker DNA, RSC will translocate DNA toward the longer linker, first moving the Cy5 dye closer to the Cy3 dye on the octamer and then further away from the Cy3, causing an initial increase in FRET followed by a decrease. This action will generate a final product where the labeled DNA end resides at the SHL\u20132 site. Based on the crystal structure of the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib33\">Luger et al., 1997</a>), this should place the Cy5 ~6.8 nm from the Cy3 labeling site, giving a low but non-zero FRET value."

                                "text": "Consistent with these expectations, we observed two major classes of single-molecule traces upon addition of RSC and ATP to the nucleosomes. One class of traces showed a monotonic decrease in FRET to zero FRET (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We assigned these traces to the case where the ATPase domain of RSC bound to the\u00a0SHL+2 site\u00a0and translocated the DNA toward the shorter linker. Because the dye labels monitored the dynamics of the DNA end moving away from the octamer, we refer to these traces as monitoring exit-side movement. The second class of traces showed an initial increase in FRET followed by a decrease to a final FRET of ~0.17 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We assigned these traces to the case where the ATPase domain bound to the\u00a0SHL\u20132 site and translocated DNA toward the longer linker, which is expected to first bring the FRET donor and acceptor dyes closer and then move them farther apart. Because the dye labels in these cases monitored the dynamics of the DNA end moving into the nucleosome, we refer to these traces as monitoring entry-side movement. We classified the traces as reflecting entry-side or exit-side movement based on the presence or absence of an initial FRET increase during remodeling and identified a roughly equal number traces showing entry-side and exit-side movement when RSC and ATP were added to the H2A/[end, +6] nucleosome construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This result is consistent with previous results indicating that translocation by SWI/SNF enzymes is bidirectional and does not depend on linker DNA length (<a href=\"#bib17\">Flaus and Owen-Hughes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kassabov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shundrovsky et al., 2006</a>). It has been shown previously that the strength of the histone-DNA contacts between the 601 positioning sequence and the histone octamer is asymmetric with respect to the nucleosomal dyad (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ngo et al., 2015</a>), so we tested whether the fraction of nucleosomes undergoing exit-side or entry-side movement depends on the orientation of the 601 positioning sequence by reversing the 601 sequence on the H2A/[end, +6] nucleosome. We found that the fractions of traces exhibiting entry-side and exit-side movement were essentially identical for the two sequence orientations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the asymmetry of the 601 positioning sequence does not influence the directionality of remodeling by RSC. The overall kinetics of the FRET changes observed in the single-molecule assay were similar to the kinetics observed in solution-based ensemble FRET measurements, indicating that surface attachment did not substantially affect remodeling by RSC (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As expected, no major FRET changes were observed when RSC was added to the nucleosomes in the absence of ATP (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Therefore, placing such a gap at the SHL+2 or SHL\u20132 site (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) should allow us to control the direction of DNA translocation around the nucleosome. After remodeling by RSC, nucleosomes without any ssDNA gap showed two distinct populations of nucleosomes with FRET values of ~0 and ~0.17, corresponding to the products of exit-side and entry-side movement, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). As expected, remodeling of a construct containing a gap at the SHL\u20132 site showed only a single peak at zero FRET after remodeling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), consistent with the gap preventing RSC from engaging the SHL\u20132 site to generate entry-side movement traces. Furthermore, &gt;95% of the remodeling traces from this construct were classified as exit-side movement traces and showed a monotonic FRET decrease without an initial FRET increase (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Similarly, a gap at the\u00a0SHL+2 site\u00a0largely eliminated the zero FRET population and resulted in essentially a single population with a FRET of ~0.14 after remodeling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Only a small fraction (~8%) of nucleosomes showed a final FRET of zero, which is most likely due to photobleaching of the Cy5 dye during remodeling. Moreover, &gt;95% of the traces observed were classified as entry-side movement traces and showed an initial FRET increase during remodeling (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C,D</a>), consistent with the gap preventing RSC from engaging the SHL+2 site and generating exit-side movement traces. These results confirm that the traces classified as reflecting entry-side movement resulted from ATPase action at the SHL\u20132 site and the traces classified as reflecting exit-side movement resulted from ATPase action at the SHL+2 site."

                                "text": "In addition to nucleosome sliding, RSC has been reported to facilitate a number of other changes to the nucleosome, such as ejecting H2A-H2B dimers or the entire histone octamer, but we do not expect to observe these activities in our assay because these activities\u00a0require free nucleosomes or free DNA as acceptors, the activity of histone chaperones, or a dinucleosome construct (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bowman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Becker and Workman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Narlikar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartholomew, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lorch and Kornberg, 2015</a>). Indeed, after incubating the H2A/[end,+6] nucleosomes with 5 nM RSC and 5 \u00b5M ATP for 20 min, &gt;90% of the nucleosomes remained present with the H2A subunit attached, similar to the fraction of nucleosomes remaining intact after incubation in the absence of RSC and ATP (91%). However, because\u00a0RSC could destabilize the H2A-H2B dimer (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lorch et al., 2010</a>), it is possible that RSC may cause transient H2A-H2B dimer displacement during remodeling that contributes to the FRET changes. To investigate whether movement of the H2A-H2B dimer (and hence the Cy3-label on H2A) relative to the rest of the octamer contributed to the FRET changes we observed during RSC remodeling, we took three approaches. First, we created a H3/[end,+6] construct (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) by moving the Cy3 label from the C-terminal tail of histone H2A to the N-terminal tail of histone H3 (position 33). If movement of the H2A-H2B dimer relative to the rest of the octamer was responsible for the FRET changes that we observed on the H2A/[end,+6] construct, we expected that moving the Cy3 dye to histone H3 would eliminate these FRET changes. However, if H2A-H2B dimer dynamics did not contribute the observed FRET changes, the H3-labeled nucleosomes would produce FRET dynamics similar to those observed with the H2A-labeled nucleosomes because the N-terminal tail of histone H3 lies near the C-terminal tail of histone H2A (<a href=\"#bib33\">Luger et al., 1997</a>). Similar to H2A-labeled nucleosomes, remodeling of the H3-labeled nucleosomes also produced two classes of FRET traces, one class showing a monotonic decrease in FRET (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and the other class showing an initial FRET increase followed by a FRET decrease (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). As in the case of the H2A/[end,+6] constructs, placing a gap at the SHL\u20132 site of the H3/[end,+6] nucleosomes eliminated nearly all of the traces showing an initial FRET increase, and placing a gap at the SHL+2 site of the H3/[end,+6] nucleosomes eliminated most of the traces showing a monotonic FRET decrease (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating that these traces reflect entry-side and exit-side movement, respectively. The observation that the FRET changes were similar for the H2A-labeled and H3-labeled nucleosomes suggests that these observed FRET changes were not specific to the dynamics of the H2A-H2B dimer."

We referred to these nucleosomes as H2A/H2A to indicate that both donor and acceptor dyes are on the H2A subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Nucleosomes with a single Cy3 on one of the H2A subunits and a single Cy5 on the other H2A subunit could be readily identified at the single-molecule level and gave FRET ~ 0.6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), whereas nucleosomes lacking a Cy5 showed zero FRET and nucleosomes lacking a Cy3 were not visible under green laser illumination. Addition of RSC and ATP to this H2A/H2A construct resulted in only a small decrease in FRET, \u0394FRET ~0.1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This FRET decrease was partially recapitulated by the addition of enzyme in the absence of ATP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), suggesting that this FRET change was associated, at least in part, with RSC binding. Furthermore, this apparent FRET change was due almost entirely to an increase in Cy3 fluorescence without a corresponding decrease in Cy5 fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), suggesting that this apparent FRET change was probably due to a change in the photophysical properties of the Cy3 dye upon RSC binding rather than a <i>bona fide</i> change in distance between the dyes. Even if the FRET change was in part due to a dye-to-dye distance change, the small magnitude of this change was not sufficient to explain the much larger changes in FRET observed with the H2A/[end,+6] and H3/[end,+6] constructs during remodeling."

To address this possibility, we moved the dye label to histone H2B at position 49, which resides within the globular domain of the histone. We first reconstituted a H2B/H2B nucleosomal construct containing a mixture of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled H2B on unlabeled DNA, as we did for the H2A/H2A construct. We identified nucleosomes containing a Cy3 dye on one H2B subunit and a Cy5 dye on the other H2B subunit by selecting those nucleosomes with a finite FRET value (FRET~0.2), again because nucleosomes lacking a Cy5 showed zero FRET and nucleosomes lacking a Cy3 were not visible under green laser illumination. The FRET values of these H2B/H2B nucleosomes did not change appreciably after addition of RSC and ATP (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Next, to observe the remodeling behavior of the nucleosomes with H2B-labeled octamer, we constructed a H2B/[end,+0] nucleosome, containing Cy3 on the <i>H2B</i> subunit (position 49) and a Cy5 at the 5\u2019 <i>end</i> of the DNA, positioned at the edge of the nucleosome (the <i>+0</i> position) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Upon addition of RSC and ATP to the H2B/[end,+0] nucleosomes, we again observed both exit-side and entry-side movement traces (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>) resembling those obtained with the H2A- and H3-labeled nucleosomes. The H2B/[end,+0] nucleosomes showed a preference for entry-side remodeling (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), perhaps because the label biased binding of RSC in the orientation supporting entry-side remodeling. However, control constructs with gaps at the SHL\u20132 or SHL+2 site eliminated nearly all of the entry-side or exit-side movement traces, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), confirming our assignment of entry-side and exit-side movement traces."

Furthermore, when we placed both Cy3 and Cy5 dyes on the H2A-H2B dimer, we did not observe\u00a0substantial motion of the H2A-H2B dimer with two different positions of the dye (on H2A or H2B). However, our data cannot exclude the possibility of smaller-scale movement of the H2A-H2B dimer, not detectable by our FRET assay, that could disrupt important histone-histone or histone-DNA contacts during remodeling."

                                "text": "Next, we asked if RSC induces large-amplitude unwrapping of DNA at the edges of the nucleosome. We separately considered this possibility for the two edges of the nucleosome where DNA enters or exits the nucleosome. At the nucleosomal edge where DNA enters the nucleosome, translocation of the DNA along its canonical path on the nucleosome would be expected to produce a FRET increase as the Cy5 at the end of linker DNA moves toward the edge of nucleosome, followed by a FRET decrease as the Cy5 moves along the nucleosome surface toward the SHL\u20132 site. On the other hand, if RSC were to unwrap a substantial amount of DNA and lift the DNA off the nucleosomal surface by a large distance, as expected if the unwrapped DNA extended from the nucleosome in a unbent fashion, we would expect the FRET traces to exhibit a FRET decrease as the Cy5 dye on the linker DNA moves away from the nucleosome, where the Cy3 dye resides. The entry-side movement traces that we observed showed a substantial increase in FRET followed by a FRET decrease for both H2A/[end, +6] and H3/[end, +6] constructs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which was consistent with movement largely along or near the canonical path at the nucleosome edge where DNA enters the nucleosome. This phenomenon was also seen for constructs with increased linker DNA length, such as the H2A/[end,+11] and H3/[end,+9] constructs, where the Cy5 dye-labeled DNA end was initially 11 bp and 9 bp away from the nucleosome edge (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). As described above, similar entry-side movement traces were also observed for the H2B/[end,+0] construct, in which the Cy3 label resides inside the globular domain of histone H2B instead of on the flexible tail of histone H2A (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Some of these entry-side movement traces also showed a small apparent decrease in FRET (\u0394FRET ~ 0.1) prior to the FRET increase, but this apparent FRET decrease resulted primarily from an increase in Cy3 intensity without a corresponding decrease in Cy5 intensity (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A-F</a>). The magnitude of this Cy3 intensity change was consistent with the changes seen when we labeled the two H2A subunits on the octamer with Cy3 and Cy5 (i.e. the H2A/H2A construct) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), suggesting that this FRET change likely resulted from a change in the photophysical properties of the Cy3 dye upon RSC binding. Even if these initial FRET decreases reflected a real change in distance between the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes, the magnitude of the FRET change, \u0394FRET ~ 0.1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D-F</a>), was much smaller than both the FRET changes that we observed for RSC-induced DNA translocation around the nucleosome and the FRET changes previously observed for transcription factor-mediated DNA unwrapping from the edge of the nucleosome (\u0394FRET ~ 0.6) on a similarly labeled nucleosome construct (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li and Widom, 2004</a>). Assuming a previously measured F\u00f6rster radius of 6 nm for the Cy3-Cy5 pair (<a href=\"#bib36\">Murphy et al., 2004</a>), these small initial FRET decreases that we observed would correspond to a change in the Cy3-Cy5 distance of only ~0.5 nm. Thus, our data suggest that under our remodeling conditions, the DNA was not lifted by a large distance away from the nucleosomal surface and did not deviate substantially from its canonical wrapping path as it entered the nucleosome."

                                "text": "In order to determine whether the DNA was unwrapped and lifted by a large distance off the nucleosomal surface at the nucleosomal edge where DNA exits, our current labeling scheme was not adequate since both lifting of DNA off the nucleosomal surface and translocation of DNA along the canonical path on the nucleosome would generate a decrease in FRET. We therefore moved the Cy5 label from the end of the DNA to a site 15 bp inside the edge of nucleosomes by incorporating the dye into the sugar-phosphate backbone to generate H2A/[backbone, \u201315] nucleosomes, where H2A again indicates the position of the Cy3 label and [backbone, \u201315] indicates the position of the Cy5 label (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). If RSC translocates the DNA around the nucleosome along its canonical path, the exit-side movement traces should show an initial FRET increase as the Cy5 moves toward the nucleosome edge, followed by a FRET decrease as the Cy5 exits the nucleosome. In contrast, lifting the DNA by a large distance off the nucleosome surface should produce a substantial FRET decrease, as this structural change would move the Cy5 dye on the DNA farther away from the Cy3 dye on the octamer, assuming that the unwrapped DNA remains largely unbent. Addition of RSC and ATP to this construct again generated two classes of traces: exit-side movement traces showing a transient increase in FRET followed by a decrease to zero FRET (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and entry-side movement traces showing a decrease in FRET to ~0.23 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Without any ssDNA gap on the nucleosome, the FRET traces of the H2A/[backbone, \u201315] construct preferentially showed entry-side movement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), likely because placing the Cy5 inside the nucleosome biased RSC to bind in the orientation that positioned the ATPase at the SHL\u20132 site. Nevertheless, when we introduced a 2-nt ssDNA gap at the SHL\u20132 site, nearly all of the traces showed the exit-side movement behavior, displaying an initial increase in FRET followed the decrease to zero FRET; when a 2-nt ssDNA gap was introduced at the SHL+2 site, nearly all of the traces showed the entry-side movement behavior, displaying only a monotonic decrease in FRET (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These experiments confirm that the traces showing the initial FRET increase followed by a FRET decrease resulted from ATPase action at the SHL+2 site and thus represented exit-side movement. Because lifting of the\u00a0DNA by a large distance\u00a0away from the nucleosomal surface would have caused a FRET decrease instead of an initial FRET increase, our data suggest that the DNA was not lifted away from the nucleosome surface by a large distance and did not deviate substantially from its canonical path as it exited the nucleosome."

To determine the step size of DNA translocation at the nucleosomal edge where DNA exits the nucleosome, we first monitored remodeling of the H2A/[end,+6] nucleosomes at 20\u00b0C (as opposed to 30\u00b0C in the previous experiments) with 2 \u00b5M ATP in order to slow the remodeling reaction and better resolve the translocation steps. The exit-side movement traces exhibited intermittent pauses interrupting the monotonic decrease to zero FRET (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and we applied a step-finding algorithm based on chi-square minimization (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kerssemakers et al., 2006</a>) to identify the location of the pauses and the sizes of the steps. The step size histogram showed a distribution of step sizes with a major peak centered at a \u0394FRET of 0.1 and a tail extending to larger \u0394FRET values (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Using an alternative, hidden Markov model (HMM)-based algorithm (<a href=\"#bib35\">McKinney et al., 2006</a>), we identified similar steps in the FRET traces and produced a similar step size histogram, again with the major peak centered at a \u0394FRET of 0.1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We note that our results cannot completely exclude the possibility that a small fraction of nucleosomes undergo large-step movement that brings the FRET to zero in a single step as these traces would not be distinguishable from Cy5 photobleaching. However, during remodeling of the H2A/[backbone,\u201315] construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), where exit-side movement led to an increase in FRET that can be distinguished from\u00a0Cy5 photobleaching, the vast majority (85%) of the exit-side movement traces showed gradual FRET changes inconsistent with such\u00a0large step sizes, suggesting that at most a small fraction of nucleosomes could remodel with such large-step movement."

To calibrate the FRET changes associated with moving the DNA along its canonical path, we positioned Cy5 at the end of the linker DNA and varied the linker DNA length (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, blue histograms). Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blosser et al., 2009</a>), these measurements showed an approximately linear relationship between the linker DNA length and the observed FRET value over the measured range with a slope of 0.053 \u00b1 0.004 bp<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, blue).

Although these data could reflect a heterogeneous step size, the distribution could also result from movement with a single step size, where the larger steps represented the sum of two or more steps where the intervening pause(s) were too short to detect. To test whether our data were consistent with such a model, we took advantage of the linear dependence of FRET on the linker DNA length and fit our data to a series of evenly spaced Gaussian peaks whose amplitude decreased by a factor of <i>f</i> from the previous peak, representing the probability of missing a step (see Materials and methods). The data derived from the step-finding algorithm based on chi-square minimization are consistent with a step size of \u0394FRET = 0.104 \u00b1 0.002 with a probability of missing a step being <i>f</i> = 34% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

Given the similar results from the two analysis methods, we used only the chi-square-minimization-based step-finding algorithm in subsequent analyses. The probabilities of missing a step obtained from these fits are reasonable given that the steps occur stochastically, and many pauses could be too short to be observed. Based on the distribution of observed pause durations, we would expect a 25% probability of missing a step due to our limited time resolution (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The observed probability of missing a step was moderately\u00a0larger than that expected from our time resolution limitation, suggesting the possibility of additional mechanisms for missing steps, for example, successive DNA translocation steps generated by the ATPase at the SHL2 site merging together while transiting to the edge of the nucleosome."

Calibration curves for these two labeling schemes showed that the slopes of the FRET versus linker DNA length were 0.059 \u00b1 0.005 bp<sup>\u22121</sup> and 0.057 \u00b1 0.002 bp<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C-F</a>, blue). Like for the H2A/[end, +6] construct, these values did not change appreciably in the presence of a bound RSC enzyme (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C-F</a>, red). The exit-side movement traces of these new constructs also showed stepwise DNA translocation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>), and the step size distributions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,F</a>) showed a major peak around a \u0394FRET of 0.1 with a tail extending to larger values. Fitting these histograms to multiple Gaussian peaks as described earlier indicated that the distributions were consistent with\u00a0a step size of \u0394FRET = 0.113 \u00b1 0.003 with a missed step probability of <i>f</i> = 34% for H3/[end, +6] and \u0394FRET = 0.092 \u00b1 0.004 and <i>f</i> = 42% for H2A/[backbone,+6] (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>). Comparing the \u0394FRET values to the slopes of the calibration curves gave step size estimates of 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 bp and 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 bp for the H3/[end, +6] and H2A/[backbone, +6] constructs, respectively, consistent with the 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 bp step size estimate for the H2A/[end, +6] construct. Again, because some of the estimated missed step probabilities were moderately larger than would be expected based on our time resolution (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), the DNA may have occasionally exited the nucleosome with larger step sizes."

In the experiments that characterized the step sizes of exit-side motion, the dye-labeled linker DNA was \u201cupstream\u201d (to the left) of the 601 sequence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C,E</a>), so exit-side movement traces resulted from ATPase action at the SHL+2 site. To maintain the same direction of DNA translocation around the nucleosome but move the dye locations to monitor the movement of DNA into the nucleosome, we made H2A/[end, +12] and H3/[end, +9] constructs where the dye-labeled linker DNA lied \u201cdownstream\u201d (to the right) of the 601 sequence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The entry-side movement traces measured at 2 \u00b5M ATP primarily showed an increase in FRET as expected from the movement of the short linker DNA into the nucleosome, bringing the Cy5 dye closer to Cy3. As before, the entry-side movement traces showed an initial, small apparent decrease in FRET before the major FRET increase, likely due to the photophysical effect on the dye upon enzyme binding (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The FRET increase occurred in a stepwise manner, indicating stepwise DNA translocation into the nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The distributions of the \u0394FRET step sizes again showed a major peak around ~0.1 with a tail extending to larger values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Fitting to multiple evenly spaced Gaussian peaks as described earlier yielded a step size of \u0394FRET = 0.088 \u00b1 0.002 with a missed step probability of <i>f</i> = 22% for the H2A/[end, +12] construct and \u0394FRET = 0.084 \u00b1 0.001 and <i>f</i> = 17% for the H3/[end, +9] construct (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Assuming that the DNA moved along the canonical nucleosomal wrapping path as it entered the nucleosome, we constructed calibration curves for the two labeling schemes by varying the initial linker DNA lengths and measured slopes of the FRET change versus linker DNA length to be 0.055 \u00b1 0.002 bp<sup>\u22121</sup> for the H2A/[end, +12] construct and 0.048 \u00b1 0.004 bp<sup>\u22121</sup> for the H3/[end, +9] construct, which again did not change appreciably in the presence of bound enzyme (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Based on these slopes, the step size distributions were consistent with\u00a0step sizes of\u00a01.6 \u00b1 0.1 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 bp, respectively, for these constructs."

At the nucleosome edges where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, RSC did not lift the DNA by a large distance away from the nucleosomal surface, and our data are consistent with translocation of the DNA largely along or close to the canonical nucleosomal wrapping path. In some cases, we observed a small FRET decrease preceding DNA translocation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that was likely due to changes in the photophysical properties of Cy3 upon enzyme binding. Similarly, constructs designed to report on the dynamics of the H2A-H2B dimer showed no FRET change or a small apparent FRET change likely due to photophysical changes of Cy3 upon enzyme binding. Even if these FRET changes were due to actual distance changes, rather than photophysical changes of the dye, they would still represent minor deviations (~0.5 nm) of DNA from the canonical wrapping path around the octamer or slight repositioning of the H2A-H2B dimer relative to the rest of the octamer. However, because lifting the DNA from the surface of the octamer or displacing the H2A-H2B dimer even by this small distance could disrupt many histone-DNA or histone-histone\u00a0contacts, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed translocation of DNA around the nucleosome is associated with the disruption of a substantial number of histone-DNA or histone-histone\u00a0contacts (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lorch et al., 2010</a>). In other words, it is possible that RSC causes DNA unwrapping or lifting of the DNA off the nucleosome, but still holds the unwrapped/lifted DNA near the surface of the nucleosome. However, such a small-distance motion would have only a minor effect on our measured FRET signal. These results are also consistent with an electron microscopy structure of the RSC complex, which suggests a tight fit of the nucleosome in the central cavity of the remodeler that would not seem to accommodate large-scale displacement of DNA from the nucleosome surface (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leschziner et al., 2007</a>)."

We observed a step size distribution that peaked at a step size\u00a0of ~1\u20132 bp both for entry-side and exit-side movement though movements with larger step sizes were also observed. Even if the motion of the DNA is not exactly along the canonical path, the small \u0394FRET step sizes of 0.08\u20130.11 that we observed in the single-nucleosome remodeling traces likely correspond to a distance change of ~0.3\u20130.6 nm (assuming a previously measured F\u00f6rster radius of 6 nm for the Cy3-Cy5 FRET pair (<a href=\"#bib36\">Murphy et al., 2004</a>)). Based on the geometry of our labeling schemes and the crystal structure of nucleosomes containing the 601 positioning sequence (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chua et al., 2012</a>), translocation by 1 bp should be associated with changes to the Cy3-Cy5 distance of ~0.3 nm on average, so our data are again consistent with a DNA translocation step size of ~1\u20132 bp. Although changes to the photophysical properties of the dyes or the relative orientation of the dyes could potentially affect our interpretation of the FRET changes, many of these effects would be expected to depend on the specific labeling scheme. The fact that we observed similar step-size histograms\u00a0with several different attachment sites of the Cy5 dye on the DNA and different attachment sites of the Cy3 dye on the octamer suggests that the measured step sizes likely reflect the true translocation step sizes of DNA around the nucleosome during RSC-catalyzed remodeling. It has been shown previously that some SF2 ATPase-containing DNA translocases or helicases translocate DNA in 1 bp increments (<a href=\"#bib37\">Myong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gu and Rice, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rajagopal et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Deindl et al., 2013</a>), so the SF2 ATPase domain of RSC might also translocate DNA at the SHL2 site of the nucleosome in 1 bp steps. The reason that the step sizes that we observed for RSC-mediated nucleosome translocation at the nucleosomal edges were not exactly 1 bp could potentially be due to the following reasons: 1) missing steps due to our limited time resolution could cause two consecutive 1 bp steps to appear as a 2 bp step, 2) two 1 bp DNA distortions generated at the SHL2 site could merge together while transiting to the entry/exit site, and 3) the DNA translocation path could deviate slightly from the canonical wrapping path, making our calibration, which was determined based on canonically wrapped nucleosomes, slightly off."

                        "text": "It has been shown previously that RSC translocates DNA at the SHL2 site where the enzyme\u2019s ATPase domain engages the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib46\">Saha et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Saha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zofall et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dechassa et al., 2008</a>) and that the isolated RSC catalytic subunit translocates naked DNA in ~2 bp increments (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sirinakis et al., 2011</a>). Based on these previous findings, it is reasonable to expect that the RSC complex may translocate DNA around the nucleosome in 1\u20132 bp steps, as has been proposed before (<a href=\"#bib47\">Saha et al., 2005</a>). However, such small steps had not been previously observed during nucleosome remodeling by SWI/SNF enzymes, so it was unclear whether the small DNA translocation step size by the ATPase at the SHL2 site would result in small DNA movement steps around the nucleosome, especially given that the entry and exit sites of nucleosome reside ~50 and 100 bp away from the SHL2 site. Indeed, in the context of remodeling intact nucleosomes, a previous biochemical study showed that SWI/SNF complexes translocate DNA around the nucleosome in large, ~50 bp steps (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zofall et al., 2006</a>). Because our current observations suggest that RSC translocates DNA around the nucleosome primarily in steps of 1\u20132 bp, the previously observed ~50 bp translocation steps likely do not reflect the fundamental step size of nucleosome translocation by RSC. Rather, they may be compound steps composed of many ~1\u20132 bp steps and may reflect relatively long kinetic pauses of DNA translocation imposed by the energy landscape of the nucleosomal substrates. However, we note that because the cavities in the RSC and SWI/SNF complexes that accommodate nucleosomes appear somewhat different (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leschziner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chaban et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dechassa et al., 2008</a>), it is possible that SWI/SNF and RSC do not translocate DNA around the nucleosome in exactly the same manner. Furthermore, it is also worth noting that our measurements were performed at limiting ATP concentrations, up to roughly the K<sub>m</sub> value for ATP (~80 \u00b5M) of RSC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cairns et al., 1996</a>), and it is possible that at higher ATP concentrations, other processes could become rate limiting and alter the behavior of the complex. Nevertheless, the behavior at limiting ATP concentrations likely reflects the response of the nucleosome to the individual translocation events catalyzed by the ATPase at the SHL2 site."

Because we tracked the motion of the DNA only at the nucleosomal edges, our data cannot determine whether an intranucleosomal loop or bulge was formed inside the nucleosome. If such loops exist,\u00a0our observations of the small step sizes of DNA translocation at both entry and exit sites of the nucleosome place constraints on such internal DNA loops/bulges: these loops/bulges are either small and most often\u00a0contain 1\u20132 bp of extra DNA; or if they are not so\u00a0small, they must accumulate and release gradually, primarily\u00a01\u20132 bp at a time at the nucleosome entry and exit sites, which would require a specific mechanism to extrude a large internal loop to the exit side in small steps."

For both enzyme families, the observed nucleosome translocation step sizes likely resulted from the intrinsic DNA translocation step size of their ATPase domains, which both\u00a0belong to the SF2 helicase family. However, it has been shown previously that the SWI/SNF-family remodelers disrupt the DNA-octamer contacts to a much greater extent than the ISWI-family remodelers (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dechassa et al., 2012</a>). Our results suggest that, despite such disruption, the RSC enzyme likely still holds the DNA close to the nucleosome and hence, such disruption does not strongly perturb the step sizes with which DNA is translocated across the nucleosome."

Notably, these same groups have previously used this same method to probe remodeling by ISWI-like enzymes. The authors report that RSC, like ISWI, appears to translocate DNA in 1-2 bp steps from both the entry and exit DNA positions. By using different locations for the FRET probes, the authors present evidence that DNA translocation does not grossly displace DNA from the H2A C-terminal tail or the H3-N-terminal tail suggesting that DNA is not displaced at the entry/exit positions of the nucleosome. The authors also do not see loss of the H2A-C-terminal tail from DNA during remodeling, suggesting that the H2A/H2B dimer is not displaced."

The work provides the clearest and most direct evidence to date for the step size and DNA path on nucleosomes; the use of 1-2 bp steps, and that this 1-2 bp DNA wave/loop likely follows a generally canonical path around the nucleosome.

This is a main criticism of the work. Since this argument is central to the conclusions of the manuscript (it also affects interpretation of the stepping data), the authors should devote more text to strengthening it. In this regard, one surprising result presented here is that RSC remodeling appears to be identical to ISWI, using this particular FRET assay. There are a host of studies demonstrating that RSC-like enzymes are more disruptive to nucleosomes than ISWI. Thus, it seems that this assay is unable to detect key aspects of the remodeling reaction. Notably, the authors' assay only monitors DNA translocation at the extreme nucleosome edge. What happens elsewhere on the nucleosome is invisible. For instance, it remains a possibility that RSC and ISWI both draw in DNA at the nucleosome edge (1-2 bp per steps), but for RSC this DNA would then be extruded into a large, constrained loop on the nucleosome surface. Such a dramatic structure would be undetectable in this assay. It was surprising that the authors had no discussion of the similarities between ISWI and RSC using this assay \u2013 perhaps because the results are inconsistent with so many other studies. Perhaps the authors can investigate loops by looking at the timing of exit/entry DNA translocation as they did for ISWI-like enzymes previously."

These are key conclusions, as they are the only ones that really speak to the novelty of this work (other studies have already dealt with step size). These conclusions are much too strong and not supported well by data. The authors do not actually probe the octamer surface. All histone FRET probes are present on either the start of the H3 N-terminal domain (residue 33), or the H2A C-terminal domain (residue 119). Both residues lie within a basic patch of amino acids that make contact with entry/exit DNA. Thus, the experiments only show that the H3 or H2A tails do not dissociate from entry/exit DNA. It is possible that these regions may remain associated with DNA even if it is displaced from the octamer, and the authors may be missing this event. FRET probes should be placed on solvent expose octamer surfaces that are not part of flexible domains."

Previously studies from the Narlikar lab, as well as in the previous single molecule studies from Bustamonte, showed that ATP concentration as a large impact on pausing events between bursts of translocation. The worry is that very low ATP concentrations may change the rate-limiting step of the reaction, leading to aberrant step sizes that are normally not a part of the reaction. The authors should investigate the impact of ATP concentration on their results. The authors should also comment on why some experiments utilize 5 micromolar ATP (single traces), but others use 20 micromolar (ensemble reactions or pooling of traces)."

Both of those papers interpret and favor that model, and that model has been featured in major reviews.

This statement is not quite as obvious as stated. This claim seems highly dependent on the geometry of the DNA-nucleosome complex (e.g. the locations of the nucleosome and DNA fluorescence labels) and seems to assume that the unpeeled DNA is fully extended. One could imagine situations where the unpeeled DNA contributes very little to the FRET or could even increase FRET, especially if the DNA end can bend (or loop) back on itself. This will obviously depend on the length / flexibility of DNA. As this is an important point of the manuscript that affects subsequent data interpretation, the authors should devote more effort to clarifying it and supporting it with more quantitative arguments."

These conclusions are much too strong and not supported well by data. The authors do not actually probe the octamer surface. All histone FRET probes are present on either the start of the H3 N-terminal domain (residue 33), or the H2A C-terminal domain (residue 119). Both residues lie within a basic patch of amino acids that make contact with entry/exit DNA. Thus, the experiments only show that the H3 or H2A tails do not dissociate from entry/exit DNA. It is possible that these regions may remain associated with DNA even if it is displaced from the octamer, and the authors may be missing this event. FRET probes should be placed on solvent expose octamer surfaces that are not part of flexible domains.</i> "

Upon addition of RSC and ATP, we did not observe any FRET change, suggesting that the H2A-H2B dimer is not substantially displaced from the nucleosome during remodeling, consistent with the results we obtained for the H2A/H2A construct. 2) The H2B/[end, +0] construct, containing Cy3 on the H2B subunit and a Cy5 at the 5\u2019 end of the DNA. Upon addition of RSC and ATP, this new construct again showed entry-side and exit-side movement traces similar to those observed from the H2A/[end, +6] construct (with the Cy3 on the H2A subunit and the Cy5 near the 5\u2019 end of the DNA) and the H3/[end, +6] construct (with the Cy3 on the H3 subunit and the Cy5 near the 5\u2019 end of the DNA).

Previously, a ~2 bp translocation step size has been observed for the isolated catalytic subunit of RSC translocating on naked DNA without octamer (Sirinakis, et al., 2011), but such small step sizes have not been previously observed in the context of full SWI/SNF-remodeling complexes acting on intact nucleosomes. Indeed, before our study, it was unclear whether the RSC complex would translocate DNA across the nucleosome with a similar step size. In fact, a previous biochemical study showed that a similar SWI/SNF complex translocates DNA around the nucleosome in large, ~50 bp steps (Zofall, et al., 2006). Our current observations suggest that RSC translocates DNA around the nucleosome in 1-2 bp steps, at both nucleosomes edges where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome. Thus, our results suggests that the previously observed, large ~50 bp translocation steps likely do not reflect the fundamental step size of nucleosome translocation by RSC. Rather, they may be compound steps composed of many 1-2 bp steps and reflect relatively long kinetic pauses of DNA translocation imposed by the energy landscape of the nucleosomal substrates."

Although they provide an estimated bound of 0.5 nm from FRET, this seems to refer to inter-dye distance, which is not necessarily the same as the contour length of DNA lifted (especially if bending/looping is considered).</i> Based on the crystal structure of the nucleosome, breaking the outermost histone-DNA contacts at SHL \u00b1 6.5 should induce a ~ 1 nm motion of the DNA end from the histone H2A labeling site in the H2A/[end, +6] construct, so unwrapping of DNA from the extreme ends of the nucleosome should be visible. However, this estimate indeed assumes that the unwrapped DNA stays fully extended, which is reasonable for unconstrained DNA given the ~ 150 bp persistence length of DNA. Nevertheless, because protein-DNA interactions can substantially alter the flexibility of DNA, we agree with the reviewers that we cannot exclude models where the remodeler has disrupted a substantially number of histone-DNA contacts simultaneously but still holds the unpeeled DNA near the octamer surface at the entry/exit sites of the nucleosome. We have mentioned this possibility in our original manuscript and have now made this point clearer in the revised manuscript, both in the Results section (subsection \u201cProbing for potential DNA unwrapping at the edge of the nucleosome\u201d, last paragraph) and in the Discussion section (second paragraph), as we also detailed in our response to the first part of comment 1."

Moreover, even if the movement of the DNA deviates from the canonical path, the small FRET changes that we observed in each step (~0.08 \u2013 0.11) are consistent with the distance changes (~0.3 \u2013 0.6 nm) expected for 1-2 bp of translocation, as we discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion. These estimates are fairly robust to changes in the path of the DNA, and unwrapping of the DNA from the edge of the nucleosome (assuming no sharp kinks in the unwrapped DNA) does not substantially change the estimate of 0.3 nm/bp of translocation."
