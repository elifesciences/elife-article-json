Identification of a switch gene for a dimorphism recently confirmed the link between developmental switches and microevolutionary divergence (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ragsdale et al., 2013</a>), although insights from genetic mechanisms have yet to be put into a macroevolutionary context. For example, whether plasticity accelerates evolution by allowing faster evolutionary responses (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baldwin, 1896</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Waddington, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Suzuki and Nijhout, 2006</a>) or hinders it by allowing adaptation without the need for genetic assimilation (<a href=\"#bib79\">Williams, 1966</a>) is still a matter of debate (e.g., <a href=\"#bib14\">de Jong, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wund, 2012</a>). To know the macroevolutionary potential of developmental plasticity, objectively measured plastic traits must be compared by deep taxon sampling in a robust phylogenetic framework. Here, we test the role of developmental plasticity in evolutionary tempo and novelty by measuring change in feeding structures in a group of 90 nematodes, including <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, of which some species show a mouthpart polyphenism, moveable teeth, and predatory feeding. As a result we identified both the gain and loss of a developmental dimorphism to be associated with rapid evolutionary diversification. We made the surprising finding that whereas the appearance of polyphenism coincided with increased complexity and evolutionary rates, these rates were even higher after the assimilation of a single phenotype."

The latter adaptation is found in the genetic model <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i> and other nematodes of the family Diplogastridae, in which cuticularized teeth and predation are sometimes associated with a dimorphism (<a href=\"#bib24\">F\u00fcrst von Lieven and Sudhaus, 2000</a>). Dimorphic species execute either a \u2018narrow-mouthed\u2019 (stenostomatous, St) or \u2018wide-mouthed\u2019 (eurystomatous, Eu) morph, which differ in the size, shape, and complexity of their mouthparts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In <i>P. pacificus</i>, the St and Eu morphs are advantageous for feeding on bacteria and nematode prey, respectively (<a href=\"#bib65\">Serobyan et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2014</a>). The dimorphism results from an irreversible decision during development, enabling a rapid optimization of morphology to the environment (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bento et al., 2010</a>). This response is mediated by small-molecule pheromones (e.g., dasc#1, ascr#1) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bose et al., 2012</a>), endocrine signaling (dafachronic acid-DAF-12) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bento et al., 2010</a>), and a switch mechanism executed by the sulfatase EUD-1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ragsdale et al., 2013</a>)."

Because our analysis included many taxa previously not analyzed by any molecular characters, newly inferred and highly supported relationships among taxa allowed robust inferences of ancestral states.

Using the inferred phylogenies we measured the rate of change in shape and form (PC1) as a Brownian rate parameter under one-, two-, and three-rate parameter models (<a href=\"#bib47\">O'Meara et al., 2006</a>). We found that the two-rate model that approximated different rate parameters for non-diplogastrid Rhabditina and Diplogastridae was favored over the single-rate model for both form (\u0394AICc = 5.34; p = 0.01, likelihood ratio test) and shape (\u0394AICc = 11.71; p &lt; 0.001), with rates in Diplogastridae being higher (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1F,G</a>). Furthermore, a three-rate model that assumed a different rate parameter for each of the three nematode groups had the greatest fit compared with either a single-rate model (\u0394AICc = 9.18, p = 0.038 for form; \u0394AICc = 14.79, p &lt; 0.001 for shape) or a model that assigned a different rate category to dimorphic diplogastrids (\u0394AICc = 9.32, p &lt; 0.01 for form; \u0394AICc = 15.27, p &lt; 0.001 for shape), and rates in monomorphic Diplogastridae were the highest (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). For form evolution in particular, a two-rate model that assumed a different rate parameter for monomorphic Diplogastridae was a better fit than all other models, including that with a single category for Diplogastridae (\u0394AICc = 5.23). Congruent with these results, a comparison of posterior densities of rate estimates from the Bayesian sampling of a multirate Brownian-motion process (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eastman et al., 2011</a>), which were extracted for individual nematode groups, indicated elevated rates of evolution in Diplogastridae relative to non-diplogastrid Rhabditina, with rates in secondarily monomorphic lineages being the fastest (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1H</a>).

We then tested for phylogenetic correlations of this complexity index with the presence of plasticity. Plasticity was strongly correlated with greater complexity, as shown by their covariance tested either under the threshold model (<a href=\"#bib22\">Felsenstein, 2012</a>) (r = 0.78, confidence interval 0.57\u20130.93) or a constant-variance random-walk model (r = 0.45; log Bayes factor = 20).

They are also congruent with a simple model for the role of plasticity in this process. First, the appearance of bimodal plasticity coincides with a burst of complexity and increase in evolutionary tempo. By this model, developmental plasticity can facilitate novel structures and their associated developmental networks (<a href=\"#bib78\">West-Eberhard, 2003</a>), as well as new complexity in behavioral or enzymatic function, thereby providing additional substrate for future selection. Following this macroevolutionary \u2018pulse\u2019 of plasticity, the secondary loss of plasticity is accompanied by a decrease in complexity but a strong acceleration of measured evolutionary rates, which in our study were most pronounced in form change. The surprising limitation of rates in dimorphic relative to secondarily monomorphic lineages might be explained in part by genetic correlation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cheverud, 1996</a>), or the inability of overlapping genetic programs controlling alternative phenotypes to completely dissociate. We speculate that, where correlated morphologies were initially governed by a dimorphism, assimilation of a single morph would then give the freedom for single phenotypes to specialize and diversify, a phenomenon proposed as developmental \u2018character release\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib77\">West-Eberhard, 1986</a>)."

This possibility might be realized through the following scenario. If populations experience fluctuating environments and alternative mouth morphologies confer fitness advantages in those environments, then environmental sensitivity (i.e., plasticity) will be maintained (<a href=\"#bib44\">Moran, 1992</a>). The presence of plasticity necessarily leads to relaxed selection on genes underlying the production of either trait, particularly those downstream of a developmental switch, facilitating the accumulation of genetic variation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Van Dyken and Wade, 2010</a>). If populations then encounter a stable, predictable environment, promoting the loss of plasticity (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schwander and Leimar, 2011</a>), this variation can be selected and refined by constitutively exposing a single morph to that environment. This would allow more rapid evolution of novel phenotypes than would be possible through the generation and selection of new genetic variation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barrett and Schluter, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lande, 2009</a>), thereby allowing rapid shifts to alternative niches such as novel diets (<a href=\"#bib38\">Led\u00f3n-Rettig et al., 2010</a>). Combined with the ability of fixed morphs to more efficiently reach their fitness optima as permitted by character release, variation accumulated during periods of plasticity would thus enable rapid phenotypic specialization and diversification. Although accelerated rates of divergence due to built-up variation and character release should ultimately decline in monomorphic lineages (<a href=\"#bib78\">West-Eberhard, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lande, 2009</a>), the net result would be an extreme radiation of forms, as has occurred in diplogastrid nematodes."

The degree to which the correlations observed are due to causation is presently unclear, although recent mechanistic advances in <i>P. pacificus</i> demonstrate the promise of functional genetic studies to test the causality of rapidly selected genes directly. Further work might also reveal that additional underlying causes, such as previously unseen ecological opportunities or selective pressures, may have jointly led to both complexity and plasticity. However, the simplicity of our results makes our proposed model sufficient to explain the observed correlations. We therefore hypothesize that developmental plasticity is required to cross a threshold of complexity that affords the degrees of freedom necessary for further diversification of form, and even after the assimilation of monomorphy this diversification can continue to be realized. The difference in rates between ancestrally and secondarily monomorphic lineages suggest a deciding role for a history of plasticity in diversification. It is possible that the processes inferred to accompany the gain of plasticity apply also to other systems with taxonomically widespread polyphenism, which sometimes likewise show a general coincidence of plasticity and diversity (e.g., <a href=\"#bib21\">Emlen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pfennig and McGee, 2010</a>). In principle, the model we propose can be generalized to other systems through dense taxon sampling, a resolved phylogeny, and quantification of alternative morphologies."

Rhabditidae were sampled such that they spanned all major clades of that group as identified in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiontke et al., 2007</a>): the <i>Mesorhabditis</i> group and non-<i>Mesorhabditis</i> \u2018pleiorhabditids\u2019; <i>Caenorhabditis</i>, the four deepest lineages of the <i>Rhabditis</i> group, and the remaining two deepest lineages of \u2018eurhabditids\u2019; <i>Rhabditoides inermis</i>, a possible immediate outgroup to Diplogastridae; <i>Poikilolaimus</i>, the putative sister group to all other Rhabditidae and nested taxa. Three Clade IV (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blaxter et al., 1998</a>) nematode species were included as outgroups in the dataset."

Genes of interest were amplified individually, and sequencing reactions were performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mayer et al., 2009</a>). Sequences were assembled using Geneious 6.1.4. Sequences for 18S, 28S, ribosomal protein, and RNA polymerase II genes, which were either original in this study or retrieved from public databases, were included for non-diplogastrid Rhabditina and outgroups. 18S and 28S rRNA sequences were aligned using the E-INS-I algorithm and default settings in MAFFT 7.1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Katoh and Standley, 2013</a>). Alignments were manually refined, and poorly aligned regions were eliminated manually. Alignments of 18S and 28S rRNA genes were 1598 and 3155 bp long, respectively, and included 859 and 1616 parsimony-informative sites. Sequences of each of the 11 ribosomal protein genes were aligned individually using default settings in Muscle 3.8 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Edgar, 2004</a>) and were realigned by predicted translation; alignments were manually refined and stop-codon sites removed. The concatenated alignment of 11 ribosomal protein genes was 5475 bp long and included 2970 parsimony-informative positions. Aligned sequences for Diplogastridae contained 444 kb without missing data. The final dataset of diplogastrid sequences was more than four times larger than that used in the previously most inclusive phylogenetic study of the family (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mayer et al., 2009</a>), and it included over three times as many species and twice as many diplogastrid genera. In the final concatenated alignment of rRNA and ribosomal protein genes for all diplogastrid species, the proportion of missing data was 20%, with a minimum of 70% of nematode species sampled per gene. The dataset of all taxa had 667 kb excluding missing data and was 11,923 bp long (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), in which the fraction of missing data was 38%."

Dimorphism was diagnosed by the presence of morphs that differed (i) in the width and aspect ratio of the stoma and (ii) in the prominence and sclerotization of mouth structures (<a href=\"#bib24\">F\u00fcrst von Lieven and Sudhaus, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Serobyan et al., 2013</a>). In all examined species with mouth plasticity, the plasticity was discrete with no observed (and hence presumably rare) intermediate forms or reaction norms for morph-diagnostic morphology. Furthermore, each of the two morphs was stereotypic for a given species, such that morphology did not qualitatively vary with different induction cues. The mouth plasticity was therefore a discrete dimorphism of constant morphs in all species with the plasticity, consistent with previous observations of <i>P. pacificus</i>, for which multiple levels of starvation, pheromones, hormones, transgenes, enzyme-inhibiting salts, or environments previously experienced by wild-caught specimens all induced either of two morphs, albeit in differing ratios (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bento et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bose et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ragsdale et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Serobyan et al., 2013</a>).

Taken together, previous reports and our own collections demonstrated that such species were monomorphic across multiple populations and environmental conditions. In each of the five cases of recent losses, namely those inferred to have occurred on a terminal branch within Diplogastridae, the assimilated morph was identified as the St morph. However, for inferred ancient losses of the dimorphism, derived morphology made the homology of the assimilated morph impossible to determine reliably. Therefore, our analyses identify monomorphic and dimorphic taxa without distinguishing which of the two morphs was lost or assimilated."

This approach estimates probabilities of the states along phylogeny under continuous-time Markov models, incorporating uncertainty in tree topology, branch length, and ancestral character states. The best-fitting parameters of morphology priors, the overall substitution rate prior (gamma distribution prior), and the bias prior for two-state characters (beta distribution prior) were estimated using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method as also implemented in SIMMAP. These calibration analyses were run for 500,000 generations, sampling the chain every 100 generations, using a 50% majority rule consensus tree summarized from the Markov chains of the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis; the first 50,000 generations were discarded as burn-in. For stochastic character mapping, 500 trees were randomly sampled, with the help of Mesquite 2.75 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Maddison and Maddison, 2011</a>), from trees generated during the MCMC runs. The number of discrete categories, <i>k</i>, was set to 90 and 31 for the gamma and beta distributions, respectively.

In the second approach, we performed PCA analysis on Procrustes shape coordinates to reconstruct Procrustes shape-space (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rohlf and Slice, 1990</a>). In contrast to form-space, shape-space in principle minimizes the effects of allometry, offering an alternative way to measure morphological change.

                                "text": "Morphological variation (disparity) was examined in three groups, namely non-diplogastrid Rhabditina, dimorphic Diplogastridae, and monomorphic Diplogastridae. We used two approaches to investigate disparity: (i) the sum of univariate variances on form-space axes (multivariate variance) and (ii) PCA volume (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1E</a>). These methods capture different aspects of morphological diversity and both are based on morphological distance measures, although neither controls for phylogenetic non-independence. The sum of variances, a variance-based metric, provides an estimate of degree of difference among species in Procrustes morphospace. Alternatively, PCA volume gives an estimate of the amount of morphospace occupied by species; it is calculated as the product of the eigenvalues of the cross-distance matrix, divided by the square of the number of species. The sum of variances was previously shown by simulation-based studies to be relatively insensitive to variation in sample size, and both methods have relatively low sensitivity to missing data (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ciampaglio et al., 2001</a>). The analyses were performed using the MATLAB package MDA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro, 2003</a>). PC axes that explained more than 5% of the overall variance (2 for form, 3 for shape) (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1A,B</a>) were retained for calculations of the sum of variances and PCA volume. Rarefaction was performed to correct for sample-size dependence (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ciampaglio et al., 2001</a>), such that the sample size was standardized to the number of species in the smallest group compared. To calculate means of disparity estimates, their standard deviations, and their 95% confidence intervals, 10,000 bootstrap replicates were performed. For pairwise comparisons of the sum of variances between groups, two-tailed p-values were estimated using 100,000 bootstrap replicates."

In our analyses, operational time was set to inferred genetic distance, that is, branch lengths inferred in our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of four partitions of the 14 included genes. This metric is supported as an appropriate measure of time by mutation accumulation line experiments, which have indicated rates of molecular evolution to be nearly identical between distantly related nematodes of Rhabditina (<a href=\"#bib76\">Weller et al., 2014</a>). Absolute time was not used because (i) relevant fossil data are not available to calibrate dates in the phylogeny and (ii) the number of generations per year is assumed to differ dramatically between nematode species due to differences in generation time and, given ecological differences (<a href=\"#bib28\">Herrmann et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kiontke et al., 2011</a>), presumed lengths of diapause (dauer) stages."

If the difference in values (\u0394AICc) was greater than 4, the worse-fitting model was considered much less supported (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</a>). Additionally, nested models were compared using a hypothesis-testing likelihood-ratio approach, that is, using a chi-square distribution (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1F</a>; p-values are also given in main text).

This method estimates posterior rates of continuous trait evolution along individual branches of the phylogeny using reversible-jump MCMC sampling of a multirate BM process, without the need for specifying hypotheses a priori about the location of rate shifts. To achieve mixing of MCMC chains, we calibrated the proposal width using the function \u2018calibrate.rjmcmc\u2019 and running the chain for 1 million generations, after which we used Tracer 1.6 to confirm mixing. Three MCMC analyses were then performed, with 30 million generations each, using the function \u2018rjmcmc.bm\u2019. Analyses were run under a relaxed-BM model with the number of local clocks constrained to three and the proposal width set to 1.5. Chains were sampled every 5000 generations, the first 25% of generations was discarded as burn-in, and Tracer 1.6 was used to confirm chains mixing and convergence. Results from the three independent runs were combined, and weighted posterior rates of individual branches within each of the compared categories were extracted. The highest posterior density (HPD) intervals and means were estimated for the three nematode groups (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and were compared using a two-tailed randomization test to determine whether posterior rates were different among groups (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1H</a>)."

We define a \u2018structure\u2019 herein as any geometric deviation that is marked by a physical vertex of &lt;135\u00b0 from the cylindrical walls of the stoma or from the arched anterior margins of the pharyngeal radii (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All recorded structures were discrete and stereotypic, that is, always present or absent, for each species or morph (for dimorphic taxa, the Eu morph was analyzed). Because such structures take a variety of shapes, all recorded structures are for clarity presented as a presence/absence character matrix (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), which includes structures consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib23\">F\u00fcrst von Lieven, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">F\u00fcrst von Lieven and Sudhaus, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sudhaus and F\u00fcrst von Lieven, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kanzaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Herrmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ragsdale et al., 2014</a>). Iterative structures (i.e., serratae, rods, points, warts, serial denticles, and divisions of stomatal wall) were conservatively scored as a single structure, because such iterative structures were always co-dependent and were sometimes (i.e., for denticles, serratae, and warts) variable in number among individuals of a single species. Furthermore, such structures show that this additional within-character complexity correlates with size, analogous to what is observed in mammalian tooth development (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harjunmaa et al., 2014</a>) or what might otherwise be expected in area-dependent patterning (<a href=\"#bib72\">Turing, 1952</a>). Therefore, to minimize the effects of size on complexity in our analyses, all tabulated structures were those that were unique and constant within a species and which could be assigned homology where present in multiple species. Additionally, structures that bore multiple vertices or \u2018secondary complexity\u2019 distal to its deviation from the stoma (i.e., teeth, which could have multiple bends or peaks) were also coded as single structures. Finally, any character present as identical, symmetrical duplicates, which was due to the presence of two subventral sectors and hence also developmental co-dependence, was scored as a single structure.

It uses surveys of patterns of morphological variation relating to mouthpart and feeding function in numerous species of nematodes in combination with a more extensive and complete phylogeny to test whether the evolution of phenotypic plasticity is associated with the tempo of evolution. The value of this work is that current literature on this topic is short of empirical and quantitative studies; the submitted manuscript could thus be an important contribution."

Increased plasticity leads to reduced heritability and maybe even genetic variance, which in turn hampers response to selection. Assuming plasticity reduces the correlation between genotype and phenotype, genotypic drift could occur without affecting the phenotype.
