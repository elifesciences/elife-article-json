Although neurons come in a variety of different shapes and sizes, they share common features: a cell body called the soma that contains the nucleus; projections called dendrites that receive information from other neurons; and projections called axons that pass information to neighboring neurons. A fundamental question in neurobiology is how neurons establish and maintain these distinct features."

By 6 DIV the spectrin rings have spread to the medial axon, and at 10 DIV the lattice is present throughout the axon. In the dendrites, F-actin is the main contributor to the cortical cytoskeleton, with long filaments that run parallel to the long axis of the dendrite. \u03b2-spectrin is present in the dendrites at low concentrations (about half those found in the axon) and it rarely exhibits any periodic structure.

They began by investigating the relationship between the F-actin and spectrin rings to determine whether the formation of one is dependent on the formation of the other. They found that disrupting either the F-actin structure or the \u03b2-II-spectrin was sufficient to prevent the formation of the F-actin and spectrin rings."

They found that, after 2 days, the spectrin rings had begun to form in the section of the axon nearest the soma; by 6 days the periodic structure extended into the middle of the axon, and by 10 days it had reached the other end of the axon (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although the network started to form near the soma, it only spread in one direction\u2014into the axon. Zhong, He et al. examined the underlying mechanisms that prevented the network forming in the dendrites. They discovered that network formation was tightly correlated to the levels of \u03b2-II-spectrin\u2014the level of \u03b2-II-spectrin was much higher in the axons than in the dendrites. Also, they found that the protein ankryin B plays an important role in promoting the accumulation of \u03b2-II-spectrin within the axon."

Most importantly, the work of Zhong, He et al. demonstrates the potential of super-resolution microscopy for gaining traction on previously intractable problems. As these approaches become more widely used, it will be exciting to see what other areas of biology come into a clear focus."
