By the end of the year it was home to another three laureates: Perutz and his colleague John Kendrew received the chemistry prize for their work on the structure of globular proteins, while Francis Crick shared the physiology or medicine prize with James Watson (who had been in the old MRC Unit for Molecular Biology with Crick, Kendrew and Perutz) and Maurice Wilkins for their work on the structure of DNA."

This is not because we pay constant homage to the Nobel laureates of the past, although they are hard to forget, but because the founders of the LMB, with the encouragement of the MRC, created a remarkably successful style and culture that is much easier to maintain than to create from scratch. This culture unequivocally values science over all else, and everyone at the LMB, whatever their role, accepts that their goal is to make it as easy as possible for great science to get done. In turn, there is a strong expectation that ambitious, important and long-term problems are tackled."

This also allows us to exploit unexpected opportunities. And because the budget depends on the overall performance of the LMB, which is reviewed every five years by the MRC, it is in everyone's interest that their colleagues do well. Coupled with the fact that the majority of equipment is communal, this model has created a tradition of freely offered help, advice, reagents, ideas and facilities, which most LMB scientists simply take for granted."

The passage of time has shown the wisdom of some of the choices made in the past. For example, when Greg Winter was being considered for tenure at the LMB in the mid-1980s, Fred Sanger, who was head of the protein and nucleic acid chemistry division at the time, suggested that he would fit into the division better if he applied his newly-developed protein engineering methods to antibodies rather than enzymes. Winter went on to humanize monoclonal antibodies, a breakthrough that has revolutionized medicine (and has also led to three highly successful biotech companies)."

In addition to Winter's work on antibodies, other examples include the ongoing analysis of the nematode nervous system, and work on the structures of G-protein coupled receptors, which had its origins in early studies of bacteriorhodopsin. Again, history can be important: the LMB pioneered the use of both X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to determine the structure of proteins, and we remain committed to being world-leading in the determination of large structures."

They are better placed than anyone to work out where the opportunities lie, and some of the greatest discoveries come from unexpected angles.

Nevertheless, when selecting new group leaders, we look for bright, flexible and imaginative scientists; these qualities are more important to us than the precise area in which they have most recently worked. Most of our recruitment is at the level of young scientists just starting a group, but more senior scientists are also attracted by the LMB ethos: for example, Venki Ramakrishnan, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 for his work on the ribosome, moved from the US to the LMB because it offered the long-term support and relative security that he felt was needed to tackle a problem as ambitious as determining the structure of the ribosome."

Indeed, we are building a closer relationship with Cambridge University School of Clinical Medicine by housing part of the Department of Medicine within our new building, and we have also space set aside for temporary translational projects and collaborations. Our experience is that the most successful collaborations arise though the active encouragement of willing partners, rather than any compulsion."

To fit the LMB's hands-on style, there are write-up spaces close to the benches, and offices of group leaders are intermingled with the write-up spaces (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The labs are partially divided, making it easy to move between them, to share equipment and to have groups that fluctuate in size. Equipment rooms are across a corridor from the labs and benches, making them accessible to all and creating a space for people to bump into each other: indeed, we took a conscious decision to make the density of scientists on each corridor the same as that in the first LMB building."

The end result is a building carefully adapted to the culture of the LMB, with a particular emphasis on interaction and communal sharing.

Unusually for a European building, there are full-height interstitial zones between the floors, which mean that the air ducts, pipework and wiring can all be accessed for maintenance and modification. Elsewhere, the main air handling units and other plant are not on the roof, as they usually are, but in towers adjacent to the building. This takes weight and vibration away from the lab structure and also creates iconic stainless steel-clad features to bemuse the onlooker."

The latter approach tends to result in the avoidance of risk and the setting of defined targets, making it largely incompatible with difficult, long-term projects. Although grants can focus funding on particular projects, institutes that rely on grants for overheads cannot have the same level of flexibility and freedom, and may struggle when grants dry up."

We also firmly believe that such funding will create an environment that is attractive to industry, will train the world's best scientists for the future, and will directly or indirectly generate discoveries, applications, medical advances and wealth. Some of the major research charities, notably the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Wellcome Trust, recognize the need for longer term, more flexible funding and they have tailored their support accordingly, empowering the best scientists to be bold. The LMB has always done this."
