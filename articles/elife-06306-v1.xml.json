We screened the mutants affecting rhabdomeric expression of rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) in the <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptors and found that dPob/EMC3, EMC1, and EMC8/9, <i>Drosophila</i> homologs of subunits of ER membrane protein complex (EMC), are essential for stabilization of immature Rh1 in an earlier step than that at which another Rh1-specific chaperone (NinaA) acts. dPob/EMC3 localizes to the ER and associates with EMC1 and calnexin. Moreover, EMC is required for the stable expression of other multi-pass transmembrane proteins such as minor rhodopsins Rh3 and Rh4, transient receptor potential, and Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, but not for a secreted protein or type I single-pass transmembrane proteins. Furthermore, we found that dPob/EMC3 deficiency induces rhabdomere degeneration in a light-independent manner. These results collectively indicate that EMC is a key factor in the biogenesis of multi-pass transmembrane proteins, including Rh1, and its loss causes retinal degeneration."

We screened the mutants affecting rhabdomeric expression of rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) in the <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptors and found that dPob/EMC3, EMC1, and EMC8/9, <i>Drosophila</i> homologs of subunits of ER membrane protein complex (EMC), are essential for stabilization of immature Rh1 in an earlier step than that at which another Rh1-specific chaperone (NinaA) acts. dPob/EMC3 localizes to the ER and associates with EMC1 and calnexin. Moreover, EMC is required for the stable expression of other multi-pass transmembrane proteins such as minor rhodopsins Rh3 and Rh4, transient receptor potential, and Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, but not for a secreted protein or type I single-pass transmembrane proteins. Furthermore, we found that dPob/EMC3 deficiency induces rhabdomere degeneration in a light-independent manner. These results collectively indicate that EMC is a key factor in the biogenesis of multi-pass transmembrane proteins, including Rh1, and its loss causes retinal degeneration."

Molecular chaperones and folding enzymes are required for the folding of the integral membrane proteins in the ER. A comprehensive approach in yeast to identify genes required for protein folding in the ER identified the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), which comprises six subunits (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jonikas et al., 2009</a>). Another report studying the comprehensive interaction map of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery revealed that EMC contains four and three additional subunits in mammals and <i>Drosophila</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christianson et al., 2011</a>). The deletions of each emc1\u20136 gene causes the unfolded protein response (UPR), presumably caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jonikas et al., 2009</a>).

Defects in rhodopsin biosynthesis and trafficking cause retinal degeneration in both <i>Drosophila</i> and humans; more than 120 mutations in the rhodopsin gene are associated with human retinitis pigmentosa (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mendes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiong and Bellen, 2013</a>). The overwhelming majority of these mutations lead to misfolded rhodopsin, which aggregates in the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hartong et al., 2006</a>). Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the folding and trafficking of rhodopsin as well as retinal degeneration caused by misfolded rhodopsin."

A protein-trap line expressing GFP-tagged sec61alpha protein (sec61::GFP) which localizes in the ER membrane was used as a negative control. Since the overall expression level of EMC1::GFP was strong, hs-Gal4 driver was used to activate UAS:EMC1::GFP for most of the experiments. To analyze the interaction between EMC1 and Rh1 apoprotein, Rh1-Gal4 driver was also used because the expression of EMC1::GFP was stronger in the photoreceptors (data not shown). For the Rh1-Gal4 experiment, flies were reared in a medium lacking vitamin A to accumulate Rh1 apoprotein in the ER. Membrane fraction was recovered from the adult heads, the membrane proteins extracted by CHAPS from the adult head membrane fraction were bound to anti-GFP magnetic beads, and the elutions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against GFP, Rh1, dPob, and Cnx."

On the other hand, the type I single-pass membrane proteins Crb (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and DE-Cad (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) were localized normally in the stalks and adherence junctions in <i>dPob</i><sup><i>\u22064</i></sup> photoreceptors.

The UPR is regulated by some unique intracellular signal transduction pathways. Therefore, mutants lacking the function of a gene essential for folding or degradation of unfolded protein probably exhibit UPR. In fact, the yeast <i>Pob</i> homolog, <i>EMC3</i>, was identified by screening of mutants exhibiting upregulated UPR. ER amplification and chaperone induction, which we observed in <i>dPob</i>-deficient photoreceptors, are also common outcomes of UPR. We therefore examined whether UPR is induced in <i>dPob</i>-deficient photoreceptors. First we used the <i>Xbp1:GFP</i> sensor, which is an established method for detecting UPRs in flies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ryoo et al., 2007</a>). During UPR, Ire1 catalyzes an unconventional splicing of a small intron from the <i>xbp1</i> mRNA, enabling translation into an active transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>). Using this mechanism, <i>Xbp1:GFP</i> sensor, a fused transcript of <i>Drosophila</i> Xbp1 and GFP translated only after the unconventional splicing by Ire1, can be used as a reporter of one of the UPR transduction pathways (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ryoo et al., 2007</a>). In both <i>dPob</i><sup><i>\u22064</i></sup> and <i>dPob</i><sup><i>e02662</i></sup> mutant mosaic retinas expressed <i>Xbp1:GFP</i> sensor in all R1\u22126 photoreceptors, and <i>Xbp1:GFP</i> fusion proteins were detected in the dPob mutant photoreceptors but not in the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> and data not shown). Next, we examined the level of eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) phosphorylation because UPR is well known to induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to attenuate protein translation on the ER membrane in a transduction pathway independent from IreI/Xbp1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cao and Kaufman, 2012</a>). Anti-phospho-eIF2\u03b1 signals were stronger in both <i>dPob</i><sup><i>\u22064</i></sup> and <i>dPob</i><sup><i>e02662</i></sup> photoreceptors than in wild-type photoreceptors (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> and data not shown).

In contrast, the EMC null mutants adequately express type I, type II, or type IV single-pass membrane proteins. Our observation on the substrate specificity of EMC is mostly consistent with previous reports. <a href=\"#bib17\">Jonikas et al. (2009)</a> found that EMC mutants and a strain overexpressing a misfolded transmembrane protein, sec61-2p or KWS, had a similar genetic interaction pattern and suggested that EMC works as a chaperone for transmembrane proteins. A recent study in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> using a hypomorphic EMC6 allele and RNAi knock-down of emc1\u20136 genes showed results partially consistent with our study; at least two pentameric Cys-loop receptors, AcR and GABA<sub>A</sub>, consisting of subunits with four transmembrane helices, were significantly decreased in the hypomorphic EMC6 mutants but GLR-1, a tetrameric AMPA-like glutamate receptor with four transmembrane helices and a type I single-pass transmembrane EGF receptor, was not affected (<a href=\"#bib28\">Richard et al., 2013</a>). Despite its four transmembrane helices, GLR-1 was normally expressed in the hypomorphic emc6 mutant of the nematode; however, these results may indicate that the residual activity of EMC was sufficient for the expression of GLR-1. The degree of requirement of EMC activity can vary for each membrane protein. In fact, in a dPob hypomorphic allele, <i>dPob</i><sup><i>e02662</i></sup>, near-normal expression of Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>) despite a severe reduction in a dPob null allele, <i>dPob</i><sup><i>\u22064</i></sup>. Overall, the results observed in the dPob null mutant does not conflict with previous studies but rather clarifies the role of EMC in the biosynthesis of multi-pass transmembrane proteins. Because of the limited availability of antibodies, we could not show a clear threshold for the number of transmembrane helices in the substrates for EMC activity. In total, the data presented to date indicate that EMC affects the expression of membrane proteins with four or more transmembrane helices."

The photoreceptors of an amorphic mutant of Cnx show complete loss of Rh1 apoprotein (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rosenbaum et al., 2006</a>), just as shown in dPob, EMC1 or EMC8/9 mutants. Moreover, both Cnx and EMC3 are epistatic to the mutant of the rhodopsin-specific chaperone, NinaA, which accumulates Rh1 apoprotein in the ER. These results indicate that EMC and Cnx can work together in the Rh1 biosynthetic cascade prior to NinaA. Cnx, the most studied chaperone of N-glycosylated membrane proteins, recognizes improperly folded proteins and facilitates folding and quality control of glycoproteins through the calnexin cycle, which prevents ER export of misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Williams, 2006</a>). One possible explanation for our result is that the EMC-Cnx complex is required for multi-pass membrane proteins to be incorporated into the calnexin cycle. If the EMC-Cnx complex is a chaperone of Rh1, physical interaction is expected between ER-accumulated Rh1 apoprotein and the EMC-Cnx complex. Indeed, it is reported that Cnx is co-immunoprecipitated with <i>Drosophila</i> Rh1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rosenbaum et al., 2006</a>). However, in this study, Rh1 apoprotein accumulated in the chromophore-depleted photoreceptor cells was not co-immunoprecipitated with EMC1.

In bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts, YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 proteins specifically facilitate insertion, folding, and assembly of many transmembrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wang and Dalbey, 2011</a>). In the ER membrane of eukaryotes, in addition to the translocon, other components such as translocon-associated protein/signal sequence receptor (TRAP/SSR) complex and translocating chain-associating membrane protein (TRAM) complex are required for the membrane insertion of the transmembrane helix. Most of the newly synthesized multi-pass membrane proteins are co-translationally integrated into the ER membrane through the translocon complex. Although the mechanism of this process is yet to be fully understood, it is assumed that only one or two transmembrane helices can be stored in the translocon channel and the lateral gate and that the next set of newly synthesized transmembrane helices displace them (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rapoport et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cymer et al., 2014</a>).

Both eyes were dissected from two adult flies per sample and cDNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperPrep Cell Lysis and RT Kit for qPCR (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Eyes with whole-eye clones of FRT40A were used as a control to obtain the relative standard curves. qPCR reactions were performed using the StepOne real-time PCR system (Life Technologies) and KOD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. PCR condition was 98\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 98\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 15 s, and 68\u00b0C for 45 s, and a melt curve stage of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 0.3\u00b0C/s increments to 98\u00b0C, with primers of Rh1: (ninaE-qF1:5\u2032-GTGGACACCATACCTGGTC-3\u2032 and ninaE-qR1:5\u2032-GCGATATTTCGGATGGCTG-3\u2032), Arr2: (Arr2-qF1:5\u2032-AAGGATCGCCATGGTATCG-3\u2032 and Arr2-qR1:5\u2032-TACGAGATGACAATACCACAGG-3\u2032), TRP: (Trp-qF2:5\u2032-GAATACACGGAGATGCGTC-3\u2032 and Trp-qF2:5\u2032-CTCGAGTTCCATGGATGTG-3\u2032), Act5C: (5\u2032-GCTTGTCTGGGCAAGAGGAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGGAACCACACAACATGCG-3\u2032).

Moreover, this study does not address many of the pressing questions regarding the EMC complex. Does dPob's role in <i>Drosophila</i> reflect the entire EMC complex function?

Besides rhodopsins, two other polytopic membrane proteins, Na, K-ATPase alpha subunit and the TRP channel, were affected while four proteins with a single transmembrane segment and one secreted protein were not affected.

Instead, steady-state levels of proteins and induction of the UPR are used as proxies to infer the folding status of the putative substrates. Both phenomena could be rather indirectly caused by lack of dPob function. In my opinion the manuscript does not achieve more than narrowing down which proteins are affected by loss of dPob function in a non-systematic fashion. The numbers of substrates in the affected and unaffected classes are low (furthermore, 'with a single membrane-spanning domain' is not an accurate topological classification for a membrane protein). Potentially, the distinctions between affected and unaffected proteins could fall into completely different categories: half-life of the precursor, activity of the precursor, trafficking machinery used by the precursor to leave the ER, activity of the precursor at the ER to name just a few speculative ideas. Therefore, the last sentences of the Conclusion section are strongly over-stated."

I don't perceive the manuscript as outstanding because the actual function of dPob is inferred from correlations with highly complex steady-state effects on selected individual proteins or on global ER homeostasis. From an outstanding paper I would expect either a systematic and unbiased approach to identifying the substrates of the putative chaperone complex or a delineation of the features that it recognizes in its substrates or some direct evidence for the actual chaperone activity proposed</i>."

We showed that weakening ERAD pathway does not suppress the loss of Rh1 by slowing down ERAD-dependent degradation. We also performed Co-IP with EMC1::GFP but did not detect stable binding with ER-accumulated Rh1 apoprotein. Our new results indicate it is more possible that EMC has some function on earlier steps than folding of fully translated protein, such as stabilizing translation, co-translational folding or membrane integration."
