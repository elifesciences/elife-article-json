Here we show that Bcl2l10 and IRBIT interact and exert an additive inhibition of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the physiological state. Moreover, we found that these proteins associate in a complex in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and that their interplay is involved in apoptosis regulation. MAMs are a hotspot for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through IP<sub>3</sub>R in mitochondria induces cell death. We found that upon apoptotic stress, IRBIT is dephosphorylated, becoming an inhibitor of Bcl2l10. Moreover, IRBIT promotes ER mitochondria contact. Our results suggest that by inhibiting Bcl2l10 activity and promoting contact between ER and mitochondria, IRBIT facilitates massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria and promotes apoptosis. This work then describes IRBIT as a new regulator of cell death."

Here we show that Bcl2l10 and IRBIT interact and exert an additive inhibition of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the physiological state. Moreover, we found that these proteins associate in a complex in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and that their interplay is involved in apoptosis regulation. MAMs are a hotspot for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through IP<sub>3</sub>R in mitochondria induces cell death. We found that upon apoptotic stress, IRBIT is dephosphorylated, becoming an inhibitor of Bcl2l10. Moreover, IRBIT promotes ER mitochondria contact. Our results suggest that by inhibiting Bcl2l10 activity and promoting contact between ER and mitochondria, IRBIT facilitates massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria and promotes apoptosis. This work then describes IRBIT as a new regulator of cell death."

In MAMs, IP<sub>3</sub>R associates with the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), allowing a direct transfer\u00a0of\u00a0Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0into the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib56\">Szabadkai et al., 2006</a>). However, if the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transferred is too high, it induces cytochrome c release and apoptosis. MAMs are then acknowledged to be an essential component of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Giorgi et al., 2009</a>). In this regard, some Bcl-2 family proteins localize at ER and modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bonneau et al., 2013</a>). Several antiapoptotic members notably interact with IP<sub>3</sub>R, each one regulating channel activity by a distinct mechanism. For example, Bcl-2 interacts with the central part of IP<sub>3</sub>R and reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to inhibit proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rong et al., 2009</a>). By contrast, Bcl-xL interacts with the most C-terminal domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R and stimulates pro-survival Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib66\">White et al., 2005</a>)."

                        "text": "Recently, Nrz, a Bcl-2 homolog in zebrafish, was shown to interact with the N-terminal IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R and to\u00a0decrease ligand binding on the receptor, thus reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from ER (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bonneau et al., 2014</a>). Only a\u00a0few regulators of IP<sub>3</sub>R interact with the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain (IP<sub>3</sub>BD) or act by interfering with ligand fixation. Among them, IRBIT acts in a manner similar to Nrz. IRBIT directly competes with IP<sub>3</sub> by interacting with the residues of the\u00a0IP<sub>3\u00a0</sub>binding\u00a0domain\u00a0(IP<sub>3</sub>BD)\u00a0that\u00a0are involved in IP<sub>3</sub> binding (known as the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket). This increases the threshold of IP<sub>3</sub> required for IP<sub>3</sub>R opening and then decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2006</a>). In addition to IP<sub>3</sub>R, IRBIT interacts with various partners, such as ion transporters and exchangers including\u00a0NBCe1-B (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shirakabe et al., 2006</a>), NHE3 (<a href=\"#bib29\">He et al., 2008</a>), and Slc26a6 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Park et al., 2013</a>), the Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channel CFTR (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yang et al., 2009</a>), Fip1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kiefer et al., 2009</a>), the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Arnaoutov and Dasso, 2014</a>) and kinases including\u00a0CaMKII\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kawaai et al., 2015</a>), PIPKI, and II\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ando et al., 2015</a>). All of\u00a0these interactions involve the N-terminal region of IRBIT, which contains a serine-rich region with several phosphorylation sites (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Devogelaere et al., 2007</a>). In particular, phosphorylation of Ser68 is required for the subsequent sequential phosphorylation of Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 by the casein kinase I (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Devogelaere et al., 2007</a>). This multiple phosphorylation of IRBIT is critical for its interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R and most of its other partners."

                        "text": "Nrz is the zebrafish ortholog of the mammalian antiapoptotic protein Bcl2l10 (also called Nrh, Bcl-B, or Diva/Boo). To date, little is known about Bcl2l10, particularly regarding its effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In mammals, Bcl2l10 is mainly expressed in the ovary and testis, but also in the lung and the developing nervous system (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aouacheria et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Inohara et al., 1998</a>). Interestingly, IRBIT is also strongly expressed in these organs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ando et al., 2003</a>). Nrz and IRBIT both regulate IP<sub>3</sub>R activity by interacting with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD. However, they do not share a common binding site on the IP<sub>3</sub>BD as Nrz does not interact with the residues required for IP<sub>3</sub> and IRBIT binding (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bonneau et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that Nrz and IRBIT may interact with\u00a0the IP<sub>3</sub>BD\u00a0at the same time. In the present study, we showed that, like Nrz, Bcl2l10 interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD of IP<sub>3</sub>R. We then analyzed how IRBIT and Bcl2l10 behave towards each other. We found that IRBIT and Bcl2l10 interacted together independently of IRBIT binding to IP<sub>3</sub>R and that they cooperated to regulate IP<sub>3</sub>R activity. Furthermore, we showed that these two proteins localized in MAMs, where they are part of a protein complex with IP<sub>3</sub>R and VDAC. Unexpectedly, we found that IRBIT promoted cell death through two mechanisms.\u00a0First\u00a0during apoptosis, IRBIT was dephosphorylated, and unphosphorylated IRBIT appeared to inhibit the\u00a0antiapoptotic activity of Bcl2l10. Second, IRBIT appeared to promote contact between ER and mitochondria that\u00a0may\u00a0facilitate proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer. Considered collectively, our results suggested a strong relationship between IRBIT and Bcl2l10 and pointed out, for the first time, the implied involvement of IRBIT in cell death."

We therefore first investigated whether Bcl2l10 behaves like Nrz and interacts with IP<sub>3</sub>R. The three different isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>R were immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells extract, and we found that endogenous Bcl2l10 interacted with the three isoforms, although the interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R2 appeared weaker than that of IP<sub>3</sub>R1\u00a0or\u00a0IP<sub>3</sub>R3\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

The BH4 domain of Bcl-2 family members mediates their interaction with proteins outside of the Bcl-2 family, such as Raf-1 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 1996</a>), calcineurin (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shibasaki et al., 1997</a>) and VDAC (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shimizu et al., 2000</a>). Co-immunoprecipitation between FLAG-tagged full length Bcl2l10 or \u2206BH4Bcl2l10 and HA-IRBIT showed that the BH4 domain of Bcl2l10 was essential for its interaction with IRBIT, as the deletion mutant \u2206BH4Bcl2l10 lost its ability to bind IRBIT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

In particular, phosphorylation of residues Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 is essential for IRBIT binding on IP<sub>3</sub>R. This multiple phosphorylation relies on a prime phosphorylation on Ser68 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Devogelaere et al., 2007</a>). Thus, deletion of the first 104 amino acids of IRBIT or the mutation S68A abolishes the interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ando et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2006</a>). Interestingly, these mutations did not affect the ability of IRBIT to be co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl2l10 when co-expressed in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), suggesting that IRBIT binds Bcl2l10 independently of its interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R. To identify the region of IRBIT involved in the interaction with Bcl2l10, we performed additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments between Bcl2l10 and various C-terminus deletion mutants of IRBIT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

We first analyzed the subcellular localization of IRBIT and Bcl2l10 to confirm that they colocalize. Subcellular fractionation performed on HeLa cells revealed that IRBIT was present in the cytosol, at the ER, and at the crude mitochondria. This last fraction contains the pure mitochondria and the mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). IRBIT localized only into MAMs and is not found in pure mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Bcl2l10\u00a0is found at the ER and in the crude mitochondria. However, unlike other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl2l10 was not detectable in the pure mitochondria fraction and was only present in MAMs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This revealed that Bcl2l10 is an uncommon antiapoptotic protein that exerts its function only at the ER, thereby suggesting that its main mechanism of action may be to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In this regard, MAMs play a central role in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent apoptosis because it is in this compartment that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is directly transferred from the ER to the mitochondria via\u00a0a\u00a0protein complex containing IP<sub>3</sub>R and VDAC (<a href=\"#bib56\">Szabadkai et al., 2006</a>).

To address this, we compared the apoptosis sensitivity of wild type (WT) HeLa cells with IRBIT KO HeLa cells generated using the\u00a0CRISPR/Cas9 system. Given the localization of IRBIT and Bcl2l10, we focused on Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and ER-stress-induced apoptosis. Cells were then treated with either 1 \u00b5M staurosporine (STS), a potent apoptosis inducer that notably triggers mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Prudent et al., 2015</a>), or with the ER-stress inducer tunicamycin (TUN at 20 \u00b5M) ,\u00a0which also mediates apoptosis by inducing a strong elevation of the mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<a href=\"#bib21\">Deniaud et al., 2008</a>).

In particular, IRBIT interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R requires phosphorylation of the residues Ser68, Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2006</a>). As IP<sub>3</sub>R plays a central role in apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jayaraman and Marks, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Szalai et al., 1999</a>), we then investigated whether the modulation of IRBIT\u2013IP<sub>3</sub>R interaction can account for IRBIT involvement in cell death. To address this question, we analyzed the phosphorylation of IRBIT during apoptosis. The lysate of HeLa cells treated with either 1 \u00b5M STS for 6 hr or 20 \u00b5M TUN for 24 hr and was analyzed by Western blot using two antibodies specific for phospho-IRBIT (S68p/S71p and S74p/S77p) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ando et al., 2009</a>). The ratio between the intensities of the phospho-IRBIT and IRBIT bands was calculated and compared to the ratio of the control (DMSO treatment) to obtain the relative phosphorylation of S68/S71 and S74/77. Using this approach, we determined that following apoptosis induced by staurosporine or tunicamycin, IRBIT phosphorylation on Ser68, Ser71, Ser74, and S77 was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>). This suggests that IRBIT's function, and notably its effect on IP<sub>3</sub>R, may be modified\u00a0during apoptosis. This result also raises the question of whether dephosphorylation of IRBIT is an early event that may\u00a0participate in the induction of apoptosis or if it is merely a consequence of cell death. We then analyzed IRBIT phosphorylation after a short treatment with STS (0.5, 1 or 1.5 hr) or TUN (4, 6 or 8 hr). At these incubation times, apoptosis was not achieved, as shown by the absence of cleaved-PARP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). However, as early as 30 min after STS treatment or 4 hr after TUN treatment, phosphorylation of Ser68, Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 was already significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>), suggesting that dephosphorylation of IRBIT may actually participate in the induction of apoptosis."

Interestingly, we determined that displacement of IRBIT from ER and MAMs was correlated with a reduction of Bcl2l10 in these compartments, particularly in MAMs, and with an elevation of Bcl2l10 in the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

At this early time point, IRBIT is dephosphorylated but apoptosis has not yet occurred (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Consistent with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2009</a>), STS and TUN treatment of WT cells significantly increased the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released through IP<sub>3</sub>R (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). STS treatment also slightly increased basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, but this cannot account for\u00a0the\u00a0drug's effect on IICR. As expected, in the\u00a0control condition (DMSO), IRBIT KO cells\u00a0had\u00a0increased IICR compared to WT cells.

We first examined the interaction of Bcl2l10 with IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence or absence of unphosphorylated IRBIT. For this purpose, extracts of HeLa cells expressing Bcl2l10 and IRBIT S68A alone or in combination were subjected to GST-pulldown with recombinant GST-IP<sub>3</sub>R\u2206CD. As expected, IRBIT S68A did not interact with IP<sub>3</sub>R whereas Bcl2l10 did. However, coexpression of IRBIT S68A markedly reduced the interaction of Bcl2l10 with IP<sub>3</sub>R (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To confirm this result, a GST-pulldown assay was performed using recombinant GST-IP<sub>3</sub>BD incubated with recombinant Bcl2l10 in combination with phosphorylated recombinant IRBIT (produced in Sf9 cells) and/or with\u00a0unphosphorylated recombinant IRBIT (produced in <i>Escherichia coli</i>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2006</a>). In the presence of phosphorylated IRBIT, Bcl2l10 bound to GST-IP<sub>3</sub>BD\u00a0strongly, whereas in the presence of unphosphorylated IRBIT, this interaction was significantly weaker (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Moreover, although we previously found that phosphorylated IRBIT promotes Bcl2l10's interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>BD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), this effect was abolished in the presence of unphosphorylated IRBIT. Indeed, the interaction between Bcl2l10 and IP<sub>3</sub>BD in the presence of unphosphorylated IRBIT was similar\u00a0regardless of whether phosphorylated IRBIT was present (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This suggests that unphosphorylated IRBIT inhibits the interaction of Bcl2l10 with IP<sub>3</sub>R and that dephosphorylation of IRBIT during apoptosis can promote the displacement of Bcl2l10 from ER membranes."

This mechanism should notably occur in MAMs because IRBIT and Bcl2l10 are removed from this compartment, where proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals aiming at\u00a0mitochondria are usually generated (<a href=\"#bib25\">Giorgi et al., 2009</a>),\u00a0during\u00a0apoptosis. To further decipher the role of IRBIT in MAMs, we then examined the extent to which this protein can influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux between ER and mitochondria by comparing ER-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between WT and IRBIT KO MEF cells. In these experiments, cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M ATP to induce a massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, the transfer of which to mitochondria can be easily detected. Under these conditions, as shown by the measurement of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with Fura-2, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER was greater in IRBIT KO cells than in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which is consistent with the previously described effect of IRBIT on IICR. However, the measurement of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye Rhod-2 revealed that although IICR was enhanced in IRBIT KO cells, the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulated in the mitochondria of these cells was lower compared than that in the WT cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This result shows that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between ER and mitochondria is impaired in IRBIT KO cells."

We then studied the status of ER-mitochondria contact in IRBIT KO HeLa cells using electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and D</a>). This analysis revealed that, in IRBIT KO cells, the percentage of mitochondria in contact with ER was less than that in WT cells. Moreover, although the average distance between ER and mitochondria at contact points was similar in the WT and IRBIT KO cells, the average length of contact points was significantly shorter in IRBIT KO cells. Accordingly, in IRBIT KO cells, contact points longer than 600 nm barely existed, whereas those shorter than 200 nm were frequent. By contrast, in WT cells, contact points shorter than 200 nm were rarely found, and those longer than 600 nm were frequent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These results suggest that IRBIT may participate in the formation or stabilization of ER-mitochondria contact points. To further support this observation, we stained the\u00a0ER and mitochondria of HeLa and MEF cells, and we estimated the colocalization between the two organelles using the Mander\u2019s overlap coefficient and the Pearson coefficient (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bolte and Cordeli\u00e8res, 2006</a>). As expected, in HeLa IRBIT KO cells and in MEF IRBIT KO cells, colocalization between ER and mitochondria was reduced compared to that in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Expression of IRBIT in IRBIT KO cells increased colocalization coefficients to levels similar to those of WT cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These results support the idea that IRBIT is involved in the formation or stabilization of ER-mitochondria contact points. As IP<sub>3</sub>R is a key component of MAMs and as IRBIT interacts with it, we next examined whether this interaction may account for the role of IRBIT in contact points. Interestingly, expression of IRBIT S68A\u00a0(which cannot bind IP<sub>3</sub>R) in IRBIT KO cells failed to restore ER-mitochondria contact (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), suggesting that the interaction between IRBIT and IP<sub>3</sub>R may be involved in the formation of contact points."

However, under a stress condition, dephosphorylation\u00a0of\u00a0IRBIT induces the displacement of both this protein and Bcl2l10 from ER membranes. This translocation likely favors proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to the mitochondria, which is facilitated by the close proximity between the organelles promoted by IRBIT. By contrast, in IRBIT KO cells, the lack of IRBIT leads to reduced\u00a0ER-mitochondria contact; Bcl2l10 may also be more abundant in MAMs and no longer displaced during apoptosis. This may avoid proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between ER and mitochondria, thereby explaining the resistance of these cells to apoptosis."

These two proteins interact with the same domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R; but\u00a0while\u00a0IRBIT interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2006</a>), Nrz, the zebrafish ortholog of Bcl2l10, has\u00a0been shown to interact with different residues (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bonneau et al., 2014</a>). Our findings confirm that IRBIT and Bcl2l10 have different binding sites in the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain, and demonstrate the existence of a Bcl2l10-IRBIT complex on IP<sub>3</sub>R. The\u00a0BH4 domain of Bcl2l10 is involved in the interaction with IRBIT and IP<sub>3</sub>R, but\u00a0two distinct portions of IRBIT mediate the interactions with Bcl2l10 and IP<sub>3</sub>R. The IP<sub>3</sub>BD is structured as a cleft at the end of which the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket is found\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Bosanac et al., 2002)</a>. The N-terminal part of IRBIT (residues 1\u2013104) is probably buried in the IP<sub>3</sub>BD where it interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket. We assume that the rest of the protein projects toward the outside of the cleft, where Bcl2l10 is\u00a0located. This allows residues 169\u2013201 of\u00a0IRBIT\u00a0to bind the BH4 domain of Bcl2l10, which is structured in\u00a0an \u03b1-helix; therefore, we can hypothesize that one side of the helix interacts with IP<sub>3</sub>R whereas the other interacts with IRBIT. This association between IRBIT and Bcl2l10 may stabilize their interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R, thus increasing their effect on IICR."

IRBIT possesses a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) binding site upstream of its serine-rich region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), between residues 40 and 44 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Devogelaere et al., 2007</a>). This binding site has been shown to dephosphorylate the\u00a0Ser68 residue, but not residues Ser71, Ser74, and Ser 77 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Devogelaere et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, PP1 was shown to mediate apoptosis via dephosphorylation of Akt (<a href=\"#bib58\">Thayyullathil et al., 2011</a>) and pRb (<a href=\"#bib46\">Puntoni and Villa-Moruzzi, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2001</a>). Moreover, PP1 can dephosphorylate and activate the BH3-only protein Bad to induce apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ayll\u00f3n et al., 2000</a>). Finally, the inhibition of PP1 has been reported to protect cardiomyocytes from tunicamycin-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). All of\u00a0these studies\u00a0have highlighted the role of PP1 in the induction of apoptosis, and we can then speculate that IRBIT is a target of PP1 at the onset of apoptosis. However, although dephosphorylation of Ser68 by PP1 may prevent further phosphorylation of Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77, it is unlikely that PP1 by itself accounts for the dephosphorylation of these residues observed during apoptosis. Sequence analysis of IRBIT revealed the existence of a LxVP motif between residues 271 and 274, which is a binding site of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Slupe et al., 2013</a>). Calcineurin plays a role in apoptosis;notably\u00a0,\u00a0it participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent apoptosis by activating the BH3-only protein Bad (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 1999</a>) and by promoting Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cereghetti et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2010</a>). Further experiments should be performed to study the ability of calcineurin to dephosphorylate IRBIT,\u00a0but it is likely that the combined action of PP1 and calcineurin is responsible for IRBIT dephosphorylation during apoptosis."

In particular, the interaction of IRBIT with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II\u03b1 (CamKII\u03b1) may also play a role in apoptosis. Indeed, IRBIT was shown to inhibit CamKII\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kawaai et al., 2015</a>), which possesses a pro-survival effect, as it notably promotes Bcl-2 expression and inhibits caspase-2 activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nutt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Song et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wei et al., 2013</a>).

Interestingly, as for Bcl2l10, the interaction between CamKII and IRBIT does not depend on IRBIT phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kawaai et al., 2015</a>). Thus, in addition to its effect on Bcl2l10, IRBIT dephosphorylation during apoptosis may favor its interaction with CamKII, as it could no longer interact with the majority of its other partners.

To date, the mechanisms governing the formation of these structures remain largely unknown. Our results suggest that the interaction between IRBIT and IP<sub>3</sub>R may mediate the effect of IRBIT on ER-mitochondria contact (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This result was quite unexpected, as IP<sub>3</sub>R does not appear to be required for ER-mitochondria contact. Indeed, KO of the three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms in DT40 cells was reported to have no effect on the frequency and length of contact points (<a href=\"#bib19\">Csord\u00e1s et al., 2006</a>). Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, is acknowledged to be the key player in\u00a0the establishment of ER-mitochondria contact, as its KO has\u00a0been reported to greatly affect\u00a0both the formation of MAMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between the two organelles (<a href=\"#bib20\">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</a>). However, this requirement of Mfn2 is now being\u00a0reconsidered, as two independent studies concluded that Mfn2 KO actually\u00a0increases contact between ER and mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cosson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Filadi et al., 2015</a>). At the light of this controversy, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the role of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the formation of MAMs has been overlooked, in particular when we take into account the fact that IP<sub>3</sub>R is part, together\u00a0with Grp75 and VDAC, of a complex which physically links ER and mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib56\">Szabadkai et al., 2006</a>). It is highly likely that this complex is the same as that containing IRBIT and Bcl2l10 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Although Grp75 knockdown altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between ER and mitochondria, the role of\u00a0the\u00a0IP<sub>3</sub>R-VDAC complex in ER-mitochondria contact has not been clearly investigated (<a href=\"#bib56\">Szabadkai et al., 2006</a>). Additional experiments to reassess the role of this complex and of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the formation of MAMs may facilitate further understanding of how IRBIT is involved in ER-mitochondria contact. An additional possibility is that IRBIT interacts with different partners in MAMs. Indeed, numerous proteins, such as the Fis1-Bap31 complex (<a href=\"#bib31\">Iwasawa et al., 2011</a>), PERK (<a href=\"#bib59\">Verfaillie et al., 2012</a>), the VAPB-PTPIP51 complex (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stoica et al., 2014</a>), and Drp-1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Prudent et al., 2015</a>) have been shown to localize in MAMs and to regulate ER-mitochondria contact. IRBIT could then associate with some of these proteins to form a tethering complex between ER and mitochondria."

                        "text": "The fact that IRBIT S68A failed to promote ER-mitochondria contact (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) raises the question of the impact of IRBIT dephosphorylation on contact point stability during apoptosis. Indeed, it can be speculated that IRBIT removal from MAM during apoptosis may phenocopy IRBIT KO and reduce ER-mitochondria contact,\u00a0thereby decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria instead of increasing it. However several studies have shown that ER-mitochondria contacts increase\u00a0during apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Csord\u00e1s et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Verfaillie et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Prudent et al., 2015</a>). In particular, Drp-1 is recruited in ER-mitochondria contact points during apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Prudent et al., 2015</a>) and PERK may also be recruited as its KO abolishes the increase of ER-mitochondria contact points during apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib59\">Verfaillie et al., 2012</a>). Our\u00a0hypothesis,\u00a0therefore, is that prior to apoptosis, phosphorylated IRBIT promotes ER-mitochondria contact and\u00a0thus\u00a0sets up a platform for proper apoptosis. Following the induction of apoptosis, IRBIT is dephosphorylated and translocated into\u00a0the\u00a0cytosol, but other proteins such as Drp-1 or PERK are also recruited to MAMs to strengthen ER-mitochondria contact and then compensate IRBIT removal. In IRBIT KO cells, these proteins are probably still recruited, but as ER-mitochondria contacts are smaller, increasing these contacts is not sufficient to insure pro-apoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer."

Interestingly, IRBIT expression was found to be reduced in a\u00a0human ovarian cancer cell line (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jeong et al., 2012</a>). As Bcl2l10 is highly expressed in the ovary (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guillemin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Inohara et al., 1998</a>), we can assume that the reduction of IRBIT expression in the\u00a0ovarian cancer cell line leads to an increased activity of Bcl2l10, which may contribute\u00a0to the usual resistance of cancer cells\u00a0to\u00a0apoptosis. Moreover, it was recently shown that IRBIT inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), an enzyme that\u00a0provides\u00a0the dNTP pool for DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib7\">Arnaoutov and Dasso, 2014</a>). In cancer cells, high activity of RNR is necessary to supply the dNTPs required for rapid cell proliferation, and increased RNR activity is frequently observed in cancer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Aye et al., 2015</a>). Thus, reduced expression of IRBIT may contribute to resistance to apoptosis due to increased Bcl2l10 activity and reduced ER-mitochondria contact, and additionally to cell proliferation by\u00a0promoting increased RNR activity. These observations, associated with the fact that IRBIT expression was found to be reduced in cancer cell lines that are resistant to DNA-damging drugs (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wittig et al., 2002</a>), highlight the key role of IRBIT in tumorigenesis, and may lead to a new definition of IRBIT as a tumor suppressor."

Further results support a proposed model in which apoptotic stimuli lead to dephosphorylation of IRBIT, releasing it and Bcl2l10 from the IP<sub>3</sub>R, and thereby increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from ER to mitochondria and promoting apoptosis.

So, in a similar manner, it is possible that the pool of endogenous IRBIT, which is dephosphorylated during apoptosis, is sufficient to remove the large majority of Bcl2l10 from ER membranes and then favors apoptosis.
