                    "text": "Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are sequence-specific DNA binding proteins found in a range of plant pathogenic bacteria, where they play important roles in host-pathogen interactions. However, it has been unclear how TALEs, after they have been injected into the host cells, activate transcription of host genes required for infection success. Here, we show that the basal transcription factor IIA gamma subunit TFIIA\u03b35 from rice is a key component for infection by the TALE-carrying bacterium <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>, the causal agent for bacterial blight. Direct interaction of several TALEs with TFIIA\u03b35 is required for activation of disease susceptibility genes. Conversely, reduced expression of the <i>TFIIA\u03b35</i> host gene limits the induction of susceptibility genes and thus decreases bacterial blight symptoms. Suppression or mutation of <i>TFIIA\u03b35</i> can also reduce bacterial streak, another devastating disease of rice caused by TALE-carrying <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i>. These results have important implications for formulating a widely applicable strategy with which to improve resistance of plants to TALE-carrying pathogens."

However, it has been unclear how TALEs, after they have been injected into the host cells, activate transcription of host genes required for infection success. Here, we show that the basal transcription factor IIA gamma subunit TFIIA\u03b35 from rice is a key component for infection by the TALE-carrying bacterium <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>, the causal agent for bacterial blight. Direct interaction of several TALEs with TFIIA\u03b35 is required for activation of disease susceptibility genes. Conversely, reduced expression of the <i>TFIIA\u03b35</i> host gene limits the induction of susceptibility genes and thus decreases bacterial blight symptoms. Suppression or mutation of <i>TFIIA\u03b35</i> can also reduce bacterial streak, another devastating disease of rice caused by TALE-carrying <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i>. These results have important implications for formulating a widely applicable strategy with which to improve resistance of plants to TALE-carrying pathogens."

For example, at least five <i>Xanthomonas</i> species use proteins called transcription activator-like effectors (or TALEs for short) to infect their host plants. The bacterial proteins are essentially injected into the plant\u2019s cells where they activate specific plant genes that make the host more susceptible to infection. Like other organisms, plants use proteins called transcription factors to switch genes on or off. However, it was not clear if the TALEs hijack the plant\u2019s transcriptional machinery to activate these \u201csusceptibility genes\u201d or if they activate the genes via some other means."

The bacteria inject TALEs via their Type III secretion system (T3SS) into host cells, where they translocate to the nucleus and bind host gene promoters in a sequence-specific manner. The DNA binding domain consists of variable repeats that together account for a predictable DNA recognition code (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Moscou and Bogdanove, 2009</a>). This property has been exploited for programmable DNA binding, and has allowed targeted genome editing by combining TALE DNA binding domains with nucleases (TALENs) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Maggio and Gon\u00e7alves, 2015</a>). TALE-like proteins are not restricted to the genus <i>Xanthomonas</i>, and have also been found in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (<a href=\"#bib6\">de Lange et al., 2014</a>), and in the endosymbiont <i>Burkholderia rhizoxinica</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">de Lange et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Juillerat et al., 2014</a>).

The rice accession IRBB5 carrying <i>TFIIA\u03b35<sup>V39E</sup></i> is indistinguishable from the near-isogenic line IR24 in plant morphology and agronomic performance, including heading date, flag leaf length, number of panicles per plant, panicle length, grains per panicle, 1000-grain weight, yield per plant, seed setting rate, grain length, width, and thickness, with only slightly reduced plant height (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Here, we have shown that not only the specific point mutant <i>TFIIA\u03b35<sup>V39E</sup></i> has increased <i>Xoo</i> resistance, but also that this can also be achieved by RNAi mediated knockdown of <i>TFIIA\u03b35</i>. In addition, we have shown that TALEs from other <i>Xanthomonas</i> pathogens, such as <i>Xoc</i>, exploit <i>TFIIA\u03b35</i>. Alteration of <i>TFIIA\u03b35</i> activity, either through the\u00a0introduction of the <i>TFIIA\u03b35<sup>V39E</sup></i> allele, or through other reduction-of-function mutations, can provide a general strategy for improving rice resistance to TALE-carrying pathogens. TALE-carrying bacteria cause diseases in many other crops (<a href=\"#bib29\">Schornack et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Boch et al., 2014</a>). If these bacteria also exploit the host TFIIA\u03b3 for infection, modification of TFIIA\u03b3 may provide a road to improving disease resistance in other crops as well."

However, the results of interaction strength between transcription factor-binding (TFB) region of TALEs and TFIIA\u03b35 analyzed by Y2H (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2) are supported by the results of in planta analyses. To confirm whether a strong interaction cause a higher level of susceptibility than a weak interaction, we swapped the TFB region of TALE pthXo1 with that from other TALEs that showed different interaction strength with TFIIA\u03b35 in Y2H. These recombinant TALEs were introduced into two <i>X. oryzae</i> strains, which do not carry PthXo1. Rice plants showed different levels of susceptibility to the two sets of bacterial strains carrying different recombinant TALE, which is consistent with the Y2H results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a> presents another set of similar results by using a TALE-free <i>X. oryzae</i> strain PH just for review purpose (because our collaborator wishes this TALE-free strain data to first appear in another paper). These in planta data suggest that <i>X. oryzae</i>-caused susceptibility requires efficient binding of TALE to TFIIA\u03b35 by its TFB region to activate rice susceptibility gene expression."

However, I do not quite agree with this reviewer about the requirement of t-test. A t-test is for testing significance of difference between two small samples (Robert Steel and James Torrie 1980 Principles and Procedures of Statistics A Biometrical Approach McGraw-Hill Book Company). If the sample sizes are larger than 30, z-test would be used and the test criterion would approximately follow a normal distribution. I have not seen in the literature any Q-PCR assay being repeated 30 times which is not necessary, neither am I aware any one has assessed the statistical distribution of Q-PCR data. But it seems that there is no reason to doubt that the Q-PCR value would not follow a normal distribution. Nevertheless, the t-test like the case here is useful for having some idea about the likely statistical significance of the differences observed in this kind of experiments, rather than not doing it at all."
