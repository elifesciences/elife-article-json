Such synthesis raises the question of what effect the necessary IRES dissociation from the tRNA binding sites, and ultimately from all of the ribosome, has on the rates of initial peptide elongation steps as nascent peptide is formed. Here we report the first results measuring rates of reaction for the initial cycles of IRES-dependent elongation. Our results demonstrate that 1) the first two cycles of elongation proceed much more slowly than subsequent cycles, 2) these reduced rates arise from slow pseudo-translocation and translocation steps, and 3) the retarding effect of ribosome-bound IRES on protein synthesis is largely overcome following translocation of tripeptidyl-tRNA. Our results also provide a straightforward approach to detailed mechanistic characterization of many aspects of eukaryotic polypeptide elongation."

Molecules called transfer RNAs bind to individual amino acids and bring them to the ribosome. Previous research has shown that, prior to initiation, IRESs on Cricket Paralysis Virus mRNAs bind to the ribosome and occupy sites where transfer RNAs would normally bind. However, it was not clear how this affects the elongation process. Zhang et al. now address this question using a cell-free system that allowed them to recreate and observe translation outside of the normal cell environment."

A likely explanation for this is that the IRES elements have to be displaced from the ribosome before the incoming transfer RNAs can occupy the three tRNA sites. However, as elongation progresses, the effects of the IRES elements are overcome and the pace of elongation increases significantly. Zhang et al.\u2019s findings provide a convenient approach that could be used for future studies of elongation. This approach could also help researchers find out how abnormalities in translation contribute to human diseases, including muscle-wasting disorders."

The cap-dependent pathway involves recognition of 7-methyl-guanosine at the 5\u2019-terminus of mRNA by a preinitiation complex of 40S ribosomal subunit and a host of initiation factors prior to a scanning step that results in initiator aminoacyl-tRNA(aa-tRNA) pairing with a cognate start codon, followed by 60S binding to form the 80S initiator complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</a>). The second pathway involves binding of the ribosome to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a structure that is present in many virus-encoded mRNAs, as well as in some cellular mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fitzgerald and Semmler, 2009</a>). Initiation of protein synthesis from an 80S\u00b7IRES complex can take place in the absence of some or even all of the initiation factors required in the cap-dependent pathway (<a href=\"#bib17\">Filbin and Kieft, 2009</a>), depending on the IRES source. The intergenic IRES of Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV-IRES) forms a complex with 80S ribosomes that is capable of initiating the synthesis of complete proteins in cell-free assays completely lacking initiation factors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jan et al. 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pestova and Hillen, 2003</a>). More recently, high resolution structural studieshave shown that, prior to polypeptide chain initiation, the closely related Dicistroviridae IRES structures from CrPV (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>) and Taura syndrome virus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Koh et al., 2014</a>) occupy all three tRNA binding sites (E, P, and A) on the ribosome, with the protein coding region beginning immediately downstream from IRES segment occupying the A-site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Since prior to the work reported in this paper nothing had been published concerning the rate of initial oligopeptide synthesis by an 80S\u00b7CrPV-IRES complex, it has been unclear whether there is a retarding effect due to the presence of IRES on the ribosome, and, if so, how many cycles of peptide elongation are required before the ribosome begins to form peptide bonds at a higher rate. In considering this question, we make use of the simplified 12-step scheme of initial tetrapeptide synthesis shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, which provides a useful framework for presenting the results described in this paper. In this scheme Steps 1\u20133 show the reactions required for initial binding of the first tRNA to the A site followed by translocation to the P-site, and reactions 4\u20136, 7\u20139, and 10\u201312 represent three elongation cycles, ending with P-site bound tetrapeptidyl-tRNA, completing the third cycle of polypeptide synthesis. This model makes the reasonable assumption that binding of successive aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) cognate to the mRNA requires the progressive removal of IRES structures from each of the tRNA binding sites, such that translocation of dipeptidyl tRNA to the P-site (structure <b>7</b>) requires removal of the IRES from the last of the three tRNA binding sites. In the work reported below, we demonstrate first, that the initial elongation steps are indeed quite slow and are limited by the translocation step of the elongation cycle, and second, that the rate of elongation accelerates following translocation of tripeptidyl-tRNA to the P-site."

In the absence of eEF2 (blue trace), the equilibrium position of Step 1, a so-called pseudo-translocation step (<a href=\"#bib40\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>) in which the IRES vacates the A-site, favors Structure <b>1</b> over Structure <b>2</b> by approximately 20-fold, consistent with recent structural studies (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Muhs et al., 2015)</a>.

These results indicate that, consistent with recent results of <a href=\"#bib54\">Petrov et al. (2016)</a>, the equilibrium between Structures <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is shifted in the presence of eEF2\u00b7GTP, such that approximately half of 80S\u00b7IRES is present as <b>2</b>.Phe-TC binding to <b>2,</b> resulting in the formation of\u00a0Structure <b>3,</b> accounts for the rapid phase in the red and black traces.

The near identity of the red and black traces, performed at different eEF2\u00b7GTP concentrations, suggests that this factor interacts with both <b>1</b> and <b>2,</b> with a dissociation constant significantly less than 1 \u00b5M. The large inhibitory effect of eEF2\u00b7GTP on <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> is consistent with its role as a translocase, and with recent results demonstrating that a principal role of EF-G, the prokaryotic equivalent of eEF2, is to inhibit back-translocation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adio et al., 2015</a>). eEF2\u00b7GTP inhibition of <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> may be due, at least in part, to a requirement for eEF2\u00b7GDP dissociation prior to Phe-TC binding."

For PheMet synthesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) we preform Structure <b>4</b> and measure its conversion to Structure <b>6</b>.\u00a0We measurePheLysMet synthesis, Structure <b>9</b>, starting from either Structure <b>4</b> or\u00a0Structure <b>7</b> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and PheValLysMet synthesis, Structure <b>12</b>, starting from either Structure <b>7</b> or Structure <b>10</b> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In all three cases, reactions involving only TC binding and a single peptide bond formation (<b>4</b> to <b>6; 7</b> to <b>9; 10</b> to <b>12</b>) proceed in remarkably similar fashion, each showing biphasic behavior with a rapid phase accounting for 65 \u00b1 10% of reaction proceeding with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of ~6\u20139\u2009s and a slower, minor phase proceeding much more slowly (t<sub>1/2</sub> ~220\u2013240\u2009s), possibly corresponding to defective ribosomes. Reactions involving formation of two peptide bonds, as in the conversion of <b>4</b> to <b>9</b> or <b>7</b> to <b>12</b> are well approximated as single phase reactions with t<sub>1/2</sub> values of 90\u2013110\u2009s. Conversion of <b>4</b> to <b>9</b> proceeds via Steps 4 \u2013 8, allowing the t<sub>1/2</sub> value for the translocation Step 6 to be estimated as 84\u2009s, from the difference between the t<sub>1/2</sub> value for the <b>4</b> to <b>9</b> reaction and the sum of the t<sub>1/2</sub> values for the <b>4</b> to <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> to <b>9</b> reactions (major phases). Similarly, the t<sub>1/2</sub> value for the translocation Step 9 can be estimated as 110\u2009s from the difference between the t<sub>1/2</sub> value for the <b>7</b> to <b>12</b> reaction and the sum of the t<sub>1/2</sub> values for the <b>7</b> to <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> to <b>12</b> reactions. Since the di-, tri- and tetrapeptides synthesized in the results reported in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> use different coding sequence mutants, these estimates of translocation t<sub>1/2</sub> values depend on the not unreasonable assumption that the identities of the tRNAs undergoing translocation do not have a major influence on the translocation rate. With this caveat, the results presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> lead to the clear conclusion that translocation is the rate limiting step in each of the first two cycles of polypeptide elongation, proceeding from <b>4</b> to <b>10</b>."

They demonstrate quite clearly that the first two cycles of elongation proceed much more slowly than subsequent steps, and that these reduced rates arise from slow, rate-determining, pseudo-translocation and translocation steps. Translocation during the first elongation cycle (Step 6) clearly requires displacement of the IRES from the E-site, so it is not unexpected that it would be slow. Less predictable is the slow translocation in the second elongation cycle, (Step 9) after the IRES structure has, presumably, already left the E-site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The slow rate of Step 9 might be due to a full dissociation of IRES from the ribosome during this step, a suggestion that could be tested by appropriately designed structural studies. In any case, our results do clearly demonstrate that, following translocation of tripeptidyl-tRNA from the A- to P-site, the pace of nascent peptide chain elongation picks up dramatically. Further work, comparing quantitatively the rates of successive cycles of nascent peptide elongation following tetrapeptide formation (i.e, cycles 4, 5, 6, 7, etc.) will be required to determine how many cycles are required before any retarding influence of bound CrPV-IRES is completely eliminated."

While we agree with the experimental results, and have in fact reproduced the cosedimentation result in our own work, we disagree with the conclusion.

Second, the coding sequences employed in this work are different from that immediately downstream of wt-CrPV-IRES (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). This is also unlikely to pose a major difficulty, given the strong evidence that mutations in the downstream sequence are, in general, tolerated without substantial effect on initiation of translation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hellen and Sarnow, 2001</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib55\">Rijnbrand et al., 2001</a>), although mutations of some downstream sequences do give rise to relatively minor changes in IRES activity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shibuya et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Third, the elongation rate of even the later cycles of IRES-dependent elongation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) is quite slow (~0.1\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>). Although this rate is essentially identical to that reported for tripeptide synthesis in a cap-dependent yeast-based in vitro translation system which requires five initiation factors and eEF3 in addition to eEF1A and eEF2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eyler and Green, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gutierrez et al., 2013</a>), it is 1.5\u20132 orders of magnitude slowerthan rates of peptide elongation that have been estimated for intact eukaryotic cells at 37\u00b0C (3\u201310\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boehlke and Friesen, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hershey, 1991</a>). There is evidence that, in many eukaryotic cells, the protein synthesis machinery is highly organized, containing several components, including ribosomes, a multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex, eEF-1A, and several auxiliary proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Negrutskii et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Negrutskii and El\u2019skaya, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">David et al., 2011</a>). It has been suggested that this organized structure optimizes translation rate by coordinating synthetase activities to facilitate channeling of aa-tRNAs to the elongating ribosomes. Thus, protein synthesis in a permeabilized mammalian cell, in which this structure is likely to be preserved, proceeds 40-fold faster than what is obtained in a cell-free system prepared from the same cells which presumably lacks this structure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Negrutskii et al., 1994</a>). The slow rates measured for both the IRES-dependent and cap-dependent in vitro systems could be due, at least in part, to their lack of aa-tRNA channeling. Such channeling would be unlikely to accelerate the very slow translocation rates in the initial peptide elongation cycles reported in this work, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other proteins present in vivo might have such effects. Future efforts will address this issue. Here, incorporation of some of the features of a recently introduced in vitro\u00a0protein synthesissystem in which initiation is carried out using the IRES from hepatitis C virus could be useful (<a href=\"#bib38\">Machida et al., 2014</a>)."

The resulting puromycin adduct, Phe-Val-Lys-Met-puro(H+), released into solution, was also identified by MALDI: calculated, 978.7; found, 978.9."

The results suggest that the first two elongation cycles involved in producing a di- or tripeptide are slow and are limited by the translocation step, and that the rate of elongation accelerates following translocation of tripeptidyl-tRNA to the P-site (the second true translocation event). The IRES was suitably modified to replace the 1st Ala codon with a Phe codon, allowing fluorescence anisotropy measurements of the rate of proflavin-modified Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> binding to either the A- or P-site, and to allow incorporation of labeled Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> to monitor production of FM, FKM, FVKM, and FKVRQWLM synthesis. Sedimentation of complexes through sucrose gradients was used to assay stable binding of Met-tRNA or peptidyl-tRNAs containing labeled Met to the ribosome. The anisotropy results in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> suggest that EF2 shifts the equilibrium of the first pseudotranslocation step in which the IRES is moved in the decoding center to vacate the A-site, and thereby increases the rate of Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> binding to the A site in a biphasic reaction. The sedimentation assay indicates that the second pseudotranslocation step, in which Phe-tRNA is translocated from the A to the P site is much slower than the combination of the first pseudotranslocation plus Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> binding to the A site. They go on to use a rapid mixing and quench assay to measure rates of FM, FKM, and FKVM synthesis, with detection and quantification of product by thin layer electrophoresis (TLE), using the appropriate pre-formed substrates for addition of labeled Met to Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or the relevant peptidyl tRNA. Results in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> indicate that the rates of aa-tRNA binding to the A site and formation of a peptide bond are very similar for all 3 substrates that produce a di-, tri-, or tetrapeptide, and the calculated rates of translocation in these reactions indicate that the rates of translocation for the dipeptidyl- and tripeptidyl-tRNAs are slow and rate-limiting in forming the tri- and tetrapeptides, respectively. Using the sedimentation assay, they could also measure the very rapid rates of ternary complex binding to the A site in the 2nd and 3rd elongation cycles producing the tri- and tetrapeptides, but found that A-site bound TC or FM-tRNA was too unstable to capture for the intermediates 5-6 containing the IRES in the E site, which they speculate might involve an allosteric effect of the IRES in destabilizing A-site binding. By then measuring rates of puromycin reaction with either the tri- or tetrapeptidyl tRNAs either under conditions where prior translocation from the P-site to the A-site is required or where the peptidy-tRNAs are prebound to the A site, they deduce that the rate of the 3rd translocation of tetrapeptidyl-tRNA from the P to A site is very rapid compared to the 2nd or 3rd translocation events."

The slow rate of the 2nd translocation step is surprising because the IRES should no longer occupy the decoding sites, so they may be detecting a novel intermediate with the IRES still bound to the ribosome outside of the decoding center and affecting a ribosome conformational change involved in translocation. The results are also significant in providing evidence against the previous conclusion by others that EF2 is required for the first pseudotranslocation that moves the IRES out of the A site (step 1) to permit recruiting the first TC to the A-site, as here they found no effect of EF2 on the rate of this reaction when it is monitored directly by fluorescence anisotropy measurements as opposed to stable TC binding to the P site assayed by sedimentation, which occurs only after the second pseudotranslocation reaction (step 3). Finally, the results using the CrPV IRES are valuable in laying the groundwork for studying eukaryotic elongation in a simplified purified system without the need for initiation factors to form the first peptide bound. There are a number of instances where the reaction conditions or interpretations of results need to be more carefully described, as follows:"

The technical quality of the data is high (I particularly like the quality of the stopped-flow traces, they are really excellent) and the conclusions are warranted. My only reservation is that many technical aspects are not clearly described.

It is not clear why the native Ala codon was replaced by Phe, as unlabeled amino acids are used anyway and the tRNAs are prepared by a method which should readily yield tRNA(Ala), i.e. one could label tRNA(Ala) with Prf (Kothe and Rodnina, 2007). This means that in principle one could use the native sequence. Furthermore, the measurements and rate determinations would be even more straightforward if [14C] and [3H]-labeled amino acids were used instead of [<sup>35</sup>S]Met; in this case one could use the native sequence. The need for modifying the sequence should be more explicitly stated in Materials and methods. Clearly, the whole set of experiments cannot be repeated with Ala as a 1st amino acid; however, it would be highly desirable to compare IRES-mediated translation with a native sequence and a modified sequence in the cell-free translation system (commercial or reconstituted from components)."

Instead, peptidyl-tRNA tends to drop-off easily (see Semenkov 2000 and Konevega 2004). Although this dissociation is relatively slow, it normally explains the drop-off during centrifugation (which takes minutes to hours). In any case, there is no evidence for the allosteric interactions between the A and E sites. The statements on the allosteric interplay should be removed, as they only weaken the paper (subsection \u201cRates of oligopeptide formation and Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> cosedimentation\u201d, third paragraph) (By the way, the so-called \"allosteric effect\" is simply caused by the presence of deacylated tRNA in aa-tRNA preps, which chases the labeled tRNA from the E site.

The slow rate of the 2nd translocation step is surprising because the IRES should no longer occupy the decoding sites, so they may be detecting a novel intermediate with the IRES still bound to the ribosome outside of the decoding center and affecting a ribosome conformational change involved in translocation. The results are also significant in providing evidence against the previous conclusion by others that EF2 is required for the first pseudotranslocation that moves the IRES out of the A site (step 1) to permit recruiting the first TC to the A-site, as here they found no effect of EF2 on the rate of this reaction when it is monitored directly by fluorescence anisotropy measurements as opposed to stable TC binding to the P site assayed by sedimentation, which occurs only after the second pseudotranslocation reaction (step 3). Finally, the results using the CrPV IRES are valuable in laying the groundwork for studying eukaryotic elongation in a simplified purified system without the need for initiation factors to form the first peptide bound.

The technical quality of the data is high (I particularly like the quality of the stopped-flow traces, they are really excellent) and the conclusions are warranted.

This means that in principle one could use the native sequence. Furthermore, the measurements and rate determinations would be even more straightforward if [14C] and [3H]-labeled amino acids were used instead of [<sup>35</sup>S]Met; in this case one could use the native sequence. The need for modifying the sequence should be more explicitly stated in Materials and methods.

Instead, peptidyl-tRNA tends to drop-off easily (see Semenkov 2000 and Konevega 2004). Although this dissociation is relatively slow, it normally explains the drop-off during centrifugation (which takes minutes to hours). In any case, there is no evidence for the allosteric interactions between the A and E sites.

This suggest that the translocated complex (structure 2) is kinetically labile and contradicts the present statement that the back-translocation is negligible. Again, the authors should do experiments, e.g. toeprinting, to provide additional evidence that pre-incubation with eEF2-GTP shifts the equilibrium between structures 1 and 2 from 95:5 to 50:50 as stated.</i> "
