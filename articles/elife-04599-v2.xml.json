A central feature of actin dynamics is the capacity of filaments to polymerize and depolymerize at their ends in response to cellular conditions. It is currently thought that filament kinetics can be described by a single rate constant for each end. In this study, using direct visualization of single actin filament elongation, we show that actin polymerization kinetics at both filament ends are strongly influenced by the binding of proteins to the lateral filament surface. We also show that the pointed-end has a non-elongating state that dominates the observed filament kinetic asymmetry. Estimates of flexibility as well as effects on fragmentation and growth suggest that the observed kinetic diversity arises from structural alteration. Tuning elongation kinetics by exploiting the malleability of the filament structure may be a ubiquitous mechanism to generate a rich variety of cellular actin dynamics."

A central feature of actin dynamics is the capacity of filaments to polymerize and depolymerize at their ends in response to cellular conditions. It is currently thought that filament kinetics can be described by a single rate constant for each end. In this study, using direct visualization of single actin filament elongation, we show that actin polymerization kinetics at both filament ends are strongly influenced by the binding of proteins to the lateral filament surface. We also show that the pointed-end has a non-elongating state that dominates the observed filament kinetic asymmetry. Estimates of flexibility as well as effects on fragmentation and growth suggest that the observed kinetic diversity arises from structural alteration. Tuning elongation kinetics by exploiting the malleability of the filament structure may be a ubiquitous mechanism to generate a rich variety of cellular actin dynamics."

The growth of the barbed-ends was strongly influenced by which side-binding protein was interacting with the filament. For example, the barbed-end grew rapidly when a protein called VASP was present but grew more slowly in the presence of the protein \u03b1-actinin. Although the growth at the pointed-end was generally slow and sporadic, the side-binding proteins also had noticeable effects."

It was only when the proteins were present at higher levels that the growth of the actin filaments was altered depending on the specific side-binding protein present. One side-binding protein called \u03b1-actinin also altered the shape of the actin filament so that when it was present at high levels, the filaments curved in a particular direction. Together, these results suggest that the growth, structure, and flexibility of actin filaments can be strongly influenced by the various proteins that bind along the length of the filaments."

The molecular basis of actin filament turnover derives from the association and dissociation of monomers from each filament end and depends on the nucleotide (ATP, ADP \u00b7 Pi, or ADP) bound to the actin monomer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>). The filament is kinetically asymmetric, where one end (called the barbed-end) is observed to grow an order of magnitude faster than the other end (the pointed-end) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>). In addition, the critical concentration for polymerization is different for the two ends. The origin of the asymmetry is not fully understood. Measurements of filament elongation as a function of solution viscosity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Drenckhahn and Pollard, 1986</a>) and particle-analysis from cryo-electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib45\">Narita et al., 2011</a>) suggest the existence of a non-elongating state at the pointed-end. Although growth pauses have been previously observed during filament elongation measured using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fujiwara et al., 2007</a>), these pauses were attributed to artifacts and were not characterized further. The dynamics of the pointed-end plays an important role in both the origin of the differences in critical concentration observed at the two ends in the presence of ATP (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fujiwara et al., 2007</a>); and in filament treadmilling, where, barbed-end growth and pointed-end shrinking occur simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bugyi and Carlier, 2010</a>). Thus, we have focused on performing an accurate and detailed analysis of both barbed-end and pointed-end dynamics using TIRF microscopy."

End-binding proteins regulate actin dynamics by limiting elongation (at the barbed-end) or serving as anchor points (for the pointed-end). Side-binding proteins, on the other hand, are much more diverse encompassing myosin motors, cross-linkers or bundlers as well as severing proteins. The interaction of the actin filament with a particular subset of proteins defines the molecular composition, architecture, and overall turnover of sub-cellular arrays such as stress fibers and filopodia. Some of these arrays are tightly packed (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jasnin et al., 2013</a>) and dynamics of the filaments are influenced by the local environment. The mechanisms of how some proteins are recruited to these structures while others are excluded are a subject of intense research (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hansen et al., 2013</a>). Although the overall filament dynamics have been thought to be sensitive to the concentration of the side-binding protein (<a href=\"#bib5\">Breitsprecher et al., 2009</a>), it is not understood how and to what extent side-binding proteins alter filament kinetics, structure, and flexibility."

We chose three cross-linking proteins and one motor protein to represent the large variety of interacting proteins and used them to tether filaments directly to the surface of a glass slide for visualization. We used the chemically inactivated myosin II motor protein (NEM-myosin) as it is the standard choice for this type of assay (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</a>). The filamin protein (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kueh et al., 2008</a>) was used, which is an important player in cellular mechanosensing that is evolutionary-conserved (<a href=\"#bib56\">Razinia et al., 2012</a>), as its use as a tether has recently generated some debate (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mullins, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Niedermayer et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, we selected \u03b1-actinin, a molecule that, together with myosin II, forms stress fibers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Langanger et al., 1986</a>), and VASP, a protein that localizes to areas of dynamic actin reorganization such as filopodia and the lamelipodium (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rottner et al., 1999</a>). By carrying out these assays with several proteins that bind to the side of actin filaments, we were able to explore the possible range of modulation available to actin filament dynamics and delineate intrinsic filament properties."

The elongation velocity \u2018<i>E</i>\u2019 at the barbed-end was the fastest with VASP and the slowest with \u03b1-actinin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). By varying the free actin concentration from 0.3 to 2 \u03bcM, we estimated the barbed-end association and dissociation rates, <i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), using only the periods of elongation (i.e., E &gt; 1.5 sub\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>, referred to hereafter as the \u2018kinetically active\u2019 phases). Compared to the previously reported value of 11.6 sub\u00b7\u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> for actin only in the absence of tethering proteins (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>), we found a higher value of <i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub> in the presence of VASP, a similar value for actin alone and for NEM-myosin, and lower values when \u03b1-actinin or filamin were used (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Extrapolating the elongation velocity as a function of actin concentration to zero actin provides an estimate of the dissociation rate, <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub>, of ATP-actin at the barbed-end (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In the presence of filamin, <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> is indistinguishable from zero, whereas in the presence of VASP, <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> increased compared to the value in the presence of NEM-myosin (1.6 \u00b1 0.5 s<sup>\u22121</sup>). The estimated <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> we measured in the presence of NEM-myosin was in agreement with the previously reported value of 1.4 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>), whereas in the presence of \u03b1-actinin, <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> was lower than 1.4 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. The ratio of inferred dissociation rates to the calculated association rate (i.e., <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub>/<i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub>) is the critical concentration at which polymerization will occur and has been estimated to be \u223c150 nM for the barbed-end (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>). We find a similar value (\u223c0.2 \u03bcM) for filaments elongated in the presence of VASP, \u03b1-actinin and NEM-myosin, but close to zero for filamin. The use of VASP induced the largest change in the measured kinetics. In contrast to the other three proteins measured, the kinetics were enhanced. VASP is known to act as a polymerase at the barbed-end by delivering subunits to the growing end (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</a>). It achieves this function through its two actin-binding domains: a G-actin-binding domain that delivers monomers (via G-actin binding or GAB domain) while remaining attached to the filament via the F-actin-binding or FAB domain (<a href=\"#bib6\">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</a>). To rule out the polymerase activity of VASP as the cause of enhanced kinetics, we also tested a VASP construct that lacks the GAB domain but retains its capacity to interact with the filament lattice (<a href=\"#bib6\">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</a>). We continued to observe fast polymerization using this VASP-\u0394GAB protein as a tether (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) in agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib6\">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</a>). The measured kinetic rates were 70 \u00b1 30 sub\u00b7\u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> for <i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub> and 14 \u00b1 9 s<sup>\u22121</sup> for <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub>, about half of those determined using the full-length VASP construct. Therefore, the effect of immobilized VASP on filament kinetics is not only due to recruitment of monomers to the growing filament. These results demonstrate that ATP-actin kinetics at the barbed-end are sensitive to the particular side-binding protein interacting with the filament."

Such kinetically inactive phases were observed for all free actin concentrations tested (250 nM\u20132 \u03bcM). Above the pointed-end critical concentration (e.g., using a free actin concentration of 1 \u03bcM), we observed a discontinuous (i.e., growth-pause) behavior for all side-binding proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In the presence of VASP or filamin, pointed-end elongation was readily observed. Pointed-end elongation was much more difficult to visualize when using NEM-myosin and \u03b1-actinin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) where elongation occurred for brief periods of time and with slower rates. The elongation velocity during kinetically active phases was influenced strongly by the different tethering proteins used (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Elongation velocity followed the order of VASP &gt; VASP \u0394GAB &gt; filamin &gt; \u03b1-actinin &gt; NEM-myosin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). On the other hand, at 300 nM free actin monomer concentration, i.e., below the pointed-end critical concentration of \u223c600 nM (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>), we observed barbed-end growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and pointed-end depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), i.e., treadmilling, in the presence of filamin as a tethering protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Treadmilling was also present using NEM-myosin and \u03b1-actinin, albeit with slower rates, since pointed-end depolymerization establishes the overall treadmilling rate. In contrast to our expectations, there was no shrinkage at the pointed-end below the critical concentration but polymerization in the presence of VASP or VASP \u0394GAB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These results suggest that side-binding proteins can also determine actin filament pointed-end growth and depolymerization dynamics. Additionally, these results show that observed effects at one end do not necessarily represent effects at both ends. For example, filamin reduces only the dissociation rate (and therefore the critical concentration) at the barbed-end although it alters both the association and dissociation rate at the pointed-end."

Therefore, we measured the elongation rates and pausing as a function of the side-binding protein surface density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For this, we varied the total protein concentration that was allowed to adsorb to the glass surface, therefore changing the number of tethering proteins that interact with a single filament. We estimated the lattice-binding protein surface density from the protein concentration, the sample volume (\u223c10 \u03bcL) and the surface to which the sample was adsorbed (a flow cell of 5 mm \u00d7 20 mm, giving 100 mm<sup>2</sup>) as done previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Howard et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Crevenna et al., 2008</a>). All protein in solution was assumed to adsorb on the upper and lower glass surfaces. To achieve consecutive lower tether densities, the total protein concentration was serially diluted. At low tethering protein concentrations, individual filaments swiveled around distinctive attachment points indicating that they are bound to single tethering molecules as observed previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Howard et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Crevenna et al., 2008</a>). To estimate the density in an alternative manner, we measured the average number of pivot points per micron of filament at the two lowest protein concentrations and divided that by the average area covered during swiveling. Assuming a linear scaling with protein concentration, this estimate results in a lower density (by a factor of 2) compared to those reported in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and throughout the text. Estimated densities ranged from \u223c5 up to \u223c18,000 molecules\u00b7\u03bcm<sup>\u22122</sup>, which are equivalent to values between 0.1 and 110 tethers per micron of filament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

Elongating actin filaments (at a free actin monomer concentration of 1 \u03bcM) showed mostly kinetically active phases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and the elongation velocity distributions were centered around \u223c9 subunits\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To investigate this possibility, we carried out experiments where a very low density of NEM-myosin was used to tether filaments to the surface while a second, side-binding protein was present in solution. We tested the effects of VASP, VASP-\u0394GAB, and filamin on filament growth. The influence of all three side-binding proteins on the elongation rate of both the barbed- and pointed-end were similar to what we observed when using them to immobilize the actin filaments to the surface (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We also performed these experiments with human VASP and the elongation rates measured for both <i>Dd</i> VASP and <i>Hs</i> VASP agree with previously reported results (<a href=\"#bib6\">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Single elongating filaments were measured at the lowest protein surface density possible that still allowed filament visualization. At the lowest \u03b1-actinin tether density used (5 molecules \u03bcm<sup>\u22122</sup>, which corresponds to 1 tether molecule every 5\u201310 microns along the filament), the ends swiveled around their tethering site due to Brownian motion and were clearly free of the surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Under these conditions, barbed-ends showed continuous elongation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) while pointed-ends were typically in the kinetically inactive state (only 2 of 50 filaments showed growth or depolymerization, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>). For the other tethering proteins, only the paused state was observed on freely swiveling pointed-ends (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using only the pause-free elongation velocities for each actin concentration tested, we estimated association and dissociation rates (slopes in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Our estimated values for the pause-free elongation kinetics agree well with those previously obtained by EM (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which were measured on the 20\u201360 s time scale. When we convolute our pointed-end pause-free elongation rate with the pausing probability, our results are comparable to the kinetics estimated by TIRF experiments (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</a>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that continuous pointed-end growth occurs at the beginning of filament assembly, which is suggested from our data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and is the time scale on which the EM data was acquired (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>). Moreover, the pausing probability, <i>P</i><sub>p</sub>, at either end was insensitive to the actin concentration used (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

Another possible source of pauses is light-induced photo-dimerization. From the work of <a href=\"#bib46\">Niedermayer et al. (2012)</a>, it is possible to quantitatively predict the accumulated fraction of filaments where depolymerization has been paused as a consequence of exposure to light (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast with this prediction, we observed all swiveling filament pointed-ends, under depolymerizing conditions, to be in a kinetically inactive state at the beginning of image acquisition (N = 40, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Here, a small seed (formed with atto565-labeled actin) was allowed to grow in solution for 15 min in the presence of atto488-labeled monomers, followed by stabilization, dilution, and visualization of the filaments (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). At a free actin concentration of 1 \u03bcM, the concentration used in solution to allow filament elongation, all pointed-ends are expected to grow at an average rate of \u223c0.5 sub/s (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard, 1986</a>). In contrast to this expectation, we observed that only 20% of the seeds grew at the pointed-end (N = 1000, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This percentage is higher than we observe in the surface-based experiments, which could be due to annealing of filaments in solution (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sept et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andrianantoandro et al., 2001</a>) or due to lack of the tethering protein. What is clear is that the non-elongating or paused state is not due to either surface or light-induced effects. Taken together, these results show that a single rate constant describes filament elongation kinetics from ATP-monomers in the absence of side-binding proteins and that the pointed-end has an intrinsic kinetically inactive state."

We also tested the mechanical effect of the side binding proteins on the actin filament when the actin filaments were attached to the surface with a low density of NEM-myosin and the side-binding protein was present in solution. Again, we observed a decrease in the persistence length of about 30% for filamin, \u03b1-actinin, and NEM-myosin, whereas the effect was about 50% in the presence of VASP or VASP \u0394GAB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

We hypothesize that structural alteration might be the origin of kinetic modulation. To test how well this interpretation could explain our results, we constructed a simple model based on long-range structural alterations to describe elongation as a function of tether density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In our model, the interaction between a growing filament and a tethering protein gives rise to a modified association rate (i.e., <math id=\"inf8\"><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><mn>0</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>) at the site of interaction, which then propagates over a certain distance <i>L</i><sub>C</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). From the interaction site, there is a linear decay of the modified association rate, as a linear decay would be expected for the release of torsional stress. Using a Monte Carlo method (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details), we calculated <i>\u03b1</i> and <i>L</i><sub>C</sub> (which are the only free parameters) by comparing the simulated elongation rates to the experimental values and minimizing the \u03c7<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This simple model satisfactorily described our experimental results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, solid lines) and provides an estimate for the propagation length. We also considered the possibility that VASP acts via a \u2018local increase in monomer concentration\u2019 similar to <a href=\"#bib7\">Breitsprecher et al. (2011)</a> (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). This local concentration model did not account for the tether density dependence of elongation velocity (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), nor it can account for the effect observed with VASP \u0394GAB that does not have the capacity to bind actin monomers."

Through accurate measurements of pointed-end association kinetics, we have observed that experiments performed in the absence of tethering proteins and in the presence of VASP or VASP \u0394GAB yielded equivalent critical concentrations for both ends (\u223c0.2 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This implies that, under these conditions, detailed balance at equilibrium is fulfilled, i.e., <math id=\"inf9\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><mi>B</mi></msubsup><mo>/</mo><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><mi>B</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><mi>P</mi></msubsup><mo>/</mo><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><mi>P</mi></msubsup></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hill, 1987</a>). We propose that the existing discrepancy in estimated critical concentrations at both ends (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fujiwara et al., 2007</a>) originates from the presence of a previously uncharacterized kinetically inactive or non-elongating state at the pointed-end. This kinetically inactive state is consistent with a non-elongating structural conformation observed by cryo-electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib45\">Narita et al., 2011</a>). The kinetic asymmetry of the pure actin filament may be low (\u223c3) and such non-elongating or closed conformation at the pointed-end would reinforce the effective filament asymmetry. The transition at the pointed-end from the open to the closed state may be coupled to ATP hydrolysis or phosphate release at the terminal subunit. The presence of this open-to-closed transition at the pointed-end would explain why the terminal subunit has an estimated different rate of phosphate release compared to the filament lattice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fujiwara et al., 2007</a>)."

                        "text": "Actin filaments in association with any of the five proteins tested displayed a change in elongation velocity, an increase in pausing, and a change in filament flexibility. Therefore, it is possible that these three characteristics have a common origin. For three of these filament-binding proteins (myosin, \u03b1-actinin, and filamin), the binding interface to the actin filament is formed by two consecutive monomers along the same strand (<a href=\"#bib19\">Galkin et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lorenz and Holmes, 2010</a>). These side-binding proteins might directly occlude the binding site for the next monomer either partially (reducing the elongation velocity) or completely (giving rise to an elongation pause). Partial distortion of the filament could turn into a defect that propagates along the lattice decreasing the observed filament stiffness and impacting the association rate. In this respect, side-binding proteins could be thought of as allosteric regulators of actin filament kinetics. Indeed, actin filaments are known to be subject to allosteric regulation by other associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Egelman and Orlova, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Galkin et al., 2012</a>). In particular, myosin (<a href=\"#bib55\">Prochniewicz and Thomas, 1997</a>), cofilin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Galkin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Prochniewicz et al., 2005</a>), dystrophin (<a href=\"#bib53\">Prochniewicz et al., 2009</a>), and utrophin (<a href=\"#bib53\">Prochniewicz et al., 2009</a>) are known to induce structural changes in the actin filament. Similar to filamin and \u03b1-actinin, dystrophin and utrophin bind actin through calponin-homology (CH) domains (<a href=\"#bib22\">Galkin et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, binding to the filament is cooperative for cofilin (<a href=\"#bib14\">De La Cruz, 2005</a>), \u03b1E-catenin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hansen et al., 2013</a>), and myosin (<a href=\"#bib47\">Orlova and Egelman, 1997</a>). The basis for this allosteric regulation could originate from the stabilization of an existing structural state of the filament (<a href=\"#bib21\">Galkin et al., 2001</a>), given that the actin filament is structurally polymorphic (<a href=\"#bib22\">Galkin et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, it is possible that the observed elongation kinetics and pauses arise from direct modulation of the filament structure. In line with this hypothesis, two other proteins, the actin-binding domain of \u03b1E-catenin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hansen et al., 2013</a>) and an N-WASP construct (<a href=\"#bib34\">Khanduja and Kuhn, 2014</a>), have recently been shown to alter filament kinetics and one of them, the actin-binding domain of \u03b1E-catenin, also influences filament structure (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hansen et al., 2013</a>). Although atomically accurate simulations and more high resolution experiments are required to understand the molecular basis of monomer association and dissociation from the filament ends, our results provide evidence that lattice structural changes affect actin filament growth kinetics. The influence of different side-binding proteins on the growth kinetics was found to persist over different length scales. Although we do not currently know the mechanism of this difference, it is interesting to note that actin-binding proteins with globular binding domains (\u03b1-actinin, filamin, and NEM-myosin) have short-range affects whereas VASP and VASP \u0394GAB, which have an unstructured binding motif, have more long-range affects."

As actin filaments form part of the cell cortex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Biro et al., 2013</a>) and focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</a>) where they assemble into oligomeric membrane-anchored complexes with many actin-binding proteins tethered to the plasma membrane surface, our studies may not be too far from the biologically relevant situation in living cells. Moreover, the cell interior is very crowded (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luby-Phelps, 2000</a>) and some sub-cellular actin arrays are tightly packed (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jasnin et al., 2013</a>). Both of these conditions may lead to the immobilization of actin-binding proteins and generate similar constrains during filament growth. In addition, the presence of side-binding proteins in solution is sufficient for altering the filament kinetics and mechanics. Depending on the local cross-linker protein abundance in the cell, turnover kinetics on the order of 1 \u03bcm of filament within \u223c1 min can be achieved, a rate at which treadmilling could become a contributing factor to cellular retrograde flow in the lamellipodium (<a href=\"#bib63\">Watanabe and Mitchison, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ponti et al., 2004</a>). Additionally, filament structural changes generated by side-binding proteins may also play a more active role in the identity and turnover of actin-based sub-cellular structures than previously thought, by regulating processes such as branching and fragmentation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hansen et al., 2013</a>) or network mechanics (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jensen et al., 2014</a>). Given the vast number of side-binding proteins, kinetic modulation via structural alteration may be a general regulatory mechanism of actin dynamics."

To estimate the density in an alternative manner, we measured the average number of pivot points per micron of filament at the two lowest protein concentrations and divided that by the average area covered during swiveling.

This is a potentially interesting study that combines a variety of approaches to study a challenging and timely problem: how allostery can modulate the polymerization dynamics of biologically important polymers. From my perspective the most interesting claim is that different side-binding proteins can differentially tune the polymerization kinetics by perturbing/modulating the structure of the filament over length scales that exceed nearest neighbor relationships. Even while recognizing the challenging and interesting nature of the subject under study, however, I am not convinced that the authors' data provide unambiguous support for their headline claims."

Without the big effect evident from VASP, I think the results are less striking because much more modest in nature. The problem with VASP as a 'side-binder' is that it contains a g-actin binding domain and can function as a polymerase. I think at minimum the authors would need to perform experiments using VASP with a debilitated or missing g-actin binding domain to unambiguously ascribe the effects they observed to the side-binding activity of VASP. Otherwise they need to do some significant re-phrasing and acknowledge that maybe the VASP polymerase activity is contributing to the fast elongation, and this will mitigate and confuse the impact of their findings about the possible role(s) of side-binders. I think such an experiment should be readily achievable."

Effects on pausing are more substantial but it seems possible those are artifacts (see next point). In any event, pausing does not seem to be the core point of the paper. If I understand <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> properly, beside VASP there is little effect on 'pause-free E' until a density of about 1000 side-binders per \u03bcM^2. If I calculated right that is 1 side-binder roughly every 8 nm. But at 370 actins/\u03bcM of polymer, 8 nm average spacing between side-binders equates to something like one every 3 actins. Requiring such high densities undermines the claim of longer-range effects."

Is it possible to do a subset of these experiments with side-binder in the solution but not on the coverslip (and using low densities of NEM-myosin on the coverslip)? If so, and if similar changes were observed it would help argue against the possibility that the results were an artifact of having a coverslip coated with filament binders. I don't view such an experiment as essential, but it would help. Likewise, unless I am overlooking something the bending seemed like it could be largely explained by a model in which the high density of side-binder simply 'grabbed' a fluctuating filament end."

Maybe they did, of course, but alternative explanations have not been convincingly ruled out. How to fix this is not obvious, but for me the connection between the TIRF results and the Brownian dynamics was too tenuous, and for me this weak connection undermined the thrust of their interpretation."

Although some studies suggest that side-binding proteins can, through long range conformational effects, affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of monomer addition and dissociation at the filament ends, this has not yet been carefully examined. Moreover, there is some controversy in the recent literature on single actin filament dynamics arising from technical problems in the measurements. The work here addresses these issues through quantitative TIRF imaging of filament dynamics, and some computational analyses. The authors have used a new, more accurate procedure to determine the instantaneous position of the filament ends during imaging, which has revealed new aspects of filament dynamics not observed (or observable) in previous studies. This has led to several interesting conclusions, including that different side-binding proteins have different effects on actin binding and dissociation rates at the filament ends, and that the pointed end significantly populates a kinetically-trapped state."

The data in the <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> supplements are compelling in this regard. Nevertheless, both of their fluorophores, atto565 and atto488, are attached to actin in the same manner, through non-specific coupling to lysine residues. It is possible that the modified sites are particularly prone to photo-crosslinking. It would add even greater strength to their arguments (and be easy to do) to also try maleimide labeling, which uniquely modifies cysteine 376 in actin. Related to this point, the authors need to characterize and describe the labeling of their actin with atto488/565: how many sites on average were modified, what was the variability from preparation to preparation, what collection of sites were modified? How do they know that the labeling did not affect the properties of the actin?"

I am highly suspect of the ability of MD simulations to accurately predict binding rates from the different structural models. The system is too complex, and the structural models themselves are at too low resolution. Further, it is almost certain that an actual filament samples many different structures contained within the manifold sampled by the available models. The finding that different structures produce different predicted rates in the calculations is not surprising; different starting points should give different simulations. But I don't see how these computed rates can be meaningfully interpreted or related back to the experimental data (e.g. is the Namba mode 3 structure a better model for the filament because it gives kinetic parameters that better match the experimental data? We can't know, since we don't know how well the simulations predict the kinetics in the first place). So I don't feel that the simulations either support or refute a relationship between structure and kinetics."

This is a potentially interesting study that combines a variety of approaches to study a challenging and timely problem: how allostery can modulate the polymerization dynamics of biologically important polymers. From my perspective the most interesting claim is that different side-binding proteins can differentially tune the polymerization kinetics by perturbing/modulating the structure of the filament over length scales that exceed nearest neighbor relationships.

The problem with VASP as a 'side-binder' is that it contains a g-actin binding domain and can function as a polymerase. I think at minimum the authors would need to perform experiments using VASP with a debilitated or missing g-actin binding domain to unambiguously ascribe the effects they observed to the side-binding activity of VASP. Otherwise they need to do some significant re-phrasing and acknowledge that maybe the VASP polymerase activity is contributing to the fast elongation, and this will mitigate and confuse the impact of their findings about the possible role(s) of side-binders.

The authors should repeat these measurements for long actin filaments to test if their conclusion still holds.
