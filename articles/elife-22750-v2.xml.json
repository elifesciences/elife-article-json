Here we report that Arabidopsis microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are distinctly partitioned between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol. All miRNAs are associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs) as opposed to polysomes in general. The MBP association is functionally linked to a deeply conserved and tightly regulated activity of miRNAs \u2013 production of phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from select target RNAs. The phasiRNA precursor RNAs, thought to be noncoding, are on MBPs and are occupied by ribosomes in a manner that supports miRNA-triggered phasiRNA production, suggesting that ribosomes on the rough ER impact siRNA biogenesis. This study reveals global patterns of cytoplasmic partitioning of small RNAs and expands the known functions of ribosomes and ER."

Here we report that Arabidopsis microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are distinctly partitioned between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol. All miRNAs are associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs) as opposed to polysomes in general. The MBP association is functionally linked to a deeply conserved and tightly regulated activity of miRNAs \u2013 production of phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from select target RNAs. The phasiRNA precursor RNAs, thought to be noncoding, are on MBPs and are occupied by ribosomes in a manner that supports miRNA-triggered phasiRNA production, suggesting that ribosomes on the rough ER impact siRNA biogenesis. This study reveals global patterns of cytoplasmic partitioning of small RNAs and expands the known functions of ribosomes and ER."

This results in enhanced silencing and the spreading of the silencing signal into flanking sequences.

In fact, a widespread and deeply conserved phenomenon in diverse land plants is miRNA-triggered production of phased secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from target transcripts (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib17\">Fei et al., 2013</a>]). Upon miRNA-guided cleavage of a target RNA, either the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 cleavage fragment is converted by RdRP to double-stranded RNA, which is then successively diced into 21-nt phasiRNAs, with the phase determined by miRNA-guided cleavage (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Axtell et al., 2006</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, eight noncoding <i>TAS</i> loci generate phasiRNAs in this manner and, as the phasiRNAs regulate target genes in trans, they are termed trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Axtell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Peragine et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rajagopalan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Vazquez et al., 2004b</a>). Most miRNAs are 21 nt long and do not trigger phasiRNA production. A predominant mechanism (termed the \u2018one hit model\u2019) to trigger phasiRNA production is by a 22-nt miRNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cuperus et al., 2010</a>); the <i>TAS1</i>, <i>2</i>, and\u00a04 loci are examples of the \u2018one-hit\u2019 model with 22-nt miR173 or miR828 as the trigger (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rajagopalan et al., 2006</a>). In a \u2018two-hit\u2019 model, a pair of 21-nt miRNAs target the same transcript to cause phasiRNA production (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axtell et al., 2006</a>). The three <i>TAS3</i> loci are such examples, each containing two sites for miR390 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axtell et al., 2006</a>), a miRNA that associates with AGO7 instead of AGO1 to trigger phasiRNA production (<a href=\"#bib38\">Montgomery et al., 2008</a>). In addition to the noncoding <i>TAS</i> loci, a small number of protein-coding genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> such as immune receptor (<i>NBS-LRR</i>) and pentatricopeptide repeat (<i>PPR</i>) genes are targeted by 22-nt miRNAs and produce phasiRNAs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Howell et al., 2007</a>)."

In addition, both SGS3 and AGO7 are present in the microsomal fraction (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jouannet et al., 2012</a>), implicating that ta-siRNA biogenesis occurs on a cytoplasmic membrane structure. A recent study found that <i>TAS3</i> RNA is bound by ribosomes, and ribosomes on <i>TAS3</i> RNA are stalled by AGO7 at the miR390-binding site, implicating that ta-siRNA biogenesis from <i>TAS3</i> occurs on polysomes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hou et al., 2016</a>)."

We found an intriguing difference between miRNAs and siRNAs in their membrane-cytosol partitioning. We showed that all miRNAs, including 22-nt miRNAs, were associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs) as opposed to polysomes in general. The plant miRNA effector AGO1 associated with membranes in part in an RNA-independent manner, recruited miRNAs to membranes, and exerted its endonuclease activity on MBPs. Reduced membrane-association of 22-nt miRNAs in an <i>ago1</i> mutant led to reduced levels, or loss of phasing, of phasiRNAs. The <i>TAS</i> transcripts, presumed to be noncoding, were actually bound by MBPs in a manner that supports phasiRNA production. These findings establish MBPs as the site of action of plant miRNAs and uncover a role of ribosomes and the ER in siRNA biogenesis, thus expanding the known functions of the rough ER."

To gain a global view of the membrane association of cellular small RNAs (sRNAs), we performed sRNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) for total (T) and microsomal (M; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) RNAs. Three biological replicates were highly reproducible (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). For an initial analysis, we quantified sRNAs by normalizing against total reads. The T sRNA population was characterized by two prominent size classes, 21 nt and 24 nt, as previously observed (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kasschau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lu et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

However, we found that a few miRNA target transcripts were present on MBPs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2013</a>).

Note that this purification scheme could not result in MBPs as pure as the previous method (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), but was used here to allow the comparison between MBP and FP RNAs. In brief, total extracts were first separated into microsome and cytosol fractions, from which MBPs and FPs were then isolated, respectively. The MBP and FP profiles on sucrose gradients were as expected (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The microsome, cytosol, MBP, and FP RNAs were then subjected to polyA+ RNA-seq in three biological replicates (reproducibility is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Clustering analysis using the 5000 top varying transcripts (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3.1</a>) showed that the microsome and MBP fractions clustered together and the cytosol and FP fractions clustered together (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This indicated that the separation of these fractions was successful. We next examined transcripts encoding transmembrane domain-containing proteins; these transcripts were expected to be translated on MBPs (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3.2</a>). Indeed, many of these transcripts showed higher abundance in microsome than cytosol (green circles in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and in MBP than FP (green circles in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This further validated the successful fractionation. Most cellular transcripts were similarly represented on MBPs and FPs, with a large fraction over-accumulated on MBPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Likewise, the majority of predicted and known targets of miRNAs (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3.3</a>) were equally represented on MBPs and FPs, with few being depleted from MBPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

As expected, phasiRNAs from all 23 examined loci (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>; <i>TAS3</i> loci excluded) were nearly eliminated in <i>ago1-36</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). For 21 of the 23 phasiRNA loci examined, the overall abundance of siRNAs was significantly reduced in <i>ago1-27</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). In <i>ago1-27</i>, the siRNAs from <i>AGO1</i> RNA were similar in abundance to wild type, but the phasing triggered by miR168-guided cleavage was nearly lost (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Notably, miR168 was one of the most affected miRNAs in terms of membrane association in <i>ago1-27</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As a control, the abundance of <i>TAS3</i> ta-siRNAs (triggered by miR390-AGO7) was not reduced (they were in fact increased) in <i>ago1-27</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The phasing of <i>TAS3</i> ta-siRNAs was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Therefore, the reduction in phasiRNAs levels from non-<i>TAS3</i> loci in <i>ago1-27</i> was not due to inability of the AGO1-27 protein to bind phasiRNAs. The AGO1-27 protein was still associated with miRNAs, as shown by AGO1 IP followed by northern blotting to detect miRNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The AGO1-27 protein was still capable of miRNA-guided cleavage in an in vitro slicer assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), consistent with the previous conclusion that the <i>ago1-27</i> allele is normal in miRNA-guided cleavage in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brodersen et al., 2008</a>). Thus, reduced phasiRNA abundance, or loss of phasing, coincided with decreased membrane association of the triggering miRNAs in <i>ago1-27</i>. These data, together with the finding that miRNA-guided cleavage occurs in M and MBP fractions, suggested that phasiRNA production occurs, or at least starts, on MBPs. This is also consistent with the reported membrane association of ta-siRNA biogenesis factors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jouannet et al., 2012</a>)."

The ribosome-protected portions corresponded to the short open reading frames (ORFs) present in these RNAs. Amazingly, the miRNA-binding site was at the boundary of ribosome-protected and non-protected portions in each <i>TAS</i> transcript (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), and the region unbound by ribosomes generated ta-siRNAs (compare sRNA-seq reads with ribo-seq reads in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

In this study, we examined the ER- and rough ER-association of small RNAs as well as cellular mRNAs. We found that most cellular mRNAs were enriched on MBPs or equally partitioned between MBPs and FPs. This indicates that most mRNAs, including miRNA target transcripts, are translated both on the rough ER and in the cytosol.

We propose that the sequestration of 22-nt miRNAs and miRNA target transcripts on MBPs prevents them from engaging in phasiRNA production. We propose that the rough ER is somehow capable of inhibiting the entry of most protein-coding transcripts into the phasiRNA biogenesis pathway. The <i>TAS</i> genes and a handful of protein-coding genes have evolutionarily adapted to the rough ER environment by having an optimal arrangement between the miRNA binding site and ribosome occupancy to enable phasiRNA biogenesis.

A gradient fractionation system (ISCO) was used to collect the monosome fraction. Monosomal RNAs were extracted with TRI Reagent (MRC), and resolved on 15% Urea-PAGE. RNAs corresponding to 25\u201335 nt were recovered from the gel and phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB). Next, the monosomal RNAs were further polyadenylated with PolyA Polymerase (NEB), and reverse transcribed with the primer oligodT linkerM (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a>), followed by cDNA circularization with CircLigase (EpiCenter). rRNAs were removed by hybridization with biotin conjugated DNA probes (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a>) followed by capture with Dynabead M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen).

They found that miRNAs and their targets were associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs). They also found that the AGO1 complexes purified from microsomal fraction (M) had slicer activity and 3'cleavage products could be detected in M and MBP fractions. They thus conclude that MBPs are the places where miRNA-guided cleavage occurs. More interestingly, the authors found that the phasiRNA-triggering 22-nt miRNAs and their targets including non-coding TAS transcripts were present on MBPs, suggesting phasiRNA biogenesis may be initiated on MBPs. These findings provide new insights into miRNA-guided target cleavage and phasiRNA biogenesis. Detailed comments are listed below."

As ago1-27 is a week allele and the mutation has no strong effects on miRNA accumulation and slicer activity, suggesting that the mutant AGO1-27 can still bind miRNAs. The authors can test this by AGO1 IP followed by small RNA Northern blot. This is confirmed. Then the next question is how the mutation affects miRNA association with M. Does this mutation affects AGO1 association with M? This can be easily addressed by an AGO1 Western blotting with M/MBP fractions in ago1-27."

Our understanding of miRNA regulation in plants has always been more advanced than animal miRNAs, mostly because the target mRNAs for plant miRNAs are so much easier to identify and study in depth. Rather than getting confused by the poorly predicted target mRNAs of animal miRNAs, the plant field has focused on the known targets and discovered amazing biology such as the phased siRNAs triggered by plant miRNAs on their target mRNAs. This paper takes another major step by purifying mRNAs and associated siRNAs from membrane fractions and finding a dramatic difference between ER polysomes and run of the mill cytoplasmic ribosome. The difference depends on how well the authors purify the various subcellular fractions and they use various compartment specific reagents to assess their purification schemes. It is convincing fractionation and the results are dramatic. The authors demonstrate step by step that AGO1 mediates the ER association of miRNAs with mRNAs, that this association is not tied to secretion of the encoded proteins, but that AGO1 is mediating the association with polysomes. And that these miRNAS cleave target mRNAs and thus trigger the production of phased siRNAs from the miRNA phase mark. The Discussion is stunningly short and to the point."
