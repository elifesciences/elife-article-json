It consists of nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine motifs (FG domains). As a bottom-up nanoscale model for the permeability barrier, we have used planar films produced with three different end-grafted FG domains, and quantitatively analyzed the binding of two different nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), NTF2 and Importin \u03b2, together with the concomitant film thickness changes. NTR binding caused only moderate changes in film thickness; the binding isotherms showed negative cooperativity and could all be mapped onto a single master curve. This universal NTR binding behavior \u2013 a key element for the transport selectivity of the NPC \u2013 was quantitatively reproduced by a physical model that treats FG domains as regular, flexible polymers, and NTRs as spherical colloids with a homogeneous surface, ignoring the detailed arrangement of interaction sites along FG domains and on the NTR surface."

It consists of nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine motifs (FG domains). As a bottom-up nanoscale model for the permeability barrier, we have used planar films produced with three different end-grafted FG domains, and quantitatively analyzed the binding of two different nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), NTF2 and Importin \u03b2, together with the concomitant film thickness changes. NTR binding caused only moderate changes in film thickness; the binding isotherms showed negative cooperativity and could all be mapped onto a single master curve. This universal NTR binding behavior \u2013 a key element for the transport selectivity of the NPC \u2013 was quantitatively reproduced by a physical model that treats FG domains as regular, flexible polymers, and NTRs as spherical colloids with a homogeneous surface, ignoring the detailed arrangement of interaction sites along FG domains and on the NTR surface."

The FG domains are thought to be highly flexible and behave like natively-unfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Denning et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Denning and Rexach, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Denning et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hough et al., 2015</a>). As such, they do not have a defined secondary or higher-order protein structure. However, depending on their intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, these proteins can organize into supramolecular assemblies such as protein meshworks, brushes or scaffolds (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dyson and Wright, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Uversky and Dunker, 2010</a>). There is a broad consensus that FG domains interact with NTRs and facilitate their passage through NPCs. In addition, there is an attractive (cohesive) interaction between FG domains. This promotes the formation and determines the properties of FG domain phases (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Frey and Gorlich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Frey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Patel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Schmidt and Gorlich, 2015</a>), and is also essential for the formation of a functional permeability barrier (<a href=\"#bib26\">Frey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hulsmann et al., 2012</a>). However, the nature of these interactions remains controversial (<a href=\"#bib65\">Peters, 2009</a>), both for the interactions between FG domains, and for the interactions between FG domains and NTRs. As a consequence, there remains a large uncertainty about the morphology of the permeability barrier (<a href=\"#bib27\">Frey and Gorlich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Frey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Peters, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rout et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yamada et al., 2010</a>) and about how it is influenced by the substantial enrichment of NTRs in the NPC conduit (<a href=\"#bib28\">Frey and Gorlich, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kapinos et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lowe et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mohr et al., 2009</a>)."

                        "text": "To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between FG domains and NTRs in the context of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, we have employed a novel approach that combines measurements of the uptake of NTRs by well-defined nanoscale assemblies of FG domains with (coarse-grained) computational modeling for a quantitative interpretation of the experimental results in terms of FG domain morphology and intermolecular interactions. Specifically, we produce films of end-grafted purified FG domains that are similar to the protein meshwork in NPCs, both in their thickness and in their FG motif density (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eisele et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">2013</a>). With such planar model systems it is possible to quantify NTR binding and investigate NTR-induced thickness changes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eisele et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Schoch et al., 2012</a>). Binding curves of several NTR/FG domain systems have been shown to deviate from an ideal Langmuir isotherm, suggesting that the binding avidity of NTRs to FG domain films strongly depends on the concentration of NTRs in the film (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eisele et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kapinos et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schleicher et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wagner et al., 2015</a>) and on the proportion of FG motifs that are occupied by NTRs. Here, we describe the use of this system to identify common features and obtain a more quantitative understanding of these interactions, by analyzing and comparing the binding of two different NTRs, nuclear transport factor 2 from <i>Homo sapiens</i> (NTF2) and Importin \u03b2 from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (Imp\u03b2), to plane-grafted FG domain films that each are generated from one of three different FG domains: the FG domain of Nsp1 from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (that has FxFG and just FG motifs), a glycosylated FG domain of Nup98 from <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> (Nup98-glyco; with primarily GLFG and just FG motifs) and an artificial, regular repeat with exclusively FSFG motifs (reg-FSFG). The two transport receptors differ in size (29.0\u2009kDa for the functional NTF2 homodimer and 95.2\u2009kDa for Imp\u03b2) and in the number and distribution of binding sites for FG domains. Two identical sites are located between the subunits of NTF2 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bayliss et al., 2002</a>), whereas for mammalian Imp\u03b2 two different sites have been identified by crystallography (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bayliss et al., 2000</a>) and molecular dynamics simulations have suggested there may be up to nine sites spread over the Imp\u03b2 surface (<a href=\"#bib38\">Isgro and Schulten, 2005</a>). Recent crystallography work revealed eight binding sites on the exportin CRM1 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Port et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that the dispersal of binding pockets across the protein surface is a common feature of the larger NTRs. The FG domains employed in this study differ in prevalent FG motif types, FG domain size, abundance of FG motifs relative to FG domain size (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), as well as in the distribution of FG motifs along the peptide chains and the composition of the spacer regions between FG motifs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Labokha et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Radu et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rout and Wente, 1994</a>)."

The agreement in curve shape is remarkable, given that the used FG domains provide a large spread of FG motif types and FG motif arrangement along the peptide chains (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and that the two tested NTR types differ both in size and in the number of binding sites for FG motifs."

This finding is in line with recent reports that propose a modulation of NTR binding by the presence of other NTRs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kapinos et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schleicher et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wagner et al., 2015</a>). In this context, it is worth noting that the areal density of bound NTR represents only a small fraction of the FG motif density available in the films. The total number of FG motifs per FG domain is 33 for Nsp1, 39 for Nup98-glyco and 16 for reg-FSFG (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Our data illustrate that, at <i>c</i><sub>NTR</sub> = 10\u2009\u03bcM, the films contained at least 10 and 50 FG motifs per bound NTF2 dimers and per bound Imp\u03b2, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). With two binding sites for FG motifs per NTF2 dimer, and up to nine binding sites per Imp\u03b2, this implies that no more than 20% of the FG motifs were simultaneously engaged in NTR binding. Importantly, NTR binding does not correlate with the total abundance of FG motifs: for example, Nsp1 binds more than twice the number of NTF2 per FG motif compared to Nup98-glyco (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), consistent with its binding NTF2 more strongly (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clarkson et al., 1997</a>)."

At higher concentrations, the thickness gradually increased, by between 5 and 35% at 10\u2009\u03bcM compared to the pristine FG domain film, depending on the FG domain type and grafting density. For Imp\u03b2 binding to Nsp1, there was a moderate and gradual thickness increase up to 25% at 10\u2009\u03bcM. In all cases, the increase in film thickness was smaller than or comparable with the dimensions of the NTRs. These findings are in clear disagreement with the film collapse by more than 50%, reported by Lim et al. on nanoscale islands of FG domain assemblies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lim et al., 2007</a>), and the 'nanomechanical collapse' model proposed based on those data.

We therefore hypothesized that it must arise from generic physical features of the FG domain / NTR system, among which are the nature of FG domains as flexible polymers and of NTRs as globular colloids, as well as the mean, overall interactions between FG domains and NTRs. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a previously developed computational model (<a href=\"#bib59\">Osmanovic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">2013b</a>) to planar surfaces (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The model treats polymers as beads on a chain, where the bead diameter is set to twice the contour length of an amino acid, to reproduce the flexibility of unfolded peptide chains (see Materials and methods); the interactions between FG domains are essentially smeared out over the whole (homogeneous) chain thus effectively including interactions between FG motifs, but potentially also with other parts of the FG domain chains. The model explicitly considers the confinement through grafting, the size, the flexibility, the geometrical excluded volume and the cohesiveness of FG domains, the concentration and geometrical excluded volume of NTRs, and the attraction between FG domains and NTRs. The polymer and the colloid surface are homogeneous, and two adjustable parameters regulate the interaction strengths (see Materials and methods): \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> the cohesiveness (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>) of polymer segments, and \u03b5<sub>pc</sub> the attraction between a polymer segment and a colloid.

The number of polymer beads was set to match the length of experimentally used FG domains. NTF2 dimers and Imp\u03b2 are represented as spherical colloids of 4.0 and 6.0 nm diameter, respectively. (<b>B</b>) Matching of the computational model with experimental data for FG domain films in the absence of NTRs. Horizontal lines represent the experimentally determined film thickness per amino acid for different FG domains (<i>black line</i> - Nsp1 at 4.9 pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>blue line</i> - Nup98-glyco at 5.4 pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>orange line</i> - reg-FSFG at 6.1 pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>), with shaded areas in matching colors indicating confidence intervals. Symbols represent the thickness as predicted by the computational model as a function of \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> for the different FG domains (at 5.5 pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>; colors match experimental data). The data points and the upper and lower ends of the vertical lines refer to the effective thicknesses where the densities have dropped to 5%, 1% and 10% of the maximal densities in the film, respectively.

As expected, the film thickness decreases (i.e., the film condenses) with increasing cohesiveness \u03b5<sub>pp</sub>. At any given \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> for the polymers representing Nsp1 and Nup98-glyco, the normalized thickness is identical, as would be expected based on mean field theory for polymer brushes, irrespective of the degree of cohesiveness (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zhulina et al., 1990</a>). The somewhat larger values for the roughly two-fold shorter chain representing reg-FSFG are thus likely to reflect finite-size effects. To obtain estimates for the cohesiveness parameter \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> for all FG domains, we compared the computational predictions (<i>symbols</i> in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) to the experimental thickness data (<i>horizontal bands</i> in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> shows \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> as a function of FG domain type, obtained via a cubic interpolation (<i>dashed line</i> in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) between the \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> values for which computational data were available. Because the interface between the film and the bulk solution is not ideally sharp, it was unclear a priori which computational density threshold (see Materials and methods) should match the effective thickness measured by QCM-D most accurately. Reassuringly, however, the results were only weakly influenced by the precise definition of film thickness that was used in the computational model, i.e., density thresholds of 1% or 10% instead of 5% typically altered the estimates for \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> by less than 10%. From the comparison of computation and experiment, it was clear that \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> for Nup98-glyco exceeded that of Nsp1, in good agreement with our previous study (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>), in which we also found Nup98-glyco to be more cohesive than Nsp1. Nup98-glyco and reg-FSFG have similar cohesiveness."

As pointed out previously (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>), this qualification per se does not imply a distinction between a 'brush-like, entropic' scenario (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lim et al., 2007</a>) of the NPC transport barrier on one side, and a hydrogel scenario (<a href=\"#bib26\">Frey et al., 2006</a>) on the other. The main distinguishing factor between these opposing scenarios is the level of cohesiveness of the FG domains, which in our computational model is parameterized by \u03b5<sub>pp</sub>, and defines the compactness of the FG domain phase (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>). From the comparison between experimental and computational results for the thickness of the different FG domain films (in the absence of NTRs, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), it appears that the FG domain assemblies are compacted by a factor two to four compared to a film of perfectly non-cohesive (\u03b5<sub>pp</sub> = 0, equivalent to a self-avoiding random walk model) and flexible peptide chains, as follows from an extrapolation of the computational data (dashed lines in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In spite of this condensation, the measured film thickness (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) for Nsp1 is larger than the inner radius of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> NPC (18 to 20 nm [<a href=\"#bib1\">Alber et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Yang et al., 1998</a>]), and that for Nup98-glyco more than 60% of the inner radius of the <i>X. tropicalis</i> NPC (~25 nm [<a href=\"#bib18\">Eibauer et al., 2015</a>]).

Future studies should test if a different behavior is found for less cohesive FG domains and/or other NTRs. Our analysis in terms of the Hill equation indicates negative cooperativity for NTR binding to the FG domain assemblies. This implies that the free energy of binding per NTR decreases with an increasing amount of bound NTR in the film, and that this decrease is more pronounced than would be expected for the one-to-one binding of NTRs to independent and uncorrelated binding sites (i.e., the Langmuir isotherm).

Key findings of the present work are that this negative cooperativity appears robust against variations in NTR and in the spread of FG motifs between Nsp1, Nup98-glyco, and reg-FSFG, and that it can be reproduced, over orders of magnitude in NTR concentration, by a model that considers the FG domains as homogeneous polymers and the NTRs as featureless spheres, i.e., ignoring chemical and structural heterogeneity."

Firstly, a small reduction in \u03b5<sub>pc</sub> produces a dramatic decrease in the uptake of colloids by the FG domain films (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This is of major functional importance: by its strong dependence on \u03b5<sub>pc</sub>, the variable colloid uptake explains how FG domain assemblies in the NPC greatly favor the uptake of NTRs over other cytosolic proteins, which have been inferred to also bind FG domains (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hough et al., 2015</a>), albeit more weakly. This then explains how, because of the selective uptake, NTRs can efficiently translocate across the NPC while more weakly binding proteins cannot. We anticipate that this predicted fine tuning can be experimentally validated by systematically adjusting protein affinity to FG domain assemblies, which awaits further studies."

This is consistent with the remarkable selectivity exhibited by NPC transport and suggests that the cohesiveness of the FG domains is tuned to be as tight as possible to optimize exclusion of inert proteins by their size (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>), while still sufficiently loose to facilitate penetration by NTRs. These features also lend themselves to further experimental validation: the model predicts how NTRs are distributed in FG domain assemblies and how these distributions depend on the interaction strength between NTRs and FG domains, which can be verified in future neutron or X-ray reflectometry measurements on FG domain films."

The observed sensitivity to the values assigned to parameters offers an explanation of why different modeling approaches thus far have led to qualitatively different predictions of FG domain behavior in the NPC (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ando et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gamini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ghavami et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miao and Schulten, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mincer and Simon, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Moussavi-Baygi et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Opferman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Osmanovic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Popken et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tagliazucchi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wolf and Mofrad, 2008</a>), where most models succeed in capturing at least some aspects of experimental data on NPCs. The here observed sensitivity to parameter settings indicates that it is critical to calibrate computational models and their parameters against well-controlled experiments. We propose that experimental data obtained on well-defined FG domain assemblies (such as those provided and used here), possibly complemented by structural data of isolated FG domains in solution (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yamada et al., 2010</a>), could serve as reference for such calibration. It would be desirable that identical sets of reference data are used by the computational modelers, as this would enable rigorous comparison between different computational approaches.

That said, given the observed insensitivity to chemical heterogeneity of the FG domains, one can estimate the level of detail that will need to be included for building an appropriate model and understanding of mechanisms of selective transport in the NPC. The results presented here indicate that it is essential to take into account the flexible nature and cohesion of FG domains, as well as the crowding of NTRs that bind to the FG domain assemblies, but that heterogeneity at the scale of amino acids may only be of minor importance."

This similarity suggests that \u2013 while the overall balance of interactions is essential \u2013 the detailed chemical and structural heterogeneity of the FG domains is not a critical factor for how NTRs interact with FG domain assemblies and thus with the NPC.

In previous studies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eisele et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">2013</a>), we found that the thickness results obtained by QCM-D for FG domain films are comparable to within the specified confidence levels to those obtained with other techniques (atomic force microscopy and SE), thus confirming that the thickness determination is robust."

Woollam Co.), to quantify protein surface densities. The fitting methods for QSX335 and QSX340 sensor substrates are described in detail in refs. (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carton et al., 2010</a>) and (<a href=\"#bib20\">Eisele et al., 2012</a>), respectively. Irrespective of the substrate, the FG domain film was treated as a transparent Cauchy film with an effective optical thickness <i>d</i><sub>SE</sub> and a wavelength-dependent refractive index <i>n</i>(\u03bb). Protein surface densities \u0393 where obtained through de Fejter\u2019s equation (<a href=\"#bib12\">De Feijter et al., 1978</a>), i.e., \u0393 =\u00a0<i>d</i><sub>SE</sub>\u0394<i>n</i> / (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>\u00a0\u00d7 d<i>n</i>/d<i>c</i>), where \u0394<i>n</i> is the difference in refractive index between the FG domain film and the buffer solution (assumed to be wavelength independent) and <i>M</i><sub>W</sub> the protein molecular mass. We used d<i>n/</i>d<i>c</i> = 0.18 cm<sup>3</sup>/g as refractive index increment for our protein films (<a href=\"#bib70\">Richter et al., 2013</a>). The resolution in \u0393 \u00d7 <i>M</i><sub>W</sub> was typically 0.5 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>. Among the optical mass-sensitive techniques, SE is particularly suited to quantify the areal mass density of organic films up to a few 10 nm thick, because mass determination is virtually insensitive to the distribution of material within the film (<a href=\"#bib70\">Richter et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "To model the experimental systems, we adapted a classical density functional theory approach that was derived, validated against Monte Carlo simulations, and applied in previous studies of polymers in a cylindrical confinement (<a href=\"#bib59\">Osmanovic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">2013b</a>). We described the FG domain assembly as a collection of one-end-grafted polymers anchored homogeneously to the bottom of a cylinder of 100 nm in diameter and 120 nm in height (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Each polymer was modeled as a string of physically and chemically identical beads that can rotate freely with respect to each other. The bead diameter and (fixed) bond length of the polymers were both taken to be 0.76 nm, such that each bead is in direct contact with its nearest neighbors on the string. Specifically, this yields a Kuhn length of 0.76 nm, i.e., twice the contour length of an amino acid, and a persistence length of 0.38 nm, mirroring the flexibility of unfolded polypeptide chains (<a href=\"#bib77\">Stirnemann et al., 2013</a>). The number of beads per polymer chain was chosen to be 300, 260 and 155 to represent Nsp1, Nup98-glyco and reg-FSFG, respectively. These numbers match half the number of amino acids (except the His tag used for anchorage) of the respective FG domain constructs being modeled, and thus the contour length, to within 5% (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The polymer grafting density was set to 5.5 pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>, i.e., 3.3 polymers per 100 nm<sup>2</sup>, to approximately match the FG domain grafting density in the NPC and the majority of the experimental data sets presented here. It was kept identical for the different FG domains to facilitate comparison and cross-validation of the computational results. For significantly lower grafting densities, lateral heterogeneity became increasingly important \u2013 as also observed experimentally (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>) \u2013 partly invalidating our approach in that regime. On the other hand, for significantly higher grafting densities, excluded-volume interactions were such that the computational convergence was much harder to achieve. NTF2 was represented as a colloidal sphere of 4.0 nm diameter, where the latter value was based on the diameter of a sphere that approximately includes the atomistic NTF2 dimer structure (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bayliss et al., 1999</a>). Similarly, Imp\u03b2 was represented as a sphere of 6.0 nm, roughly matching the atomistic Imp\u03b2 structure (<a href=\"#bib25\">Forwood et al., 2010</a>), and 50% larger than NTF2, in agreement with a difference in diameter expected based on the mass difference between Imp\u03b2 and NTF2. The colloidal spheres could freely diffuse into and out of the cylinder with a chemical potential corresponding to the molar concentration, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib61\">Osmanovic et al., 2013b</a>)."

The attractive interactions were of the generic, exponential form with a decay length of 1 nm. \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> and \u03b5<sub>pc</sub> were varied to map the morphological space of the FG domain/NTR films as a function of the balance between inter and intra FG domain interactions on the one hand, and FG domain-NTR interactions on the other.

They appear to provide definitive evidence against large-scale conformational changes that have been proposed to accompany NTR interactions with FG domains.

It is worth emphasizing that a Hill coefficient that is less than unity is necessary but not sufficient to invoke negative cooperativity. Further, the modeling does not seem to provide a rationalization for the proposed negative cooperativity.</i> We thank the reviewers for this question regarding the negative cooperativity and its implications for the interactions involved in transport through NPCs. We followed the standard textbook definitions when describing the binding as negatively cooperative when the Hill coefficients are less than unity. For example, Voet D &amp; Voet JG, Biochemistry, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011), specifies: \u201cThe quantity <i>n</i>, the Hill constant, increases with the degree of cooperativity of a reaction and thereby provides a convenient, although simplistic, characterization of a ligand-binding reaction. [\u2026] If <i>n</i> &lt; 1, the reaction is termed negatively cooperative\u201d. Because of the rather simplistic nature of this definition, in the text we explicitly describe the meaning of \u201cnegatively cooperative\u201d in the context of our work and say \u201cthat the free energy of binding per NTR decreases with an increasing amount of bound NTR in the film, and that this decrease is more pronounced than would be expected for the one-to-one binding of NTRs to independent and uncorrelated binding sites (i.e., the Langmuir isotherm)\u201d. We included this more precise definition in the section \u201cUniversal aspects and negative cooperativity in NTR binding to FG domains\u201d."

Specifically, we infer that, beside the binding energy (that is included in simple Langmuir behaviour), NTR binding is affected by \u201ccrowding and excluded-volume interactions, and by the entropic costs of NTR absorption that, in turn, reduce the conformational freedom of the grafted and flexible FG domains\u201d."

In particular, is it possible to obtain equivalent fits with a polymer model that belongs to a completely different universality class such as a self-avoiding random walk for example? A suitable set of reference models needs to be constructed, as should a suitable random prior to understand why one should put faith in the model.</i> The choice of the polymer model used in this manuscript is based on our earlier work (<a href=\"#bib59\">Osmanovic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Osmanovi\u0107 et al., 2013b</a>, including the supplementary material) in which the polymer model and polymer-colloid model were extensively tested and validated against Monte Carlo simulations. We have expanded the text (in the section \u201cComputational model\u201d) to discuss this point more extensively. In response to the reviewers\u2019 comment about different universality classes, we would like to emphasise that our model encompasses different types of polymer behaviour and indeed our manuscript does not make any claim about FG domain behaviour belonging to one particular universality class or another. These types of behaviour are generally accounted for by our model, depending on the particular parameter settings employed. For example, the self-avoiding random walk model raised by the reviewers corresponds to our polymer model with \u03b5<sub>pp</sub> = 0 (just hard-sphere interactions). However, this model does not provide a good match to the experimental data as can be inferred from the revised section \u201cFG domain films are significantly compacted compared to non-cohesive polymer brushes\u201d."

Although the matching of experimental data is nice, the predictive insights that emerge from the model remain unclear. This is important because one would like to know specific predictions in order to design ways to test the merits of the model.</i> We are grateful for this suggestion and have expanded the text to outline more fully the implications of the modelling for nucleocytoplasmic transport. In our view, one of the most exciting perspectives is to predict and to test transport selectivity through the NPC, along the lines we discuss in the final paragraph of the section \u201cTowards a minimal physical model for the NPC\u201d. We have expanded our original discussion here and make more explicit our prediction that this transport selectivity may be modelled and understood by taking into account the flexible nature and cohesion of FG domains and crowding alone, so that one can circumvent the complications inherent in including precise details of much of the underlying chemistry and sub-molecular structure."

Consequently, we have revised and expanded the Discussion to describe more fully how the predictions of the model can be tested with additional experiments, in particular the distributions of NTRs in FG domain films (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and the extreme dependence on protein uptake on the protein affinity for the FG domains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Thus, transport through NPCs generally concerns the translocation of folded, globular proteins, and so does the uptake of transport receptors in our FG domain assemblies and consequently is on a different scale to the passage of flexible polymers through very narrow pores. Consequently we feel that Muthukumar\u2019s work is not strictly relevant to the system that is being investigated in our manuscript, but would be delighted to follow more specific guidance by the reviewers on this topic."
