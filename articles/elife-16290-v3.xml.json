Blinks are rarely noticed by the subject as blink-induced alterations of visual input are blanked out without jeopardizing the perception of visual continuity, features blinks share with saccades. Although not perceived, the blink-induced disconnection from the visual environment leads to a loss of information. Therefore there is critical need to minimize it. Here we demonstrate evidence for a new type of eye movement serving a distinct oculomotor demand, namely the resetting of eye torsion, likewise inevitably causing a loss of visual information. By integrating this eye movement into blinks, the inevitable down times of vision associated with each of the two behaviors are synchronized and the overall downtime minimized."

Blinks are rarely noticed by the subject as blink-induced alterations of visual input are blanked out without jeopardizing the perception of visual continuity, features blinks share with saccades. Although not perceived, the blink-induced disconnection from the visual environment leads to a loss of information. Therefore there is critical need to minimize it. Here we demonstrate evidence for a new type of eye movement serving a distinct oculomotor demand, namely the resetting of eye torsion, likewise inevitably causing a loss of visual information. By integrating this eye movement into blinks, the inevitable down times of vision associated with each of the two behaviors are synchronized and the overall downtime minimized."

This revealed that correcting eye movements did indeed occur at the same time as blinks, but unexpectedly the movements were different from those that had been recorded in previous studies. Further experiments then confirmed that the blinks themselves triggered this new type of corrective movement, rather than the loss of vision that resulted from the blinks. Khazali et al. propose that by synchronizing the resetting movements with blinks, the brain ensures that the eyes are damp wiped and restored to their optimal positions while minimizing visual disturbance. The next challenge is to identify the circuit of neurons in the brain that underlies these eye movements and to clarify how this circuit interacts with the one that controls blinking."

Although normal visual input is blanked out for ~300 milliseconds during blinks, we rarely perceive these gaps due to what is called blink suppression (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bristow et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Volkmann et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Volkmann, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Manning et al., 1983</a>), the attenuation of visual sensitivity during blinks. This mechanism is useful to eliminate the visual consequences of eye and lid movements during blinks (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ridder and Tomlinson, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Volkmann et al., 1968</a>). But it comes with the cost of losing the connection to the visual world for the duration of the blink (<a href=\"#bib28\">VanderWerf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bour et al., 2000</a>). Without compensation this loss would lead to a discontinuous visual perception. However, previous experiments in humans have shown that the visual system is able to ensure an illusion of continuity by bridging the perceptual gaps (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bristow et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Shultz et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, in cases quick behavioral responses may be demanded, the blink frequency may be temporarily reduced in order to provide more time for the processing of behaviorally relevant visual information. For example during reading, we blink only 4\u20135 instead of 15\u201320 times per minute (<a href=\"#bib23\">Shultz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bentivoglio et al., 1997</a>). Another mechanism, reducing the down time of the visual system is the synchronization of blinks with saccades, the latter likewise blanking out vision due to saccadic suppression (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fogarty and Stern, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Zee et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Evinger et al., 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1984</a>)."

One of these reflexes is the torsional optokinetic nystagmus (tOKN) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Farooq et al., 2004</a>). It consists of a slow phase in which the eyes pursue the rotation of the visual stimulus in order to reduce the slip of its retinal image, followed by a torsional fast phase in the opposite direction. The fast phase, generally considered to rely on the brainstem premotor circuitry for saccades (<a href=\"#bib26\">Tozzi et al., 2007</a>), ensures that the eyes stay within the mechanical limits of the plant. In view of the tight interaction of voluntary saccades and blinks we expected that also the involuntary fast phases of the tOKN might be synchronized with blinks in order to minimize the overall down time of the visual system. Here we report that the overarching goal to optimize visual perception is actually met in a surprisingly different manner. Rather than combining fast phases with blinks, the oculomotor system deploys a novel type of resetting movement which is qualitatively different from fast phases."

This following movement, the slow phase of the torsional optokinetic nystagmus (tOKN), was time and again interrupted by fast movements in the opposite direction, corresponding to the fast phases of the tOKN, which aim to move the eyes back towards zero torsion. This resetting was, however, imperfect as reflected by a gradual build-up in the direction of the optic flow until a plateau of ~3\u20138 deg was reached. This plateau varied between subjects and experimental blocks. This build-up is a consequence of a smaller cumulative amplitude of fast phases as compared to the cumulative amplitude of slow phases."

During the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phases I and II, once the eyes showed an optokinetic nystagmus and had gradually reached their respective plateau of up to 8 deg, we observed a change in the eye position towards zero torsion associated with each blink. We will refer to this eye movement as blink-associated resetting movement, BARM (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a>). The amplitudes of these BARMs were in the order of one degree (1.34 \u00b1 1.3 deg, mean \u00b1 std across subjects). In the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I, when only the fixation dot was present and deviations from zero were small, BARMs were also seen, but they were less frequent, more variable in direction and smaller (0.6 \u00b1 0.89 deg, mean \u00b1 std, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>). In the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase II, however, in which the visual conditions were not different from the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I, but the average eye position had not yet fully returned to zero torsion, BARMs were much more frequent and of larger amplitude (0.68 \u00b1 0.79 deg mean \u00b1 std, p=0.02, fixation in darkness phase II vs. fixation in darkness phase I, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a> for one of the subjects; for the other subjects see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that the probability and the amplitude of BARMs are determined by the deviation of the eyes from zero torsion, no matter if an optokinetic stimulus is present or not. In accordance with this view, we found the amplitude of BARMs to be linearly correlated with the size of the pre-blink torsional eye position, which is the deviation from zero torsion (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, the amplitude of BARMs was not related to the slow phase preceding the blink, since the amplitude of the slow phase, defined by the difference of the torsional eye position between the onset of the slow phase and the onset of the blink, was not correlated with the amplitude of BARMs (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, for the other subjects see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In other words, the absolute torsional eye position matters but the latest history of the slow phase does not. Although the correlation between the amplitude of BARMs and the pre-blink eye position was strongest for the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), in which the optokinetic stimulus was present and the deviation from zero was largest, we found similar relationships also for the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I and phase II. This supports the view that BARMs are not restricted to optic flow stimuli but that they are a ubiquitous phenomenon. In accordance with the correlation analysis, also the slope of the regression of the BARM amplitude as a function of the pre-blink torsional eye position was largest for the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II, intermediate for the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase II and smallest for the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I. In order to elucidate if theses experimental phase differences were a consequence of different ranges of pre-blink torsional eye positions in the various phases, the regressions and the correlations were recalculated for exactly the same, constrained range of pre-blink torsional eye positions (\u22122 deg to 2 deg). <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> shows that the differences between phases in terms of the quality of fits and the slopes of the regression lines stayed. This indicates that the BARM amplitude is not only dependent on the pre-blink torsional eye position preceding a single BARM but additionally influenced by the average torsional eye position of a phase. It suggests a gain modulation of the linear relation between pre-blink torsional eye position and BARM amplitude according to superordinate requirements."

                                "text": "Are BARMs, in fact, fast phases coinciding with blinks? The occurrence of BARMs during the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phases I and II argues against this objection. In these phases there was no optokinetic stimulus present that could give rise to a fast phase optokinetic response. Moreover, the fixation in darkness period I did not follow a preceding exposure to an optokinetic stimulus, excluding fast phases as hangovers of earlier optokinetic stimulation. Further evidence for a qualitative difference between BARMs and fast phases comes from an analysis that we performed for fast phases in analogy to the one for BARMs described before. In the case of fast phases, the preceding slow phase amplitude, i.e. the difference between the onset and the offset of the slow phase explains a large part of the amplitude of the following fast phase (r = \u22120.35 \u00b1 0.1 mean \u00b1 std. across subjects, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, mean slope of 0.33). On the other hand, the torsional eye position at the onset of the fast phase has little if any influence on the size of the fast phase amplitude (correlations are only weak and inconsistent: significant correlation in 3 out of 5 subjects, r = \u22120.18 \u00b1 0.09 mean \u00b1 std. across subjects, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is very different from BARMs, in which \u2013 as said earlier - it is the pre-blink torsional eye position which determines the size of the BARM. Moreover, the amplitude of the fast phases are dependent on the optic flow direction. This is why they form two separated clusters in plots of fast phase amplitude as function of the direction of the optic flow. Fitting these two clusters requires separate linear regressions yielding different regression slopes and offsets in comparison with fitting them as one pool (see Materials and methods). On the other hand, BARMs form a continuous distribution with similar regression slopes and offsets independent of the direction of the optic flow. This was confirmed by having almost no difference between the regression slopes produced by fitting blinks as two separated pools, depending on the optic flow direction, and by fitting them as one (see details in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure\u00a03</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure\u00a03\u2014figure supplement 1</a> legends and Materials and methods). We conclude that BARMs and fast phases are functionally two distinct entities (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and F</a>)."

We observed nasal and downward eye movements during blinks very similar to previous descriptions of blink-associated eye movements during fixation in the absence of torsional optic flow (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bour et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bergamin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Straumann et al., 1996</a>). The analysis of torsional eye movements during blinks showed some divergence across subjects. Four out of five subjects had long lasting blink-associated eye movements, composed of two clearly distinct components (Ha: 369 \u00b1 54 ms; Mo 316 \u00b1 18 ms; Da 367 \u00b1 13 ms; Ph 372 \u00b1 45 ms mean \u00b1 std duration). In one subject, the two components were not clearly distinguishable because they were most probably merged (see Figure 5 for reasoning)."

The torsional dimension of the first component was always directed clockwise. Since the right eye was measured this component corresponds to an extorsional eye movement. It was supplemented by a nasal downward movement as compared to the pre-blink position. These properties match the ones previously described for blinks during fixation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bour et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bergamin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Straumann et al., 1996</a>). Importantly, we found this first component not only in the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I and II, when the subject had to fixate in darkness, but also in the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II when the optic flow was present. The profile of this first component did not change significantly between phases and, most noteworthy, the direction of it was not changed by the direction of the optic flow, which would be required if it had a compensatory role (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The only relation between the first component\u2019s torsional dimension and BARMs was found in \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II, in which the torsional amplitude was larger when the optic flow pointed in the same direction, i.e. clockwise, as compared to the counterclockwise direction. This was reflected by a negative correlation between the amplitude of the first component and the amplitude of BARMs (r = \u22120.43, p=0.0001, based on the four subjects with two components). In other words, the tiny influence of the optic flow on the first component was congruent with the optic flow direction. For this reason it cannot account for the compensatory action of BARMs."

Columns represent three different experimental phases. Red traces are eye movements from blocks in which the optic flow during the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I rotated CW, grey traces indicate blocks with CCW optic flow. The same color code is used to distinguish eye movements in the two darkness phases, which preceded the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I or followed by the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 \u2018phase II\u2019 the one with CW or CCW optic flow. To facilitate the comparison of eye movement directions during blinks with the overall eye position during a phase, the insets in each panel plot the mean eye position (\u00b1 std) for the whole duration of the respective experimental phase. Note that the torsional eye movement response consists of two distinct components: the first one is positively (= extorsionally) directed and constant across the three phases, whereas the following second component is directed opposite to the overall eye position of a phase in accordance with a role in resetting the eye torsion to zero. For better visibility the torsional component is 3-times magnified (indicated by the difference in the scale of the y-axis). The eye traces are aligned to the peak velocity of the first component. Eye traces are plotted from 80 ms before and 300 ms after that time. Dashed vertical lines indicate the mean start and end of blinks obtained from the video eye tracking (see Materials and methods). To show the time points used for determining the eye position after the blink (blink end plus safety temporal distance to avoid artifacts) vertical green lines with shadows were added representing the mean \u00b1 std (across experimental blocks for Ha). Note that the second component starts during the eyelid closure and it proceeds after the point of recognizing the pupil (second dashed line), which could be during partially opened lid and not necessarily at the offset of the eyelid opening (see Materials and methods). The blink starting point taking the safety temporal distance in to account lays with around 50 ms before the onset of the figure."

Its peak velocity was reached 73 \u00b1 22 ms (mean \u00b1 std across subjects and phases) after the velocity peak of the first component in the \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I and II. Although the exact velocity profile was different in the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II, peak velocity was reached after a similar latency (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Therefore it is justified to assume the component 2 in non-optic flow phases to be of the same origin as the one in optic flow phases. Of decisive importance is the fact that the torsional direction of the second component depended on the direction of the optic flow. As expected for a compensatory mechanism, it was always directed opposite to the optic flow. Moreover, the amplitude of the torsional component was larger during optic flow phases, when there was more need for resetting, as compared to non-optic flow phases. As a matter of fact, the torsional amplitude of the second component correlated with the amplitude of BARMs, the latter measured as in the video records by comparing pre- and post-blink eye torsion. This correlation could be seen for all phases and subjects (fixation in darkness phase I: r = 0.63, p&lt;0.05; optic flow phase I and II: r = 0.96, p&lt;0.05; fixation in darkness phase II: r = 0.87, p&lt;0.05, based on pooled data from four out of five subjects). Finally, we found no consistent relationships between the amplitude of BARMs and the horizontal and vertical eye movements accompanying the blink. In sum, it is the second component, which makes the decisive contribution to the BARMs documented by video eye tracking. Moreover, the second component acts independently of accompanying vertical and horizontal eye movements. One question remains, namely if this second component of BARMs is unique to blinks or a specialized type of saccades."

A plot of the fast phases of the tOKN in the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phases I and II showed the expected monotonic, almost linear growth of peak velocity with amplitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The two blink components differed in their location on the velocity-amplitude plot and in the relationship between amplitude and peak velocity. While the first component of blink-associated eye movements recorded with search coils did - as expected - not show a consistent dependency of peak velocity on amplitude for all subjects, the second component (=BARM) exhibited the typical relationship of a saccadic eye movement not that different from that of fast phases although the regression line was significantly shifted to slower velocities (p&lt;0.05 for all subjects) (see Materials and methods, and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

To test this \u2018afference hypothesis\u2019 we simulated the altered visual input during blinks by temporarily blanking the optic flow pattern during the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II for durations corresponding to the ones of typical blinks (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure\u00a06\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although we obtained significant correlations between the size of the torsional eye shift during blanking and the eye torsion before blanking in 4 out of 5 subjects, the slopes of the linear regressions were almost zero in all of five subjects. Thus, the lack of optic flow input during blinks cannot explain the occurrence of BARMs. In line with this conclusion, we did not find any correlation between blink duration and the amplitude of BARMs, neither for true nor for simulated blinks, a relationship one might have expected if it was the lack of optic flow that drove the eye back to zero torsion (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure\u00a06\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

He had a mean vertical deviation of \u22120.87 \u00b1 22 deg during CCW and 0.42 \u00b1 0.36 deg (mean \u00b1 std) during CW optic flow stimulation. Each of his blinks ended in the opposite direction of the mean vertical deviation before blink, leading to a clearly visible difference of vertical eye positions after blinks dependent on the optic flow direction. This is remarkable in view of the small vertical deviations of less than 1 deg. BARMs are obviously sensitive enough to compensate for them."

It helps to avoid the accumulation of excessive eye torsion, building up in response to torsional optic flow by time and again resetting the torsional deviation. While this resetting eye movement serves a similar purpose as the well-known torsional fast phase component of the torsional optokinetic nystagmus (tOKN), it is different from the latter for several reasons: 1. This new eye movement is a key element of a motor synergy in which it is yoked with eye blinks, which is why we refer to it as blink-associated resetting eye movement (BARM). 2. The horizontal and vertical movement components complementing the torsional resetting response are qualitatively different from those of the fast phases of the tOKN. 3. The amplitude of BARMs is correlated with the pre-blink torsional eye position but not with the amplitude of the preceding slow phase component of the tOKN, a relationship, which is exactly opposite to the fast phases of the OKN as also reported before (<a href=\"#bib33\">Watanabe et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Waddington and Harris, 2012</a>). 4. BARMs differ in the main sequence relationship from tOKN fast phases. 5. BARMs are also observed in the absence of an optokinetic stimulus in case significant amounts of eye torsion may have arisen spontaneously. 6. Similar blink-associated resetting eye movements are deployed to reset eye deviations from straight ahead in the vertical and horizontal dimension. In sum, we suggest that BARMs are a distinct type of eye movement that is a ubiquitous partner of eye blinks."

Video eye tracking has the advantage of avoiding any interaction with the eye and the eye lids. On the other hand, it does not provide information for the time the eyes are covered by the eye lids. Complementary search coil recordings allowed us to fill this gap and to document a sequence of two movement components. Whereas the first one does not account for the properties of BARMs, the second one does. Perhaps one might object that the second component is only an artifact of the search coil recording technique, e.g. due to the need to anesthetize the eye (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergamin et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2004</a>). Yet, the congruency of the overall amount of resetting documented with video eye tracking and search coil recordings clearly speaks against this concern."

Firstly, although BARMs reset eye torsion, this resetting is not complete if torsion is induced by torsional optic flow. This stands in contrast to torsional deviations observed in the absence of torsional optic flow where we observed more BARMs leading the eyes back to zero. A possible explanation of the incomplete resetting of optic flow induced torsion might be the lack of naturalness of the condition. Continuous torsional optic flow in one direction, present for 270 s as in our experiments, might result from being spun in a leisure park attraction but hardly from ego motion in a natural environment. Actually it is tempting to speculate that the building up of a torsion plateau in reaction to the exposure to steady state torsional optic flow might reflect an adaptive shift of the subjective vertical. Interpreted this way, BARMs would not be driven by the deviation of the eyes from a baseline zero but by the deviation from the adapted torsional zero (<a href=\"#bib25\">Thilo and Gresty, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ibbotson et al., 2005</a>)."

                        "text": "The second aspect is that the influence of the level of pre-blink eye torsion on the amplitude of BARMs depends on context and history. This is indicated by slight, yet significant differences of the BARM-amplitude vs. pre-blink eye torsion regressions. The influence was strongest - as expressed by the steepest regression line slopes as well as the largest coefficients of correlation - for experimental phases which led to higher initial levels of torsion due to a build-up of torsion as in the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II. This modulation of the slope is actually quite useful as it helps to counteract the accumulation of eye torsion in the presence of strong torsional optic flow."

While blinks may have an impact on eyes that deviate from straight ahead, the rotation symmetry of the eyes suggests a mechanical reaction that should be independent of eye torsion. Yet, BARMs are always compensatory, which requires that they consider information on the initial torsional position in order to select an appropriate amplitude and velocity as well as a relationship between the two that is reminiscent of a saccade-like main sequence characteristic. Hence, the evidence available clearly argues for active control of BARMs rather than a biomechanical artifact. It is an active process linked to blinks rather than being elicited by an interruption of vision as indicated by control experiments in which we simulated the blink-associated interruption of the visual input."

The first component corresponds to the classical blink-associated eye movement which is directed nasally, downward and extorsional - a reflex that has been suggested to support the hydration and protection of the eye (<a href=\"#bib8\">Evinger et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Evinger, 1995</a>). The independence of the two components is documented by the consistent direction of the first independent of the resetting direction of torsion, and the absence of the consistent amplitude vs. velocity relationship that characterizes the second component, an independence that argues that the latter is a rigid blink-specific eye movement that is not related to other types of oculomotor behavior serving vision. Although previous work on search coil recordings of blink-associated eye movements had noted the occurrence of a second component, it did not address its function (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergamin et al., 2002</a>)."

Actually in extreme cases only blink-associated saccades may be left, while others are lacking completely (<a href=\"#bib34\">Zee et al., 1983</a>). Rather than assuming a facilitatory influence of blink-related signals on a run-down saccade generator, a more parsimonious interpretation could be that the putative blink-associated saccades in these clinical case are actually BARMs, still possible because the underlying circuitry may have been spared by the pathology. On the other hand, the blink-associated oscillations that have been observed in patients suffering from neurodegenerative brainstem disease with normal saccades (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hain et al., 1986</a>) might be a manifestation of a degenerated BARM generator sparing the saccade generator. In other words, the speculative conclusion would be the assumption of a far-reaching dissociation of the generators of BARMs and saccades. The practical implication of this scenario could be that patients suffering from a loss of saccades might actually train to deploy BARMs more frequently and efficiently."

While we explored the properties of these eye movements primarily in the torsional domain, preliminary evidence suggests that they may not be restricted to torsion but may help to keep also horizontal and vertical deviations at bay. Yoking these eye movements with the closure of the eyelids is an ecologically useful synergy that helps to minimize the downtime of vision that is inevitably associated with both. Considering that we blink on average 18 times per minute over 16\u2009hr of wakefulness per day and furthermore that each BARM makes a resetting saccade of 50 ms length waivable, the gain in uncompromised vision is substantial, amounting to 15 mins every day."

The torsional eye position was computed offline using the iris tracking software of the system (Chronos Vision GmbH) which determines the rotation relative to a reference frame based on a cross-correlation algorithm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ong and\u00a0Haslwanter 2010</a>)."

Detected events were considered true blinks only if they appeared in both eyes simultaneously for all eye positions (vertical, horizontal and torsional) thereby distinguished from occasional pupil detection artifacts. The start of a blink was defined by the appearance of infinite values resulting from a failure of pupil recognition due to the lid closure. Correspondingly, the end of a blink was defined by the reappearance of finite values. The means of start and end of blinks for subject Ha are illustrated by the dashed lines in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. The reappearance of finite values is a consequence of the reappearance of the pupil. However, the resulting eye position data for the moments of transition from lid open to closed and back again are usually unreliable as the detection algorithm is easily fooled by still partially covered pupils. We therefore introduced a temporal safety distance (7 frames before and 10 frames after) relative to these moments of instability and measured the eye position 140 ms before and 200 ms after the blink. Note that our method to detect the blink\u2019s onset and offset is approximate as it depends on the pupil recognition and not the diction of the earliest lid movements."

In the same way the relationship between torsional shifts and the amplitude of the preceding torsional slow phase was calculated. For BARMs the slow phase amplitude was determined as change in torsional eye position from the end of the preceding fast phase to the onset of the blink. Since torsional shifts can have two directions (clockwise or counterclockwise), depending on the direction of optic flow direction, a correlation or regression analysis that relies on samples pooled over both directions may erroneously suggest a linear relationship simply if the data points related to the two distributions form sufficiently distinct clusters with data points within clusters positioned at random. To test whether the data points are continuum, forming one cluster, or if they are separated, forming two clusters depending of the optic flow direction, we did the following: first, the analyses were primarily done separately for each direction of torsional shift. Then we repeated the same analysis but for having the data as one pool. Finally, We compared the slopes and offsets from the regression analysis applied to pooled data for both directions with the ones for the analysis of the two pools sorted by direction. For the torsional shifts associated with fast phases we found large differences of offset and slopes for the one cluster vs. two cluster analysis. On the other hand, the shifts of BARMs had almost equal slopes and offsets for both types of analyses. Take for example subject O (shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>), the slope difference for shifts by fast phases was 0.18 and the offset difference was 1.4\u00b0. In contrast, for blinks the slope difference was 0.021 and the offset difference 0.14\u00b0. The same analysis was applied to pooled data from all subjects. The regression slope difference was \u22120.21 \u00b1 0.1 (mean \u00b1 std) for fast phases and 0.025 \u00b1 0.039 for blinking. The offset difference was 1.6 \u00b1 0.7\u00b0 (mean \u00b1 std) for fast phases and 0.19 \u00b1 0.35\u00b0 for blinking. The differences were smaller for blinks by a factor of 10. In view of these results, we pooled the data from both directions for analysis of BARMs, but analyzed fast phases separately for each direction. Single values used or given for fast phases (for example in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) represent the mean of values for both directions."

For each pool of data, contributed by individual subjects, we had more than 400 samples. We generated bootstrapping pools per subject by taking 400 samples with replacement randomly from each pool for 1000 times and correlating them as follows: 1. The torsional shift of fast phase tOKN with their related preceding slow phase amplitude and pre-fast phase eye position, 2. The torsional shift of BARMs with their related preceding slow phase amplitude and pre-blink torsional eye position. These are four different types of correlations with two dependent variables, torsional shifts from fast phase tOKN and from BARMs. The relationship of both dependent variables (differing in color) on pre-shift eye position on the one hand and pre-shift slow phase amplitude on the other is represented by the mean correlation coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals across 1000 correlations per subject in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, instead of the correlation coefficients, we plot the means of the slopes of fitting the data with 2D linear regressions (torsional shift = a \u00b7 pre-shift slow phase amplitude + b \u00b7 pre-shift eye position) and their 95% confidence intervals are shown for the same relations. For the reasons discussed above, the torsional shift associated with BARMS were fitted with one model for both directions whereas torsional shifts from fast phases were fitted with two separate models."

In the third subject (S), whose blink duration was 288 \u00b1 45 ms (mean \u00b1 std), the two components could not be distinguished reliably. However, as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, the timing of the torsional peak depended on the experimental phase. During fixation in darkness phase I and II, in which the need for a resetting eye movement is low, the torsional peak was seen earlier than in the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Assuming that both components are merged in this subject it suggests that the first component dominated during fixation in darkness, when there was almost no need for compensation, and consequently, less need for the second component. In contrast, during the \u2018optic flow\u2019 phase I and II, when the torsional peak was later, its velocity-amplitude relationship was shifted to lower velocities (18.6 \u00b1 4.5 mean \u00b1 std, fast phases: 31.5 \u00b1 5.1 deg/s) compared to fast phases resembling the second component as seen in the other four subjects (BARMs in Mo: 32.6 \u00b1 10.5, in HA: 19.5 \u00b1 5.44, in Da: 17.5 \u00b1 8.3, in Ph: 13.3 \u00b1 4.27; fast phases in Mo: 38 \u00b1 9.16, in HA: 23.5 \u00b1 5.6, in Da: 42 \u00b1 15.2, in Ph:; 23.2 \u00b1 7.5 significant difference between BARMs and fast phases for each subject, Wilcoxon rank-sum test p&lt;0.05)."

The noise level was assessed by calculating standard deviations of the eye position during the whole phase of \u2018fixation in darkness\u2019 phase I in 3 dimensions per block. To obtain a value for each subject, the mean across blocks was calculated per subject. For the video eye tracking system the amount of noise was comparatively high in the horizontal and vertical dimensions (4.8 \u00b1 1.3\u00b0 mean \u00b1 std across subjects, 6.4 \u00b1 3.8\u00b0, and 1.6 \u00b1 0.34\u00b0 for horizontal, vertical, and torsional, respectively). A major reason for the high level of noise seen in the video eye tracking system for the horizontal and vertical eye position are inevitable tiny translational head movements, which cause a translation of the pupil image relative to the camera that is misinterpreted by the algorithm as eye movement. Torsional eye position is less noisy because torsional head movements are smaller. The amount of noise was in general much lower for the coil system (0.29 \u00b1 0.15\u00b0, 0.29 \u00b1 0.12\u00b0, and 0.115 \u00b1 0.075\u00b0 for horizontal, vertical and torsional eye positions). The fact that in particular the translational noise components are smaller is a consequence of the fact that the signal is invariant to small changes in head position along the translation axes."

BARMs are rapid eye movements that correct deviations in eye position from neutral position. BARMs occur during optokinetic nystagmus and, to a lesser extent, during fixation of a stationary target. Because they are coordinated with eye blinking, BARMs correct eye position drift in a way that minimizes interference with vision. The properties of BARMs are distinct from saccades or the fast phases of optokinetic nystagmus, and thus appear to be a truly novel type of eye movement. Most of the analysis of BARMs was done for torsional eye movements, but BARMs also seem to occur in the horizontal and vertical eye movements."

More analysis and possibly eye coil data from more subjects are needed to strengthen this portion of the manuscript. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> reveals considerable variability across the three subjects recorded with eye coils, and much of the text describing the two kinetically distinct components of the blink-related eye movements seems to be describing results from the one subject shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> rather than a summary of results from the three subjects. Only one subject (S) seems to have been tested with both eye coil and video-oculography, and this subject shows atypical blink-related eye movement, making it difficult to compare the results obtained with the two methods. It is important to more clearly document which of the observations made with eye coils were consistent across subjects."

Actually, we could meanwhile study two more subjects with search coils and consider the new data in the revised manuscript (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). The results contributed by these two new subjects are very similar to the ones based on the three subjects reported earlier. Similar to our first two subject Ha and Mo, the new two subjects show 2 components which are easily distinguishable. The amplitude of the first component amplitude does not have a relationship with its velocity (i.e. it does not exhibit a \u2018main sequence\u2019). On the other hand, the second component obeys a mean sequence relationship that has a slope lower than the one of the fast phase main sequence (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and Materials and methods). The patterns exhibited by the two new subjects with the ones exhibited by subjects Ha and Mo supports our interpretations that. Unlike the other subjects (old subjects Ha and Mo and the two new ones), exhibiting a clear separation of the two components, subject S\u00b4s pattern was characterized by a merger of the two components, compromising attempts to characterize the kinematics of specific components. We think that the addition of the new data, our original interpretation of the search coil recordings has become much more substantiated. In retrospect we are grateful to the reviewers for having put their finger on what was a weak spot in the argument."

This is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, and indicated by the red regression lines. We state explicitly in the legend now that red lines are only drawn if there was a significant correlation. We discuss that this correlation is inconsistent (only seen in 3 out of 5 subjects) and, even more relevant, the relationship is weak as indicated by the small correlation coefficients and very low slopes (from 0.03 to 0,22 vs. 0.41 to 0.9 for blinks). The clear quantitative differences, supporting the assumption of a qualitative distinction between BARMs and fast phases are now better recognizable in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure D and E</a> which are based on a new analysis, a 2-D regression analysis, carried out as suggested by you (point 2e).

The sign of eye position and torsional shift during fast phases is a consequence of the direction of optic flow. If data from both direction are plotted \u2013 as done in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> \u2013 it appears as if there is a linear relationship although there is only a discrete distinction between fast phases for the two optic flow directions. Actually, if data from both directions were pooled a significant correlation resulted. To avoid this pitfall we analyzed data from each direction separately and plotted regression lines separately for each direction if the correlations were significant. For the analysis of blinks, however, we pooled the data because a direction-specific analysis did not reveal relevant differences in the offset and slope as it was seen for fast phases.
