Largely missing, thus far, is an analysis of the complete morphologies of individual afferent arbors. Here we present a survey of cutaneous sensory arbor morphologies in hairy skin of the mouse using genetically-directed sparse labeling with a sensory neuron-specific alkaline phosphatase reporter. Quantitative analyses of 719 arbors, among which 77 were fully reconstructed, reveal 10 morphologically distinct types. Among the two types with the largest arbors, one contacts \u223c200 hair follicles with circumferential endings and a second is characterized by a densely ramifying arbor with one to several thousand branches and a total axon length between one-half and one meter. These observations constrain models of receptive field size and structure among cutaneous sensory neurons, and they raise intriguing questions regarding the cellular and developmental mechanisms responsible for this morphological diversity."

Largely missing, thus far, is an analysis of the complete morphologies of individual afferent arbors. Here we present a survey of cutaneous sensory arbor morphologies in hairy skin of the mouse using genetically-directed sparse labeling with a sensory neuron-specific alkaline phosphatase reporter. Quantitative analyses of 719 arbors, among which 77 were fully reconstructed, reveal 10 morphologically distinct types. Among the two types with the largest arbors, one contacts \u223c200 hair follicles with circumferential endings and a second is characterized by a densely ramifying arbor with one to several thousand branches and a total axon length between one-half and one meter. These observations constrain models of receptive field size and structure among cutaneous sensory neurons, and they raise intriguing questions regarding the cellular and developmental mechanisms responsible for this morphological diversity."

In this approach a Cre enzyme is used to remove a region of DNA that is flanked by two genetically engineered Lox sequences. Wu et al. used a gene that codes for an enzyme marker (alkaline phosphatase) that previous investigators had into the DNA of mice. The gene was inserted in such a way that it was only expressed in sensory neurons that innervate the skin when Cre-Lox recombination had removed an adjacent segment of DNA. Moreover, Wu et al. used this reporter gene in combination with a modified Cre enzyme that only enters the nuclei of cells in the presence of a drug (Tamoxifen), so the probability that the marker gene is expressed is determined by the concentration of Tamoxifen. By administering a low level of Tamoxifen to pregnant mice, it was possible to label a very small number of sensory neurons in each embryo. Individual neurons that express the alkaline phosphatase marker were visualized with a histochemical reaction that rendered them dark purple. The remainder of the tissue remained unstained."

The next challenge is to study the morphologies of neurons in tissues other than the skin, and also the neurons involved in other sensory systems, and to explore the cellular and developmental mechanisms responsible for the morphological diversity found in these initial experiments."

Among these modalities are thermosensation, pain, itch, and many distinct types of mechanosensation. A further level of complexity arises from the distinctive anatomic distributions of the different types of cutaneous sensory afferents. For example, hairy skin has specialized mechanosensors that contact hair follicles and their associated Merkel cell clusters, whereas glabrous (i.e. palmar) skin is innervated by specialized mechanosensors, such as those that contact Meissner corpuscles, that are absent from hairy skin. Additionally, the spatial density of sensory afferents and the spatial scale of sensory integration vary widely over the body surface. For example, two-point discrimination for mechanical stimuli has high resolution on the fingertips and low resolution on the torso (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iggo, 1982</a>), and sensory thresholds for hot and cold stimuli vary in a fine-grained mosaic over the body surface (<a href=\"#bib32\">Norrsell et al., 1999</a>)."

While the cross-sectional microanatomy of cutaneous sensory afferents has been intensively studied, their full arbors have been technically difficult to visualize for two reasons. First, the analysis of complete arbor morphologies requires either single cell tracer filling or genetically-directed sparse expression of a reporter, followed by imaging of full thickness skin to visualize individual labeled arbors against a background in which the vast majority of arbors are unlabeled. With respect to tracer filling methods, since cutaneous arbors generally reside at a substantial distance from their cell bodies in the DRG, tracer diffusion from the cell body is inefficient. Second, because skin is a relatively refractile tissue, immunostaining and imaging of full-thickness skin preparations has not been widely practiced. This second challenge has largely been solved with the recent development of protocols that give high signal-to-noise ratio immunostaining and organic solvents that render intact skin optically clear (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2011</a>). In contrast to the challenges associated with visualizing sensory projections in the skin, a number of investigators have analyzed the projections of individual dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the dorsal laminae of the spinal cord and have correlated these projection patterns with molecular and physiologic properties (e.g. <a href=\"#bib45\">Woodbury et al., 2001</a>)."

Cre-mediated excision of the <i>Brn3a</i> coding region and 3\u2032 UTR activates expression of <i>AP</i> by placing it under the control of the <i>Brn3a</i> promoter.

At present, the correspondence between several of these morphologic types and previously characterized sensory neuron types cannot be made with certainty, and for this reason we will refer to the 10 types using names that are based strictly on their morphologies. These are (in alphabetical order): bushy ending (BE), high density follicle-associated lanceolate ending (HD-FALE), isolated follicle-associated circumferential ending (I-FACE), isolated follicle-associated lanceolate ending (I-FALE), large area follicle-associated circumferential ending (LA-FACE), large area free ending (LA-FE), low density follicle-associated lanceolate ending (LD-FALE), Merkel cell associated (MCA), small area follicle-associated circumferential ending (SA-FACE), and thick ending (TE). (Here we use \u2018lanceolate endings\u2019 to mean longitudinally oriented lanceolates, i.e. parallel to the follicle axis; transverse lanceolate endings have also been described (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fundin et al., 1997</a>).) Individual arbors are referred to by type, followed by an individual identifier in parenthesis, for example I-FALE (A13-11). In the figures that follow, all of the images and arbor traces are viewed in the plane of the skin unless otherwise noted."

In the latter category (I-FACE and I-FALE), most of the follicles appear to be guard (tylotrich) hairs based on their large diameter (\u223c50 \u03bcm). The assumption that MCA, I-FACE, and I-FALE afferents target single Merkel clusters or single follicles must be qualified by noting that all cutaneous sensory axons enter the dermis from subdermal nerves and are, therefore, invariably broken during the skin dissection, generally within several hundred microns of their terminal arbors. Since we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more additional branches emerge from the parent axon at a point proximal to its broken end, we refer to the follicle targets as \u2018isolated\u2019 rather than \u2018single\u2019. This caution is given extra weight by evidence that an individual axon can innervate more than one Merkel cell cluster based on neurobiotin filling experiments in neonatal mice. In these experiments several slowly adapting type I (SAI) low threshold mechanoreceptor axons were observed to innervate two adjacent Merkel cell clusters (<a href=\"#bib46\">Woodbury and Koerber, 2007</a>). However, in our P21 skin preparations 20/20 labeled MCA arbors targeted only isolated Merkel cell clusters, with no other labeled MCA arbors seen within a radius of &gt;350 \u03bcm."

One type, low-density follicle-associated lanceolate endings (LD-FALE), has a sparsely branched arbor that innervates between 2 and 36 follicles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). These arbors encompass territories of 1\u20132 mm in diameter, but with total axon lengths of only 5\u201335 mm and with only 5\u201340 branch points (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). (A quantitative analysis of the number of follicles innervated by this and several other arbor types are presented in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>.) Among LD-FALE arbors, some branches terminate with thickened endings that lack the full C-shape of the typical follicle-associated lanceolate endings; these may represent endings that contact only a small fraction of a follicle's circumference or that are in the process of growing around or retracting from a target follicle. In nearly every instance, the opening of the \u2018C\u2019 faces the anterior of the mouse (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>)."

The 10 arbor types characterized from mouse back skin cover a wide range of morphologies but likely provide a still incomplete picture of cutaneous arbor diversity for at least two reasons. First, the AP reporter and CreER driver used here are expressed in many but not all DRG neurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Badea et al., 2012</a>); and, second, body surfaces such as the lips, cornea, nipples, genitalia, and glabrous skin were not included in the survey. The division of afferent arbors into 10 types is based on a combination of discrete and continuous parameters. The discrete parameters correspond to the morphologies of the endings, which are either lanceolate, circumferential, free, bushy, thick, or Merkel cell-associated. The continuous parameters correspond to the number of follicles innervated, axon length, number of branch points, arbor area, and arbor depth. Visual inspection of the distributions of these parameters produces an unambiguous division into the 10 arbor types defined here, and therefore we have not used more sophisticated methods such as unsupervised clustering, which are typically applied to datasets with less obvious divisions (e.g., see <a href=\"#bib4\">Badea and Nathans, 2004</a>)."

Thus, arbors with lanceolate endings never produce circular endings, bushy endings, or thick endings; arbors with circular endings never produce lanceolate endings, bushy endings, or thick endings; and so on. The only possible exception to this pattern is the presence of occasional free nerve endings within arbors that have follicle-associated circular endings (LA-FACE arbors; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). However, these are readily distinguished from the endings of arbors that exclusively produce free endings (LA-FE arbors) by virtue of their failure to branch and their deeper stratification within the dermis. As our analysis was conducted at a relatively young age (P21), these rare free endings could represent growing or regressing branches in a still-plastic arbor. The morphologic uniformity of terminal structures\u2014presumably the sites of transduction of the sensory stimulus\u2014within each arbor type argues for a corresponding uniformity in the sensory transduction apparatus and, consequently, in the range and types of favored stimuli. Thus, these data support the view that cutaneous sensory afferents represent a set of labeled lines, collectively delivering to the dorsal spinal cord at least 10 parallel representations of external stimuli that impinge on hairy skin."

TE arbors could correspond to the thickened endings of myelinated fibers referred to by Rice and colleagues as \u2018fuzzy endings\u2019 or \u2018club endings\u2019, which are suggested to represent mechanoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fundin et al., 1997</a>).

At the opposite extreme, LA-FE neurons are predicted to have receptive fields of 3\u20135 mm diameter with dense and relatively homogeneous coverage by sensory endings. BE neurons are predicted to have receptive fields of 0.5\u20131 mm diameter with an even higher density of sensory endings.

By analogy with the responses of auditory and vestibular sensory cells, if hair deflection toward a lanceolate ending (\u2018compression\u2019) elicits a response opposite to that of hair deflection away from the lanceolate ending (\u2018extension\u2019), then the asymmetric locations of lanceolate endings would necessarily provide information about the direction of hair movement.

In particular, the mechanisms that determine laminar specificity, target specificity, and arbor size and branching density among cutaneous afferents are unknown. While these and related questions have been addressed in a wide variety of neurobiological systems, they may be especially tractable in systems in which arbors are confined to one or several parallel planes, as in the inner plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina and the <i>Drosophila</i> larval body wall (<a href=\"#bib29\">Masland, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jan and Jan, 2010</a>). For sensory arbors that contact multiple follicles, competition among arbors of the same type for a limited pool of targets or target territories\u2014such as the finite circumference of each follicle, around which the lanceolate endings are packed\u2014could determine the size of individual arbor territories. Competition of this sort has been described among lanceolate endings that innervate the same guard hair follicle (<a href=\"#bib9\">Casserly et al., 1994</a>), and it is analogous to the competition observed among motor axons at the developing neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"#bib40\">Turney and Lichtman, 2012</a>). This model predicts that the average arbor territory will correlate inversely with, and be controlled by, the number of DRG neurons of the given class per unit area of skin. Finally, axon length and number of branch points, which vary over a 1,000-fold range across different arbor types, could be controlled not only by local extrinsic signals but also by regulating, at the level of gene transcription, the abundances and ratios of various cytoskeletal proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gallo, 2011</a>)."

Hair follicles and their associated structures\u2014Merkel cell clusters (touch domes), arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous glands\u2014are all polarized with respect to the body axes. This is macroscopically apparent in the anterior-to-posterior angle of the hair follicle itself, an organizational feature that is under the control of the planar cell polarity pathway (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). It seems reasonable to suppose that each hair follicle could transmit polarity information to its associated lanceolate cluster, and recent experiments with mice lacking planar cell polarity signaling in the skin support this conjecture (Chang and Nathans, unpublished observations)."

First, the primary sensory neurons are abundant, large, and anatomically segregated (in the DRG) where they can be studied or dissected either during development or in adulthood. Second, the sensory arbors are embedded within a large two-dimensional tissue (the skin) that by virtue of its surface location is readily accessible to controlled stimulation or surgical and pharmacologic manipulations. And third, it is the only sensory system in which single unit recordings can be made from primary sensory neurons in an awake human to correlate physiology with psychophysics (e.g., <a href=\"#bib41\">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vallbo et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">L\u00f6ken et al., 2009</a>)."

                                "text": "Of the three points noted above, the localization of sensory arbors within the skin is of greatest relevance to the present study. Unlike previous histochemical and immunolocalization studies on skin that have generally been conducted with vertically sectioned tissue (e.g. <a href=\"#bib13\">Fundin et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zylka et al., 2005</a>), we have worked exclusively with intact skin. This preparation has a number of favorable attributes. First, murine skin is sufficiently thin that intradermal structures can be imaged in their entirety, thus obviating the need for physical sectioning. Second, the two-dimensional nature of the sample and the resiliency of fixed skin simplifies tissue handling, imaging, and cataloguing of structures by their location in the X\u2013Y plane. And third, the relative ease with which large areas of skin can be surveyed in flat mounts facilitates the assembly of large datasets and the identification of relatively rare arbor types."

Other efforts include comprehensive descriptions of mammalian retinal cell types and their connectivities; complete reconstruction of the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobe; and light microscope-level reconstruction of mouse neuromuscular units (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sun et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Badea and Nathans, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lin and Masland, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Takemura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>). Compared to other neuronal reconstruction programs, the analysis of cutaneous sensory arbors has an important simplifying feature: interactions between different arbors are minimal (perhaps limited to co-innervation of the same target follicle) so that a full appreciation of the neuroanatomy can largely be obtained from reconstructions of individual arbors and their epithelial targets. By contrast, in most regions of the nervous system, connectivity between large numbers of pre- and postsynaptic partners is critical to understanding neuronal function. This simplifying feature, together with the technical advantages of two-dimensional imaging and reconstruction in the skin, suggests that, in the not-too-distant future, it should be possible to obtain a comprehensive anatomic description of cutaneous afferents in mammalian skin."

Convex polygons encompassing all isolated (i.e. non-overlapping) arbors were drawn over the image using Adobe Illustrator and each polygon area was calculated. For high resolution analyses, including axon tracing, BBBA-cleared skins were flattened between two glass gel-electrophoresis plates and isolated arbors were imaged at 10\u00d7 magnification on a Zeiss apotome system. Grey-scale Z-stacks were captured in bright field mode with a 5 \u03bcm separation between adjacent layers. Following dehydration in ethanol, with the skin still pinned to the Sylguard surface, and clearing in BBBA, adult skin showed essentially no shrinkage in the X- and Y-dimensions and was reduced to \u223c92% of the original thickness in the Z-dimension. Therefore \u223c25 stacks were required to encompass the \u223c125 \u03bcm of full thickness skin in BBBA (original thickness \u223c135 \u03bcm). A montage of images was captured on a Zeiss Imager Z1 and assembled with Zeiss AxioVision software. Neurites were traced using Neuromantic neuronal tracing freeware (Darren Myat, <a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/neuromantic\">http://www.reading.ac.uk/neuromantic</a>) in semi-automatic mode. As the current version of Neuromantic does not accept input files &gt;1 GB, the files for the largest arbors (the LA-FE arbors), were reduced from \u223c3 GB to &lt;1 GB by twofold reductions in X and Y resolution. Semi-automated tracing of the larger arbors (LA-FE and LA-FACE) requires \u223c15 person-hours per arbor. As a measure of reproducibility, we compared two independent traces of the same BE arbor, BE (A11-10) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The axon lengths and number of branch points for the two tracings were 85,020 vs 86,908 \u03bcm and 1011 vs 1071, corresponding to differences of 2.17% and 5.60%, respectively."

If your analysis could link the morphological categories to another reference point commonly used to study DRG neurons, such as physiological properties or molecular features, the paper would have greater interest, but asking for further studies along these lines is inconsistent with journal policy. Where we think this report has general implications for many scientists is in the method that you have used, namely to use an inducible-intersectional genetic strategy to label a subset of cells, and to develop the morphometric and quantitative assays for categorizing what you saw. Consequently, the study should be published, subject to addressing the comments outlined below."

It is not a random sample, but the non-randomness is fully understood by the authors. The <i>NFL Cre</i> driver is not expressed in all sensory neurons. Tamoxifen induction of expression is variable; any low-probability event of this kind is subject to some variation due to factors that are not understood. Brn3a is nearly pan-sensory in embryos but its expression levels change as sensory neurons mature. Only the hairy skin of the back was examined, and so on. These limitations are discussed frankly by the authors and are not an impediment to publication. A truly comprehensive study would require some higher throughput platform to generate and present the data."

Although <i>Brn3a</i> KO heterozygotes are viable and have no gross phenotype, this does not rule out a subtle phenotype in sensory morphology. The strongest argument against this is the known compensatory autoregulation of the <i>Brn3a</i> locus. At least in embryos, this results in near-normal gene expression levels for <i>Brn3a</i> downstream targets in heterozygous knockouts. This is discussed in the cited reference by Eng et al 2004 and this should be noted."

However, the present study \u201clikely only covers a fraction of the morphologic diversity of cutaneous arbors\u201d. There are many more morphologies described here than there are known distinct functions. Whether the morphological classification system used here really corresponds well to function remains to be seen. The best support for the validity of the classification method is that the larger arbors seem to have predominantly a single kind of ending, as discussed. This in fact is a significant original contribution, because this was very difficult to appreciate from the kinds of morphological studies in prior papers. The authors observe that LA-FACE arbors sometimes have free endings. One possible reason for this, not mentioned, is that at P21 the arbors are still being refined, and perhaps some of these free endings will either elaborate or regress by adulthood."

It is not a random sample, but the non-randomness is fully understood by the authors. The NFL Cre driver is not expressed in all sensory neurons. Tamoxifen induction of expression is variable; any low-probability event of this kind is subject to some variation due to factors that are not understood. Brn3a is nearly pan-sensory in embryos but its expression levels change as sensory neurons mature. Only the hairy skin of the back was examined, and so on. These limitations are discussed frankly by the authors and are not an impediment to publication. A truly comprehensive study would require some higher throughput platform to generate and present the data</i>."

Although Brn3a KO heterozygotes are viable and have no gross phenotype, this does not rule out a subtle phenotype in sensory morphology. The strongest argument against this is the known compensatory autoregulation of the Brn3a locus. At least in embryos, this results in near-normal gene expression levels for Brn3a downstream targets in heterozygous knockouts. This is discussed in the cited reference by Eng et al 2004 and this should be noted</i>."

However, the present study \u201clikely only covers a fraction of the morphologic diversity of cutaneous arbors\u201d. There are many more morphologies described here than there are known distinct functions. Whether the morphological classification system used here really corresponds well to function remains to be seen. The best support for the validity of the classification method is that the larger arbors seem to have predominantly a single kind of ending, as discussed. This in fact is a significant original contribution, because this was very difficult to appreciate from the kinds of morphological studies in prior papers. The authors observe that LA-FACE arbors sometimes have free endings. One possible reason for this, not mentioned, is that at P21 the arbors are still being refined, and perhaps some of these free endings will either elaborate or regress by adulthood</i>."
