Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that coadministration with iRGD peptide did not have an impact on permeability of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) in a xenograft model of prostate cancer, whereas the original study reported that it increased the penetrance of this cancer drug (Figure 2B; Sugahara et al., 2010). Further, in mice bearing orthotopic 22Rv1 human prostate tumors, we did not find a statistically significant difference in tumor weight for mice treated with DOX and iRGD compared to DOX alone, whereas the original study reported a decrease in tumor weight when DOX was coadministered with iRGD (Figure 2C; Sugahara et al., 2010). In addition, we did not find a statistically significant difference in TUNEL staining in tumor tissue between mice treated with DOX and iRGD compared to DOX alone, while the original study reported an increase in TUNEL positive staining with iRGD coadministration (Figure 2D; Sugahara et al., 2010). Similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 9A; Sugahara et al., 2010), we did not observe an impact on mouse body weight with DOX and iRGD treatment. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result."

Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that coadministration with iRGD peptide did not have an impact on permeability of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) in a xenograft model of prostate cancer, whereas the original study reported that it increased the penetrance of this cancer drug (Figure 2B; Sugahara et al., 2010). Further, in mice bearing orthotopic 22Rv1 human prostate tumors, we did not find a statistically significant difference in tumor weight for mice treated with DOX and iRGD compared to DOX alone, whereas the original study reported a decrease in tumor weight when DOX was coadministered with iRGD (Figure 2C; Sugahara et al., 2010). In addition, we did not find a statistically significant difference in TUNEL staining in tumor tissue between mice treated with DOX and iRGD compared to DOX alone, while the original study reported an increase in TUNEL positive staining with iRGD coadministration (Figure 2D; Sugahara et al., 2010). Similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 9A; Sugahara et al., 2010), we did not observe an impact on mouse body weight with DOX and iRGD treatment. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result."

This followed-up on a previous study that reported iRGD coupled to a motif that binds to the Neuropilin-1 receptor, increased tissue penetrance of cancer drugs beyond the vasculature when it was directly conjugated to those chemotherapies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Feron, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Sugahara et al., 2009</a>)."

Since that publication there have been additional studies that have utilized the iRGD peptide with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) in cancer biology research. Follow-up studies by Peng et al. reported that in an <i>in vitro</i> model of prostate cancer iRGD improved the penetrance of DOX into tumor cell lines (<a href=\"#bib14\">Peng and Kope\u010dek, 2015</a>). However, this improvement was only observed in a DOX/iRGD conjugated form. Further, in an <i>in vivo</i> model of mammary adenocarcinoma, Ni et al. reported that iRGD-grafted nanocrystallites can target cancer stem cells, which are typically inside the tumor core (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ni et al., 2015</a>). In a hepatocarcinoma xenograft model, utilizing the same mouse strain as Sugahara et al., Schmithals et al. reported that co-administration of iRGD enhanced the penetration of DOX into tumor tissue as well as reduced tumor size as compared to DOX alone (<a href=\"#bib16\">Schmithals et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Sugahara et al., 2010</a>). Utilizing a different chemotherapeutic, Zhang et al. reported that in an A549 xenograft model of non-small cell lung cancer, co-administration of iRGD along with gemcitabine lead to increased penetrance of drug to the tumor and decreased tumor volume over the treatment period of 30 days (<a href=\"#bib22\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Finally, Lao et al. reported that a thymosin alpha 1-iRGD conjugated form increased apoptosis of MCF-7 cells and decreased tumor volume over an 11 day treatment period when compared to thymosin alpha 1 alone (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lao et al., 2015</a>)."

This experiment utilized a 10 mg/kg dose of DOX and analyzed DOX accumulation after a brief exposure (1\u2009hr). Mice harboring tumors were injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 10 mg/kg DOX and PBS, or a combination of 10 mg/kg DOX and 4\u2009\u00b5mol/kg iRGD.

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 2D of <a href=\"#bib19\">Sugahara et al. (2010)</a> except that this replication attempt was restricted to the 1 mg/kg DOX conditions. Tumors, to evaluate efficacy, and heart tissues, to evaluate cardiotoxicity a known effect of DOX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arola et al., 2000</a>), were excised after the mice received intravenous injections of PBS, DOX + PBS, or DOX + iRGD every other day over a 24 day period. Negative and positive controls for TUNEL staining were performed in parallel to the study tissues confirming the specificity of the staining (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). While TUNEL staining was detectable in tumors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>), no detectable TUNEL staining in heart tissues was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>). This is in contrast to the original study, which reported TUNEL positive scores in heart tissue for these conditions, albeit much smaller than the reported scores in heart tissues from the 3 mg/kg DOX conditions. Scoring of TUNEL positive cells in tumors from mice treated with DOX + PBS were 0.79 times [n=6, <i>SD</i>=0.35] the amount of DOX in tumors from mice treated with PBS alone [n=6, <i>M</i>=1.0, <i>SD</i>=0.37] (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similarly, tumors from mice treated with DOX + iRGD were 0.71 times [n=6, <i>SD</i>=0.20] the amount of DOX in tumors from PBS treated mice. This is in comparison to the original study, which reported ~1.4 times increase for DOX + PBS treated mice and an ~2.6 times increase in TUNEL positive cells for DOX + iRGD relative to untreated mice. To evaluate if there were any differences in TUNEL staining in tumors among the conditions, we performed an ANOVA, which was not statistically significant (One-way ANOVA <i>F</i>(2, 15) = 1.378, <i>p</i>=0.282). The planned pairwise comparison of TUNEL staining in tumors from mice treated with DOX + PBS compared to DOX + iRGD was also not statistically significant (<i>t</i>(15) = 0.435, <i>p</i>=0.670, <i>a priori</i> significance threshold =\u00a00.05). Other studies that utilized a similarly low dose of doxorubicin to reduce side effects, also reported small reductions in tumor weight compared to vehicle control with minimal and not statistically significant changes in TUNEL staining (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hossain et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Sugahara et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Wang et al., 2010</a>)."

The peptide chains were synthesized from the carboxyl terminus to the Cys amino terminus onto H-Cys(Trt)-2Cl resin. This H-Cys(Trt)-2Cl resin was incubated with dichloromethane (DCM) for 30\u2009min and then washed with dimethylformamide (DMF) three times. Fmoc-protecting groups at the amino terminus were deprotected with an alkaline buffer and then washed with DMF three times to remove the deprotection buffer. The second amino acid was Fmoc-Asp(Otbu)-OH coupled to the first amino acid and then DMF cleaned. After each coupling, the peptide was ninhydrin tested and the coupling and washing steps repeated until the crude peptide was fully synthesized. The full synthesized crude peptide was cleaved from the resin and cleaned with Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The crude peptides were diethyl ether precipitated, drained and washed. The rest of the Fmoc group was removed. The peptides were isolated and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu LC-20A) (data available at <a href=\"https://osf.io/m58sv/\">https://osf.io/m58sv/</a>).

The authors performed a well designed analysis of the co-administration approach and conclude that there is no statistical difference between groups of animals treated with doxorubicin with or without the iRGD tumor penetrating peptide. Studies of this nature are extremely important to clarify the potential for errors in the scientific literature and to understand how often this actually happens vs. poorly designed/attempts at repeating the study vs. unsubstantiated innuendo/rumor. Overall, this is a well performed study. The reviewers made a few suggestions for improvement before acceptance."

The data and analysis scripts for each analysis are broken down by experiment. This includes the meta-analyses, which is separate from the experimental analyses. The meta-analyses script (\u2018Study 15 meta analyses.R\u2019) is available in the files section of the link provided in the <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> figure legend (<a href=\"https://osf.io/ymxaz/files/\">https://osf.io/ymxaz/files/</a>). Regarding ANOVA of body weights in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we have revised the manuscript to clearly state that the% body weight shift values were used in the ANOVA on day 24 values, while the total body weight was used in the additional AUC analysis (files available in the file section of the link provided in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> figure legend (<a href=\"https://osf.io/kwh39/files/\">https://osf.io/kwh39/files/</a>). We have also added a supplement figure to present the data both ways."

However in the later figures (see, for example, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), the dark shaded boxes are for PBS and the white shaded box is for DOX+iRGD and the light shade is for DOX. I suggest the authors to use consistent shading across figures. For example, use white shaded box for DOX+iRGS in all box plots etc.</i>"
