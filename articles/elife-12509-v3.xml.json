By locating the flexible proteins on the surface of 70S ribosome, we show that this trifunctional cross-linker is effective at attaining structural information not easily attainable by crystallography and electron microscopy. From a crude Rrp46 immunoprecipitate, it helped identify two direct binding partners of Rrp46 and 15 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among the co-immunoprecipitated exosome subunits. Applying it to <i>E. coli</i> and <i>C. elegans</i> lysates, we identified 3130 and 893 inter-linked lysine pairs, representing 677 and 121 PPIs. Using a quantitative CXMS workflow we demonstrate that it can reveal changes in the reactivity of lysine residues due to protein-nucleic acid interaction."

By locating the flexible proteins on the surface of 70S ribosome, we show that this trifunctional cross-linker is effective at attaining structural information not easily attainable by crystallography and electron microscopy. From a crude Rrp46 immunoprecipitate, it helped identify two direct binding partners of Rrp46 and 15 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among the co-immunoprecipitated exosome subunits. Applying it to <i>E. coli</i> and <i>C. elegans</i> lysates, we identified 3130 and 893 inter-linked lysine pairs, representing 677 and 121 PPIs. Using a quantitative CXMS workflow we demonstrate that it can reveal changes in the reactivity of lysine residues due to protein-nucleic acid interaction."

As a proof of concept, we carried out a quantitative CXMS analysis of an RNA-binding protein L7Ae. Using deuterium-labeled Leiker, we found that for the three L7Ae lysine residues that are buried upon RNA binding, their mono-links decreased dramatically in the presence of RNA, exactly as expected.

After experimenting with different designs of Leiker (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s6\">6</a>, and Appendix), we found that bAL1 and bAL2 worked the best and there was no difference in performance between these two (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Hereafter, Leiker refers to either bAL1 or bAL2. In this study, bAL2 was used in most of the experiments and a bAL2-based CXMS workflow is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Both bAL1 and bAL2 feature a one-piece design with an azobenzene-based chemical cleavage site (<a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2010</a>) and a 9.3-\u00c5 carbon chain that connects two sulfo-NHS esters. This spacer arm is shorter than that of BS<sup>3</sup> (11.4\u2009\u00c5), so it may confer a higher specificity to Leiker in capturing protein-protein interactions. Inter-, loop-, and mono-linked peptides generated by either all produce a reporter ion of <i>m/z</i> 122.0606 in higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) spectra (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). It can be used to verify the identification of Leiker-cross-linked peptides. For quantitative CXMS analysis, we synthesized isotope-labeled bAL2 in which six hydrogen atoms in the spacer arm were replaced with deuterium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The six-dalton difference was sufficient to separate peptides cross-linked by [d<sub>0</sub>]-Leiker from the same peptides cross-linked by [d<sub>6</sub>]-Leiker."

The peptide mixture was then incubated with streptavidin agarose. After extensive washes, cross-linked peptides were released using the Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> elution buffer. BS<sup>3</sup> was used in parallel as a control. As is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> the number of BS<sup>3</sup>-linked peptide pairs identified decreased dramatically, from 109 in the undiluted sample to only one in the 100-fold diluted sample. The number of Leiker-linked peptide pairs identified after enrichment was in no way affected by increasing background complexity, with &gt;160 inter-links detected in each sample. To be noted, these inter-linked peptide pairs, or inter-links for abbreviation, can result from either intra-protein or inter-protein cross-linking (illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Strikingly, cross-linking products, including inter-, loop- and mono-links (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) constituted over 97% of all peptides identified post enrichment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Of the Leiker-linked lysine pairs that can be mapped to the pdb structures (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>), 82% have C\u03b1 \u2013 C\u03b1 distance \u226422\u2009\u00c5 and 93% have C\u03b1 \u2013 C\u03b1 distance \u226430\u2009\u00c5 (FDR &lt; 5%, E-value &lt; 0.01), which is comparable to BS<sup>3</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

A total of 222 inter-linked lysine pairs were identified with high confidence, including 95 inter-molecular and 127 intra-molecular cross-links (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). This is three times as many as in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lauber and Reilly, 2011</a>). Of the 95 cross-links connecting two lysine residues that are both present in the crystal structure of a 70S ribosome (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fischer et al., 2015</a>) (PDB code: 5AFI), 75% are compatible with the crystal structure with a C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance \u226422\u2009\u00c5, which is the length of the spacer arm of Leiker plus two lysine side chains. Among the subset of intra-molecular cross-links, 84% have C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distances \u226422\u2009\u00c5; among the subset of inter-molecular cross-links, 50% have C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distances \u226422\u2009\u00c5 and 73% have C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distances \u226430\u2009\u00c5, which could be a reasonable cutoff considering conformation flexibility of proteins in solution (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). One particular ribosomal protein L9 is a good example to illustrate conformational flexibility and the dynamic nature of interactions between proteins or protein complexes. A large <i>b</i>-factor in the crystal structure has suggested that L9 is highly mobile. It has been observed to adopt an extended, rod-like conformation in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schuwirth et al., 2005</a>) and a strikingly different bent conformation in the solution structure of the ribosome determined using cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fischer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Seidelt et al., 2009</a>). Bending of L9 was echoed in this study, as reflected in the cross-links bridging L9 and L2 and the cross-links bridging the two termini of L9 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Three additional cross-links involving L9 have C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distances &gt;50\u2009\u00c5 if measured within a ribosomal particle (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). We propose these apparently long distance cross-links, which are similar to the ones observed in a previous CXMS study (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lauber and Reilly, 2011</a>), reflect interactions between ribosomal particles. L9 locates at the interface between ribosomal particles in higher-order configurations (<i>e.g.</i> polysome) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brandt et al., 2009</a>). Dimerization or oligomerization of 70S ribosomes in the absence of mRNA was also observed using negative staining EM from highly purified non-cross-linked 70S ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

                                "text": "The peripheral regions of the ribosome are critical for protein translation and regulation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Savelsbergh et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Valle et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kothe et al., 2004</a>). However, despite of extensive studies on the ribosome structures, these peripheral parts are still largely missing because they are either too dynamic or refractory to crystallography. For <i>E. coli</i> ribosomal proteins currently lacking well-defined coordinates in the 70S crystal structures, Leiker-based CXMS provided remarkably more linkages than other ribosomal proteins. The top four proteins with the most inter-molecular cross-links identified are S1, L1, L7/12, and L31, all of which are mobile components in the peripheral regions and often invisible in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). S1 is the largest ribosomal protein, which binds to mRNA and initiates translation, but has no high-resolution structures available either alone or in the context of the 70S ribosome (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fischer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lauber et al., 2012</a>). A previous CXMS analysis of the 30S subunit revealed interaction between S1 and a region near the 3\u2019 end of 16S rRNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lauber et al., 2012</a>), but it is unknown whether or not S1 interacts with the 50S subunit. Our analysis of the 70S ribosome revealed extensive contacts between the C-terminal mRNA binding domain of S1 and L1 in the 50S subunit (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Since the two of them localize to a region where both tRNA and mRNA leave the ribosome, the observation of six cross-links between them hints that there might be a coordination between deacylated tRNA release and mRNA exit from the ribosome. The 30S proteins that were found to interact with S1 in this study were largely consistent with those identified in the previous study (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lauber et al., 2012</a>). In particular, four cross-links were identified between the N-terminal peptide of S1 (M1-K14) and the N-terminal peptide of S2 (M1-K11) (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). This result agrees perfectly with a recent structural finding on the direct interaction between S1 and S2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Byrgazov et al., 2015</a>). L1 had the highest number of cross-links with S1, followed by cross-links with L33, L5, L9, S13, and S2 (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). The proximity of L1 to L33 and L5 implicates a rotated conformation of L1 in the sample (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 3</a>), which was repeatedly observed in various structures of the 70S ribosome in different functional states (<a href=\"#bib75\">Valle et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, beyond the expected interactions between L7/12 and L6, L10, or L11 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diaconu et al., 2005</a>), we also found novel interactions between L7/12 and L19 or S3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). These findings suggest that the highly flexible L7/12 stalk might be able to contact the 30S subunit, given the predicted large length of this dynamic stalk (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diaconu et al., 2005</a>). Nine cross-links between <i>E. coli</i> L31 and L5 placed L31 in the central protuberance region (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>), which is supported by the crystal structure of <i>T. thermophilus</i> 70S ribosome (<a href=\"#bib77\">Voorhees et al., 2009</a>) and the newly revealed structure of 70S ribosome (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fischer et al., 2015</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that Leiker-based CXMS analysis can provide structural information that is highly complementary to crystallography and cryo-EM, especially for the flexible or dynamic regions that cannot be deduced using traditional methods."

                                "text": "Combining CXMS and immunoprecipitation (IP) has great potential for the detection of binding partners in close proximity among co-immunoprecipitated proteins; such method may be widely adopted in biology laboratories. Much progress has been made recently in this area by the use of a modified anti-GFP single-chain antibody that cannot be cross-linked so that GFP-tagged protein complexes can be cross-linked on beads and separated away from the antibody for CXMS analysis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shi et al., 2015</a>). For highly heterogeneous IP samples, however, cross-linked peptides can be inundated by non-cross-linked peptides even if the antibody is removed from the background. As a test, we prepared a crude immunoprecipitate of a TAP-tagged yeast exosome subunit Rrp46 (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), from which 740 proteins were identified at 0.1% protein FDR. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted off IgG beads and cross-linked with Leiker. To evaluate the sensitivity of the method, we varied the amount of immunoprecipitates from 40\u2009\u03bcg to 3\u2009\u03bcg of proteins and found that the number of inter-link identifications did not change much as the input decreased from 40 to 20\u2009\u03bcg (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). From three experiments starting with 40\u2009\u03bcg of proteins, a total of 195 cross-linked lysine pairs (43 inter-molecular and 152 intra-molecular) were identified (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 4</a>). Thanks to cross-linking, not only did we identify all ten exosome core subunits, but also 15 putative direct protein-protein interactions amongst the core subunits, which generated a connectivity map more complete than the one from yeast two-hybrid experiments (<a href=\"#bib70\">Stark et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Uetz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Oliveira et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Luz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Yu et al., 2008</a>) and showed that among the co-immunoprecipitated proteins, Rrp41 and Rrp45 directly bind to the bait protein Rrp46 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Of the cross-links identified, 69% were compatible with the crystal structure of an RNA-bound 11-subunit exosome complex (<a href=\"#bib45\">Makino et al., 2013</a>) (PDB code: 4IFD). Among the cross-links that disagreed with the RNA-bound structure, 68% involved the catalytic subunit Rrp44, which has a large rotation relative to the rest of the exosome core between the RNA-bound and the RNA-free states (<a href=\"#bib45\">Makino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). The crude Rrp46 immunoprecipitate should mainly contain apo exosome, because magnesium was included in the buffer to activate the nuclease activity of exosome. Therefore, the presence (in the crystal structure) or absence (in our exosome preparation) of bound RNA is likely to be the primary reason behind most of the seemingly inconsistent inter-molecular cross-links."

Here we found two known (Mpp6 [<a href=\"#bib47\">Milligan et al., 2008</a>] and Ski7 <a href=\"#bib1\">Araki et al., 2001</a>) and four potential exosome regulators through nine cross-links with core exosome subunits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 4</a>). These cross-links revealed residues in close proximity. Ski7 was found to cross-link with Rrp4 via K111, which fits well with previous co-IP results obtained by using different fragments of Ski7 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Araki et al., 2001</a>) and a recently published CXMS study of the yeast exosome (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shi et al., 2015</a>). Among the newly identified candidate regulators, the translation initiation factor Tif1 stood out; it had interactions with the Rrp4 and Rrp44 exosome subunits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Translation has been implicated in RNA quality control (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</a>). The linkages identified here support the hypothesis that exosome complexes \u2018stand by\u2019 the translation machinery and recognize and degrade aberrant mRNA molecules."

In three independent experiments, Leiker-treated, trypsin digested <i>E. coli</i> lysates were fractionated on a high pH reverse phase column, and cross-linked peptides were enriched from each of the 10 or 11 fractions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). After filtering the data by requiring FDR &lt; 0.05, E-value &lt; 0.01, spectral count \u2265 3, we identified a total of 2003 non-redundant inter-linked lysine pairs including 1386 (69%) intra-molecular and 617 (32%) inter-molecular cross-links (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Protein structure information is available in the PDB database for 984 intra-molecular cross-links identified with Leiker, and is consistent with 80% of them, indicating the high quality of the results (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Of note, the inter-molecular cross-links represent 436 pairs of protein-protein interactions, and 25% of the cross-links are supported by the combined network of the bacteriome.org database (<a href=\"#bib53\">Peregr\u00edn-Alvarez et al., 2009</a>) <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Most of the inter-molecular cross-links suggest novel protein-protein interactions. Based on the Leiker cross-links, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network and extracted the most highly connected module (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bader and Hogue, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Saito et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This 12-protein module consists of 9 ribosomal proteins and two DNA-binding proteins (the Hu heterodimer DBHA/DBHB) organized around a translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Evidently, it is enriched with proteins that function in translation, suggesting that DBHA/DBHB also plays a role in this process. Indeed, previous studies reported that a small fraction of this Hu heterodimer is bound to ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rouvi\u00e8re-Yaniv and Kjeldgaard, 1979</a>) and that this protein can enhance or repress translation of the mRNA molecules that it binds to (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balandina et al., 2001</a>). In contrast, the most connected module obtained from the previously identified BS<sup>3</sup> cross-links (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yang et al., 2012</a>) comprised only three ribosomal proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These results indicate the potential of Leiker in generating comprehensive protein-protein interaction networks using CXMS. Since ribosomal proteins dominated <i>E. coli</i> whole-cell lysates, we prepared samples in which ribosomes were removed by centrifugation through a layer of sucrose cushion. Analysis of the ribo-free samples (two repeats) with Leiker identified 1971 inter-links, 1127 of which were not identified in the whole-cell lysates (5% FDR, E-value &lt; 0.01, spectral count \u2265 3) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). Together, we identified a total of 3130 non-redundant cross-linked lysine pairs from <i>E. coli</i>. This allowed us to construct a network comprising 677 protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>)."

To apply Leiker in quantitative CXMS, we synthesized deuterium-labeled Leiker ([d<sub>6</sub>]-bAL2) in addition to the unlabeled version ([d<sub>0</sub>]-bAL2). Few software tools reported to date directly support quantitative CXMS (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fischer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Walzthoeni et al., 2015</a>). We therefore modified the quantification software pQuant (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2014</a>) and established an automated data analysis workflow for quantitative CXMS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). As a proof-of-principle experiment, we compared the RNA-free and H/ACA RNA-bound states of a <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> ribosomal protein L7Ae (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rozhdestvensky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li and Ye, 2006</a>). We treated RNA-free L7Ae with [d<sub>0</sub>]-bAL2 and the assembled L7Ae-RNA complex with [d<sub>6</sub>]-bAL2 in the forward reaction, and switched the isotope labels in the reverse reaction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). An equal amount of BSA protein was included in each sample to control for possible difference in cross-linking efficiency between [d<sub>0</sub>]- and [d<sub>6</sub>]-Leiker. We expected that the formation of the protein-RNA complex would block the access of Leiker to lysine residues at the binding interface, which would be manifested as large abundance decrease of mono- or inter-linked peptides at these sites."

The accuracy of the ratio calculation was evaluated with the confidence score \u03c3 (range: 0\u20131, from the most to the least reliable). If a cross-link have ratios with \u03c3 &lt; 0.5, the median of these ratios is assigned to this cross-link. The cross-link ratios of the proteins of interest are normalized to the median ratio of all BSA cross-links. For each cross-link, the median [state1]/[state2] ratio of three independent forward labeling experiments is plotted against the median ratio of three independent reverse labeling experiments. Cross-links that are only present in state1 or state2 due to a dramatic conformational change cannot be quantified as described above because the ratios would be zero or infinite and their \u03c3 values would be 1. Therefore, if a cross-link does not have a valid ratio after automatic quantification, the EICs were manually inspected to determine if it was an all-or-none change."

With an enrichment efficiency of 97% or more, Leiker yields a fourfold increase in the number of identified cross-linked peptide pairs from complex samples. Also established is a workflow for quantitative CXMS based on deuterium-labeled Leiker."

However, the interaction networks obtained as such are limited, because the cross-links identified are dominated by those from highly abundant proteins, for example, EF-Tu and ribosomal proteins in <i>E. coli</i>. This can be overcome with subcellular fractionation, which can separate abundant proteins from less abundant ones. We increased the number of unique inter-link identifications by more than 50% (from 2003 to 3130) by simply removing ribosomes from the <i>E. coli</i> lysates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This is also obvious by contrasting the CXMS results of the whole-worm lysate and the mitochondrial fraction of <i>C. elegans</i>, from which 459 and 547 inter-linked lysine pairs were detected, respectively, with an overlap of only 113. We anticipate that extensive protein fractionation coupled with Leiker-assisted CXMS will pave the way towards constructing comprehensive interactomes for different model organisms, and next-generation cross-link identification software of higher sensitivity will also help. Further, with the advantage of heavy isotope labeling for quantification in addition to the enrichment function, Leiker shows promise for use in differential interactome analysis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ideker and Krogan, 2012</a>)."

This shows that the quality of our Leiker-based CXMS data is high. Interestingly, the inter-molecular cross-links detected from the ribo-free samples had a much higher rate of structural compatibility (69%) than those detected in the whole-cell lysates (12%). Given that 92% of the inter-links with existing structural information in the whole-cell lysate involved at least one ribosomal protein and many were between ribosomal proteins, we think that most of the apparently incompatible inter-molecular cross-links seen in the whole-cell lysates likely result from cross-linking of adjacent ribosomal particles."

This is regrettable, as they carry structural information about proteins and always outnumber inter-links (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Leiker also generates abundant mono-links. In this study, we demonstrate that mono-links are highly valuable in mapping RNA-binding lysine residues. As the positively charged lysine residue is frequently involved in binding the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA and RNA, relative quantification of lysine mono-links would be particularly suited for mapping the DNA or RNA binding surface on a protein. We suggest that mono-link data should be used in routine practice."

If the value of <math id=\"inf4\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></math> is zero (the highest confidence), there is no interference signal; if the value is one (the lowest confidence), the peptide signals are inundated by interference signals. For each identified cross-link spectrum, an extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) was constructed for each isotopic peak of the light- and heavy-labeled precursor. The H/L ratios can be calculated based on the monoisotopic peak, the most intense peak, or the least interfered peak of each isotopic cluster as specified by users. For L7Ae, all options yielded similar results and we selected the monoisotopic peak. For the highly complex samples of the log phase versus stationary phase <i>E. coli</i>, the option of the least interfered peak performed the best. For each cross-link, every identified spectrum (E-value &lt; 0.001) will lead to a H/L ratio and a confidence score \u03c3, because pQuant conducts the quantitation independently starting from each identified MS/MS spectrum. In most cases, the H/L ratios obtained for the same precursor ion are close, but sometimes the ratios may differ due to multiple reasons including local interference signals or a sudden decrease followed by recovery in signal intensity in the chromatograms, all of which can affect the calling of the start and the end of a chromatogram peak. Ratios with \u03c3 values above or equal to 0.5 were discarded. The median H/L ratio obtained from the remaining spectra was assigned to a cross-linked lysine pair or a mono-linked lysine residue as the final quantification value. If a cross-link had no assigned ratio value (i.e., none of its ratios had a \u03c3 value less than 0.5), we manually evaluated the reconstructed ion chromatograms to assess abundance changes. All the ratios were normalized against the median value of all the H/L ratios belonging to the spiked-in BSA."

The basic idea here is to enrich crosslinked and crosslink-modified peptides from mixtures of peptides generated from protein assemblies. While this concept and its demonstration is not new, the value of the present study lies in its experimental tests and assessment of the utility of such trifunctional crosslinking reagents for enriching information-filled crosslink-modified peptides from a large background of unmodified peptides. In this respect, there are components of the manuscript that have considerable potential value (especially the section entitled \"Leiker enabled robust enrichment of cross-linked peptides\"). At the same time other components of the study are either not well enough described to have real value or the conclusions from these components are insufficiently justified (especially the section entitled \"Application of Leiker to lysates\").

In order to allow the reader to better assess the relative merits of the present approach versus those used formerly, the authors should compare and contrast their results with this prior work, which was performed with standard bifunctional crosslinking reagents. Points of interest here include a comparison of the number of inter-subunit crosslinks, the relative amounts of sample used, and any differences in the information gained in these two cases. This comparison should prove of greater value to the reader than the comparisons that are made in the manuscript, which are comparisons between the results provided by the author and early two-hybrid experiments as well as to just a single crosslink data point in the Shi et al. 2015 paper."

I believe that this is the most convincing and valuable data that is provided by the authors. However, because the described technique involves additional steps to those carried out in more conventional crosslinking experiments, it is important to evaluate the cost in sensitivity (if any) that this gain in information content is accomplished. This is especially important for real world samples of affinity isolated complexes, where the amount of sample is often limiting. Thus, this study will be more valuable if the authors provide information on the data falloff as a function of decreasing the quantity of the ten protein mixture. Also, the individual amounts of each protein should be provided, not just the total amounts of all ten proteins and the names of the proteins should be supplied in the paper proper rather than just in the Supplementary data. Finally, because structures for most of these proteins are available, the \u03b1-carbon to \u03b1-carbon distance distribution for all the inter-links should be provided and assessed as a measure of x-link veracity."

The authors should more accurately represent their work in the light of the prior work, and certainly the re-naming of the strategy associated with the use of trifunctional crosslinking reagents as \"Leiker\" is inappropriate.</i> A) Leiker is not a collective term of all trifunctional cross-linkers; it is one type of design that we selected out of many and it truly meets the expectation for trifunctional cross-linkers. In the winner design, the azobenzene-based cleavage site has never been applied to the synthesis of cross-linkers previously. What distinguishes this study from other similar ones is the extensive, meticulous testing of multiple trifunctional cross-linkers and finding the best one for CXMS users. It is a heavy burden to test different cross-linkers. For example, we spent two years on the two-piece design before giving it up. No users would have the patience to test multiple cross-linkers in depth when they really want is one that works."

We used the immunoprecipitated exosome sample, instead of the ten-protein mixture, for the sensitivity test for two reasons: 1. The ten-protein mix is too simple to mimic real-world samples of immunoprecipitated proteins; 2. as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A (1:0</a> dilution), Leiker has little advantage on this simple protein mixture over BS<sub>3</sub>.
