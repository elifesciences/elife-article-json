Resurgent current results from unbinding of a blocking particle that competes with normal channel inactivation. The underlying molecular components contributing to resurgent current have not been fully identified. Here, we show that the Na<sub>V</sub> channel auxiliary subunit FGF14 'b' isoform, a locus for inherited spinocerebellar ataxias, controls resurgent current and repetitive firing in Purkinje neurons. FGF14 knockdown biased Na<sub>V</sub> channels towards the inactivated state by decreasing channel availability, diminishing the 'late' Na<sub>V</sub> current, and accelerating channel inactivation rate, thereby reducing resurgent current and repetitive spiking. Critical for these effects was both the alternatively spliced FGF14b N-terminus and direct interaction between FGF14b and the Na<sub>V</sub> C-terminus. Together, these data suggest that the FGF14b N-terminus is a potent regulator of resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current in cerebellar Purkinje neurons."
