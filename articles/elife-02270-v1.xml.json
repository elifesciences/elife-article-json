The P21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) is an effector for the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 that regulate actin cytoskeletal remodeling, but its role in the immune system remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that T-cell specific deletion of <i>Pak2</i> gene in mice resulted in severe T cell lymphopenia accompanied by marked defects in development, maturation, and egress of thymocytes. Pak2 was required for pre-TCR \u03b2-selection and positive selection. Surprisingly, Pak2 deficiency in CD4 single positive thymocytes prevented functional maturation and reduced expression of S1P1 and KLF2. Mechanistically, Pak2 is required for actin cytoskeletal remodeling triggered by TCR. Failure to induce proper actin cytoskeletal remodeling impaired PLC\u03b31 and Erk1/2 signaling in the absence of Pak2, uncovering the critical function of Pak2 as an essential regulator that governs the actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling to ensure normal thymocyte development and maturation."

The P21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) is an effector for the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 that regulate actin cytoskeletal remodeling, but its role in the immune system remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that T-cell specific deletion of <i>Pak2</i> gene in mice resulted in severe T cell lymphopenia accompanied by marked defects in development, maturation, and egress of thymocytes. Pak2 was required for pre-TCR \u03b2-selection and positive selection. Surprisingly, Pak2 deficiency in CD4 single positive thymocytes prevented functional maturation and reduced expression of S1P1 and KLF2. Mechanistically, Pak2 is required for actin cytoskeletal remodeling triggered by TCR. Failure to induce proper actin cytoskeletal remodeling impaired PLC\u03b31 and Erk1/2 signaling in the absence of Pak2, uncovering the critical function of Pak2 as an essential regulator that governs the actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling to ensure normal thymocyte development and maturation."

These progenitor cells then undergo a process called differentiation to become specific types of T cells, which mature in the thymus before moving to the blood.

In particular, the absence of Pak2 in thymocytes (the cells that become T cells) prevented them from maturing into T cells, and also prevented them from producing a receptor protein that is needed for mature T cells to leave the thymus. This work implies that disruption of the Pak2-mediated signaling pathway that regulates the cytoskeleton may weaken the immune system in humans."

Surprisingly, deletion of Pak2 at a later developmental stage using the <i>Cd4</i>-Cre severely inhibited functional maturation of CD4SP thymocytes, including impaired expression of S1P1 accompanied by reduced expression of its transcription factor, KLF2. TCR-mediated signaling was greatly decreased in the absence of Pak2, including Nur77 induction and S6 phosphorylation, leading to decreased proliferation. Mechanistically, Pak2 deficiency impaired actin cytoskeletal remodeling and activation of PLC\u03b31 and Erk1/2 triggered by plate-bound TCR stimulation. These findings reveal a critical function of Pak2 as an essential regulator that drives the actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling for normal thymocyte development and maturation."

To circumvent this problem, we generated conditional Pak2 KO mice by flanking exon 2 of <i>Pak2</i> with <i>loxP</i> sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kosoff et al., 2013</a>) and introduced, by breeding, two different Cre transgenes, <i>Lck-</i>Cre (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hennet et al., 1995</a>) and <i>Cd4</i>-Cre (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2001</a>), in which the Cre recombinase is expressed under the promoters of T cell-specific <i>Lck</i> or <i>Cd4</i> genes.

DN3 thymocytes in <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Lck-</i>Cre mice were increased with impaired expression of intracellular TCR \u03b2-chain at DN3 but not DN4 stages, suggesting a relative block in development at the checkpoint mediated by the pre-TCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>).

The generation of OTII TCR transgene+ CD4SP thymocytes was greatly reduced, suggesting defective positive selection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013H</a>).

To define the effects of Pak2 deficiency at later stages of thymocyte development, we analyzed T cell development in thymi in <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4</i>-Cre mice, in which Pak2 is deleted at the DP stage using the <i>Cd4</i> promoter-driven Cre transgene. Numbers of DP and CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes were similar, suggesting generation of CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes was normal in <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Expression of CD5, CD69, and CD3 on DP thymocytes were similar between <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup> and <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice (data not shown). The apparently normal development of DP and SP thymocytes in <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice suggested that Pak2 may be dispensable for positive selection or a defect is masked by a compensatory mechanism in vivo. To eliminate compensatory changes in the TCR repertoire, we introduced the OTII transgene into <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice. The generation of CD4SP thymocytes was markedly reduced in OTII+;<i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4</i>-Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>), suggesting that Pak2 is required for positive selection."

Similar to what we observed in <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice, CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4</i>-Cre FTOC were blocked at the semi-mature stage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>).

Importantly, these results indicate that fetal thymic maturation was still blocked at the semi-mature stage in the absence of Pak2 even when expression of IL-7R\u03b1 was not compromised.

The transcription factor KLF2 plays a key role in controlling expression of S1P1 in SP thymocytes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carlson et al., 2006</a>). Expression of KLF2 is controlled during thymocyte development. In DN and DP stages, expression of KLF2 is minimal to prevent premature egress of DN or DP thymocytes. SP thymocytes gradually increase expression of KLF2, reaching highest expression amounts at the mature stage. KLF2 also controls expression of CD62L, which promotes T cell entry to the lymph nodes in the periphery. The signaling pathway that controls timed egress of thymocytes by increasing KLF2 has not been identified. Since CD62L expression was reduced in Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes, we asked whether KLF2 expression is altered in the absence of Pak2. Indeed, expression of KLF2 was greatly reduced in CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Moreover, we found that S1P1 expression was also markedly decreased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that Pak2-dependent signals regulate timed egress of SP thymocytes by controlling expression of KLF2 and S1P1. Since Pak2 is required for the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage, the decrease in KLF2 and S1P1 mRNA expression may reflect the lack of the mature CD4SP thymocytes in the absence of Pak2. However, we observed a reproducible decrease in KLF2 expression in the semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes of <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, right panel), suggesting Pak2 contributes to expression of KLF2 when CD4SP thymocytes are just beginning to upregulate KLF2."

Moreover, within CD4SP thymocytes there is a subset that increases Qa2 expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), which could represent a mature subset. Thus, we examined directly whether CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice contain functionally mature cells. One of the hallmarks of functional maturity of CD4SP thymocytes is their ability to proliferate in response to CD3 and CD28 stimulation, unlike semi-mature thymocytes that are more susceptible to cell death (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hogquist et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Takada et al., 2011</a>). We compared the proliferative responses of CD24<sup>low</sup>Qa2<sup>hi</sup> CD4SP cells from WT and <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice following plate-bound TCR and CD28 stimulation. As expected, the CD24<sup>low</sup>Qa2<sup>hi</sup> CD4SP thymocytes from WT mice underwent 2\u20133 rounds of cell division following CD3 or CD3 and CD28 stimulation, suggesting these cells are functionally mature. In contrast, most CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice including the CD24<sup>low</sup>Qa2<sup>hi</sup> subset did not proliferate following TCR/CD28 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

Of note, Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes are more susceptible to cell death following 24 hr of incubation in resting or stimulated conditions because they contain more semi-mature thymocytes that undergo cell death (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>).

The PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway has been reported to be activated by the TCR and CD28 stimulation, reflected in the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (S6), a direct target of the mTORC1-activated p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</a>). Activation of the mTORC1 pathway increases rates of mRNA translation and protein synthesis, which permits increased cell growth and proliferation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mills and Jameson, 2009</a>). Activation of mTORC1 pathway was absolutely required for phosphorylation of S6 at the S235/S236 sites and p70S6K at the T389 site, as phosphorylation of these sites were completely abrogated by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>). Phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 in CD4SP thymocytes from WT mice was increased after 24 hr of stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, top panels). On the contrary, most of the CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice displayed minimal S6 phosphorylation. Since TCR-induced S6 phosphorylation reaches its optimal amounts after 1 or 2 hr of TCR stimulation and lasts up to 5 hr (<a href=\"#bib54\">Salmond et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">van den Brink et al., 1999</a>), we examined S6 phosphorylation following 2 hr of plate-bound anti-CD3 stimulation. Phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 was substantially decreased in the absence of Pak2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, bottom panels). Activation of MAPK-RSK pathway contributes to phosphorylation of S6 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Salmond et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, treatment of thymocytes with a MEK inhibitor, UO126, partially reduced phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>). However, since rapamycin treatment completely abrogated phosphorylation of S6 at these sites (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>), the MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of S6 also seems to depend on activation of mTORC1-mediated pathway. To determine whether reduced phosphorylation of S6 in the absence of Pak2 is due to inhibition of mTORC1-mediated pathway, we examined phosphorylation of p70S6K at the T389 site because phosphorylation of this site was completely dependent on mTORC1-mediated pathway but independent of MAPK-mediated pathway (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>). Phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 was also decreased following 30 min and 1 hr of plate-bound CD3 stimulation in the absence of Pak2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These findings demonstrate that Pak2 participates in mTORC1-mediated activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6 following plate-bound TCR stimulation."

Since Pak2 is required for multiple processes of development and maturation of thymocytes, it is possible that Pak2 regulates these processes by governing TCR-mediated signaling. Because activation of Erk1/2 following TCR stimulation plays a key role in thymic development as well as in induction of Nur77 (<a href=\"#bib70\">van den Brink et al., 1999</a>), we examined activation of Erk1/2 following TCR or TCR/CD28 stimulation. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was markedly reduced in the absence of Pak2, when cells were stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). In contrast, phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was not reduced when cells were stimulated by soluble anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/CD28 in the absence of Pak2 (data not shown), suggesting that Pak2 is required for transducing signaling events that are specifically provoked by plate-bound TCR stimulation. TCR engagement by plating T cells on surfaces coated with antibodies to the TCR mimics T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and triggers dynamic changes in actin cytoskeletal architecture, such as formation and expansion of contacts bounded by continuously remodeled actin-rich rings (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wear et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bunnell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Babich et al., 2012</a>). These actin-rich rings are associated with extension of lamellipodia that requires assembly and disassembly of actin filament neworks (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bunnell et al., 2001</a>). Changes in actin cytoskeletal architecture induced by TCR engagement promote T cell signaling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Babich et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, actin dynamics that mediate ongoing actin polymerization and retrograde flow promotes sustained PLC\u03b31 signaling during plate-bound TCR activation, while disruption of F-actin dynamics inhibits sustained PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Babich et al., 2012</a>). Since activation of PLC\u03b31 plays a critical role in activating Erk1/2 following TCR stimulation, we hypothesized that Pak2 participates in activation of Erk1/2 via promoting PLC\u03b31 activation by regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics during T cell spreading triggered by TCR engagement. Indeed, we found that phosphorylation of PLC\u03b31 that is known to be associated with its activation status (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 1991</a>) is profoundly decreased in the absence of Pak2, indicating that Pak2 is required for optimal PLC\u03b31 activation, possibly by regulating actin cytoskeletal reorganization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>)."

To determine whether the loss of Pak2 affects the actin cytoskeleton in CD4SP thymocytes, we first examined actin polymerization and Rac1 activation in resting conditions. To our surprise, the amount of polymerized filamentous actin (F-actin) was greatly increased in resting conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), suggesting processes regulating actin assembly and disassembly were disrupted in the absence of Pak2. Consistent with these data, Rac1 activation was consistently increased under resting conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, despite increased F-actin and activated Rac levels, Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes did not reorganize their actin cytoskeleton and spread when triggered by plate-bound TCR stimulation. WT CD4SP thymocytes exhibited intense spreading at 60 min of stimulation, when they were plated on the coverslips coated with antibodies to the TCR (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, upper left and middle panels), while polarizing F-actin of the cell body towards to the contact sites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, upper right panel). In stark contrast, Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes displayed poor spreading at the contact sites and actin polymerization at the contact sites was markedly impaired (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, lower left and middle panels), while F-actin in the cell was not polarized towards to the contact sites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, lower right panel). As a result, areas where cells spread at the contact sites were significantly reduced in the absence of Pak2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). These findings revealed that Pak2 plays a vital role in regulating the actin cytoskeletal reorganization induced by TCR stimulation. Since the integrity of dynamic actin cytoskeletal structure and actin cytoskeletal reorganization triggered by TCR engagement are fundamental for the proper signal transmission in many biological processes of T cells, we propose that Pak2 controls multiple stages of T cell development in the thymus by governing dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton."

We found that Pak2 is required to remodel actin cytoskeletal architecture during T cell spreading induced by TCR stimulation. Since TCR engagement induces rapid changes in cytoskeletal reorganization in T cells, which is critical for transducing signals, it is possible that perturbation of the actin cytoskeletal reorganization processes in Pak2-deficient thymocytes prevents normal TCR-mediated signaling events. Indeed, inability to remodel the actin cytoskeleton during T cell spreading was accompanied by impaired activation of PLC\u03b31 and Erk1/2, suggesting Pak2 is required to drive actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling induced by the TCR. As a result, induction of Nur77 and phosphorylation S6 were inhibited, and proliferative responses were diminished in the absence of Pak2. Activation of PLC\u03b31 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sommers et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fu et al., 2010</a>) and Ras-mediated MAPK pathway leading to Erk1/2 activation are essential for positive selection (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alberola-Ila et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Swan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">O'Shea et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Swat et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pag\u00e8s et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fischer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McGargill et al., 2009</a>). Since positive selection is initiated by TCR/pMHC interaction between DP thymocytes and cTECs and controlled by avidity and affinity of this interaction (<a href=\"#bib59\">Starr et al., 2003</a>), inefficient signaling such as impaired activation of PLC\u03b31 and Erk1/2 could lead to defects in positive selection in the absence of Pak2. We also confirmed that disruption of actin dynamics by administration of either the F-actin stabilizing agent jasplakinolide (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bubb et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</a>) or the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin (<a href=\"#bib58\">Spector et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cou\u00e9 et al., 1987</a>) completely abrogated signaling events such as induction of Nur77 and S6 phosphorylation following plate-bound TCR stimulation (data not shown), suggesting actin cytoskeletal reorganization is critical for activation of TCR-induced signaling events.

Newly selected SP thymocytes acquire \u2018mature\u2019 features in the medulla before they egress (<a href=\"#bib39\">McCaughtry et al., 2007</a>). During this time, they decrease expression of CD69 and CD24 and increase expression of CD62L, integrin \u03b27, and Qa2. In addition, SP thymocytes become functionally mature as they acquire competency to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation, rather than die like their immature precursors DP or semi-mature SP thymocytes. We found that CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice were arrested at the semi-mature stage, unable to increase expression of CD62L and integrin \u03b27. CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice did not contain a functionally mature subset because they failed to proliferate following CD3 or CD3/CD28 stimulation. Rather, CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice contain more semi-mature cells that undergo cell death when stimulated, confirming that Pak2 is required for functional maturation of CD4SP thymocytes. The effect of Pak2 deficiency in CD4-expressing SP thymocytes was specific to the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage after positive selection, since the generation of semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes from DP thymocytes was normal in <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice. The mechanism by which Pak2 mediates the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage of CD4SP thymocytes is not clear. Since semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice were more prone to cell death following 24 hr of in vitro culture, Pak2 may be required for maintenance of semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes. However, Pak2 deficiency in CD4-expressing SP thymocytes did not increase cell death or apoptosis in freshly isolated thymocytes ex vivo or after 1\u20132 hr of in vitro culture. Moreover, the number of semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes was not reduced in <i>Pak2</i><sup><i>F/F</i></sup><i>;Cd4-</i>Cre mice, suggesting that the effect of Pak2 deficiency may be specific to the semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes that received a maturation signal. For example, the maturation signal may activate Pak2 in semi-mature cells to provide protection from apoptosis and to make the transition to the mature stage.

Failure to generate mature CD4SP thymocytes in the absence of Pak2 greatly impeded both KLF2 and S1P1 expression. Although KLF2 plays a critical role in egress and trafficking, KLF2 does not contribute to functional maturation of thymocytes because KLF2-deficient SP thymocytes are not defective in proliferation following CD3/CD28 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Takada et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, Pak2 plays essential roles in promoting functional maturation as well as KLF2 expression. These results indicate that Pak2-mediated functional maturation is required for the increased expression of KLF2. We propose that timed egress of thymocytes by KLF2 is tightly coordinated by a Pak2-dependent maturation process as a quality checkpoint mechanism.

It is not clear whether Pak2 is directly involved in regulating transcription responses by phosphorylating components of transcriptional machinery which mediate this transition, or whether Pak2 phosphorylates a signaling component that ultimately leads to the transcription response facilitating this transition.

We saw minimal reduction on phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 in cells treated with the MEK inhibitor UO126, while rapamycin completely inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389, suggesting phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 is mediated by mTOR-dependent, not by a MAPK-dependent pathway."

To determine whether reduced phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 in the absence of Pak2 is due to inhibition of mTORC1-mediated pathway, we examined phosphorylation of p70S6K at the T389 site because phosphorylation of this site was completely dependent on mTORC1-mediated pathway but independent of MAPK-mediated pathway (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 2C-2E</a>). Phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 was also decreased following 30 min and 1 hour of plate-bound CD3 stimulation in the absence of Pak2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Therefore, we conclude that Pak2 participates in mTORC1-mediated activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6. We added a section describing this finding in the manuscript."
