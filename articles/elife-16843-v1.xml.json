                    "text": "Research into how protein restriction improves organismal health and lengthens lifespan has largely focused on cell-autonomous processes. In certain instances, however, nutrient effects on lifespan are independent of consumption, leading us to test the hypothesis that central, cell non-autonomous processes are important protein restriction regulators. We characterized a transient feeding preference for dietary protein after modest starvation in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and identified tryptophan hydroxylase (<i>Trh</i>), serotonin receptor 2a (5HT2a), and the solute carrier 7-family amino acid transporter, <i>JhI-21</i>, as required for this preference through their role in establishing protein value. Disruption of any one of these genes increased lifespan up to 90% independent of food intake suggesting the perceived value of dietary protein is a critical determinant of its effect on lifespan. Evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory systems that define neural states of nutrient demand and reward are therefore sufficient to control aging and physiology independent of food consumption."

                    "text": "Research into how protein restriction improves organismal health and lengthens lifespan has largely focused on cell-autonomous processes. In certain instances, however, nutrient effects on lifespan are independent of consumption, leading us to test the hypothesis that central, cell non-autonomous processes are important protein restriction regulators. We characterized a transient feeding preference for dietary protein after modest starvation in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and identified tryptophan hydroxylase (<i>Trh</i>), serotonin receptor 2a (5HT2a), and the solute carrier 7-family amino acid transporter, <i>JhI-21</i>, as required for this preference through their role in establishing protein value. Disruption of any one of these genes increased lifespan up to 90% independent of food intake suggesting the perceived value of dietary protein is a critical determinant of its effect on lifespan. Evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory systems that define neural states of nutrient demand and reward are therefore sufficient to control aging and physiology independent of food consumption."

Previous work suggests that how an animal perceives food can also influence how fast the animal ages. For example, both flies and worms actually have shorter lifespans if their food intake is reduced when they can still \u201csmell\u201d food in their environment. However, the sensory cues that trigger changes in lifespan and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects are largely unknown."

Flies that had been deprived of food for a brief period tended to eat more protein than other flies that had not been starved. Ro et al. then revealed that serotonin, a brain chemical that can alter the activity of nerve cells, plays a key role in how fruit flies decide to feed specifically on foods that contain protein. Further experiments revealed also that flies age faster when they are allowed to interact with protein in their diet independently from other nutrients, despite eating the same amount. Disrupting any of several components involved in serotonin signaling protected the flies from this effect and led to them living almost twice as long under these conditions."

As such, it is this protein reward or value \u2013 rather than just eating protein itself \u2013 that influences how quickly the fly ages. Further work is now needed to understand how the brain mechanisms that allow animals to perceive and evaluate food act to control lifespan and aging."

Availability of specific nutrients, rather than overall caloric value, may be the driving force for this effect under some circumstances, and dietary protein is particularly important (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kamata et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mair et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mayntz et al., 2005</a>). Protein restriction extends lifespan in crickets (<a href=\"#bib53\">Reddiex et al., 2013</a>), flies (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mair et al., 2005</a>), mice (<a href=\"#bib61\">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</a>), and probably humans (<a href=\"#bib36\">Levine et al., 2014</a>). Nearly all research into the mechanisms of this phenomenon has focused on the consequences of amino acid imbalance within cells, mostly through investigation of the TOR pathway and its effectors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Efeyan et al., 2015</a>). Remarkably, however, many of the effects of diet manifest independently of food consumption, likely through global integration of nutrient signals and cell non-autonomous responses to those signals directed by the nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib39\">Linford et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mair et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Taylor et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, sensory neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can promote or limit lifespan depending on the specific neurons involved (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Apfeld and Kenyon, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Libert et al., 2007</a>), and the first instance of sensory modulation of lifespan in mice was recently reported (<a href=\"#bib55\">Riera et al., 2014</a>)."

For example, predatory spiders are known to select their prey depending on predicted\u00a0nutrient composition (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mayntz et al., 2005</a>), spider monkeys tightly regulate daily protein intake in the wild (<a href=\"#bib14\">Felton et al., 2009</a>), and laboratory mice balance their macronutrient intake differently under influence of a drug (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shor-Posner et al., 1986</a>). Changes in behavior of this sort require a dynamic process of context-dependent valuation of nutrients, which almost surely includes an integration of sensory perception of ecological availability and an internal assessment of nutrient demand. State-dependent valuation and how it drives behavior have been studied\u00a0in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pompilio et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tindell et al., 2006</a>). Context-dependent value of sugars has been established for oviposition preference in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yang et al., 2008</a>), and it is likely that food preference behavior also includes a similar context-dependent signaling process (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying how animals determine the value of certain nutrients in a context-dependent manner are not well understood. Previous studies have sought an understanding of the neural bases for assessing\u00a0protein and carbohydrate availability (<a href=\"#bib66\">Thibault and Booth, 1999</a>) because, phenotypically, these two macronutrients influence many biological activities, including fat accumulation, reproductive behavior, and lifespan (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Skorupa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tatar et al., 2014</a>). For a small fraction of these phenotypes, we have some understanding of mechanism. Genetic and neuronal manipulations have identified the biogenic amine, dopamine, as important for oviposition preference for dietary sugars in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2015</a>) and for recognition of the nutritive quality of sugar in mice (<a href=\"#bib11\">de Araujo et al., 2008</a>). A second biogenic amine, serotonin, has been implicated as an indicator of carbohydrate satiety and, less clearly, for influencing protein or lipid feeding. However, these studies are less well-defined and pharmacological approaches have been used. (<a href=\"#bib28\">Johnston, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">LeBlanc and Thibault, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Leibowitz and Alexander, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Leibowitz et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2010</a>). Unlike other biogenic amines serotonin is produced in the brain as well as in peripheral tissues. In many organisms the majority of serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal track (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gershon et al., 1965</a>), using a distinct synthetic pathway (<a href=\"#bib46\">Neckameyer et al., 2007</a>). Pharmacologic manipulation is, therefore, not sufficient to distinguish peripheral effects from those on central processing, such as satiety, reward, and overall nutrient value."

As described above, there is evidence that organisms forage to balance their intake of specific nutrients rather than merely to meet energetic requirements, and even humans are known to make feeding decisions based on dietary protein (<a href=\"#bib22\">Griffioen-Roose et al., 2011</a>). Although the molecular mechanisms for such choices are not well understood, important components of the process must include the ability to sense protein, to assess the value of protein relative to demand, and to execute behavioral and physiological responses that maintain protein homeostasis. We therefore initially sought insight into mechanisms of short-term behavioral choice in response to protein manipulations, with the expectation that targeting specific components of this mechanism might influence aging through valuation itself, independent of feeding or total nutrient intake. Here, we establish that serotonin signaling in the CNS through one serotonin receptor, receptor 2a, is required for protein preference by determining the\u00a0value of protein at the time of physiological demand. We also provide the first documented functional connection between amino acid transporter, JhI-21, and serotonin signaling in the context of macronutrient selection. We further demonstrate that modulators of protein value also mediate diet-dependent lifespan when animals are exposed to a complex nutrient environment where they are presumably required to continuously evaluate internal nutritional state relative to the availability of individual nutrients in the environment. These results highlight how the macronutrient valuation process itself, in the context of perceived availability and demand, can influence the aging process independent of food consumption."

We characterized a dynamic and transient protein-seeking behavior in <i>Drosophila</i> in response to nutrient demand. Using a new real-time feeding monitoring system called FLIC, which quantifies all contact interactions an individual fly has with food (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ro et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"http://www.wikiflic.com\">http://www.wikiflic.com</a>), we found that after mild starvation both male and female flies preferred a sugar diet supplemented with autolyzed yeast (the major protein source in the fly diet) over a diet composed exclusively of sugar (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, 24\u00a0hr starvation). This preference persisted for just over one day, with longer food deprivation increasing protein preference (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). On the other hand, fully-fed animals consumed a sugar-only diet more often throughout the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, fully-fed). Food choice was not based on caloric content because starved flies also chose a 1% protein diet over an isocaloric 1% sugar diet and an increase in protein concentration to a hypercaloric 5% did not affect this preference (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The FLIC system identifies every interaction with each food type and quantifies when this occurs and for how long. Using this information we found that total feeding time was a much stronger predictor of total protein feeding time than it was of sugar feeding time (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Moreover, flies with more total feeding time were more likely to choose a protein containing food as their first meal and to have a stronger protein preference over the course of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These results indicate that individual flies are affected differently by 24\u00a0hr starvation and that those under high nutrient demand (identified by large total feeding time) tend to choose protein as their first meal. These flies also consume greater amounts of protein over the course of the experiment, presumably to ameliorate their deficit. Following mild starvation, flies preferred autolyzed yeast, which is primarily composed of short peptide/single amino acids (<a href=\"#fig1s1\"><a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a></a>), to the same extent as a pure complex protein such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) over a wide range of concentrations, suggesting that behavioral preference for yeast is driven in whole or in part by its protein content. Twenty-four hour starvation had no detectable effect on internal protein levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), suggesting that preference was independent of gross protein stores. Protein preference is, therefore, not limited to reproductively active female flies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Vargas et al., 2010</a>) and is more dynamic than previously suspected."

Indeed, we observed that serotonin levels in the head were unchanged after starvation but increased 100\u2013200% after flies consumed protein compared with the fully-fed condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Because transcriptional regulation of serotonin receptors can directly affect behavioral output (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albert and Fran\u00e7ois, 2010</a>), we examined whether mRNA levels of serotonin receptors were altered in the head of the fly following protein ingestion. Much like the temporal profile of serotonin concentration, we observed an acute increase in the abundance of <i>5HT2a</i> mRNA, but not transcript from other serotonin receptors, in the heads of flies that were starved of all nutrients and refed with protein for 3\u00a0hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). <i>5HT2a</i> mRNA abundance was not affected by starvation alone, and it returned to the level of fully-fed animals after 24\u00a0hr of protein feeding, which is coincident with their loss of feeding preference (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Together, these results suggest that protein reward and preference are established in a relatively short time (&lt;3\u00a0hr) and regulated by serotonin signaling through 5HT2a."

Second, it may be important for higher-order processing of the value of ingested protein. To distinguish these hypotheses, we hyper-activated serotonergic neurons in fully-fed flies using targeted expression of a heat-sensitive Trp channel (<i>Trh-GAL4</i>&gt;<i>UAS-dTrpA1)</i>. If serotonin acts in protein sensing, both foods would be interpreted equally as containing protein, and thus we would expect flies to lack preference in our choice test regardless of their starvation state. In contrast, if serotonin acts to increase the value of consumed protein, we would predict that hyper-activation of serotonergic signaling would add value to protein meals and reinforce protein feeding in the absence of starvation. Although activation of serotonergic neurons suppressed feeding as we expected (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gasque et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> left), when fully-fed flies did eat, they showed a near absolute preference for protein-containing food (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> right; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Laboratory protocols that are standard in the aging field employ fly diets that consist of sugar and brewer\u2019s yeast, the sole source of dietary protein, combined in an agar medium in fixed ratios. On a standard laboratory diet of low or intermediate yeast content, <i>Trh</i> mutants were long-lived, and loss of <i>5HT2a</i> did not affect lifespan (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). If serotonin influences aging primarily through the physiological changes in response to the amount of protein consumed, then loss of <i>Trh</i> or <i>5HT2a</i> would be expected to reduce or eliminate diet-dependent changes in lifespan in fixed-diet conditions (<a href=\"#bib59\">Skorupa et al., 2008</a>). We found that <i>Trh</i> mutant flies responded similarly to control animals, while 5HT2a mutants showed a reduced response, when diet was manipulated in this traditional manner (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

Flies on a fixed diet can regulate meal size but not individual nutrient intake, resulting in the possibility that feeding behaviors may be dominated by one nutrient at\u00a0the expense of the other. For example, if the fixed mixture contains a high concentration of a certain nutrient, flies may cease feeding prematurely to prevent overeating that nutrient even if the demand for another is yet to be met. We therefore aged flies in more complex dietary environments where they can freely choose between two distinct food sources. In three control diets flies were provided with either a 10% sucrose-only, 10% yeast-only, or a fixed 10% sucrose/10% yeast diet on both sides of a divider. For the choice environment, flies were provided with 10% sucrose on one side of the divider and 10% yeast on the other, allowing them to freely interact with individual macronutrients (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

Several lines of evidence make it clear that this is not the case. First, mutant flies show the same extent of increased sugar consumption as control animals in the choice environment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, third bar group). Second, the lifespans of <i>Trh</i> and <i>5HT2a</i> mutant flies are reduced to a similar extent as control animals when the carbohydrate content of a fixed diet is increased (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>), showing that their lifespan is equally or more sensitive to dietary carbohydrate. Third, gross metabolites that are known to be influenced by food intake, including total protein, fat, and carbohydrate abundances (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Skorupa et al., 2008</a>), are strongly increased in the choice environment, and mutant and control animals are similarly affected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). It appears, therefore, that <i>Trh</i> and <i>5HT2a</i> mutant flies are eating the same amount of the same food, and they are processing nutrients similarly to control animals, in both the fixed- and choice-diet regimes. Yet lifespan of the mutant flies is dramatically longer in the complex dietary environment. Based on the roles of serotonin and 5HT2a in the valuation of dietary protein, we propose that the macronutrient valuation process itself is a potent factor that modulates organismal aging independent of food consumption."

Amino acid transporters may act as general sensors, as well as carriers, of nutrients (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hyde et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nicklin et al., 2009</a>). Solute carrier 7 protein family members are candidates for such a role, and the leucine transporter SLC7A5 is required to initiate amino acid dependent activation of TOR signaling (<a href=\"#bib64\">Taylor, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Verrey et al., 2004</a>). A BLAST analysis comparing vertebrate SLC7A5 to the fly protein database revealed the gene <i>juvenile hormone inducible 21 (JhI-21)</i> as the most likely homolog (see also, <a href=\"#bib51\">Piyankarage et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, we found that mutation in <i>JhI-21</i> abolished protein preference in starved flies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). We also discovered evidence that JhI-21 acts upstream of serotonin signaling; <i>JhI-21</i> mutant animals failed to increase neuronal serotonin after 3\u00a0hr of yeast feeding, establishing that it is required for protein-dependent serotonin production (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). <i>JhI-21</i> mutant females exhibited a normal increase in egg production with dietary protein concentration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), and they showed normal feeding in both fixed and choice environments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Nevertheless, mutation in <i>JhI-21</i> recapitulated the extended lifespan pattern observed in <i>Trh</i> and <i>5HT2a</i> mutant flies with a modest (13%) increase in mean lifespan in a fixed-diet condition (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) and a greater (32%) mean lifespan extension in a choice-diet environment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These data suggest that the <i>JhI-21</i> amino acid transporter, and possibly SLC7 protein family members in general, are conserved regulators of protein-dependent behavior and physiology and that they may function together with serotonin signaling to modulate aging independently of mechanisms that regulate reproduction and total food intake."

We used genetic tools that are specific to serotonergic synthesis in the CNS (<i>Trh-GAL4</i>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Daubert et al., 2010</a>) and loss-of-function mutants for <i>Trh</i> itself (<a href=\"#bib46\">Neckameyer et al., 2007</a>) and <i>5HT2a</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nichols, 2007</a>) to reveal significant spatial specificity of serotonin signaling in the brain for these effects. Based on immunostaining of adult <i>Drosophila,</i> Trh is found in 83 neurons per hemisphere of the brain (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bao et al., 2010</a>), and 5HT2a is concentrated in small groups of glomeruli such as the ellipsoid body, large field R-neurons, antennal lobe, and a subset of gustatory neurons in the suboesophageal ganglion (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nichols, 2007</a>). Moreover, by combining temporal neuronal manipulations with continuous feeding measures we were able to provide, for the first time, evidence that serotonin is acting acutely during the post-ingestive phase to drive behavioral and health outcomes. Mammalian studies have implicated some component of serotonin signaling in feeding regulation and nutrient balance, but these studies have been limited by the lack of spatial and temporal resolution inherent in pharmacological treatments and the technical difficulties of manipulating individual neurons or serotonin receptors.

                        "text": "Our results implicate nutrient valuation as another component of a central homeostatic system that perceives and evaluations nutrient availability to drive behavior and aging. Nutrient homeostasis includes a dynamic process of context-dependent valuation of nutrients, which entails an integration of sensory perception of ecological availability and an internal assessment of nutrient demand. Among such cell non-autonomous mechanisms, sensory perception of nutrients, independent of feeding, is known to modulate aging in several species (<a href=\"#bib37\">Libert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Smith et al., 2008</a>). This hypothesis begs the questions of whether and how sensory perception influences general serotonin signaling and the specific behavioral and aging effects that we describe. Our discoveries that the SLC7A5 homolog, JhI-21, is required for normal serotonin release following protein feeding and that loss of function in this gene increases lifespan suggest that peripherally expressed amino acid transporters play important roles in a putative central nutrient homeostatic system. In mice, a lysosomal amino acid transporter has been shown to communicate luminal amino acid levels to the canonical cellular amino acid sensor, TOR (<a href=\"#bib6\">Attardo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, an insect glycine transporter, <i>Slimfast</i>, together with certain solute carrier 6 family members are critical for organismal growth (<a href=\"#bib9\">Colombani et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goberdhan et al., 2005</a>), and several orphan <i>Drosophila</i> amino acid transporters in adipocytes regulate ovarian stem cell number (<a href=\"#bib5\">Armstrong et al., 2014</a>). In light of these studies, it is compelling to consider a potential amino acid sensing function of JhI-21 and to investigate its temporal and special expression. This may serve as a model to understand how information on nutrient availability and demand is relayed from key peripheral tissues to the CNS to stimulate appropriate behavioral and physiological responses."

We believe that these seemingly contradictory results instead indicate complex dynamics of nutrient demand and reward that may be occurring continuously in natural conditions. Despite plentiful food, it is likely that at any given time individual flies comprise a spectrum of protein demand states based on their recent history of feeding. Indeed, there is some indication of this in our long-term FLIC data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which suggest the possibility of a cycling between protein and sugar preference throughout a 24\u2009hr period. This is what might be expected were flies to be switching between foods to balance intake of protein and carbohydrate over time. Our mild starvation treatment would be expected to both enhance protein demand and synchronize this demand among flies, leading to a sensitized assay for protein preference at the population level. Tracer methods are unable to capture such dynamics and thus make it currently a technical challenge to understand these subtle differences in long-term <i>ad libitum</i> feeding patterns under conditions used for aging assays. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the beneficial effects of reduced serotonin signaling for lifespan become magnified when animals are asked to actively balance their nutrients in choice-diet conditions."

Studies of choice behavior have revealed interesting insights into the effect of dietary self-selection and different life history traits (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jensen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Maklakov et al., 2008</a>). However, incorporating such natural behaviors into aging studies is rare, and our work provides the first mechanistic insight into their influence. In our experiments, we presented the two macronutrients (carbohydrate and protein) as a choice, expecting this to ameliorate a situation where the animals are forced to ingest excess of a certain nutrient to obtain minimal levels of another (<a href=\"#bib58\">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2007</a>) or where the animals prematurely cease feeding to prevent such excess ingestion at the expense of remaining deficient. Interestingly, young flies appear healthier in the choice diet, with greater protein and TAG abundances and more robust behavioral abilities, including negative geotaxis. These functions deteriorate more rapidly in the choice diet, however, which is consistent with more rapid aging. While the subtleties of the choice environment remain to be elucidated, it is remarkable to note that not only nutrient availability but also nutrient presentation is important, independent of how much of each are consumed. If one accepts this premise, then it is reasonable to consider this environment as a more appropriate husbandry paradigm that better mimics conditions in nature or in human societies where individuals often seek out specific nutrients to satisfy short-term cravings."

It is also notable that the same neural circuits that evaluate internal and external nutritional status to determine what and when to eat also interact with major hormone axes known to influence aging, such as insulin-like and TGF\u03b2 signaling (<a href=\"#bib12\">Domingos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">You et al., 2008</a>).

We used either 45\u00a0mg/ml bovine albumin serum (BSA; Fisher Scientific) or autolyzed yeast (Bacto yeast extract, BD) as protein sources and 1% sucrose as sugar in the choice experiments. The candidate screen was done using the CAFE assay and BSA as a protein source. For the screen, we added 10<sup>\u20135.5</sup>\u00a0\u00b5M of denatonium benzoate (Sigma-Aldrich) in the protein-supplemented food to reduce the frequency of false positives."

Briefly, we filled one side of the food trough with a 1% sucrose+ protein solution and the other trough with a solution of 1% sucrose-only. To avoid positional bias, we alternated the side of each food type across different <i>Drosophila</i> feeding monitors (DFMs). After loading the foods, we introduced an individual fly into each behavioral arena using an aspirator. We began the FLIC monitor software (V. 2.0\u20132.1) before flies were loaded to ensure that no feeding signals were lost during the fly-loading time. Unless otherwise noted, choice experiments lasted 3\u00a0hr. A Cumulative PI of an individual was calculated as \u2018\u2018[(Total feeding interaction time on protein+sucrose) - (Total feeding interaction time on sucrose)]/Total feeding interaction time\u2019\u2019. We computed a time-dependent feeding PI from an individual fly by calculating fixed feeding PI within a 30\u00a0min time-window every 10\u2009min. Flies that did not generate any feeding signals in a given 30\u00a0min window were treated as missing data for that period. Average time-dependent PI values and their SEM across biological replicates were therefore calculated based only on flies that exhibited at least one feeding event during the period in question. Initial characterization of the protein feeding behavior when starved and fully-fed were determined by the FLIC system as well as all subsequent follow-up experiments after the candidate screen."

We calculated the Feeding bout PI as\u2019 [(Feeding interaction time on protein+sucrose during x number of feeding bouts) - (Feeding interaction time on sucrose during x number of feeding bouts)]/Total feeding interaction time during x number of feeding bouts\u201d.

Flies were then transferred to the negative geotaxis apparatus using brief CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia, after which they were allowed to recover for 30\u00a0min. We used an automated process in which flies were automatically dropped from 24\u201d. After freefall, which effectively knocked the flies to the bottom of the chamber, a video camera was triggered and individual fly movements were tracked for 10\u00a0sec using the DDrop software developed in our laboratory. From the tracking data we were able to calculate, for each female, the total distance traveled as well as the time required to reach the top of the chamber. We present the time (in seconds) required to reach the top of the chamber, which is highly correlated with total distance traveled."

Briefly, 2\u20133 day old adult female flies were transferred onto test food medium. For each genotype per treatment, we put 25 flies per vial with 8\u201310 vial replicates. Flies were transferred to new food three times per week at which time survival was recorded and dead flies removed. For the protein-restriction experiment, we used a fixed mixture of 5% sucrose + 5% yeast as the protein-restricted diet, and a fixed mixture of 5% sucrose +15% yeast as the high protein diet. For the lifespan experiments comparing 'Fixed food' vs 'Choice food' environments, we created inserts that fit into individual vials. These inserts allowed us to expose the flies to two separate sources of food simultaneously. For these experiments we either loaded the same foods on both sides (no choice diets) or a different food on each side (choice diet). Specifically, the no choice diets contained either 10% sucrose in each well, 10% yeast in each well, or a fixed mixture of 10% yeast and 10% sucrose in each well. The choice diet entailed 10% sucrose on one side of the insert and 10% yeast on the other side of the insert. To test effects of a sugar-rich diet on longevity, we provided flies a fixed mixture of 30% sucrose + 5% yeast as the sugar-rich food, or a fixed mixture of 5% sucrose + 5% yeast as the sugar-restricted food."

For comparison involving food preference, gene expression, metabolite amount, serotonin amount, and food consumption with more than two genotypes or treatment groups, we performed one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc significance test. We took linear regression approach to model the relationship between time spent feeding on either protein or sugar as dependent variable of total feeding time. To test the effects of diet and genotype in flies' food intake of the fixed vs choice diets, we used Two-way ANOVA. Unless otherwise indicated, pairwise comparisons between different treatment survivorship curves were carried out using the statistical package R with DLife, a survival analysis package developed in the Pletcher Laboratory (<a href=\"#bib38\">Linford et al., 2013</a>). P<b>\u2010</b>values for survivorship comparisons were obtained using log<b>\u2010</b>rank test. For testing interaction between genotypes and diets, we used cox-regression analysis to report P-value for the interaction term. In all cases, two<b>\u2010</b>tailed P<b>\u2010</b>values are reported. We also calculated P-values for aging experiments using a mixed effects modeling approach where standard linear models were applied using survival time as an outcome and vial within genotype as a random effect. In all cases, the P-values for the genotype effect on mean lifespan was significantly lower than we obtained using non-parametric log-rank statistics. Therefore, for all analyses, we report the P-values from the log-rank analyses because they are more conservative. To test for a diet effect on negative geotaxis, we used Mann-Whitney U-test."

They show short term starvation induces specific food preferences upon re-feeding using their elegant FLIC food choice assay. Fed flies prefer sugar only food where as previously starved flies show preference for a sugar/protein mix independent of calorific content. They performed a candidate genetic screen to identify the underlying mechanism and defined a clear role for serotonin signaling as flies lacking <i>Trh</i> showed reduced protein preference, and this effect is specifically while the food choice is being made and not prior. Interestingly, hyper activating serotonin signaling drove preference for protein containing food suggesting the value of protein was increased rather than serotonin mimics protein sensing. <i>Trh</i> mutants themselves are long lived but most intriguingly, flies given nutritional choice in their diet live very short compared to those on a fixed ratio media. Strikingly however, mutants in <i>Trh</i> or 5HT2 lived 90% longer in these conditions despite eating as much. Finally, mutation to the animal acid transporter <i>jhI-21</i> increases lifespan and dampens serotonin signaling in response to protein. Experiments are well thought out and executed and overall I think it\u2019s a worthy and interesting contribution to <i>eLife</i>."

However, in fixed food ratios, increasing protein suppresses lifespan in <i>Trh</i> mutants despite their lack of protein 'reward'. The authors explain away this effect by the concomitant changes in sugar intake. The manuscript would benefit from further discussion on this point and ideally some experimental support \u2013 i.e., if one were to increase protein in a fixed diet while decreasing sugar (i.e., removing its toxicity) would the authors predict that wild type animals would show decreased lifespan due to increased serotonin reward while now <i>trh</i> mutant would be refractory?"

The authors show that starvation induces flies to prefer protein rich food over sugar rich food and that this preference is mediated by serotonerigic signaling, requires tryptophan hydroxylase, the 5HT2a receptor and the solute carrier JhI-21. Temporal control over serotonin signaling using the shibiri system establishes that the serotonergic signal to be active during the re-feeding stage after starvation. This is further confirmed by qPCR or for the 5HT2a receptor. Interestingly, animals that are allowed to choose their food components show a shorter lifespan but only in animals with intact serotonin signaling. Animals with reduced serotonin signaling live dramatically longer in the choice paradigm even though the serotonin mutants also have a higher protein and triacylclycerol level and are not calorically restricted. Overall, an interesting and convincing study."

They show short term starvation induces specific food preferences upon re-feeding using their elegant FLIC food choice assay. Fed flies prefer sugar only food where as previously starved flies show preference for a sugar/protein mix independent of calorific content. They performed a candidate genetic screen to identify the underlying mechanism and defined a clear role for serotonin signaling as flies lacking Trh showed reduced protein preference, and this effect is specifically while the food choice is being made and not prior. Interestingly, hyper activating serotonin signaling drove preference for protein containing food suggesting the value of protein was increased rather than serotonin mimics protein sensing. Trh mutants themselves are long lived but most intriguingly, flies given nutritional choice in their diet live very short compared to those on a fixed ratio media. Strikingly however, mutants in Trh or 5HT2 lived 90% longer in these conditions despite eating as much. Finally, mutation to the animal acid transporter jhI-21 increases lifespan and dampens serotonin signaling in response to protein. Experiments are well thought out and executed and overall I think it\u2019s a worthy and interesting contribution to eLife.</i> "

However \u2013 in fixed food ratios increasing protein suppresses lifespan in Trh mutants despite their lack of protein 'reward'. The authors explain away this effect by the concomitant changes in sugar intake. The manuscript would benefit from further discussion on this point and ideally some experimental support \u2013 i.e. if one were to increase protein in a fixed diet while decreasing sugar (i.e. removing its toxicity) would the authors predict that wild type animals would show decreased lifespan due to increased serotonin reward while now trh mutant would be refractory?</i> "

Indeed, because we found the dramatic effects of a choice diet equally interesting, we have been pursuing experiments that are designed to understand how and why the choice diet produces the effects it does. While the details of this work are not pertinent, it has revealed that flies carrying a null mutation in 5HT2a are, for all practical purposes, immune to changes in lifespan, physiology, and health brought about by protein manipulation in the diet. We currently believe that the difference between <i>Trh</i> and 5HT2a mutants in these studies is due to the nature of the mutant alleles. The <i>Trh</i> allele is a hypomorph (complete loss of <i>Trh</i> is lethal during development) that retains some serotonergic signaling. The molecular details concerning how serotonin impacts lifespan through 5HT2a in response to protein reward are currently under investigation and, we believe, outside the scope of this current manuscript."

The authors show that starvation induces flies to prefer protein rich food over sugar rich food and that this preference is mediated by serotonerigic signaling, requires tryptophan hydroxylase, the 5HT2a receptor and the solute carrier JhI-21. Temporal control over serotonin signaling using the shibiri system establishes that the serotonergic signal to be active during the re-feeding stage after starvation. This is further confirmed by qPCR or for the 5HT2a receptor. Interestingly, animals that are allowed to choose their food components show a shorter lifespan but only in animals with intact serotonin signaling. Animals with reduced serotonin signaling live dramatically longer in the choice paradigm even though the serotonin mutants also have a higher protein and triacylclycerol level and are not calorically restricted.

Indeed, deriving new statistical analyses and error representation for these types of continuous data in which different flies (or none at all) contribute to the observable measure of the group turns out to be a significant statistical problem, which is, to our knowledge, unsolved at this point. Indeed, no other methods for measuring feeding behavior provide the ability to quantitatively assess individual variability (nearly all derive from group statistics). Ongoing theoretical research is being carried out to solve this problem. Nevertheless, we have addressed this concern by: (i) including manageable cumulative statistics, together with relevant error measures, (ii) adding new data from replicate experiments that establish robustness, and (iii) adding new analyses and data representations that, while in some ways unorthodox, provide additional support for our inference."

In other words, all flies eat one food or another at several times throughout the experiment, and therefore each fly provides a cumulative PI value that we now represent in the revision (see comment above). However, they obviously do not all feed at the same time. We tried to be as transparent as possible about this by representing the time-dependent PI plots with points that are proportional to the number of flies contributing to them. There is, however, a second way of representing feeding data, which is not by time but is instead by feeding bout. In other words, rather than asking what the preference index is for those flies that are feeding between 30 and 60min, we could ask what the preference index is for each fly over its first 5 meals (or 10 or 15 meals\u2026) regardless of when those meals occurred. In this way, the PI cannot be influenced by an unusual food choice by a small number flies because every included fly would contribute the same amount of information to each point (e.g., every fly in the experiment feeds at least five times). While not every fly would exhibit 10 or 15 meals, those that do contribute equally to the point and again error bars are meaningful. These \u201cFeeding bout PI\u201d plots are now presented in the supplementary figures as: <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1\u2014supplement Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>. We present Feeding bout PI only for select bout numbers because, while we could represent it as continuous (i.e., for 5,6,7,8, etc. feeding bouts), the statistics are intractable."
