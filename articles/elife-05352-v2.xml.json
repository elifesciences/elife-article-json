However, its small size and location deep within the brain have impeded direct investigation in humans with non-invasive techniques. Here we provide direct evidence for a functional role for the ATN in memory formation from rare simultaneous human intrathalamic and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from eight volunteering patients receiving intrathalamic electrodes implanted for the treatment of epilepsy, demonstrating real-time communication between neocortex and ATN during successful memory encoding. Neocortical-ATN theta oscillatory phase synchrony of local field potentials and neocortical-theta-to-ATN-gamma cross-frequency coupling during presentation of complex photographic scenes predicted later memory for the scenes, demonstrating a key role for the ATN in human memory encoding."

However, its small size and location deep within the brain have impeded direct investigation in humans with non-invasive techniques. Here we provide direct evidence for a functional role for the ATN in memory formation from rare simultaneous human intrathalamic and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from eight volunteering patients receiving intrathalamic electrodes implanted for the treatment of epilepsy, demonstrating real-time communication between neocortex and ATN during successful memory encoding. Neocortical-ATN theta oscillatory phase synchrony of local field potentials and neocortical-theta-to-ATN-gamma cross-frequency coupling during presentation of complex photographic scenes predicted later memory for the scenes, demonstrating a key role for the ATN in human memory encoding."

Brain imaging techniques have helped researchers identify two key brain regions that are involved in the process of memory formation: the neocortex and the hippocampus. The neocortex forms the outer layer of the brain, and performs complex tasks such as decision-making and language comprehension. The hippocampus, which sits deeper within the brain, deals primarily with memory and navigation. Research has shown that memory formation depends on communication between the neocortex and the hippocampus. However, scientists suspected that additional structures located beneath the neocortex\u2014among them, the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN)\u2014are also crucial for forming memories. This has been difficult to confirm as the small size of the ATN, and their location deep within the brain, make their activity almost impossible to monitor using standard brain imaging techniques."

Simultaneously, electrodes attached to the scalps of the volunteers recorded the activity of the neocortex. When a memory was successfully stored in the brain, the activity of the two regions became synchronized. This suggests that successful memory formation depends upon communication between the ATN and the neocortex."

While corticothalamic interactions are well-known to be crucial for adaptive behavior (<a href=\"#bib50\">Saalmann et al., 2012</a>), the functional role of the ATN in humans has resisted investigation with non-invasive techniques owing both to its depth and small size. Here we had the rare opportunity to record electrophysiological activity during memory encoding directly from the ATN and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei (DMTN) of eight epileptic human volunteers with electrodes implanted for epilepsy treatment, as well as from frontal (and in two cases, parietal) scalp electrodes, reflecting neocortical activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The DMTN are thought to be involved in executive control during memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib64\">Van der Werf et al., 2003</a>) and were hypothesized to play a lesser role than the ATN during encoding."

                        "text": "Mean fronto-thalamic phase-locking values (PLVs) across all eight participants during encoding are plotted against time and frequency in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Corticothalamic theta synchrony differences in a late (0.5\u20131.5 s) time window were predicted, given the theoretical importance of theta oscillations in memory, and the typical late timing of encoding-related differences in frontal and parietal event-related potentials (ERPs) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schott et al., 2002</a>) and in post-stimulus MT theta oscillatory power (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hanslmayr and Staudigl, 2014</a>). Frontal-right-ATN (RATN) theta synchrony was indeed greater during successful than unsuccessful encoding at 5\u20136 Hz between 0.5 and 1.5 s after picture presentation (permutation tests, PT: p = 0.001; paired T-tests, TT: T = 9.9, p = 0.000022; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Conservative false discovery rate correction (PT; 57 frequencies, 0\u2013100 Hz; 1024 data-points, 0\u20132 s) yielded a threshold of p = 0.0019 (overall criterion p = 0.05). Cluster-size PT (CSPT) on binary TT outcomes (significant/nonsignificant at p = 0.05) showed the second cluster of this late theta synchrony to be significant (\u223c1.0\u20131.5 s; p = 0.016; observed contiguous cluster 437 pixels; criterial cluster 285 pixels for overall p = 0.05). Synchrony at 5.2 Hz, averaged from 0.5 to 1.5 s for each participant, was greater during successful than unsuccessful encoding in seven of eight participants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), yielding a group difference in median synchrony (Wilcoxon test: p = 0.038). Participant 4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) also showed the difference from 1 to 1.5 s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), so that all eight participants showed a difference in this time-window. The time course of theta synchrony is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>. Compared with surrogate data (<a href=\"#bib62\">Theiler et al., 1992</a>), the PLV was significant (criterion p = 0.05) for 230 ms, which is more than a complete theta cycle at 5 Hz. The timescale is of the order of that over which synchrony is commonly detected (<a href=\"#bib65\">Varela et al., 2001</a>). Note from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014supplement 2</a> that theta synchrony was greater during successful than unsuccessful encoding in all eight participants from 1.25\u20131.5 s post-stimulus, and the appearance of two separate episodes at the group level is likely to have arisen due to inter-participant differences in the timing of the synchrony episode over the 1 s time window from 0.5\u20131.5 s post-stimulus."

Of note is that the gamma range was narrower (\u223c40\u201350 Hz compared with \u223c40\u201370 Hz) during successful than during unsuccessful encoding, resulting in significantly greater within-RATN CFC involving higher gamma-frequency amplitudes during unsuccessful compared with during successful encoding (paired T-test, TT, T = 3.6, p = 0.0086; cluster-size permutation test, CSPT: p = 0.045; observed contiguous cluster 15 pixels; criterial cluster 14 pixels for overall p = 0.05; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). The CFC patterns during successful and unsuccessful encoding were then compared directly. Within-RATN CFC during successful encoding was compared with a distribution of 1000 phase-scattered surrogates, and the theta-gamma (3.8\u20138.1 Hz, 30.5\u201364.6 Hz) cross-frequency points at which CFC during successful encoding exceeded a threshold with criterion p = 0.05 were identified. The same analysis was performed for unsuccessful encoding. The two resulting CFC patterns differed significantly (two-dimensional Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test\u20142-D KS test: d = 0.81, p = 0.048), with a wider gamma range during unsuccessful encoding. Assuming that an assembly of synchronously firing neurons is associated with a particular memory trace, the narrower RATN gamma range coupled with theta phase during successful memory formation could be interpreted as reflecting firing of only relevant neural assemblies, thus reflecting neural specificity during encoding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Desimone, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">D\u00fczel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schott et al., 2006</a>). We correspondingly postulate that the corticothalamic coupling may coordinate the firing of particular thalamic neural assemblies underpinning the memory to be encoded, facilitating synaptic strengthening and relevant memory formation. Indeed, ongoing CFC has been detected in the centromedian thalamic nucleus during cognitive task performance (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fitzgerald et al., 2013</a>). Again, there was no encoding-related CFC difference apparent for thalamic high gamma (<a href=\"#bib11\">Canolty et al., 2006</a>)."

The absence of neocortical-DMTN synchrony differences, together with their recent detection during verbal memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib60\">Staudigl et al., 2012</a>), fits with evidence suggesting ATN specialization for encoding (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harding et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Van der Werf et al., 2003</a>), and DMTN for retrieval (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harding et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Van der Werf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aggleton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aggleton, 2012</a>).

Item-specific attention indeed has a well-recognized effect on whether an item is successfully encoded (<a href=\"#bib48\">Raz and Buhle, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Muzzio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burke et al., 2014</a>).

Neural encoding differences related to later memory have been identified using ERPs and cortical theta/gamma oscillations, generally peaking at around 1 s after stimulus presentation, continuing up to 1.5 s post-stimulus (<a href=\"#bib46\">Paller et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schott et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sederberg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Osipova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lega et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hanslmayr and Staudigl, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Long et al., 2014</a>). Secondly, whereas oscillatory dynamics between the pulvinar thalamic nucleus and the parietal cortex support visual attention in macaques, consistent with attention deficits following focal pulvinar lesions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Saalmann et al., 2012</a>), our main findings pertain to the ATN, for which lesion and animal studies suggest a role in memory. Moreover, based on current knowledge about the ATN and the DMTN (<a href=\"#bib64\">Van der Werf et al., 2003</a>) one would rather expect attentional differences to be reflected in DMTN activity, which we did not find. Most critically, if global attentional fluctuations were responsible for our theta synchrony findings, one would expect longer response times during the encoding phase for later forgotten compared with later remembered scenes, due to lack of attention to the encoding task. However, response times did not differ. Finally, global attentional fluctuations over time would also imply a dependency between the probability of successful encoding on successive trials during the study phase of the experiment, and we found no dependency."

Electrode location is provided in detail for Participant 1 for illustration purposes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The deepest two thalamic contacts were located in the DMTN, and the most superficial in the ATN. The second most superficial was at the ATN/DMTN border. The critical results from this participant (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) were obtained from a bipolar recording from the two most superficial right-sided thalamic contacts. We confirmed that the synchrony patterns were not observed when the second most superficial contact was referenced to either of the two deeper contacts, suggesting that the critical signals originated from the most superficial contact, which was clearly located in ATN, and not from its reference contact."

No seizures took place during the testing sessions, and all patients were fully alert and cooperative throughout. Epochs were individually visually inspected and cleaned of ocular and other artifacts using temporal-decorrelation-separation independent component analysis (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2012</a>). Spikes and spike-waves were also removed using this approach, to maximize the number of epochs for analysis. We deemed the differences in electrophysiological activity detected between epochs recorded during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding in our simple task to be unlikely to result from global attentional fluctuations due to epileptiform activity for several reasons. Firstly, accuracy was close to ceiling for the indoor vs outdoor judgment during encoding. Secondly, there was no difference in response times during encoding for successful compared with unsuccessful memory formation. Thirdly, successful and unsuccessful encoding of successive scenes in the series showed no sequential dependency. Furthermore, while the cortical site of the epileptic focus differed across participants (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), the reported results were highly consistent across the group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2, 6\u20137</a>).

Across these three participants, the mean difference in these percentages between successful and unsuccessful encoding was only 1.83% (i.e., slightly greater for successful encoding), suggesting that concerns about spikes and spike-waves being confounded with the two data categories of interest are minimal. Nevertheless, the analyses were also performed excluding epochs with spikes and spike-waves, and the findings reported remained statistically significant."

A logarithmic scale was used to take account of the frequency resolution of the Morlet wavelet (<a href=\"#bib16\">D\u00fczel et al., 2005</a>), such that wavelet spacing became sparser as frequency increased. After wavelet transformation, a phase series was extracted for each epoch, and the phase differences between scalp and thalamic channels were calculated (for details of this well known method (see <a href=\"#bib30\">Lachaux et al., 1999</a> and <a href=\"#bib61\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2012</a>). Phase-locking values (PLVs) could vary between 0 (no PL) and 1 (complete PL). In order to enhance time resolution (at the expense of frequency resolution), we also applied 1-cycle wavelets, confirming that the synchrony that we report (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) took place post-stimulus (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Statistical analysis thus focused on the 2 s post-stimulus period of 1024 time-points. It should be noted that the calculation of PLVs may be influenced by a common reference (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vinck et al., 2011</a>), and we addressed this issue by using bipolar referencing in our thalamic recordings (see also <a href=\"#bib60\">Staudigl et al., 2012</a>). Volume conduction may also influence PLVs (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vinck et al., 2011</a>), but in the present study, phase synchrony is calculated between the frontal cortex and the RATN, whose spatial separation should exclude this influence."

For the permutation tests, a false discovery rate correction (<a href=\"#bib11\">Canolty et al., 2006</a>) was applied for the 57 frequency (0\u2013100 Hz) and 1024 time-point (0\u20132 s) comparisons, which was especially conservative given the dependency between adjacent time and frequency points (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the T-tests, a cluster-size permutation test (<a href=\"#bib38\">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</a>) was performed, in which a cluster was defined as adjacent significant (criterion: p = 0.05 by paired T-test) time-frequency points. Mean PLV matrices for each participant for each condition were randomly assigned to two groups 1000 times, and T-tests were performed across time and frequency for each permutation. T-test outcomes were rendered binary (1 = significant, 0 = nonsignificant) for each of the 57 frequencies and 1024 time-points, and the maximum cluster size (as defined above) emerging randomly in each iteration was calculated in order to provide a distribution against which to determine the significance of the observed cluster size. The same approach was taken for cluster-size significance in the cross-frequency coupling analysis described below. Finally, we evaluated the consistency of the results across the eight participants by applying a nonparametric (and thus conservative) Wilcoxon test of the differences between theta (5.2 Hz) PLVs for successful and unsuccessful encoding in the 0.5 to 1.5 s time-window in which theta differences had been revealed by the above-described conservative methods (see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In order to use all available data to calculate the PLV difference between successful and unsuccessful encoding, this selection of 26 epochs and mean PLV calculation was carried out 200 times and an overall observed mean PLV was then calculated for successful encoding. For significance testing by permutation tests, this difference was compared to an error distribution, which was obtained by randomly assigning 52 epochs, irrespective of encoding success, to two artificial categories 1000 times (each time randomly selecting 26 of the 74 successful encoding epochs, and using all 26 unsuccessful encoding epochs) and calculating the mean PLV difference each time.

The average complex value across epochs was then also calculated, and from this value, the modulatory phase was determined by taking the arctangent of the imaginary over real parts, thus quantifying the average phase of the lower frequency oscillation at which the amplitude of the high frequency oscillation was highest. The theta amplitudes were then shifted by minus modulatory phase, and the correlation coefficient (CC) between the shifted theta oscillations and the gamma amplitudes was found. The CC was Fisher-Z transformed, then a mean was taken over epochs for each participant to provide the modulation index, separately for successful and unsuccessful encoding. Paired T-tests comparing successful with unsuccessful encoding were then performed for each pixel within the 37 theta-phase frequency by 21 gamma-amplitude frequency matrix, comparing the degree of theta-phase with gamma-amplitude coupling. The resulting p values, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, were then subjected to a cluster-based correction via permutation testing as described above for synchrony differences."

GC uses multivariate autoregressive modeling to ascertain whether time series A may be more accurately predicted from time series B, with a certain time lag, than B from A. If incorporating values from B in the regression of A allows better prediction of A than vice versa, B is said to influence A. The data were first detrended and rendered zero mean across epochs to remove nonstationarity. The variances of the prediction errors of the autoregressive models were then used to assess likely information flow direction. The Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC, BIC) were employed to calculate a model order balancing overparameterization and adequate spectral resolution (<a href=\"#bib57\">Seth, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Staudigl et al., 2012</a>). When a minimum is not reached and the BIC/AIC does not show substantial decreases at higher orders, as here, model orders for EEG are usually chosen over a range (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brovelli et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Staudigl et al., 2012</a>). We applied model orders from 26 to 36, identifying a peak GC corresponding to a third of a theta cycle. Model coefficients were interpreted in the frequency domain. Significance of the difference between frontal-RATN and RATN-frontal GC in successful and in unsuccessful encoding was assessed by paired T-tests."

The model order specifies the number of time lagged observations made (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bressler and Seth, 2011</a>), and the order at which GC peaks provides an indication of how long into the past one signal provides information about subsequent activity in the other signal. We interpreted the model order corresponding with peak causality as providing an indication of the delay in transfer of information (<a href=\"#bib60\">Staudigl et al., 2012</a>), which has been measured directly between the frontal cortex and hippocampus in rats and found to be consistent with the delays suggested by the present data (<a href=\"#bib58\">Siapas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Benchenane et al., 2010</a>)."

The authors assessed phase synchronization and cross frequency coupling in recordings from eight patients with epilepsy, who performed an intentional picture encoding task followed by a recognition memory test. They confirmed the hypothesis that the interaction between the anterior thalamus and frontal cortex is related to successful memory formation and based on cross-region theta synchronization and local theta-gamma coupling. The paper is clearly and concisely written but each of the reviewers had several concerns that should be addressed in a revision."

Reaction time differences in the simple orientation task (indoor/outdoor decision) might be related to modulations of attention, but they are dominated by stimulus features. The decision is just more difficult for some items than others. Also analyzing the probability of sequential encoding is not convincing. This analysis might track slowly modulated changes in attentional states, but it fails to detect trial-by-trial fluctuations of attention, which might be most relevant for the subsequent memory effect as assessed here. However, the subsequent memory paradigm depends on fluctuations in the probability to encode a series of items. If you would theoretically be able to align perfectly attention, stimuli, emotional valence and all other factors modulating the likelihood to encode an item successfully, a given subject would encode either all items or none."

If the subject is able to perform the orientation task correctly (and above chance level), we can assume that he/she has processed the items attentively, further fluctuations of attention are most likely present and related to memory formation success, but this is no problem because these fluctuations are needed for this study design. To dissociate attentional from mnemonic components, one would for instance need a factorial design modulating memory formation and attention; very difficult to come up with a clever design (see Rees et al. Science 1999 for an attempt). To my opinion, the authors can just omit this attentional topic in their Results and Discussion section."

The data presented is not sufficient to support this specificity. Also the framing is too focused. For instance, they ignore the nucleus reunions, a most relevant thalamic relay station interacting with the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe during specific mnemonic processes (e.g., Xu and S\u00fcdhof, Science 2013). Given the connectivity of this nucleus, it is way better suited to support memory formation by connecting to the (medial) prefrontal cortex. I suggest to present the electrode localization in more detail and to broaden the framing."

One might argue that highly confident measurements are episodic-type retrieval more than recognition but in the analysis they appear to collapse all confidence measurements into two different categories. Given the available data, I assume it is difficult to disambiguate highly confident from only partially confident measurements, but I would prefer to see something that attempts to look more strongly at the \u201crecall\u201d type encoding events rather than those that are simply recognition events. Further, in a recognition memory paradigm, activity at retrieval is probably as important as activity during encoding for determining success and an analysis focusing on this epoch would be of interest. Specifically, examining activity time-locked to retrieval item presentation would be interesting. I think the study is still noteworthy, even if it assesses recognition memory and not episodic memory, but they authors may wish to re-cast their findings somewhat."

(2010). Deep brain stimulation in the treatment of refractory epilepsy: update on current data and future directions. Neurobiology of disease, 38(3), 354-360.) To my eyes, in the supplementary figures, the parietal response is more robust than the examples of a frontal response that they show. Certainly, the memory-relevant thalamic connections may include multiple cortical areas, but if the memory effect does not have any region-specificity it may indicate orienting or attention, etc. more than a memory specific effect. Obtaining more scalp electrode data in these patients may be possible for future cases (dressing issue can be overcome by placing scalp leads under sterile conditions in the OR), but if the authors have any other contacts to report or can compare the frontal versus parietal activity this may help. They can also maybe differentiate frontal pole from FCz activity in the aggregated data. This would apply both to the synchrony analysis and the CFC analysis."

The clustering analysis shows significant synchrony in short time periods within the .5-1.5 second epoch, but for a 5 Hz oscillation I would expect something like .5-1 seconds of continuously significant synchrony difference via the PLV value across subjects. But when they compare the PLV value for the entire time window and compare across the subjects, the effect (p = 0.038) may not survive a correction for multiple comparisons across all of the different tests they performed. I would prefer to see more analyses that look across the relevant time window, long enough to account for a few cycles of the oscillation. Similarly, while the PLV difference is significant, I would like to see something (maybe I missed it) showing the level of synchrony by itself is significant for the same relevant, contiguous time epoch, at least for the putatively higher-synchrony condition (successful encoding). I assume the authors did this following the LaChaux methods but a plot showing the time windows that are significantly synchronous would be helpful."

Placement of electrodes in the ATN and DMTN provided a rare opportunity to record electrophysiological data from the human thalamus, and we investigated memory function, because human lesion studies and animal studies suggest that these nuclei play a role in memory processing (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harding et al. 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Van der Werf et al. 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aggleton et al. 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aggleton 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Vertes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Staudigl et al. 2012</a>).

Furthermore, the connectivity of the nucleus reuniens does not include direct communication with the ATN or DMTN (Cassel et al. 2013).

Further, in a recognition memory paradigm, activity at retrieval is probably as important as activity during encoding for determining success and an analysis focusing on this epoch would be of interest.

The anterior thalamic nucleus was selected as a target for epilepsy because of wide cortical projections, a \u201cway-station\u201d between localized onset and generalization. Clinically, part of ATN electrode placement includes proving that stimulation elicits a driving response in multiple cortical locations (Lega, B. C., Halpern, C. H., Jaggi, J. L., &amp; Baltuch, G. H. (2010). Deep brain stimulation in the treatment of refractory epilepsy: update on current data and future directions. Neurobiology of disease, 38(3), 354-360.) To my eyes, in the supplementary figures, the parietal response is more robust than the examples of a frontal response that they show. Certainly, the memory-relevant thalamic connections may include multiple cortical areas, but if the memory effect does not have any region-specificity it may indicate orienting or attention, etc. more than a memory specific effect. Obtaining more scalp electrode data in these patients may be possible for future cases (dressing issue can be overcome by placing scalp leads under sterile conditions in the OR), but if the authors have any other contacts to report or can compare the frontal versus parietal activity this may help. They can also maybe differentiate frontal pole from FCz activity in the aggregated data. This would apply both to the synchrony analysis and the CFC analysis</i>."

While the synchrony pattern we report is discernible with all 3 cortical electrode placements, it is not identical. We also show the difference between frontal-RATN theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling involving the different frontal electrode placements. Again, the patterns are similar but not identical. We cannot, however, make strong claims about cortical specificity given the number of participants with each electrode placement. Participants 3-8 had only a single frontal electrode, at Fpz, and only participants 1 and 2 had other frontal and also parietal contacts, meaning that power is inadequate for a group statistical analysis to compare differing frontal and parietal synchrony directly."

The clustering analysis shows significant synchrony in short time periods within the .5-1.5 second epoch, but for a 5 Hz oscillation I would expect something like .5-1 seconds of continuously significant synchrony difference via the PLV value across subjects. But when they compare the PLV value for the entire time window and compare across the subjects, the effect (p = 0.038) may not survive a correction for multiple comparisons across all of the different tests they performed. I would prefer to see more analyses that look across the relevant time window, long enough to account for a few cycles of the oscillation. Similarly, while the PLV difference is significant, I would like to see something (maybe I missed it) showing the level of synchrony by itself is significant for the same relevant, contiguous time epoch, at least for the putatively higher-synchrony condition (successful encoding).
