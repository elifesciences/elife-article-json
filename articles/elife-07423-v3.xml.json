In <i>Drosophila</i>, exposure to parasitoid wasps leads to a sharp decline in oviposition. We show that exposure to predator elicits both an acute and learned oviposition depression, mediated through the visual system. However, long-term persistence of oviposition depression after predator removal requires neuronal signaling functions, a functional mushroom body, and neurally driven apoptosis of oocytes through effector caspases. Strikingly, wasp-exposed flies (teachers) can transmit egg-retention behavior and trigger ovarian apoptosis in naive, unexposed flies (students). Acquisition and behavioral execution of this socially learned behavior by naive flies requires all of the factors needed for primary learning. The ability to teach does not require ovarian apoptosis. This work provides new insight into genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie an ecologically relevant form of learning and mechanisms for its social transmission."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, exposure to parasitoid wasps leads to a sharp decline in oviposition. We show that exposure to predator elicits both an acute and learned oviposition depression, mediated through the visual system. However, long-term persistence of oviposition depression after predator removal requires neuronal signaling functions, a functional mushroom body, and neurally driven apoptosis of oocytes through effector caspases. Strikingly, wasp-exposed flies (teachers) can transmit egg-retention behavior and trigger ovarian apoptosis in naive, unexposed flies (students). Acquisition and behavioral execution of this socially learned behavior by naive flies requires all of the factors needed for primary learning. The ability to teach does not require ovarian apoptosis. This work provides new insight into genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie an ecologically relevant form of learning and mechanisms for its social transmission."

Yet, emerging studies are providing mounting evidence to suggest that the use of social cues extend far beyond the traditional notions of social animals: organisms once viewed as asocial in nature are now known to have advanced forms of social communication (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gariepy et al., 2014</a>). This social transmission of information can result in distinct behavioral changes, based on another individual's set of experiences. The ability to learn from others influences the choices and behaviors of individuals and allows a group of individuals to share information about a changing environment. It is speculated that social information transmission involves either the ability to feel vicarious reward and punishment or other complex communication strategies to transmit an individual's experience to the community of conspecifics. The potential benefits of adaptive behavior, based on information acquired from others within the community, can give social learners a significant advantage over those that must directly explore and gather environmental information for themselves. Understanding how this information transfer occurs and what the underlying neurological and molecular mechanisms are is critical for a comprehensive view of adaptive behavior across a wide range of taxa."

Plants have been observed to alter their physiology in response to signaling from another plant (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baldwin and Schultz, 1983</a>). An example of such communication involves salt stress, which has been shown to trigger the release of volatile organic compounds that induce salt resistance in neighboring plants that have yet to experience any salt stress (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee and Seo, 2014</a>). In animals, the process is speculated to be more complex: honeybees are able to fine tune signals directed at individuals within the hive that elicit highly specific behavioral changes in response to specific environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wenner, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schneider and Lewis, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Richard et al., 2012</a>).

It is clear that the once thought \u2018fine line\u2019 between social and non-social organisms is beginning to blur, and that social communication is actually much more fundamental to life than originally considered."

Learning can occur in a social context through olfactory cues, observation and instruction, or by imitation, and thus, is a mechanism for sharing information about a changing environment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baldwin and Meldau, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cermakian et al., 2013</a>). The potential benefits of adaptive behavior, based on information acquired from others within the community, can give social learners a significant advantage over those that must directly explore and gather environmental information for themselves. However, in general, the underlying molecular mechanisms of social learning are almost entirely mysterious and remain a <i>terra incognita</i> in terms of the strategies for communication, perception, neural plasticity, and the underlying physiological changes that cause changes in behavior. In this study, we use endoparasitoid wasps to explore social learning in the <i>Drosophila</i> model system with the aim of addressing some of these open questions."

These wasps prey on immature stages of other insects, using larva and pupa of certain species as hosts for their own offspring. Such wasps pose a serious threat to juvenile <i>Drosophila</i>, with infection rates as high as 90% in natural populations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Janssen et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Driessen et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fleury et al., 2004</a>). Adult <i>Drosophila</i> have evolved complex behavioral changes to protect their offspring from these predatory wasps, including altered food preference and reduced oviposition rates (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lefevre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kacsoh et al., 2013</a>). Adult <i>Drosophila</i> themselves are not infected by these wasps, thus, making the change in reproductive behavior beneficial only to an anticipated threat to their offspring and not a response to predation itself. A remarkable feature of this altered reproductive behavior is that female <i>Drosophila</i> never having seen this predator can nevertheless robustly and reproducibly respond to it, suggesting an innate recognition of this predator-threat. Here, we use this natural predator system to explore predator threat communication within <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and describe the specific learning, memory, and anatomical components necessary for this response. Our findings report the first example of social learning in <i>Drosophila</i> that can be delineated from simple mimicry, through the use of a natural predator. Exposure to the predatory wasp results in a distinct germ line-cell physiological apoptotic response in both flies having seen the wasp (direct experience) or flies having been paired with experienced individuals (social learning), which is clearly independent of mimicry. Furthermore, we address the genetic factors, neural circuits, and behavioral changes necessary for the transmission of this socially learned alteration in germ line physiology."

This behavioral change entails at least two different and quantifiable behavioral responses. First, if high-ethanol containing food is made available to adult <i>Drosophila</i>, then wasp-exposed females will actively prefer to lay eggs on ethanol-laden food (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kacsoh et al., 2013</a>). Second, if ethanol-containing food is not an option, <i>Drosophila</i> females will depress their egg-laying frequency, presumably to allow for time to search and discover an egg-laying environment that is not wasp infested (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lefevre et al., 2012</a>). Adult <i>Drosophila</i> are not infected by these wasps, thus, making the change in reproductive behavior beneficial only to an anticipated threat to their offspring. To address the question of whether changes in reproductive behavior could be transferred from exposed teacher flies to naive student conspecifics, we examined the underlying physiological, physical, and genetic components of the exposed teacher and naive student flies and asked if these mechanisms rely on learned reproductive behavior."

After 24 hr, food plates were removed and embryos counted. Consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lefevre et al., 2012</a>), exposed females reduced their oviposition rate significantly (average unexposed lay \u223c65 \u00b1 3.2 eggs; average exposed lay \u223c13 \u00b1 1.98 eggs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We observed this robust response in at least four different genetic backgrounds including <i>Canton-S</i> (CS), <i>Oregon-R</i> (OreR) (unexposed \u223c57 \u00b1 2.84 eggs compared to exposed 13 \u00b1 1.88 eggs on average)<i>, w</i><sup><i>1118</i></sup> (unexposed \u223c25 \u00b1 1.54 eggs compared to exposed \u223c1 \u00b1 0.53 egg on average), and transgenic flies carrying Histone H2AvD-GFP (His-GFP) (unexposed \u223c108 \u00b1 7.69 eggs compared to exposed 18 \u00b1 1.97 eggs) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clarkson and Saint, 1999</a>). To test whether this decrease in egg laying can be transmitted from exposed flies to naive females, we exposed <i>Canton-S</i> flies to wasps for 24 hr, then removed the wasps and placed these pre-exposed flies in a new condo with three naive female flies expressing Histone-GFP (His-GFP) for an additional 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The His-GFP line was ideal for discriminating mixed populations of non-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP embryos since this histone is clearly visible by 70 min after oviposition (embryonic cell cycle 9) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Foe et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clarkson and Saint, 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Oviposition in exposed teacher females was significantly reduced during the 24-hr exposure to wasps (acute depression: 0\u201324 hr) (53 \u00b1 3.35 compared to 14 \u00b1 1.59 eggs) and this depression persisted for an additional 24-hr post wasp exposure (learned depression: 24\u201348 hr) (35 \u00b1 2.44 compared to 19 \u00b1 1.33 eggs), relative to age-matched, unexposed sibling controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Quantification of total GFP and non-GFP embryos deposited during the 24\u201348 hr after initial teacher exposure to wasps demonstrated that naive His-GFP student flies had also decreased oviposition, relative to His-GFP siblings mixed with unexposed <i>Canton</i>-<i>S</i> flies (33 \u00b1 2.34 compared to 6 \u00b1 0.86 eggs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In the reciprocal experiment, naive <i>Canton-S</i> student flies mixed with pre-exposed His-GFP teacher flies also exhibited a decrease in oviposition (46 \u00b1 2.48 compared to 14 \u00b1 1.34 eggs, see <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary files 6,7</a> for all raw egg numbers) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Thus, naive female flies, never experiencing wasp exposure directly, reduced oviposition when encountering exposed flies. The decrease in oviposition of student flies is not due to an effect of the ratio of teacher to student flies. We tested a 1:1 ratio of 3 exposed female teachers to 3 naive female student flies. This elicited a similar reduction in oviposition (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). Interestingly, when we tested a 1:1 ratio of 3 exposed males to 3 naive female student flies, we found no significant decrease in oviposition for students instructed by exposed males (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H,I</a>). This suggests that, under these conditions, only females can transmit predator-response information. Males are neither necessary nor sufficient for the information transfer. Therefore, for all further experiments, we used a teaching cohort of 5 females and 1 male to 3 female students, unless otherwise noted."

Our results demonstrate that teachers can instruct multiple cohorts of students, thus, the inability of a student to become a teacher is not due to a limitation in amount a teacher can teach."

Interestingly, the majority of apoptosis was observed at the stage 7/8 egg chamber checkpoint, with almost no apoptosis in region 2/3, as visualized by DNA staining with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), suggesting that the pathway through which apoptosis was being triggered is fundamentally different from previously described apoptotic events (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McCall, 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>). <i>Canton-S</i> and His-GFP fly ovaries were easily distinguishable when stained together, thus, making it possible to score apoptosis levels in ovaries of exposed and unexposed females under completely identical conditions (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Further confirmation that wasp exposure triggered a true apoptotic event is evidenced by the presence of characteristic DAPI-intense pychnotic nurse cell nuclei, by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) stain that detects fragmented DNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013J</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>), and activated caspase-3 staining (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>): All positive markers of the cell death process (<a href=\"#bib36\">McCall, 2004</a>). We noted that both DAPI and TUNEL were readily detected in apoptotic stage 12/13 nurse cells in both exposed and unexposed females at similar levels. Developmentally regulated cell death is normally expected to eliminate late-stage nurse cells in maturing oocytes, thus, serving as an internal control for the level of detected apoptosis in exposed and unexposed females (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A,B</a>). Similar to the reduced oviposition behavior observed, this physiologically triggered apoptosis specifically of stage 7/8 egg chambers persisted well beyond the period of initial wasp exposure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C,D</a>)."

We gave both exposed and unexposed flies a high-protein yeast food stained with red food dye to visualize food intake. We found that both wasp-exposed and unexposed flies exhibited a similar amount of high-protein yeast food intake even when given a choice to feed on normal food without yeast by visualizing the red dye in the fly abdomens (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). The red yeast paste was placed on instant <i>Drosophila</i> media, which turns blue upon contact with water, allowing us to visualize whether flies are preferring high (red)- or low (blue)- nutrient food (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013L</a>). We found that even in the presence of high-protein yeast food, exposed flies still depressed oviposition when compared to unexposed controls, in addition to having apoptosis induced at the egg chamber stage 7/8 checkpoint (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1M\u2013T</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). Thus, the mid-oogenesis apoptosis checkpoint triggered in exposed flies is not due to a poor nutrition intake.

                                "text": "One explanation for social learning could be that student flies instinctively mimic the behavior of more experienced teacher flies. Repeated episodes of imitative behavior could lead to a strengthening of neural circuits that underlie this behavior. We explored this idea by testing if wasp-exposed flies that are genetically unable to suppress oviposition efficiency are still able to successfully act as teacher flies. The <i>Drosophila</i> mid-oogenesis checkpoint is known to activate effector caspases Dcp-1 and drice (<a href=\"#bib36\">McCall, 2004</a>). Additionally, the caspase-3 staining we performed on wasp-exposed teacher ovaries recognizes effector caspases Dcp-1 and drice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>), leading us to hypothesize that these caspases are important in oviposition depression in teacher and student flies as a response to parasitoid wasps. By using a maternal <i>\u03b1-Tubulin &gt; Gal4</i> driver to express an RNA-hairpin targeting mRNA from each of these genes, we were able to reverse both the decrease in oviposition as well as the increase of stage 7/8 egg chamber apoptosis of wasp-exposed females, while RNAi depletion of these caspases had no effect on oviposition of unexposed females (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). This provides further evidence that the stage 7/8 egg chamber apoptosis and corresponding oviposition decrease is a specific physiological checkpoint, similar to that previously described for poor nutritional intake (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</a>). We considered the possibility that ovarian apoptosis could produce secondary signals important for conveying information to naive flies, which in turn triggers apoptosis in student ovaries. To test this, we used teacher flies that were incapable of triggering apoptosis because of RNAi depletion of Dcp-1 or drice, specifically in developing egg chambers. Strikingly, following wasp exposure, flies, depleted of germ line Dcp-1 or drice function, were still excellent teachers capable of cueing naive student flies to decrease their oviposition and induce apoptosis at the stage 7/8 mid-oogenesis checkpoint in the students' ovaries (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 A-B and G</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1I,J</a>). The finding that Dcp-1 and drice deficient females incapable of depressing oviposition can nevertheless convey critical cues to naive students demonstrates that the depressed oviposition response can be decoupled from the process required for teacher\u2013student information transfer. Thus, information transfer in this context is not due to secondary effects of ovarian cell death. Interestingly, Dcp-1- and drice-deficient student females could not depress oviposition in response to exposed, wild-type teachers, suggesting that the same effector caspases activated in exposed teachers are also needed for oviposition depression in students (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>). Control, parental lines were found to behave as wild type as both teachers and students (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). We tested two additional Dcp-1 (<i>Dcp-1</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> and <i>Dcp-1</i><sup><i>3</i></sup>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Etchegaray et al., 2012</a>) mutant lines that displayed the same phenotype as the RNAi result (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>). We conclude that the depressed oviposition in student flies cannot be from simple mimicry."

These visual cues were important for wasp perception and subsequent behavior change (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kacsoh et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, to better understand the mechanism through which information was being transferred from teacher to student flies, we tested the role of both smell and vision in information acquisition in our system by testing these mutations in both teacher and student flies. The gene <i>Orco</i> is known to be expressed in almost all olfactory receptor neurons, and the mutant-lacking <i>Orco</i> is unable to respond to smell stimuli (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vosshall et al., 1999</a>). We found that <i>Orco</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> flies could respond to wasps and teach student flies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Additionally, <i>Orco</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> flies as naive students could learn normally from teacher flies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

Consistent with previous studies indicating the necessity of light in visual learning (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ofstad et al., 2011</a>), these data suggest that wild-type fly vision can only detect cues from wasps and teachers if there is light present, again demonstrating the role for visual cues for the behavior."

Previous experiments had both teachers and students co-habitating, leading us to speculate whether other stimuli were involved in either the acute- or social-learning response. To test this, we built the Fly Duplex, which we constructed by using three standard 25 mm \u00d7 75-mm glass microscope slides that were adhered between two 75 mm \u00d7 50 mm \u00d7 1-mm glass microscope slides using clear aquarium silicone sealant, making two compartments separated by one 1-mm thick glass slide. This setup allows flies to see other flies or wasps in the neighboring chamber, but do not allow direct contact (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). We find that both the acute and learned response are intact when performing the exposure in separate, but adjacent, chambers using the Fly Duplex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013C</a>). We also find that teachers are able to transmit information to naive flies when in separate chambers, yielding depressed oviposition (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013C</a>). Both the requirement for light and the use of the Fly Duplex strongly suggest that olfactory, auditory, and tactile information is not likely to be important for this type of social communication. Instead, this demonstrates that visual cues alone are sufficient for acute-, learned-, and social-learning responses."

We first tested flies mutant in the wingless gene (<i>wg</i><sup><i>1</i></sup>). The wingless phenotype in the <i>wg</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> stock is not fully penetrant. The progeny of <i>wg</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> parents are comprised of flies with two wings, one wing, and no wings (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Reported segregation patterns suggest that the three phenotypes are genotypically similar and that phenotypic change is a result of incomplete penetrance (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sharma, 1973</a>). We find that both one-winged and two-winged mutants have an intact acute and learned response following wasp exposure (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 10F</a>). However, one-winged <i>wg</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> flies are unable to act as teachers, suggesting a role for both wings in communication (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Two-winged <i>wg</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> flies behaved as wild-type teachers, demonstrating that the <i>wg</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> mutation does not induce impaired teaching (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). For additional validation of this observation, we mechanically removed the wings of wild-type flies. The wings of wild-type <i>Canton-S</i> flies were cut prior to wasp exposure and tested for oviposition response. These flies displayed an intact acute and learned response, but they were unable to teach (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Finally, we used the GAL4/UAS system to express the cell death protein reaper (UAS-Rpr) in conjunction with a wing driver (MS1096) to ablate proper wing development (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). We find that these flies also have an intact acute and learned response, but they were unable to teach (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H</a>).

We decided to perform our assay using flies mutant in the <i>erect wing</i> locus, which encodes a protein, EWG. Loss-of-function <i>erect wing</i> alleles result in embryonic lethality. Viable alleles of <i>erect wing</i> cause severe abnormalities of the indirect flight muscles (<a href=\"#bib15\">DeSimone et al., 1996</a>). Flies carrying viable allelic combinations of mutations at the <i>erect wing</i> (<i>ewg</i>) locus do not have, or have greatly reduced, indirect flight muscles (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deak II et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 1982</a>). We tested two EWG alleles, <i>ewg</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> and <i>ewg</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>, and found that these flies displayed an intact acute and learned response, but they were unable to teach. These mutants exhibited a wild-type ability to learn from His-GFP teachers, again demonstrating that wings are not required to learn (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A\u2013D</a>). EWG is also required in the development of the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">DeSimone and White, 1993</a>). Given this information, we wanted to examine if nervous system-specific expression of wild-type EWG protein in an <i>ewg</i> mutant background is sufficient to restore teaching ability. This expression does not rescue the muscle phenotype (<a href=\"#bib15\">DeSimone et al., 1996</a>).

Each of these mutants responded acutely to predator presence with a dramatic decrease in oviposition when in the presence of wasps for the first 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A,C,E,G,I,K</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,E,G</a>). This indicates that the acute oviposition depression is independent of these gene functions. However, when wasps were removed and mutant flies were placed in a new tube for an additional 24 hr after wasp exposure, oviposition returned to levels comparable to unexposed flies (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A,C,E,G,I,K</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,E,G</a>). This indicates that although the acute response to a predator threat does not require memory consolidation, the persistence of decreased oviposition behavior after wasp removal requires a form of long-term memory whose consolidation requires cAMP signaling and translational control mediated at least in part through the prion domain of <i>Orb2</i>. These results are consistent with other wasp-induced fly memory formation, specifically with respect to seeking ethanol-laden substrates upon wasp exposure (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kacsoh et al., 2015</a>). Naive wild-type student flies encountering the pre-exposed mutants also did not respond through oviposition decrease (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A,C,E,G,I,K</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,E,G</a>). Collectively, the data from multiple alleles of multiple mutants indicated that these mutations yielded flies that did not retain physiological effects of the threat-response necessary to successfully transmit information to naive wild-type student females."

As these learning mutants show normal acute oviposition depression in response to direct wasp exposure, this suggests that wasp-induced and teacher-induced reductions in oviposition behavior occur through fundamentally different mechanisms. This is consistent with the fact that wasps and teachers must provide different visual signals to initiate learning and must, therefore, be expected to alter behavior through different neural circuit mechanisms. Taken together with the observations of blind <i>ninaB</i><sup><i>P315</i></sup> mutants, experiments performed in the dark, and the Fly Duplex, these results demonstrate that during social learning student flies must be able to visually perceive information from teacher flies and then undergo an active-learning process in order to stably respond by depressing oviposition."

The apoptotic response to acute wasp exposure (0\u201324 hr) in <i>orb2</i><sup><i>\u0394Q</i></sup> was similar to the wild type, as expected, given that these flies had a normal depressed oviposition in presence of wasps (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12M</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1K</a>). However, in the 24-hr period following removal of wasps (24\u201348 hr), <i>orb2</i><sup><i>\u0394Q</i></sup> female flies had increased their egg laying and showed low levels of apoptosis in stage 7/8 egg chambers comparable to control unexposed flies (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12M</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1L</a>). We conclude that <i>Drosophila</i> females depress their egg laying during exposure to predatory wasps through an acute pathway that requires visual perception of wasp presence and leads to active elimination of developing eggs. The persistence of depressed oviposition and apoptosis in the 24-hr period after wasp removal requires an intact <i>orb2</i> gene, suggesting that maintenance of the initial behavior may require neural consolidation of the memory of wasp presence learned during the exposure period. Both acute and persistent mechanisms indicate that a systemic pathway initiated in photoreceptors and visual systems of female flies, processed centrally through neural circuits that can encode memories, leads to neuroendocrine signaling that impinges on developing egg chambers where it activates caspase-signaling cascades."

Following wasp exposure, we surgically removed fly heads and paired them with naive student flies. Decapitated flies are of standard use in behavioral assays, and only decapitated flies that recovered after anesthesia were used (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cook, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nilsen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Clyne and Miesenbock, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Trott et al., 2012</a>). We found that decapitated flies could not maintain the same level of reduced oviposition as normal flies (i.e., decapitation led to an increase in oviposition), and they could no longer teach, suggesting a continued input from the brain is needed to elicit these behavioral changes (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). To ask whether the mushroom body (MB) specifically plays a role in maintained oviposition reduction and the teaching behavior, we used the GAL4/UAS system to express tetanus toxin light chain (<i>UAS-TeTx</i>) in conjunction with a MB driver (<i>OK-107-GAL4</i>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aso et al., 2009</a>) to block synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib35\">Martin et al., 2002</a>). The tetanus toxin light chain works by catalytically inhibiting synaptic transmission once present in the cytosol by cleaving either synaptobrevin, syntaxin, or SNAP-25 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Poulain et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bittner et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mochida et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kurazono et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McMahon et al., 1993</a>). We found that flies expressing <i>UAS-TeTx</i> in the MB exhibited a wild-type acute response, suggesting that the acute response occurs independent of the MB. However, in the learned period, these flies no longer showed reduced oviposition and were unable to teach naive students (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13D</a>). Using a second MB driver (MB247), this result was recapitulated (<a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mao et al., 2004</a>). Control parental lines functioned as both wild-type students and teachers both as homozygotes and when outcrossed to <i>Canton-S</i> (<a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013H</a>). Flies expressing UAS-TeTx in the MB failed to function as students (<a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1J\u2013K</a>). These data suggest that wasp presence is sensed through the visual system, and this information is relayed to the MB to induce a persistent reduction of oviposition, apoptosis, and teaching behavior, all of which are maintained over a time span of days."

However, these experiments could not exclude the possibility that <i>orb2</i> gene product was required in non-neural tissues. Similarly, <i>orb2</i> may have been necessary for early neuronal development, and mutant phenotypes observed simply reflected developmental defects that precluded proper adult MB functions (pleiotropic effects). Given that inhibiting synaptic transmission in the MB with <i>UAS-TeTx</i> eliminated a long-term behavioral response to wasp exposure, teaching ability, and social learning (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13D</a>, <a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013K</a>), we tested the hypothesis that the gene products of known learning and memory genes (such as <i>orb2</i>) may also be required to function in this anatomical region of the brain. To test this, we used the GAL4/UAS system as before: in this case, the MB driver (<i>OK-107-GAL4</i>) drove expression of an RNA-hairpin targeting <i>orb2</i> mRNA. We found that RNAi depletion of Orb2 in the MB produced the same phenotype as the <i>orb2</i><sup><i>\u0394Q</i></sup> mutant tested (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14A\u2013B</a>). This result highlights that flies deficient in <i>orb2</i> in the MB are able to perceive and respond to wasps, but not remember exposure, and therefore cannot teach naive students, once wasps are removed. Flies deficient in <i>orb2</i> in the MB are also unable to learn from wild-type teachers. Control parental lines with either just the <i>OK-107-GAL4</i> or UAS-Orb2-hairpin transgenes (but not both) functioned as wild type as they exhibited no defects in behavior persistence (<a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Control lines expressing RNA-hairpin targeting the white gene in the MB demonstrated wild-type behavior, demonstrating induction of the RNA-hairpin alone does not induce deficient memory formation, teaching ability, or learning ability (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). This suggests that <i>orb2</i> is required in MB neuronal circuits in order for maintained wasp-induced oviposition depression, and it further suggests that persistence of this behavior likely requires long-term memory formation is the MB."

                                "text": "The above data, however, do distinguish between two possible roles for <i>orb2.</i> First, the <i>orb2</i> gene product could be required for normal development of the MB and other parts of the nervous system that interface with the MB. The <i>OK-107-GAL4</i> driver begins expression of GAL4 in the larvae. Thus, it remains possible that RNAi depletion of Orb2 in the larvae could cause developmental defects that then indirectly cause behavioral phenotypes in adults. A second possibility is that persistence of depressed oviposition and in turn teaching ability requires <i>orb2</i> function in the adult MB, regardless of its possible function during MB development. In order to address this question, we turned to the GAL4-based Gene-Switch System where the GAL4 transcription factor is fused to the human progesterone ligand-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burcin et al., 1999</a>). We used flies expressing the Gene-Switch transgene specifically in the MB, where only an administration of the pharmacological Gene-Switch ligand RU486 could activate the GAL4 transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mao et al., 2004</a>). In order to confirm our feeding protocol could work in The Fly Condo, we used the MB Gene-Switch line to express a nuclear-localized GFP. Flies were placed into condos containing instant <i>Drosophila</i> media hydrated by a mixture of RU486 dissolved in methanol and water. We found that flies placed in the Fly Condo where the food contains RU486 are able to function as wild-type teachers and students (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15A\u2013B</a>). This observation demonstrates that RU486 does not perturb <i>Drosophila</i>'s ability to perceive and respond to wasp presence by changing their oviposition behavior, as both flies expressing a Gene-Switch construct and His-GFP flies behaved as wild type. Our data also demonstrate that induction of a protein in MB, in this case GFP, does not perturb learning and memory formation nor teaching ability. When the assay is run with just methanol, therefore lacking RU846, we find flies are able to function as wild type, similar to when they were fed RU486 (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15C\u2013D</a>). Control MB-Gene switch parental lines behave as wild-type flies as both homozygotes and when outcrossed to <i>Canton-S</i>. In cases when RU486 laden food was fed to flies containing the MB Gene Switch and GFP nuclear localization signal (nls) construct, we find that 24 hr is sufficient to induce GFP signal specifically localized to the MB, whereas food lacking RU486 (methanol only) does not induce GFP after 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15E\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig15s1\">Figure 15\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>)."

Induction of the RNA-hairpin through RU486 feeding in the MB was expected to occur within the same window of time as the GFP expression (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>). Flies expressing the MB Gene-Switch and carrying the UAS-Orb2-RNA-hairpin construct, that were not fed RU486, showed normal, wild-type memory, learning, and teaching ability (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16C\u2013D</a>).

These two data points suggest that the UAS-Orb2-RNA-hairpin construct is only driven in flies expressing the MB Gene-Switch when fed RU486 only. When the MB Gene-Switch parental control line was used to express an RNA-hairpin to the white gene, flies elicited wild-type memory formation with and without RU486 feeding, demonstrating that the Gene-Switch ligand (RU486) alone and an RNA-hairpin alone is not responsible for memory, teaching, and learning impairment (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16E\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig16s1\">Figure 16\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>).

The response persists over multiple days when learning and memory functions are intact. We also find that this behavior can be socially transmitted from experienced teacher females to naive student females: the transfer of information from teachers does not occur as a by-product of apoptosis in the teacher, but rather through an independent pathway, since depressed oviposition is not a necessary condition for social transmission of reduced egg-laying behavior or apoptosis in the student females (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17</a>). These conclusions are further supported by the unexpected observation that student flies, that had learned to reduce oviposition, could not serve as teachers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We emphasize that teacher-instructed students continued to exhibit depressed oviposition and stage 7/8 egg chamber apoptosis in the 24-hr period after removal of teachers. This again indicates that depressed oviposition itself is not sufficient for information transfer. However, at a higher level, these observations also indicate that such adaptive information transfer cannot spread throughout a population, since only primary teachers are able to transmit the predator-threat information."

                        "text": "The above findings document a pathway initiated through visual stimulation and results eventually in a dramatic physiological response in the ovary. The discovery of neurally driven control of non-neural germ line cell physiology is conceptually similar to a recent study in <i>Drosophila</i>, which demonstrated that olfactory stimulation was necessary for maintenance of blood progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shim et al., 2013</a>), thus, also establishing a link between perception of environmental information and physiological response to specific information. Although learning mutants and flies expressing an RNA-hairpin to orb2 could perceive and respond to predator presence, the observation that egg production completely recovered by 24 hr following removal of the wasp threat (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>, <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1K,L</a>) is consistent with previous observations where females switched from a poor to rich food source repress the mid-oogenesis checkpoint via insulin signaling and recover normal egg production within 24 hr (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</a>). This rapid recovery of oviposition in learning and memory mutants, coupled with removing fly heads and inhibiting synaptic transmission in the MB, suggests that maintenance of the depressed oviposition state requires continued neural signaling mediated by a memory component of the brain."

                        "text": "Our observations document and describe a particularly robust form of social learning in <i>Drosophila</i> and establish several fundamental features. First, direct learning and social learning require visual system function but occur through different mechanisms: in particular, the acute response of flies to direct wasp exposure can occur even in classic-learning mutants, while persistence of the predator response and subsequent social learning requires functions of learning genes and continued neural input. Loss of memory gene functions, such as <i>Adf1</i>, <i>amn</i>, <i>dnc</i>, <i>dFmr1, rut</i>, and <i>Orb2</i>, or inhibition of MB synaptic transmission had no effect on the ability to change oviposition behavior in the presence of wasp, however, in each of these cases, persistence of this behavior after wasp removal, and subsequent teaching ability, was abolished. Additionally, inhibition of orb2 using the GAL4/UAS and Gene-Switch systems suggests that maintenance of the change in oviposition state requires neural signaling mediated by a memory component of the adult brain. Second, social learning occurs through a mechanism distinct from mimicry. Information of wasp presence can be transmitted by animals that have encountered wasps but are physiologically unable to display egg retention, which is the normal behavioral output of such learning (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17</a>). Third, social learning in this context appears to be limited in its spread: being transmitted only from teachers with direct predator experience to students that they encounter. Therefore, students that have learned through social learning cannot become teachers themselves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This is noteworthy because the inability of primary students to further transfer information to secondary students will limit the time frame and number of individuals in which this knowledge transfer takes place. The spreading of socially learned behavior has been previously postulated to possibly drive local adaptation by maintaining behavioral diversity of groups through self-propagating social learning once initiated in an individual (<a href=\"#bib4\">Battesti et al., 2012</a>). With regards to social learning of oviposition depression in response to a predator threat, it seems reasonable that such information would be most useful if limited to nearest neighbors, whose progeny may be similarly vulnerable in time and space by parasitoid wasps. However, the fitness costs of prolonged oviposition depression and/or spreading to conspecifics beyond primary learners could be devastating if it were self propagating, and thus, the degree to which it can spread within a group must be limited by restricting teaching behavior only to individuals having had direct visual experience of the threat, while ensuring memory of the threat in both primary (teachers) and secondary (students) learners is maintained and then decays over time."

The learning and memory genes we tested and found to be involved are conserved across many animal species (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bolduc and Tully, 2009</a>), and thus, serves as an excellent approach to model cellular and neuronal network functions that may be relevant to vertebrate brain function. Even though the vertebrate brain is vastly more complex than that of the fly, additional genes, gene families, and pharmacological effects can be elucidated in <i>Drosophila</i> and may identify core mechanisms that are used in all species. These conserved components provide starting points in vertebrate animals for further vertical integration in the fields of learning and social communication. In this way, mechanisms that are unique to vertebrates can also be inferred, and we suggest that the learning and memory paradigm presented here will prove to be a useful discovery tool. We believe this study establishes a new and robust ecologically relevant model of social learning in <i>Drosophila</i> with possible far reaching implications for neurobiology, Darwinian selection and evolution."

Item No. 59-113) were filled to the rim with standard <i>Drosophila</i> media and allowed to cool. Upon cooling, a single Fly Duplex was inserted into the food such that it touched the bottom of the plate. The open end of the Fly Duplex was closed using a cotton plug (Genesse Scientific (San Diego, CA) Cat. Item No. 51-102B) to prevent insect escape. 10 female flies and 2 male flies were placed into one chamber of the Fly Duplex in the control, while 10 female Lh14 wasps were placed in the compartment adjacent to the flies in the experimental setting for 24 hr. After the 24-hr exposure, flies and wasps were removed by anesthetizing flies and wasps in the Fly Duplexes. Control flies underwent the same anesthetization. Wasps were removed and replaced with 10 female \u2018student\u2019 flies. All flies were placed into new clean Duplexes for the second 24-hr period. The oviposition plate from each fly condo was replaced 24 hr after the start of the experiment, and the second plate was removed 48 hr after the start of the experiment. Fly egg counts from each plate were made at the 0\u201324 and 24\u201348 hr time points."

For all food treatments, we pipetted a total liquid volume of 2250 \u00b5l directly onto the instant food. For experiments with RU486, an RU486 solution was used. This was prepared by dissolving 3.575 mg of RU486 in 800 \u00b5l methanol (Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) Lot number 141313). This solution was added to 15.2 ml of distilled water. The total solution (16 ml) was thoroughly mixed and 2250 \u00b5l were pipetted onto the instant food into each well.

This change in germline development provides a molecular explanation for the change in reproductive behavior, thus establishing a link between the visual system and female germline cells. We also show that persistence of this change in reproductive behavior requires a functional mushroom body and wild-type functions of learning and memory genes, again demonstrating a link between adult brain function and germline cell physiology. Because both behavioral and physiological changes are triggered by an ecologically relevant predator, we suggest that <i>Drosophila</i> evolved these specific innate behavioral and physiological responses to this serious environmental threat. Therefore, we suggest that this story would have broad interest to the <i>eLife</i> readership."
