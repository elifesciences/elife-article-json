These complexes consist of SRP proteins and a single, highly structured SRP RNA. Canonical SRP RNA genes have not been identified for some <i>Thermoproteus</i> species even though they contain SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. Here, we show that genome rearrangement events in <i>Thermoproteus tenax</i> created a permuted SRP RNA gene. The 5'- and 3'-termini of this SRP RNA are located close to a functionally important loop present in all known SRP RNAs. RNA-Seq analyses revealed that these termini are ligated together to generate circular SRP RNA molecules that can bind to SRP19 and SRP54. The circularization site is processed by the tRNA splicing endonuclease. This moonlighting activity of the tRNA splicing machinery permits the permutation of the SRP RNA and creates highly stable and functional circular RNA molecules."

These complexes consist of SRP proteins and a single, highly structured SRP RNA. Canonical SRP RNA genes have not been identified for some <i>Thermoproteus</i> species even though they contain SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. Here, we show that genome rearrangement events in <i>Thermoproteus tenax</i> created a permuted SRP RNA gene. The 5'- and 3'-termini of this SRP RNA are located close to a functionally important loop present in all known SRP RNAs. RNA-Seq analyses revealed that these termini are ligated together to generate circular SRP RNA molecules that can bind to SRP19 and SRP54. The circularization site is processed by the tRNA splicing endonuclease. This moonlighting activity of the tRNA splicing machinery permits the permutation of the SRP RNA and creates highly stable and functional circular RNA molecules."

SRP binding can arrest the elongation of nascent peptide chains and targets the ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (in Eukaryotes) or the plasma membrane (in Bacteria and Archaea). The SRPs consist of one central SRP RNA molecule and different SRP proteins. Eukaryotes harbor six SRP proteins, Bacteria have one SRP protein and archaeal SRPs are formed by an approximately 300 nt long SRP RNA and the two proteins SRP19 and SRP54\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">R\u00f6misch et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bernstein et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bhuiyan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cusack et al., 2000</a>). The SRP RNA is pivotal for the structure and function of all SRPs. Archaeal and eukaryotic SRP RNAs are similar and usually contain eight helical elements that fold into a small Alu-domain and a large S-domain that are connected by an extended linker region\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Batey, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gundelfinger et al., 1983</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). SRP19 binds to the tips of helices 6 and 8 in the S-domain, which form strictly conserved tertiary RNA interactions(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hainzl et al., 2002</a>). The SRP RNA adopts a conformation that exposes a SRP54-binding site in helix 8 (h8)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Rose and Weeks, 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). SRP54 is essential for (i) the recognition and binding of the signal sequence at the ribosome, and (ii) for the GTP-dependent interaction with the SRP receptor of the archaeal plasma membrane\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Luirink et al., 1994</a>). Intriguingly, few species of the archaeal genus <i>Thermoproteus</i> (e.g. <i>Thermoproteus tenax</i> and <i>Thermoproteus uzoniensis</i>) do not contain canonical SRP RNAs and SRP RNA genes are not annotated\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Siebers et al., 2011</a>). Genes encoding standard SRP19 (TTX_2083) and SRP54 (TTX_0615) proteins are present and signal sequences can be identified for secretory proteins (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Thus, we aimed to search for the elusive SRP RNA genes in <i>T. tenax</i> to investigate potential alterations of one of the most conserved ribonucleoprotein complexes found in nature."

                        "text": "We isolated small RNA molecules from <i>T. tenax</i> cells and subjected them to Illumina Hiseq2000 RNA-Seq analysis. 13.45 million sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome to obtain insights into the RNome of <i>T. tenax</i>. Subsequently, we searched the sequence reads for minimal conserved SRP RNA features. SRP RNA molecules are highly structured and contain several conserved structural features but only few absolutely conserved sequence segments. These sequences include a conserved SRP54 binding motif in helix 8b and a GNAR tetraloop motif connecting helix 6. We identified these short motifs in an intergenic region between the genes TTX_0683 (pyruvate phosphate dikinase [ppdK]) and TTX_0684 (protein phosphatase [ppa]). The prediction of RNA folding for this intergenic sequence revealed a high potential for extended helical regions, which prompted us to analyze this region in more detail. We utilized the obtained RNA-Seq reads to identify the 5'- and 3'-termini of a 309 nt long highly structured RNA transcript. The alignment of this RNA molecule with other archaeal SRP RNA molecules that are annotated in the SRP database\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Rosenblad, 2003</a>) highlighted the presence of several conserved structural features (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, the location of the 5'- and 3'-termini of this newly discovered SRP RNA was shifted from the standard location in helix 1 in the small Alu-domain to a region close to a functionally important loop in the large S-domain. This indicates that <i>Thermoproteus</i> species with \u2018missing\u2019 SRP RNA genes contain permuted SRP RNA sequences in which the transcripts\u2019 termini have been shifted by over 100 nucleotides and the order of sequence motifs has been rearranged. We identified a similar permuted SRP RNA gene in <i>T. uzoniensis</i> and noticed that nucleic acid sequence variations do not occur in conserved regions of the SRP RNA and in most cases do not disrupt the structure of the SRP RNA (i.e. G-C base pairs are replaced by G-U or A-U basepairs) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Sequence reads that mapped to the termini regions of the <i>T. tenax</i> SRP RNA revealed unmapped parts consisting of sequences of the distant end, which indicates that these reads span ligated 5'-and 3'-termini (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The observed ligation sites are identical and restore the loop at the tip of helix 8 in the permuted SRP RNA. Thus, mature SRP RNAs exist as circular molecules. The RNA-Seq reads also revealed that SRP RNA precursor transcripts contain a 23 nt long leader sequence upstream of the ligated mature 5'-termini (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A TATA box promoter element (5\u2032-TTAATA-3\u2032) is present 26 nt upstream of the transcription start site in both <i>T. tenax</i> and <i>T. uzoniensis</i>. Additionally, we detected a C/D box sRNA gene adjacent of the permuted SRP RNA gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Northern Blot analyses verified the presence of the SRP in <i>T. tenax</i> total RNA preparations, and revealed three distinct bands that were reproduced with two different probes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Full-length in vitro transcripts of the SRP RNA (linear and circularized with T4 RNA ligase) were run as size markers. The observed migration of this highly structured transcript was identical to the total RNA signal and suggests that the two prominent bands represent the circular form of the SRP RNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

The canonical termini of archaeal SRP RNA molecules are located in helix 1 of the small Alu-domain. This helix is absent in the <i>T. tenax</i> SRP RNA. It has been suggested that the main function of this helix is to prevent the unfolding of the SRP RNA under the extreme growth conditions of hyperthermophiles\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Zwieb, 2005</a>). Thus, the replacement of this helix with a continuous sequence in a circular RNA molecule would provide improved RNA stability and a potential evolutionary advantage. The high stability of circular RNA molecules is also a likely explanation for the observed low RNA-Seq coverage as only few SRP RNA fragments were amenable to adapter ligation during RNA-Seq library preparation."

Ligation of these RNA ends guarantees the presence of a canonical loop in this region. However, this ligation reaction requires the presence of clearly defined termini as all sequenced circularization junctions were found to be identical. Thus, we investigated if the observed precursor transcripts might be subjected to endonucleolytic processing to generate mature RNA ends. We observed that the 23 nt long leader sequence of the primary transcript can fold with extended trailer sequences into a so-called bulge helix bulge (BHB) motif (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). A similar motif is also present at the termini of the permuted <i>T. uzoniensis</i> SRP RNA (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). BHB elements are structural motifs found in intron-containing transfer RNAs (tRNAs)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Thompson and Daniels, 1988</a>). A BHB consists of a central four base pair helix that is flanked by at least one three nt unpaired bulge. These structures are recognized by the tRNA splicing endonuclease that cleaves the bulge sequences and recruits the tRNA ligase RtcB to join the tRNA sequences and circularize the intron sequence\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Popow et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Englert et al., 2011</a>). The presence of a BHB motif suggests that RtcB could be responsible for SRP RNA circularization, if the <i>T. tenax</i> splicing endonuclease specifically recognized the identified BHB motif. It should be noted, that <i>T. tenax</i> contains a record number of 48 introns in 46 tRNAs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Chan and Lowe, 2009</a>). These introns are processed by a tRNA splicing endonuclease that belongs to a family of heterotetrameric enzymes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Randau et al., 2005</a>). This family shows the most relaxed BHB substrate recognition mechanism and does not rely on the recognition of tRNA sequences for cleavage\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Yoshinari et al., 2009</a>). We produced recombinant <i>T. tenax</i> splicing endonuclease (TTX_1594, catalytic subunit and TTX_1893 structural subunit, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and could verify specific cleavage of the proposed BHB motif (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This suggests that the tRNA splicing machinery (i.e. tRNA splicing endonuclease &amp; tRNA ligase RtcB) has a moonlighting activity and processes and circularizes permuted SRP RNA molecules."

It has been argued that the fragmentation of tRNAs genes can provide a selective advantage during evolution as tRNA genes frequently serve as viral integration sites\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Randau and S\u00f6ll, 2008</a>). The presence of efficient tRNA splicing machinery that can deal with large-scale tRNA intron transposition is required to maintain functionality of a permuted SRP RNA. Thus, it is plausible that permuted SRP RNA genes are derived from an ancestral variant with simple BHB introns. The mechanism of archaeal genome rearrangement events is not known. However, it should be noted that C/D box sRNA genes have previously been observed in the vicinity of split genes and are also located near the permuted SRP RNA gene\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Randau, 2012</a>). The potential mobility of C/D box sRNA gene sequences will be subject of future investigations. In conclusion, genome rearrangement events near non-coding RNA genes can result in novel maturation pathways of universal RNA molecules. One example is the observed occurrence of permuted and circularized SRP RNA molecules whose increased stability should provide a selective advantage."
