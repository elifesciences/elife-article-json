While transient in vivo, these precursor populations readily interconvert in vitro. We show that altered transcription is the driver of these coordinated changes, known as lineage priming, in a process that exploits novel polycomb activities. We find that intragenic levels of the polycomb mark H3K27me3 anti-correlate with changes in transcription, irrespective of the gene\u2019s developmental trajectory or identity as a polycomb target. In contrast, promoter proximal H3K27me3 is markedly higher for PrEn priming genes. Consequently, depletion of this modification stimulates the degree to which ESCs are primed towards PrEn when challenged to differentiate, but has little effect on gene expression in self-renewing ESC culture. These observations link polycomb with dynamic changes in transcription and stalled lineage commitment, allowing cells to explore alternative choices prior to a definitive decision."

While transient in vivo, these precursor populations readily interconvert in vitro. We show that altered transcription is the driver of these coordinated changes, known as lineage priming, in a process that exploits novel polycomb activities. We find that intragenic levels of the polycomb mark H3K27me3 anti-correlate with changes in transcription, irrespective of the gene\u2019s developmental trajectory or identity as a polycomb target. In contrast, promoter proximal H3K27me3 is markedly higher for PrEn priming genes. Consequently, depletion of this modification stimulates the degree to which ESCs are primed towards PrEn when challenged to differentiate, but has little effect on gene expression in self-renewing ESC culture. These observations link polycomb with dynamic changes in transcription and stalled lineage commitment, allowing cells to explore alternative choices prior to a definitive decision."

PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cao et al., 2002</a>) through the EZH1/2 histone methyltransferase (HMTase) component of the complex and this histone modification can in turn recruit PRC1 through the chromodomains of CBX subunits (<a href=\"#bib52\">Morey and Helin 2010</a>). Recently, variant PRC1 complexes have been shown to nucleate PRC2 binding providing a self-reinforcing mode of polycomb recruitment (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blackledge et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cooper et al., 2014</a>). In mouse ESCs, H3K27me3 and PRCs occupy large domains at repressed genes that encode developmental regulators (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Endoh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ku et al., 2008</a>) and consequently transcripts of these genes are upregulated in response to loss of PRC1 or PRC2 in ESCs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Endoh et al., 2008</a>). The trithorax system is associated with trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) - a modification found at the majority of non-methylated CpG islands (CGIs) that marks a transcriptionally permissive state (<a href=\"#bib37\">Klose et al., 2013</a>). A subset of CGIs, however, contain nucleosomes marked by both H3K27me3 and some H3K4me3, a combination of histone modifications referred to as bivalency (<a href=\"#bib2\">Azuara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Voigt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Denissov et al., 2014</a>). The co-incidence of these two histone modifications is also accompanied by the presence of a form of RNA polymerase II associated with transcription initiation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brookes et al., 2012</a>), consistent with the hypothesis that the bivalent chromatin state contributes to robust gene activation or silencing during the exit from pluripotency and the initiation of differentiation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Voigt et al., 2012</a>).

Cells that express the <i>Hhex</i>-Venus (HV) reporter and SSEA1 self-renew, are PrEn-primed and readily convert to an HV<sup>-</sup>, SSEA1<sup>+</sup>, Epi-primed ESC state. Here we use this tool to investigate the role of polycomb in maintaining the balance between Epi- and PrEn-primed ESC populations. We use gene expression microarrays in combination with genome-wide nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to identify a set of genes with a distinct expression profile in these populations that is primarily regulated at the level of transcription. We show that gene body H3K27me3 is reduced with increased transcriptional activity across our priming gene sets, suggesting that H3K27me3 is a response to these small and dynamic changes in transcription. In contrast, promoter proximal H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 levels are invariant during priming, with a pattern of H3K27me3 around the start site that is significantly enriched in PrEn priming genes. Consistent with this observation, single cell qPCR analysis on polycomb mutant ESCs suggests that PRC1 and 2 are required for the establishment of ESC heterogeneity. Furthermore, short-term inhibition of EZH2 activity results in reduced neural differentiation efficiency in vitro and preferential PrEn contribution in vivo. These results suggest that polycomb regulates rapid and reversible damping of transcription and the maintenance of heterogeneity in early lineage specification."

Amplified poly-A RNA from both populations was hybridised to expression microarrays and combined with data from a previous dataset (<a href=\"#bib9\">Canham et al., 2010</a>). As previous analysis suggested that the PrEn-primed population (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup>) exhibited small but detectable increases in expression of endoderm markers, we first defined the set of genes showing differential expression between the undifferentiated Epi-primed fraction (HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; green gate) and spontaneously differentiated endoderm cells (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; yellow gate) using analysis of variance (ANOVA; FDR of 0.05 and a fold change of &gt; 1.5; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

This confirmed the trajectory of differential expression for two randomly chosen panels of candidate genes with elevated expression in the Epi- and PrEn-primed populations, respectively.

Genes upregulated in either the Epi-primed (HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>) or PrEn-primed (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup>) population displayed increased nascent transcript abundance in the relevant cell population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) - albeit with a smaller magnitude of change than that observed for steady state RNA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In addition, the average level of GRO-seq signal on PrEn priming genes was much lower than for Epi priming genes, while steady state mRNA levels were approximately equal (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>; boxplots at the bottom of the graph), suggesting that PrEn genes are at least in part regulated at a post-transcriptional level. These data indicate that gene expression patterns characteristic of priming are primarily regulated at the level of transcription, but for PrEn priming transcripts there is also a post-transcriptional component."

                                "text": "To investigate mechanisms governing the dynamic transcriptional changes characteristic of lineage priming, we profiled histone modifications in primed populations of ESCs by native chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in two biologically independent cultures followed by deep sequencing. Given the proposed role of polycomb in the balance between pluripotency and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Voigt et al., 2012</a>) and the enrichment of CGIs associated with priming gene sets (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), we focussed on H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. As expected, the constitutively highly expressed <i>Actb</i> was devoid of H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and enriched for H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, a canonical polycomb target region, the <i>Hoxd</i> cluster, was decorated with H3K27me3 and had low level H3K4me3 in both HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cell populations. <i>Zmiz1</i>, a gene upregulated in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population, showed a broad domain of H3K27me3 peaking at two CGIs, but the levels of H3K27me3 at <i>Zmiz1</i> were somewhat reduced in HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> as compared to HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The reverse held true for genes upregulated in the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>, Epi-primed population. For example, <i>Aldh1b1</i> - an HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> enriched transcript - had slightly increased H3K27me3 that correlated with its reduced transcription in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> fraction, despite a less extensive coating of H3K27me3 at this gene than at <i>Zmiz1. Zmiz1</i> and <i>Aldh1b1</i> had H3K4me3 surrounding their promoters, coincident with CGIs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; green bars), but unlike H3K27me3, their levels of H3K4me3 appeared not to vary between the primed cell populations. Since these differences were very subtle on single genes, we examined the average differential levels of H3K27me3 between the populations for all genes within each gene list to establish whether this change was specific to PrEn or Epi priming genes. We found no quantitative difference at the TSS (\u00b1 500 bp) between the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> populations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Meta-analysis confirmed the invariant H3K27me3 signal both at and upstream of the TSS, but surprisingly identified a small but significant reciprocal relationship between transcriptional activity and the level of H3K27me3 within gene bodies (TSS +501 bp to transcription end site (TES) +2 kb; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). This occurred not only for PrEn priming genes, but also for Epi priming genes, despite the reduced magnitude and incidence of H3K27me3 TSS \u2018peaks\u2019 at these genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>). As the observed effect was subtle however, we replicated these results using an alternative, formaldehyde cross-linked ChIP methodology. This approach confirmed both the invariant H3K27me3 levels at the TSS of priming genes and the differential H3K27me3 within gene bodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). While both ChIP methodologies showed very similar results, the gene-body effect at Epi-priming genes showed the same trend as in the native ChIP, but as the level of H3K27me3 is low in these genes and cross linked ChIP is less efficient than that performed under native conditions, this trend was less robust than that observed under native conditions."

However, when we split our gene lists based on the presence or absence of a \u2018peak\u2019 of H3K27me3 at the TSS, we found that the reciprocal relationship between H3K27me3 and transcription occurred irrespective of this sub-division (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Conversely, when we selected only those genes that showed differential levels of GRO-seq signal between the primed populations (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) only a subset of these genes showed an enrichment for H3K27me3 at their TSS (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). These findings suggest that H3K27me3 depositions at the TSS and within the gene body are independent of one another. We used the same methodology to examine the behaviour of H3K4me3 in primed ESC populations. As expected, we found little variation in H3K4me3 levels either at the TSS or across gene bodies, for both sets of differentially expressed genes in both ESC populations (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Heatmaps representing the distribution of H3K4me3 around the TSSs (\u00b1 2.5 kb) of all differentially expressed genes showed that H3K4me3 levels did not change significantly between the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cell populations (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) and generally appeared similar irrespective of the expression state in PrEn- and Epi-primed ESCs. In contrast, a far greater proportion of genes upregulated in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population showed promoter proximal enrichment for H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), and this corresponded to a significant enrichment for TSS associated polycomb \u2018peaks\u2019 at these genes (41.3% of genes upregulated in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population vs. only 19.5% of genes upregulated in the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Consistent with this finding, PrEn priming genes show an elevated tendency to be upregulated in response to the loss of both PRC1 and PRC2 components (RING1B and EED, respectively; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Conversely, Epi priming genes are enriched for genes that are downregulated in polycomb mutant ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Leeb et al., 2010</a>)."

Studies on ESC heterogeneity using the early epiblast marker <i>Rex1</i> (<i>Zfp42</i>) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Marks et al., 2012</a>) included both gene expression and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq datasets. These populations dynamically interconvert, although unlike PrEn- and Epi-primed cells, the <i>Rex1</i> low (Rex<sup>-</sup>) population contains partially differentiated cells and, therefore, Rex<sup>-</sup> cells give rise to <i>Rex1</i> high (Rex<sup>+</sup>) cells at a lower frequency than the reverse. Thus, the Rex<sup>+</sup> population resembles the Epi-primed fraction, whereas the Rex<sup>-</sup> population includes spontaneously differentiated cells in addition to the PrEn-primed cells described here. Rex<sup>+</sup> and Rex<sup>-</sup> populations therefore resemble the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> populations with the caveat that HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> are merely a subset of Rex<sup>-</sup> cells. To explore this systematically we compared the gene set enriched in the <i>Rex1</i> expressing populations (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>) to the lists we compiled based on HV expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Almost one third (73/210) of the Epi priming genes were also upregulated in the Rex<sup>+</sup> population (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Moreover, more than half of the PrEn priming genes were represented in the list of genes upregulated in the Rex<sup>-</sup> population (285/533 genes). Comparison of Rex<sup>+</sup> with HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and Rex<sup>-</sup> with HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> showed negligible overlap (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>)."

In this comparison however, both differentially expressed gene sets show a significant reduction of H3K27me3 at the TSS as well as the gene body and this is not surprising as the Rex<sup>-</sup> population contains cells that have already embarked on differentiation rather than just primed populations of ESCs. To test this contention, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 on spontaneously differentiated PrEn cells (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup>) and compared this to H3K27me3 levels in the Epi-primed population. Consistent with the Rex analysis, we observed more pronounced changes in H3K27me3 levels between these populations, including a significant reduction at the TSSs and upstream regions of PrEn-priming genes (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C and D</a>)."

To test this, we determined the rate at which primed populations re-equilibrate when returned to culture using modified reporters that contain either the original <i>Hhex</i>-IRES-Venus and a constitutive <i>H2b</i>-mCherry lineage label (HVHC ESCs) or an amplified <i>H2b</i>-mCherry under control of the <i>Hhex</i> locus and a constitutive <i>H2b</i>-Venus lineage marker (HFHCV ESCs). For both reporter lines, Epi- and PrEn-primed populations were isolated by FACS and returned to culture. <i>Hhex</i> expression was then monitored by flow cytometry at defined time points (18, 24, 48 and 72\u2009h post-sorting; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Re-equilibration dynamics were found to be largely equivalent irrespective of the developmental trajectory or the reporter used. Moreover, co-culturing the two populations isolated from lineage labelled, but different colour reporter lines showed nearly identical dynamics to those cultured independently (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a> \u2013 compare solid with dashed lines). These results indicate that the rate of interconversion was independent of the starting gene expression state and any paracrine interactions between the populations. By 72\u2009h, both Epi- and PrEn starting populations were largely equivalent (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013C</a>), although complete equilibration was probably achieved around day 5 after sorting (extrapolated from the data in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Based on the re-equilibration dynamics observed in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>, we chose an intermediate time point during re-culture and determined the levels of gene body H3K27me3. Half of each of the primed populations used to generate the cross-linked ChIP data presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> was re-cultured for 30\u2009h prior to performing H3K27me3 ChIP on the SSEA1+ (S<sup>+</sup>) fraction (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>). As expected (and comparable to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), the ChIP-seq profiles for the <i>Hoxd</i> and <i>Actb</i> loci showed patterns of high and low H3K27me3 levels, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4E</a>). However, a comparison of the ChIP-seq signal between the re-cultured primed populations showed a complete loss of the differential H3K27me3 levels observed at the time of the initial sort (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4E</a> compared to the parental populations shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This suggests that differential gene-body H3K27me3 levels are closely coupled to the dynamics of the cells as they transit between primed states, supporting the idea that these patterns are dictated largely by gene transcription."

Since both gene sets could be regulated by PRC2 in the gene body, we wanted to determine whether a complete removal of polycomb activity would result in a loss of priming.

We observed very small sets of genes undergoing significant changes in gene expression, despite the clear and consistent global removal of H3K27me3 after 24\u00a0h of EPZ treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Similar results were observed in different base media, although switching ESCs into different base media resulted in much larger changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>).

To assess whether inhibition of H3K27me3 deposition influences ESC differentiation bias, we tested their tendency to differentiate in a specific direction upon removal of the reversible pharmacological block to H3K27 methylation. Epi differentiation was assessed in the form of defined neural differentiation using a reporter cell line in which GFP expression is driven by the promoter of the neural progenitor marker, Sox1. Following EPZ treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) Sox1-GFP (46c) cells were differentiated and the levels of GFP expression were quantified by flow cytometry on day 5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Transient removal of H3K27me3 resulted in reduced neural differentiation efficiency and cells that formed less extensive axon networks while expressing relatively high levels of TUJ1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We also assessed the capacity of the descendants of EPZ-treated ESCs to colonize the epiblast or PrEn lineages in vivo by injecting treated ESCs that contained a constitutive nuclear mCherry label (HVHC ESCs, see the methods section) into host morulas. Prior to injection, HVHC ESCs were grown in serum+LIF for 24\u00a0h, followed by 24\u00a0h of treatment in fresh serum+LIF (ESC control), N2B27+LIF+DMSO (DMSO control), or N2B27+LIF+EPZ (EPZ). ESCs grown in serum+LIF gave the expected high levels of Epi contribution and minimal contribution to the extra-embryonic visceral and parietal endoderm as we have observed in morula injections previously (<a href=\"#bib54\">Morgani et al., 2013</a>). While ESCs cultured in neutral media (N2B27+LIF+DMSO) produced a modest enhancement in extra-embryonic contribution, they also gave robust contribution to the epiblast (control 2, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In contrast, descendants of EPZ-treated ESCs were found at low levels in the embryonic epiblast and throughout the extra-embryonic endoderm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The impact of H3K27me3 inhibition on colonization of the PrEn and Epi lineages was apparent in both the number of embryos with extra-embryonic contribution and the extent of contribution in individual embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and data not shown). These results indicate that short-term inhibition of polycomb activity strongly reduces contribution to the epiblast while enhancing contribution to extra-embryonic endoderm. Taken together, both the in vitro differentiation and in vivo contribution results indicate that a transient loss of PRC2 catalytic activity shifts the distribution of priming in ESCs in favor of PrEn and away from epiblast."

These small fluctuations are associated with the acquisition of a distinct differentiation bias, although the corresponding changes in the physical properties of chromatin at individual gene loci are expected to be modest at best. This presupposes an inherent limitation in the ability to robustly detect the molecular events surrounding lineage priming on a per-gene basis. However, here we have taken advantage of the fact that these small expression changes occur synchronously across an extended set of genes. This allowed us to perform multi-gene meta-analysis for both transcriptional and epigenetic states and, in so doing, to detect changes that would otherwise have been unappreciated. This added power has allowed us to substantiate the gene expression changes observed previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Canham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Morgani et al., 2013</a>). Moreover it has allowed us to determine that priming in embryonic stem cell populations is principally regulated at the level of transcription and involves the activity of polycomb repressive complexes. While the polycomb system has long been associated with regulating developmental gene expression, here we show that these proteins are both enablers and regulators of priming toward specific lineages during sequential rounds of ESC self-renewal."

Some insight has been gained as to the signalling cascades that influence lineage priming in ESCs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hamilton and Brickman, 2014</a>), yet the gene regulatory mechanisms underpinning these subtle and transient expression changes have remained undetermined. Here we performed nascent RNA analysis on Hhex-defined Epi- and PrEn-primed ESC populations to show that the regulation of lineage priming occurs primarily at the level of transcription. A small number of genes do however show alterations in steady-state but not nascent RNA levels, suggesting that post transcriptional mechanisms also play a role, particularly for genes that are upregulated in the PrEn-primed population. These genes include immediate early responders to ERK/MAPK signalling, such as Fos, Jun, Fosl1, Fosl2, Ctgf, Cyr61 and Igf2, all of which were previously shown to be regulated at the level of RNA degradation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rabani et al., 2011</a>). As short durations of MEK-ERK signalling can stimulate the expression of these genes and promote reversible PrEn priming, a post-transcriptional mechanism would be compatible with rapid signal-induced state switching."

We show that transcriptional changes associated with lineage priming in ESC populations correlate with levels of H3K27me3 in two ways. An invariant pattern of H3K27me3 proximal to the transcription start site of PrEn priming genes and a reciprocal relationship between transcription and the levels of gene body H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). The dynamic changes in PRC2 activity within gene bodies links H3K27me3 deposition to changes in nascent transcription. This result suggests that PRC2 occupancy may be antagonised by local polymerase density and associated changes in chromatin state (<a href=\"#bib65\">Schmitges et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miyazaki et al., 2013</a>). Thus our observations argue that polycomb is not merely a silencing factor, but can help balance the dynamic oscillations in transcription that occur during lineage priming. This general role for polycomb contrasts with the lineage specific implications of the invariant pattern of H3K27me3 that we observe around the transcription start site of a large proportion of PrEn priming genes. Based on ChIP-seq analysis on mixed ESC populations, it has been suggested that polycomb targets in ESCs are lineage specific developmental genes, including PrEn genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Azuara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fisher and Fisher, 2011</a>). However, these datasets contain a large number of genes expressed at unrelated stages of development. Here we link Polycomb specifically to the choice between Epi and PrEn differentiation that occurs in the blastocyst at around the time of ESC derivation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chazaud et al., 2006</a>). Based on our analysis, a large proportion of PrEn priming genes (~40%; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) are polycomb targets that are upregulated in response to loss of polycomb activity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Leeb et al., 2010</a>). However, datasets acquired using polycomb mutant ESCs are complicated by the selective nature of ESC growth and the capacity of polycomb mutant ESCs to adapt to culture over time. We also observed enhanced homogeneous expression of both PrEn genes and heterogeneously expressed members of the core Epi/pluripotency network (e.g. <i>Esrrb</i>, <i>Nanog</i> and <i>Tbx3</i>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). One explanation for this lies in the inherently selective nature of ESC expansion. Thus, the induction of higher levels of PrEn priming might incur a growth disadvantage that could be compensated for by increased epiblast/pluripotent gene expression in PrEn primed cells. As PrEn supports Epi expansion in vivo (<a href=\"#bib53\">Morgani and Brickman 2015</a>), a loss of polycomb might result in the production of paracrine factors that can promote epiblast/pluripotent gene expression as has recently been suggested for the Wnt/Pcp pathway downstream of Jarid2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Landeira et al., 2015</a>). In light of these results, we propose a model whereby polycomb acts around the start site of transcription to constrain PrEn gene expression within a limited dynamic range under homeostatic conditions, and in so doing, facilitates PrEn priming through transient and coordinated fluctuations in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Sustained loss of polycomb activity therefore leads to selection of cells that exhibit reduced levels of heterogeneity."

This modest transcriptional effect could be due to the passive nature of H3K27me3 loss, where progressive dilution of the modified histone occurs as hypomethylated H3 is deposited following rounds of DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabert and Groth, 2012</a>). Alternatively, removal of certain histone modifications may simply have little impact on global transcription under steady-state culture conditions, as the TF circuitry required to maintain gene expression levels remains intact. There is some evidence for this scenario, as disruption of components of both the SET1/MLL and PRC2 complexes leads to a marked reduction in the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively, with surprisingly little effect on gene expression. Interestingly, in these instances, the limited effect on expression contrasts with a marked impact on differentiation potential and these findings are compatible with the observations presented here (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carlone et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Clouaire et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Riising et al., 2014</a>). We propose then, that EPZ treated cells are, to an extent, freed from the constraints on gene expression variability that are normally supported by polycomb. Under these conditions, priming loci have a greater probability of engaging in expression when challenged to differentiate. As a result, exposure of ESCs to short-term polycomb inhibition does not lead to a clear transcriptional response, but predisposes PrEn priming genes for rapid upregulation upon exposure to differentiation cues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This is also consistent with the data we obtained using the <i>Eed</i> mutant HV reporter cell line, which showed enhanced expression of HV in response to Chi, a Gsk3 inhibitor also used to induce endoderm differentiation from ESCs. Taken together, our work suggests that stable polycomb occupancy at TSSs marks priming genes in ESCs and is coupled to highly dynamic, but limited fluctuations in transcription. These fluctuations are a component of the priming process, but their magnitude is kept in check to prevent ESCs from embarking on differentiation."

The segregation of these two lineages is dependent on Fgf signalling (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yamanaka et al., 2010</a>) and involves the induction of lineage specific transcription factors. ESCs are derived from these stages of embryonic development and our data suggests that polycomb group proteins are important mediators of these initial lineage segregation events, perhaps supporting a limited period of dynamic cell fate choice in PrEn progenitors that precedes commitment to embryonic or extra-embryonic lineages (<a href=\"#bib73\">Xenopoulos et al., 2015</a>)."

Sorted cells were checked for sufficient purity (&gt;80% of cells detected as being in the original sorting gate) by running ~1000 cells through the sorter again.

The cells were sorted to include only Pecam positive ESCs and five cells of varying sizes (2 large, 1 intermediate and 2 small cells per embryo) were selected for injection into each embryo to avoid introducing a bias based on cell cycle and/or cell size. Injected embryos were placed into E0.5 pseudopregnant females that were sacrificed after 6 days to obtain E6.5 embryos by dissection. The complete chimera set comprised embryos generated from one ESC culture for serum+LIF (\u2018control 1\u2019; embryos introduced into 4 pseudopregnant females) and two independent cultures for each of N2B27+LIF+DMSO and N2B27+LIF+EPZ (\u2018control 2\u2019 and \u2018inhibitor\u2019 respectively; each replicate was introduced into 3 pseudopregnant females).

The depth of the stacks was adjusted to match the size of the largest embryo and for each slice mCherry and brightfield images were acquired sequentially. To generate chimera images, mCherry stacks were subjected to rolling ball background subtraction followed by maximum intensity z-projection of all the slices. The resulting mCherry z-projection was then overlayed onto a single brightfield slice that was in focus and a scale bar of 50 \u00b5m was added to the overlay image."

Specifically, they take advantage of two interconverting populations of mouse ESCs primed for the primitive endoderm or the epiblast lineages, respectively, to gain insights into mechanisms underlying lineage priming in self-renewing ESCs. The authors provide evidence that this heterogeneity correlates with transcriptional variation between the two cell populations, which correlates with subtle changes in the distribution of the H3K27me3 histone post-translational modification (PTM), a mark catalyzed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), both within gene bodies and, for primitive endoderm primed ESCs, at the promoter region. The authors provide evidence that loss of function of Polycombs leads to a loss of transcriptional heterogeneity, and, using both in vitro and in vivo developmental assays, report that transient inhibition of the PRC2 Polycomb complex in the ESC state leads to perturbations in cell fate decisions."

The strength of the work is that the authors reveal a role of polycomb in regulating heterogeneity and lineage priming in self-renewing ESCs. To date most work on polycomb proteins has been done in the context of its function in ESC differentiation, i.e. when ESCs are moved down a specific lineage. As such the manuscript is an important addition for the field and new insights in this area improve our understanding of the early stages of development when pluripotent stem cells undergo lineage commitment."

While there is not much that the authors can do about this, it limits the ability of the reader to know to what extent the differences are meaningful or direct. So far there are correlations between K27me3 and transcription as well as functional changes in the Polycomb KO, but a clear mechanistic framework is still lacking. Thus, all reviewers agree that more experiments are necessary to support and strengthen the conclusions."

Second, the ChIP-seq of histone PTMs is not a quantitative measure. Instead, ChIP-RX (Orlando et al., Cell Reports, 2014) is the now the accepted technique to establish whether there are quantitative differences in histone PTM levels, in this case for H3K27me3 in the Epi or PrEn cells. In fact, ChIP-RX would be particularly important in this case because the observed modest differences in H3K27me3 levels at promoters and gene bodies between the two cell populations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Here we have used the power of these priming gene sets to define two novel modes of Polycomb regulation, a subtle but robust change in the gene body of all priming genes that is inversely correlated with transcription, and a promoter-specific road block to Primitive Endoderm (PrEn) commitment."

These numbers are difficult to obtain in cell sorting experiments. As a result, we tried to scale the ChIP-RX down to cell numbers that could be obtained in multiple cell sorting experiments (between 0.5-1.3 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells). We also scaled down the number of cross-linked S2 cells (<i>Drosophila</i> spike), but as a result, we found that the test to spike ratios varied significantly between samples. Consequently, the resulting normalisation (as outlined by Orlando and colleagues) led to highly variable results, even between replicate experiments. Despite this issue, we could still detect the differential signal between the primed populations, but the overall ChIP enrichment was skewed due to differences in test to spike ratios between samples, making the data harder to interpret.

As a result we do not believe that it would be informative to sort primed populations from these mutants. However, we also observe that the Hhex reporter was significantly induced in Eed mutants in response to adding the Gsk3 inhibitor Chiron (Chi) to media. Chi is known to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to the induction of Wnt targets, and Hhex is a known Wnt target (Zorn et al. 1999; Huelsken et al. 2000; Rodriguez et al. 2001; Zamparini et al. 2006). The enhanced induction of the reporter supports one of the substantial conclusions of our paper, that Polycomb acts to suppress endoderm commitment and while PrEn genes are not significantly induced in its absence, they become poised for activation."
