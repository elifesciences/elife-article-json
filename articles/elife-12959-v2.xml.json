Class IV neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae are polymodal nociceptors responsible for thermal, mechanical, and light sensation. Importantly, activation of Class IV provoked distinct avoidance behaviors, depending on the inputs. We found that noxious thermal stimuli, but not blue light stimulation, caused a unique pattern of Class IV, which were composed of pauses after high-frequency spike trains and a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in the dendrite (the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient). Both these responses depended on two TRPA channels and the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (L-VGCC), showing that the thermosensation provokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The precipitous fluctuation of firing rate in Class IV neurons enhanced the robust heat avoidance. We hypothesize that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can be a key signal encoding a specific modality."

Class IV neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae are polymodal nociceptors responsible for thermal, mechanical, and light sensation. Importantly, activation of Class IV provoked distinct avoidance behaviors, depending on the inputs. We found that noxious thermal stimuli, but not blue light stimulation, caused a unique pattern of Class IV, which were composed of pauses after high-frequency spike trains and a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in the dendrite (the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient). Both these responses depended on two TRPA channels and the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (L-VGCC), showing that the thermosensation provokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The precipitous fluctuation of firing rate in Class IV neurons enhanced the robust heat avoidance. We hypothesize that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can be a key signal encoding a specific modality."

A series of studies have shown that Class IV neurons are polymodal nociceptors and relevant receptors are identified as described below: Touching the dorsal cuticle of larvae with a metal probe hotter than 45\u00b0C evokes a stereotypic corkscrew-like escape rolling behavior (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babcock et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tracey et al., 2003</a>); and activation of the Class IV neurons is necessary and sufficient for this output (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hwang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ohyama et al., 2013</a>). This thermal nociception behavior is mediated by thermoTRPs genes including <i>Drosophila</i> TRPA1 (dTrpA1), Painless, and Pyrexia (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babcock et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hwang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Neely et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tracey et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>). In addition to the noxious heat, strong mechanical stimuli, such as a sharp poke, elicit the same nocifensive behavior (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hwang et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, Class IV neurons are extra-ocular photoreceptors that respond to short-wavelength light stimuli and evoke a directional shift of locomotion, which requires Gr28b (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yamanaka et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, to achieve such a discriminative processing, Class IV neurons are supposed to integrate multiple modes of sensory inputs into distinct firing patterns in a highly sophisticated manner. Recently, extracellular single-unit recordings have been developed to monitor physiological activities of Class I-IV dendritic arborization neurons upon naturalistic stimulation, such as light and gentle touch (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tsubouchi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>).

In response to the local heating over 45\u00b0C, Class IV neurons generated unique firing patterns that were composed of intermittent pause periods after high-frequency firing trains. This 'burst and pause' firing pattern was associated with a large rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the entire dendritic tree, which we designated as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. We showed that both of the unique firing pattern and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient are physiological responses of Class IV neurons, characterized their underlying mechanisms by using pharmacological and genetic approaches, and compared the response to the noxious heat with that to short-wavelength light to address the basis of the polymodal sensation. Furthermore, we pursued which characteristics of the 'burst and pause' firing pattern contributes to the induction of the rolling behavior, and showed that the multiple fluctuations of firing rate enhanced robust output by using optogenetic manipulation. Altogether, we propose that the low-frequency continuous firing train transmits the noxious light sensation; in contrast, the multiple peaks of firing rate fluctuation facilitate the perception of a noxious heat stimulus."

To measure the microenvironmental temperature, we exploited the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance of a glass microelectrode (<a href=\"#bib57\">Palmer and Williams, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Shapiro et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yao et al., 2009</a>). The temperature within a radius of approximately 50\u2009\u03bcm from the laser focus rapidly increased from an ambient temperature (25\u00b0C) to target temperatures (30\u201350\u00b0C) within 100 ms, and stayed almost constant at the maximum temperature throughout the 1\u2009s irradiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>). Moreover, the temperature maximum was directly proportional to the power output of the laser (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Compared to the perfusion protocol involving a preheated solution that is introduced into the recording chamber (<a href=\"#bib82\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>) as well as the direct heating of the chamber (<a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2003</a>), the IR-laser system allowed us to reproducibly deliver more spatially\u00a0restricted, and more temporally\u00a0controlled stimuli."

For this purpose, we dissected third instar <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, prepared fillet preparations, and performed extracellular single-unit recordings. The foci of the IR-laser irradiation were targeted onto the proximal dendritic arbors (the path length of branches between the IR-laser foci and soma was no longer than 100 \u00b5m). IR-laser irradiation of more than 30-mW laser output power evoked high-frequency firings in Class IV neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>: 30 mW, 40.6 \u00b1 4.8\u2009Hz; 40 mW, 83.9 \u00b1 7.3\u2009Hz; <i>n</i> = 9 cells). From our calibration of the IR laser, an irradiation of 1-mW raised the temperature by an increment of ~0.6\u00b0C in the focused region (inset of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>); thus, the estimated temperature was ~43\u00b0C for the 30-mW laser output power. This threshold temperature was close to that of previous experiments, where the jumps of the firing rate were detected at around 40\u00b0C with perfusion of the preheated solution into the recording chamber (<a href=\"#bib82\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>). We were intrigued by the firing patterns in response to IR irradiation of 40-mW laser power, which typically contained pauses that followed high-frequency spikes (see 40-mW in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>); and we characterized the underlying mechanistic details as described later. Our control or 'wild-type' larvae in the electrophysiological experiments carried a transgene of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe that was expressed selectively in Class IV neurons, unless described otherwise."

The probabilities of the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were dependent on the output powers of the IR-laser, which arose abruptly at around 36 mW (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), so this high occurrence is one advantage of irradiation to the soma.

Excitability of Class IV neurons was prerequisite for this Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, as shown by the fact that the occurrence of the transients was completely blocked by overexpression of the inward-rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), which hyperpolarizes neurons and decreases their resting membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hardie et al., 2001</a>). This raised the possibility that the transient was caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from extracellular space (see another possibility discussed in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and its legend) and that some of the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) were involved. To verify these possibilities, we screened genes encoding \u03b1 subunits of VGCCs for those necessary for the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients; specifically, we recorded and analyzed probabilities and amplitudes of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in various VGCC loss-of-function mutants. A dramatic phenotype was found in mutants of the L-type VGCC gene (<i>Ca-\u03b11D</i><sup>X7/AR66</sup> and <i>Ca-\u03b11D</i><sup>X10/AR66</sup>)(<a href=\"#bib16\">Eberl et al., 1998</a>); normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients hardly occurred in those mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>). A similar defect was observed in the wild type when a selective inhibitor of L-type VGCC, Nimodipine (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gielow et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grey and Burrell, 2010</a>), was applied (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). These results showed that L-type VGCC-mediated excitability is required for the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in Class IV neurons (see our negative results of other types of the <i>Drosophila</i> VGCC family in 'Materials and methods')."

More importantly, in each dataset, the minimal interspike interval within the US was invariably shorter than that within non-US firings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; p\u00a0&lt;\u00a05.2\u00d710<sup>\u20136</sup>; paired Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test; <i>n</i> = 13 cells), indicating that large excitatory currents existed just prior to the pause in firing (see also <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In other words, firing patterns were modified as if the 'burst and pause' pattern had been replaced with conventional high-frequency spike trains, indicating that the L-type VGCC is essential for the generation of US. We also found that firing rates decreased for short periods following the pauses (data not shown); therefore, we assumed that an after-hyperpolarization current is generated during the pauses (see 'Discussion'). Collectively, our findings strongly suggest that dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients we observed in response to heat produced by the IR laser are generated by accumulations of L-type VGCC-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in Class IV neurons."

This is probably also the case with the ectopic expression of the lowest-threshold isoform of dTrpA1, one of the thermoTRPs described above, in Class IV neurons. <i>dTrpA1</i> encodes four distinct isoforms that display different temperature sensitivities (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>); among them, the dTrpA1-A isoform (<a href=\"#bib77\">Viswanath et al., 2003</a>) (also designated as dTrpA1.K) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>) has the lowest threshold (~29\u00b0C) and shows little desensitization by repetitive heat-activations (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pulver et al., 2009</a>). Forced expression of dTrpA1-A in Class IV neurons allows larvae to respond to a 30\u00b0C heat probe and elicit the nocifensive rolling behavior (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babcock et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>), possibly by endowing the neurons with higher sensitivity to the moderate-temperature stimulus. Consistent with this speculation, our recordings demonstrated that TrpA1-A-expressing neurons (TrpA1-A<sup>+</sup> neurons) evoke both Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and the unique firing pattern below 20 mW (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), to which the wild-type neurons were insensitive (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), and all of other results (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>) strengthened the possibility that the cellular responses of Class IV neurons to IR irradiation reflected the intrinsic membrane properties."

This had to be verified because of concerns in previous studies. For example, when neuronal activities with Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are recorded extracellularly, the intracellularly detected spikes sometimes disappear in the voltage traces of extracellular single-unit recordings of axons (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schonewille et al., 2006</a>). Another instance shows that intracellularly detected spikes are not always propagated along the axon (<a href=\"#bib51\">Monsivais et al., 2005</a>). To explore these possibilities, we performed extracellular single-unit recordings from both the soma of a Class IV neuron and the axon bundle, including its own axon, and analyzed the correspondence between the firing patterns from somata, which coincided with US, and those from axon bundles (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Spikes from a single axon bundle can include those of not only Class IV but also other sensory neurons.

Although the probability of rolling was rather high in the continuous activation condition (see 'Discussion'), this result is, nevertheless, consistent with the idea that the intermittent firing pattern facilitates the rolling behavior. However, it should be stressed that the intermittent pattern produced under our optogenetic experiment was distinct from the pattern of the wild-type neuron upon noxious thermal stimulations according to two quantitative features. First, the maximum firing rate of the optogenetic pattern was 40~50\u2009Hz (data not shown) and lower than that of wild-type neurons (~80\u2009Hz; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Second, none of the spike trains generated in our optogenetic condition fully met the definition of US (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

To evaluate a causal link between the firing patterns and the fast crawling, we performed a set of optogenetic experiments as follows: First, we confirmed that ChIEF-expressing Class IV neurons could be activated with lower-power blue light (0.056 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; 470 nm) and displayed lower-frequency firings (10~20\u2009Hz) with no 'burst and pause' pattern in <i>Ca-\u03b11D</i>-knockdown larvae (data not shown). Then, we observed that such a firing pattern triggered the fast crawling, even when no rolling behavior was evoked (Maximum speed of crawling stride: [before activation] 6.37 \u00b1 0.29\u2009mm/s, [after activation] 10.51 \u00b1 0.66\u2009mm/s, mean \u00b1 s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 24 larvae; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0269, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; see 'Materials and methods' for details).

Our IR laser irradiation-measurement device is a noninvasive system, which is applicable to whole-mount animals and able to induce a rapid and local rise in the ambient temperature, mimicking the noxious heat input. With the resolution of our experimental conditions, the IR irradiation had no apparent effect on the integrity of organelles and evoked physiological responses of Class IV neurons. With the help of this system, we showed that the thermotransduction machinery is present in the dendrite."

Class IV neurons in the <i>dTrpA1</i> mutant displayed a much longer latency time prior to the increase in the firing rate compared to the wild type. On the other hand, the rising profile of the firing rate in the <i>pain\u00a0</i>mutant was comparable to that of the wild type, but the rate reached only 65% of that of the wild-type neurons. Therefore the temporal pattern of the wild-type firing response was not a simple summation of those of the two TRPA mutants. If dTrpA1 and Painless are the unique cation channels for the conductance of the putative thermocurrent, the time course of the firing in <i>painless</i> mutants may represent that of dTrpA1 activation, and vice versa. If this inference is the case, our results can be interpreted in a way that dTrpA1 can become activated to some extent by itself and that it is prerequisite for Painless to be properly activated. A previous electrophysiological analysis of Painless showed that Painless is a noxious-heat activated, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-requiring, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel (<a href=\"#bib73\">Sokabe et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, we suppose that noxious heat stimulation activates dTrpA1 and causes local Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the dendrite, followed by the robust increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance of Painless, leading to large depolarization. This results in gating of L-type VGCC and generation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, most likely by accumulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, throughout the dendrites of Class IV neurons."

Likewise, the probability of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient occurrence in Class IV neurons arose abruptly at around an IR-power that was estimated to raise the temperature close to 47\u00b0C, and the neuron increased the magnitude of the responses at the suprathreshold temperature. What would be the potential advantages for Class IV to set the threshold by employing Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes? One advantage would be the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the thermosensation. The cellular threshold of the response to the noxious heat could become precipitous by multiplying a physical property of the high-threshold channel (dTrpA1) by the probability of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike generation."

Our observations highlighted two features of the neuronal response to the different noxious stimuli: (1) the presence or the absence of multiple peaks of firing rate fluctuation and (2) the high or low absolute value of maximum firing rate. We hypothesize that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike can be a key signal encoding a specific modality: the total number of peaks of firing rate fluctuation transmits the noxious heat input by way of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes; in contrast, the continuous firing train at a lower rate encodes the noxious light sensation (e.g. see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6D</a>). This means that the thermal stimuli induce the high-threshold and larger generator currents (orange line; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> bottom), while blue light inputs evoke the low-threshold and smaller currents (blue line; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> bottom). We showed that the heat-induced unique firing patterns of Class IV were conducted along the axon, which projects to the putative central pattern generator(s) driving the thermal nocifensive responses. It has been shown that Channelrhodopsin2-mediated activation of Class IV provokes the thermal nocifensive behavior (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hwang et al., 2007</a>) and the photo-avoidance (<a href=\"#bib82\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>).

Therefore, we speculate that such unique firing rate fluctuation may be decoded as a facilitating signal of rolling (the 'burst number-coding' hypothesis). It has also been shown in olfactory behaviors of <i>C. elegans</i> that specific activity patterns may modulate the probability of action selection (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gordus et al., 2015</a>). Recently, it has been reported that combining mechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of rolling behavior in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>). Altogether, the likelihood of rolling locomotion upon noxious heat stimulation can be potentiated by the input(s) from other sensory modalities and multiple peaks of firing rate fluctuation. We also noticed that the probability of rolling was rather high in the continuous activation condition (66.0%; gray bar in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We assume that almost all of the Class IV neurons were activated under our optogenetic conditions, so that such a high behavioral reactivity was elicited. On the other hand, lower probabilities of rolling were detected in the initial periods of the heat probe assay of <i>Ca-\u03b11D</i> knockdown larvae (~20%, &lt;2\u2009s; <i>Ca-\u03b11D RNAi</i> in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

How are the two types of firing patterns in response to the distinct noxious inputs decoded and transformed into differential escape behaviors? Previous studies have shown that the burst coding is a behaviorally relevant mechanism (<a href=\"#bib40\">Krahe and Gabbiani, 2004</a>). For instance, the bursts in an ultrasound-sensitive acoustic sensory neuron of the field cricket <i>Teleogryllus oceanicus</i> code for a conspicuous increase in amplitude of an ultrasound stimulus (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sabourin and Pollack, 2009</a>). It is well known that in the cerebellar cortex, climbing fiber inputs evoke characteristic complex spikes in Purkinje neurons, which induce the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes and a subsequent pause in the spike train (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davie et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kitamura and H\u00e4usser, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Llinas and Sugimori, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mathews et al., 2012</a>). The firing response of Purkinje neurons is remarkably similar to that of Class IV neurons in terms of the pattern and the underlying mechanism. It should be noted that the pause of firing in Purkinje neurons evokes the high-frequency firing response in the target neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei via the post-inhibitory rebound (PIR) mechanism (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, it has been proposed that the pauses of firings per se convey signals (the \u2018pause coding\u2019 theory, <a href=\"#bib13\">De Schutter and Steuber, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hong and Optican, 2008</a>). Another circuit evoking the nocifensive light-avoidance behavior may receive direct excitatory inputs from Class IV neurons; this would be consistent with our hypothesis that the dual codes of the polymodal sensory information are decoded and segregated as distinctive command signals in the downstream circuit. Recently, the candidate synaptic partner(s) of Class IV neurons were identified through functional and anatomical assays (<a href=\"#bib78\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>); thus, our hypothesis can be tested by investigating the neuronal responses of these candidate neurons to noxious thermal stimulations of Class IV neurons."

To elucidate the relationship between the electrical resistance of an electrode and the temperature of the external saline solution (<a href=\"#bib82\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>), we monitored the electrical resistances at various values of temperature of the solution. First, we heated the saline solution in a petridish up to 50\u00b0C with an inline heater (SF-28, Warner Instruments,\u00a0Hamden,\u00a0CT) that was regulated by a thermo-controller (TC-324B, Warner Instruments). Then, we turned off the heater and recorded the electrical resistances (<i>R</i>) of the electrode and the temperatures (<i>T</i>) of the solution simultaneously during natural cooling. The electrical resistances of glass microelectrodes were 5\u201310 M\u03a9 at ambient temperature (~25\u00b0C). We measured the electrical resistances by giving square pulses (50 ms, 10 mV; 1\u2009Hz) in the voltage clamp mode. The reciprocal of temperature (<i>1/T</i>) was plotted against the log of the electrical resistance (<i>log R</i>), so that the Arrhenius equations were estimated as a <i>R-T</i> transformation formula by linear regression."

A filter (GFP-3035D, Olympus) was placed into the above microscope to illuminate blue light (472.5\u00a0nm with 30\u00a0nm band width). The light intensity at 2.5X magnification was measured by a radiometric sensor head (UP17P-6S-H5-DO, Gentec-EO,\u00a0Quebec,\u00a0Canada) coupled with a power meter (UNO, Gentec-EO) and it was determined to be 0.72 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> in the light spot. Sixty-five\u00a0to 104 animals were tested in each condition and the percentage of positive responses was calculated."

For behavioral experiments, one larva at a time was separated from food and placed into the center of a 9.5 x 13.5 cm square plastic dish filled with 2% agar (Bacto Agar; Becton Dickinson, Franclin Lakes, NJ). After 5\u2009min of acclimation, the dish with larva was placed into the behavior rig. 5 cycles of 100 ms pulses followed by 100 ms pause intervals or a single 1\u2009s long pulse of blue light (0.234 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), or a single 1\u2009s long pulse (0.056 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>\u00a0for the crawling assay below) were applied by using a collimated LED light source (M470L3-C1; ThorLabs,\u00a0Newton,\u00a0NJ) with an emission peak at around 470 nm. A data acquisition system (USB-6212 BNC; National Instruments,\u00a0Austin,\u00a0TX) provided the triggering TTL signals, with timing controlled by a custom LabVIEW program (National Instruments). We recorded videos of larval behavior by using a GE60 CCD image sensor (640 x 480 pixels; Library) at 30 frames per second. For the analyses of crawling stride speeds, larval locomotions were traced in videos by using 'Manual Tracking' Fiji plugin (ImageJ 1.46J, NIH,\u00a0Bethesda,\u00a0MD), and then the maximum stride speeds for 5 s before and after optogenetic activation were calculated. For electrophysiological recordings, 5 cycles of 100 ms pulses with 100 ms pause intervals or a single 1\u2009s long pulse of blue light (0.294 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), or a single 1\u2009s long pulse (0.056 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was applied from above through external saline solution.

Using a highly sophisticated experimental setup combining UV-mediated focal heat application, electrophysiology and calcium imaging, the authors show that \"burst and pause\" activity pattern of Class IV neurons accompanying a calcium transient is induced by heat but not light. In <i>dTrpA1</i> mutants or L-type voltage-gated calcium channel mutants, the \"burst and pause\" activity pattern, calcium transients and the behavioral response to noxious heat (rolling) are blocked. Optogenetic induction of an activity pattern mimicking the \"burst and pause\" activity slightly increased the frequency of rolling. From these results, the authors propose an interesting hypothesis that specific pattern of neural activity mediates transmission of specific modality."
