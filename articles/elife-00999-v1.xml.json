In this study, we show that Brahma (Brm) chromatin-remodeling complex is required for ISC proliferation and damage-induced midgut regeneration in a lineage-specific manner. ISCs and enteroblasts exhibit high levels of Brm proteins; and without Brm, ISC proliferation and differentiation are impaired. Importantly, the Brm complex participates in ISC proliferation induced by the Scalloped\u2013Yorkie transcriptional complex and that the Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway directly restricted ISC proliferation by regulating Brm protein levels by inducing caspase-dependent cleavage of Brm. The cleavage resistant form of Brm protein promoted ISC proliferation. Our findings highlighted the importance of Hpo signaling in regulating epigenetic components such as Brm to control downstream transcription and hence ISC proliferation."

In this study, we show that Brahma (Brm) chromatin-remodeling complex is required for ISC proliferation and damage-induced midgut regeneration in a lineage-specific manner. ISCs and enteroblasts exhibit high levels of Brm proteins; and without Brm, ISC proliferation and differentiation are impaired. Importantly, the Brm complex participates in ISC proliferation induced by the Scalloped\u2013Yorkie transcriptional complex and that the Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway directly restricted ISC proliferation by regulating Brm protein levels by inducing caspase-dependent cleavage of Brm. The cleavage resistant form of Brm protein promoted ISC proliferation. Our findings highlighted the importance of Hpo signaling in regulating epigenetic components such as Brm to control downstream transcription and hence ISC proliferation."

Four epigenetic factors, DNA methylation, histone modifications, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and the recently discovered non-coding RNAs play major roles in epigenetic regulation at the chromatin level. The SWI/SNF family is one of the most-studied families of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which regulate gene expression by destabilizing nucleosome structures to alter the DNA accessibility for transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cairns, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</a>). Studies have implicated diverse roles for the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes in embryonic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. SWI/SNF complexes also function in neural, heart, and muscle development (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bultman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lickert et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ho et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ho and Crabtree, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhan et al., 2011</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, there are two SWI/SNF complexes, the Brahma (Brm)-associated proteins (BAP) complex and the polybromo-containing BAP (PBAP) complex. The BAP complex has a signature subunit Osa, while PBAP complex is defined by BAP170, Polybromo, and Syap (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elfring et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chalkley et al., 2008</a>). Brm is a unique DNA-stimulated ATPase and common subunit for both BAP and PBAP complexes. Progress has been made in understanding the function of the Brm complex during <i>Drosophila</i> development (<a href=\"#bib48\">Treisman et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Collins and Treisman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Janody et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Moshkin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Carrera et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Terriente-Felix and de Celis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Neumuller et al., 2011</a>), yet little is known about Brm complex functions in maintaining stem cell pluripotency of the epithelial tissues."

The midgut is composed of four cell types: enterocytes (ECs), enteroendocrine (ee) cells, intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and enteroblasts (EBs). The mature ECs are large polyploid cells of absorptive function and frame the midgut lining; ee and ISCs are the two types of diploid cells in the midgut that are less abundant. ISCs evenly locate at basal position underneath the ECs with a wedge-like morphology (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2007</a>) and are the only known cell type in the posterior midgut that proliferates. On cell division, ISCs undergo self-renewal or proliferation to become EBs, quiescent progenitor cells that ultimately differentiate to ECs or ee cells with the ratio 9:1 under the control of Delta (Dl) and Notch (<a href=\"#bib30\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>). Since the active Dl expression is retained in self-renewed ISCs and is lost in the newly generated EBs, antibody against the active Dl is used as the specific and the only known marker for <i>Drosophila</i> ISCs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</a>). It has been demonstrated that the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs are tightly controlled by Notch, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR), Hippo (Hpo), and Wingless signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</a>)."

Hpo is a serine/threonine Ste20-like kinase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harvey et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pantalacci et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Udan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wu et al., 2003</a>) that directly phosphorylates and activates downstream nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) family protein kinase Warts (Wts). Wts activation mediated by Hpo requires scaffold proteins Salvador (Sav) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kango-Singh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tapon et al., 2002</a>) and mob as tumor suppressor (Mats) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lai et al., 2005</a>).

We also demonstrate that Brm is regulated by the Hpo pathway at the protein level through Hpo kinase-induced, caspase-dependent, cleavage of Brm at its D718 site.

During the screen, <i>escargot-Gal4</i> (<i>esg-Gal4</i>) was used to drive RNAi expressions of different genes in ISCs and EBs in the presence of a temperature-sensitive Gal4 repressor, <i>tubGal80</i> (henceforth <i>esg80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup>). Adult <i>esg80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> flies grown at the permissive temperature do not express GFP or RNAi in ISCs and EBs. Once shifted to the non-permissive temperature, RNAi expressions in ISCs and EBs are induced and simultaneously marked by <i>esg-Gal4</i>-driven GFP signals (<a href=\"#bib30\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>). Interestingly, among the RNAi lines, VDRC (37720) and Bloomington (31712) abolished the expression of Brm, the energy providing subunit in <i>Drosophila</i> Brm complex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Neumuller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Waldholm et al., 2011</a>). On Brm RNAi expression, the number of GFP positive (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells in the adult posterior midgut decreased. Concomitantly, the number of phospho-histone3 positive (PH3<sup>+</sup>) cells also reduced, suggesting that ISC proliferation is affected (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,B\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,A\u2032</a>, also <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Immunostaining using an antibody against Brm 505\u2013775 aa (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elfring et al., 1998</a>) confirmed that endogenous Brm protein can be efficiently knocked down in the cells of both wing imaginal discs and midguts that express Brm RNAi transgenes (compare <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013B\u2032\u2032,C\u2013C\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; and compare <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013E\u2032\u2032\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013D\u2032\u2032\u2032</a>). In addition, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited a spherical shape in the absence of Brm compared with the angular shaped control cells (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,B\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,A\u2032</a>), suggesting that the attachment of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells to surrounding cells is disrupted. We further tested whether knockdown of Brm in ISCs/EBs affects the division of ISCs. On Brm RNAi expression, EBs in the intestinal epithelium labeled with the expression of the Suppressor of Hairless reporter (Su(H)-LacZ, a specific marker for EBs) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>) were detected (compare <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013G\u2032\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013F\u2032\u2032</a>). This piece of evidence suggests that EBs are still formed even when Brm expression is inhibited and ISC proliferation is blocked. Expression of Brm<sup>K804R</sup>, a dominant negative form of Brm defective for ATP hydrolysis activity without affecting the complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elfring et al., 1998</a>), results in similar effects compared to Brm RNAi (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,C\u2032</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Of note, we observed a mild increase in the ISC/EB numbers on Brm overexpression, and the PH3<sup><i>+</i></sup> cell number was slightly increased (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,D\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,A\u2032,E</a>)."

We hypothesized that the loss of Brm might result in an inhibition of ISC proliferation, precocious ISC differentiation, or a blockage of ISC differentiation. To test these possible mechanisms, the Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) approach (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee and Luo, 2001</a>) was used to generate <i>brm</i> null allele (<i>brm</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>) clones, and its impact on midgut proliferation was analyzed (<a href=\"#bib30\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>). The wild-type MARCM stem cell clones divided indefinitely, their sizes increased linearly, and contained several or all midgut cell types (<a href=\"#bib30\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>). If Brm is important for ISC proliferation, the <i>brm</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> clones will be retained in a limited size; if Brm is necessary for EC differentiation, the <i>brm</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> clones should mostly contain the small nuclear ISCs/EBs. Compared with the control clones that contain an average of five cells including both large nuclear cells and small nuclear cells within each clone, 3-day <i>brm</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> clones contain only one or two cells, which are all small nuclear cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, and compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,G\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,F\u2032</a>). In addition, 8-day <i>brm</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> clones contain only one or two cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,A\u2032,B,B\u2032,C</a>).

PDM-1, a marker for fully differentiated ECs, is used to identify ECs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Overexpressing Brm for 2 days generated new EC-like GFP<sup>+</sup> cells with large nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,D\u2032</a>), whereas the wild type control group and the Brm RNAi group only contained GFP<sup>+</sup> cells with small nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,C\u2032,E,E\u2032,I</a>). It is implicated that high levels of Brm lead to precocious differentiation of ISCs. After 5-day or even 13-day induction, large mature ECs were formed in wild-type midguts, while Brm RNAi suppressed ISC proliferation and EC differentiation in experimental midguts (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,H\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,F\u2032,I</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C\u2032</a>), suggesting that Brm is essential for ISCs and EBs to differentiate into ECs. In summary, the knockdown of Brm by RNAi blocks ISC proliferation and EC differentiation."

Previous studies have reported that the feeding of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) causes midgut cell proliferation via the disruption of basement membrane organization and increases in the intestinal stem cell division without affecting the final EB differentiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amcheslavsky et al., 2009</a>). It is plausible to think that Brm also exerts an effect on DSS-induced midgut cell proliferation, as it is required for midgut cell proliferation. Indeed, when Brm RNAi was expressed, DSS-induced increase of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was blocked (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,C\u2032,D,D\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,A\u2019,B,B\u2032</a>), suggesting that Brm is required in ISCs for DSS-induced proliferation.

Considering that Brm is involved in DSS-induced ISC proliferation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we tested whether there is a functional link between Brm and Yki\u2013Sd transcriptional complex. To this end, mass spectrum (MS) analysis was first performed. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments were performed in S2 cells to pull down the endogenous Yki or Sd protein using antibodies, and the pull-down products were sent for MS analysis. Several Brm complex components were found in the MS results, including Brm, Osa, Bap60, Bap55, and Mor (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for MS details). Consistent with the results of Yki MS analysis (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), we found that Yki and Brm coimmunoprecipitated with each other when Myc-tagged Yki (Myc\u2013Yki) and V5-tagged Brm (Brm\u2013V5) were coexpressed in S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We also verified the interaction between Brm and Sd using Co-IP in S2 cells. Results showed that overexpressed HA-tagged Sd (HA\u2013Sd) interacted with the endogenous Brm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Sd also coimmunoprecipitated with Mor and Osa but not Bap60 when they were coexpressed in S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition, we checked the cellular localization of these proteins in S2 cells. The majority of overexpressed Brm and overexpressed Sd were located in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D\u2032\u2032\u2032</a>), whereas cytoplasmic\u2013nuclear localization of Yki was not affected by Brm coexpression (data not shown), implicating that Brm complex does not promote the nuclear localization of Yki to influence the transcriptional activity of Yki\u2013Sd complex."

Overexpression of either Yki or SdGA, an active form of Sd (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>), under the control of <i>esg80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> resulted in an increase in GFP<sup>+</sup> and PH3<sup><i>+</i></sup> cell numbers (compared <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,C\u2032\u2032,E,E\u2032\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,A\u2032\u2032,K</a>), suggesting an enhancement of ISC proliferation. Interestingly, Yki overexpression resulted in pronounced hyperplasia of intestine with a thicker intestinal epithelium composed of a multi-layer of tightly packed cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Staley and Irvine, 2010</a>) (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), whereas SdGA expression did not induce such a phenomenon (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), suggesting that Yki and Sd may have distinct mechanisms in regulating ISC proliferation. When Brm was knocked down, ISC proliferation was greatly suppressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>, and compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,B\u2032\u2032,D,D\u2032\u2032,F,F\u2032\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,A\u2032\u2032,C,C\u2032\u2032,E,E\u2032\u2032</a>) with a decreased Dl signal intensity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2032,D\u2032</a>), and the formation of thicker intestinal epithelium induced by Yki overexpression was inhibited (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Moreover, similar results were obtained by MARCM analysis of <i>brm</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>. Overexpression of Yki in control MARCM clones resulted in a significant increase in the cell numbers and in the formation of large clones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L,L\u2032,N</a>), whereas this Yki-induced proliferation was completely blocked in the <i>brm</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> clones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M,M\u2032,N</a>). Taken these results together, the depletion of Brm compromised Yki or SdGA overexpression induced ISC proliferation, indicating that Brm functions downstream of Yki\u2013Sd to maintain ISC proliferative ability."

Interestingly, cotransfection of Brm and Hpo in S2 cells resulted in a lower Brm protein level, suggesting that Brm was destabilized in the presence of Hpo (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This result raised the concern that the Hpo pathway might regulate Brm activity by controlling its protein stability. Furthermore, Brm cleavage event in which a small protein band at about 100 kD was detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) in the presence of Hpo upon MG132 treatment. To detect whether this small band represents a cleaved Brm fragment, we generated a Brm construct with a Flag tag at the N-terminus and a V5 tag at the C-terminus (referred to as Flag-Brm-V5). Using this construct, we were able to identify a Flag-tagged N-terminal cleavage product about 100 kD and a V5-tagged C-terminal cleavage product about 130 kD in the presence of Hpo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Considering that the molecular weight of full length Brm is about 230 kD, it is possible that Hpo regulates Brm stability by inducing Brm cleavage at only one site. We also found that this cleavage action depended on Hpo protein in a dose-dependent manner, since increasing the dose of Hpo plasmids resulted in an accumulation of the cleaved Brm product and a decrease in the full length Brm protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). A truncation of Hpo without kinase activity (Hpo-C) did not induce such cleavage (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that Hpo kinase domain but not C-terminal regulatory domain induces Brm cleavage. In addition, Hpo-induced Brm cleavage was blocked in the presence of Yki\u2013Sd (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that it was regulated by downstream events of the Hpo signaling pathway."

To validate these sites, individual aspartic acids were mutated to alanine separately. Interestingly, Brm mutant carrying aspartic acids to alanine mutation at D718 site (Brm<sup>D718A</sup>) does not undergo cleavage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In conclusion, Brm protein stability was regulated by Hpo-induced caspase-dependent cleavage at the D718 site."

To test the function of Brm<sup>D718A</sup>, we expressed Brm<sup>D718A</sup> under the control of <i>esg80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> in ISCs/EBs. An upregulation of ISC/EB (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and PH3<sup>+</sup> cell numbers was detected in guts expressing Brm<sup>D718A</sup> mutant (compare <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013B\u2032</a> with <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013A\u2032,J</a>), whereas expressing wild-type Brm induced a mild increase in the ISC/EB numbers and PH3<sup>+</sup> cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,G\u2032,J</a>). On coexpression of Brm<sup>D718A</sup> and Yki, the number of PH3<sup>+</sup> cells was further increased, suggesting that ISC proliferation is promoted (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D\u2032,J</a>). Furthermore, analysis of 5-bromodeosyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in midguts showed that Brm<sup>D718A</sup> overexpression greatly enhanced BrdU ectopic expression, whereas Brm RNAi resulted in a lower proliferative activity (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D\u2032</a>). Altogether, these results indicate that Brm<sup>D718A</sup> promotes ISC proliferation."

Recently, the findings from several research reports based on the stem cell system reveal important roles of chromatin remodeling complex in stem cell state maintenance (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lessard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ho et al., 2009</a>). Our study suggested that the chromatin remodeling activity of Brm complex was required for the proliferation and differentiation of <i>Drosophila</i> ISCs. Based on our findings, we propose that Brm is critical for maintaining <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal homeostasis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). High levels of Brm in the ISC nucleus represent high proliferative ability and are essential for EC differentiation; low levels of Brm in the EC nucleus may be a response for homeostasis. Changes in Brm protein levels resulted in the disruption of differentiation and deregulation of cell proliferation. In line with previous findings in human, the cell-type-specific expression of <i>Drosophila</i> homologs BRG1 and BRM were also detected in adult tissues (<a href=\"#bib41\">Reisman et al., 2005</a>). BRG1 is mainly expressed in cell types that constantly undergo proliferation or self-renewal, whereas BRM is expressed in other cell types (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marenda et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reisman et al., 2005</a>).

                        "text": "It is known that the Hpo pathway restricts cell proliferation and promotes cell death at least in two ways: inhibiting the transcriptional co-activator Yki (<a href=\"#bib15\">Huang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>), and inducing activation of pro-apoptotic genes such as caspases directly (<a href=\"#bib50\">Verghese et al., 2012</a>). In our study, we identified a novel regulatory mechanism of the Hpo pathway in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. In this scenario, Brm activity is regulated by the Hpo pathway. In normal physiological conditions, under the control of Hpo signaling, the function of Yki\u2013Sd to promote ISC proliferation is restricted and the pro-proliferation of target genes such as <i>diap1</i> that inhibits Hpo-induced caspase activity cannot be further activated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>). Therefore, Hpo signaling normally functions to restrict cell numbers in the midgut by keeping ISC proliferation at low levels. Yki is enriched in ISCs, but predominantly inactivated in cytoplasm by the Hpo pathway (<a href=\"#bib23\">Karpowicz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Staley and Irvine, 2010</a>). The knockdown of Yki in ISCs did not cause any phenotype in the midgut (<a href=\"#bib23\">Karpowicz et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that Yki is inactivated in ISCs under normal homeostasis. During an injury, Hpo signaling is suppressed or disrupted, Yki translocates into the nuclei to form a complex with Sd (<a href=\"#bib23\">Karpowicz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Shaw et al., 2010</a>), which may allow Yki\u2013Sd to interact with Brm complex in the nucleus to activate transcriptional targets. Of note, the loss-of-function of Brm resulted in growth defect of ISCs, suggesting that Brm is required for ISC homeostasis and possessing a different role of Brm from Yki in the regulation of ISCs. It is possible that the function of Brm on ISC homeostasis is regulated via other signaling pathways by recruiting other factors. Therefore, different phenotypes induced by the loss-of-function of Brm and Yki in midgut might be due to different regulatory mechanisms. Despite its unique function cooperating with Yki in midgut, that Brm complex is essential for Yki-mediated transcription might be a general requirement for cell proliferation. While this manuscript was under preparation, Irvine lab reported a genome-wide association of Yki with chromatin and chromatin-remodeling complexes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oh et al., 2013</a>). These results support our model."

The loss of Hpo signaling stabilizes Brm protein, whereas the active Hpo pathway restricts Brm levels by activating <i>Drosophila</i> caspases to cleave Brm at the D718 site and inhibiting downstream target gene <i>diap1</i> transcription simultaneously. In addition, overexpression of Brm complex components induces only a mild enhancement on midgut proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,D\u2032</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E,E\u2032,G,G\u2032,I,I\u2032</a>). One possibility is that overexpressing only one of the Brm complex components does not provide full activation of the whole complex; the other possibility is that due to the restriction of the Hpo signaling, as overexpressing Brm<sup>D718A</sup> mutant protein in ISCs/EBs exhibits a stronger phenotype than expressing the wild-type Brm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,G</a>) and coexpression of Brm<sup>D718A</sup> completely rescues the impairment of Hpo-induced ISC proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). D718A mutation blocks the caspase-dependent Brm cleavage and exhibits high activity in promoting ISC proliferation.

To focus on the function of Brm cleavage in the presence of cell death signals, we tried to examine the activities of the cleaved Brm fragments. Although in vivo experiments did not show strong activity of Brm N- and C-cleavage products in promoting proliferation of ISCs, the C-terminal fragment of Brm that contains the ATPase domain exhibits a relative higher activity than the N-terminal fragment in ISCs (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2D,E,K</a>). The cleavage might induce faster degradation of Brm N- and C-terminus, since it was difficult to detect N- or C-fragments of Brm by Western blot analysis without MG132 treatment. It reveals that the degradation events of Brm including both ubiquitination and cleavage at D718 site can be important for Brm functional regulation under different conditions. To this end, the intrinsic signaling(s) may balance the activity of Brm complex through degradation of some important components, such as Brm, to maintain tissue homeostasis. Of note, the cleavage of Brm at D718 is occurred at a novel DATD sequence that is not conserved in human Brm. It has been reported that Cathepsin G, not caspase, cut hBrm during apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biggs et al., 2001</a>), suggesting that the cleavage regulatory mechanism of Brm is relatively conserved between <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals."

In mammals, it is known that Hpo signaling and SWI/SNF complex-mediated chromatin remodeling processes play critical roles in tissue development. Malfunction of the Hpo signaling pathway and aberrant expressions of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling proteins BRM and BRG1 have been documented in a wide variety of human cancers including colorectal carcinoma (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reisman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Watanabe et al., 2011</a>).

Peptide solution was measured using a LTQ Deca XP system (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, California, United States). HPLC separation was performed with a capillary LC pump. The flow rate of the pump was at 250 \u03bcl/min and was about 2 \u03bcl/min after split. The mobile phases used for reverse phase were A: 0.1% formic acid in water, pH 3.0, B: 0.1% formic acid in ACN. Peptides were eluted using a 2\u201335%, 35\u201390% stepped linear gradient of solvent B in 60 min, 90 min following 90% solvent B in 10 min, and 2% solvent B in 30 min for balance. An ESIIT mass spectrometer (LTQ Deca XP; Thermo Finnigan) was used for peptide detection. The positive ion mode was employed, and the spray voltage was set at 3.4 KV. The spray temperature was set at 200\u00b0C for peptides. Collision energy is automatically set by the LTQ Deca XP system. After acquisition of a full scan mass spectrum, 10 MS/MS scans were acquired for the next 10 most intense ions using dynamic exclusion. Peptides and proteins were identified using Turbo Sequest software (Thermo Finnigan), which uses the MS and MS/MS spectra of peptide ions to search against the publicly available Uniport fly database (Version 2011-05-26). The protein identification criteria that we used were based on Delta (CN \u2265 0.1) and Xcorr (one charge \u2265 1.9, two charges \u2265 2.2, three charges \u2265 3.75)."

They do this by using an Brm-RNAi under the control of a <i>escargot-Gal4</i> driver, conditionally expressed in the adult using a <i>Gal80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> system (the temperature shift timings should be clearly stated in the results and better detailed in the Materials and methods). The RNAi knockdown is stated in the text as being confirmed by antibody staining, but the relevant figure shows that the RNAi works in the imaginal disc: how do we know that the <i>escargot-Gal4</i> is as effective in the adult as the <i>hh-Gal4</i> is in the third instar disc? The RNAi phenotype is also averred to be similar to a dominant-negative phenotype: the figures presented do suggest a similarity, though how deep this is not evident from what is presented. The reduction of ISC cells is seen better in the MARCM experiment and this suggests that the RNAi could be effective as assumed. In sum, the conclusion of a role for Brm in ISC proliferation would have been stronger if an independent ISC antibody marker were used to verify the RNAi result. This important point needs to be addressed. As it stands, the principal assertion of the first figure is weak, thereby weakening the rest that follows."

Does this not alter the possibilities for interpreting the data? Figure 1O and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> do not look similar. Can the authors address this? Could it not be that the ISCs are very few (as shown earlier) and that the absence of proliferation of these few ISC upon DSS induction is due to an earlier role for Brm rather than an additional later role on damage induced midgut regeneration?"

The lineage trace method is not well explained anywhere in the text. Presumably they imply that this method allows the removal of even this low-level of Brm in early-ECs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>) and they then examine the effect on EC differentiation. This point needs to be clarified and clearly demonstrated. If, on the other hand (and this seems to be the case), they suggest that the ISC that are present (without Brm) do not proliferate and therefore there are fewer ECs as seen by the absence of PDM-1, then this suggests a role for Brm in ISCs and not necessarily in EC differentiation too. A clean way to examine the role of Brm in EC differentiation will be to down-regulate Brm specifically in early-ECs but not in ISCs. The authors could examine if this is feasible using conditional <i>Gal4</i> drivers."

This section, with respect to the main theme of the paper, raises concern. So far, we have epistasis showing that Brm is downstream of Yki-Sd. Now we are shown physical interaction in another very different context (S2) cells (similar results have also been recently published by the Ken Irvine Lab). These S2 results are also interpreted quantitatively and this interpretation transferred to an in vivo context: it is not clear how one can do this, coming as it does from a rather artificial and experimentally highly-manipulated cell-culture context. If the authors do not show in vivo interaction by high-resolution imaging methods they are not adding anything too much to what we have already from the Irvine lab paper. Just reporting this as an independent conformation of the Irvine lab results is confirmatory, but that can be stated in a less elaborate way. Similarly, the genetic interactions of Brm with Sd are very interesting from a genetic perspective, but other that hinting tantalizingly to a similar interaction in ISCs we do not know if this wing-blade interaction applies in this context. Indeed does the mild phenotype from Sd over-expression not suggest that Sd may not have a major role in ISC differentiation, although Yki does?"
