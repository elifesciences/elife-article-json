The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1\u20133) bind to m<sup>6</sup>A-modified cellular RNAs and affect RNA metabolism and processing. Here, we show that YTHDF1\u20133 proteins recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified HIV-1 RNA and inhibit HIV-1 infection in cell lines and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. We further mapped the YTHDF1\u20133 binding sites in HIV-1 RNA from infected cells. We found that the overexpression of YTHDF proteins in cells inhibited HIV-1 infection mainly by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription, while knockdown of YTHDF1\u20133 in cells had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A writers decreased HIV-1 Gag protein expression in virus-producing cells, while silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A erasers increased Gag expression. Our findings suggest an important role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA in viral infection and HIV-1 protein synthesis."

The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1\u20133) bind to m<sup>6</sup>A-modified cellular RNAs and affect RNA metabolism and processing. Here, we show that YTHDF1\u20133 proteins recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified HIV-1 RNA and inhibit HIV-1 infection in cell lines and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. We further mapped the YTHDF1\u20133 binding sites in HIV-1 RNA from infected cells. We found that the overexpression of YTHDF proteins in cells inhibited HIV-1 infection mainly by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription, while knockdown of YTHDF1\u20133 in cells had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A writers decreased HIV-1 Gag protein expression in virus-producing cells, while silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A erasers increased Gag expression. Our findings suggest an important role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA in viral infection and HIV-1 protein synthesis."

A better understanding of how HIV behaves in the cell would help researchers to find a cure for persistent HIV infection. When HIV enters an immune cell, its genetic material \u2013 in the form of molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA) \u2013 is used as a template to make molecules of DNA. This viral DNA can integrate into the host cell\u2019s DNA, where it is used as a template to make more viral RNA molecules, which are then used to make viral proteins.

These findings suggest that adenosine methylation plays an important role in regulating the ability of HIV to thrive and multiply in T-lymphocytes, which are an important target for HIV. Since the RNAs of other human viruses, such as influenza virus, can also be modified by adenosine methylation, drugs that target this pathway could have the potential to be used to fight a variety of viral illnesses."

The m<sup>6</sup>A modification is widely distributed in mammalian mRNAs, enriched in the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) near the stop codon and also present in the 5\u2019 UTR and long exons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dominissini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>).

These m<sup>6</sup>A-reader proteins preferentially bind methylated mRNAs and control the stability and translation of target mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dominissini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Human YTHDF1\u20133 proteins contain a conserved YTH RNA-binding domain that preferentially binds the m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNAs and a P/Q/N-rich region that is associated with different RNA-protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Lichinchi <i>et al</i>. recently reported that silencing of the m<sup>6</sup>A writers or the eraser AlkBH5 decreases or increases HIV-1 replication, respectively (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lichinchi et al., 2016</a>). Kennedy <i>et al.</i> showed that m<sup>6</sup>A modifications in the 3\u2019 UTR region of HIV-1 RNA enhance viral gene expression by recruiting cellular YTHDF proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kennedy et al., 2016</a>). However, neither study examined the\u00a0m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA and its effect on HIV-1 replication in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, nor systemically analyzed the role of the m<sup>6</sup>A writers, erasers, and readers in HIV-1 replication."

We mapped the specific sites in HIV-1 RNA bound by YTHDF proteins in HIV-1-infected cells. We found that overexpression of YTHDF proteins in target cells significantly inhibited HIV-1 infection, while knockdown of these proteins in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells enhanced HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, knockdown of the m<sup>6</sup>A writers or the erasers decreased or increased HIV-1 Gag synthesis and virion release in virus-producing cells, respectively. Our findings suggest important functions of the m<sup>6</sup>A reader, writer, and eraser proteins in modulating HIV-1 gene expression and viral infection through the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA."

We noticed a differential level of the effect on HIV-1 infection in different cell types by manipulating the individual YTHDF1\u20133 proteins. It is possible that the different effects are due to distinct cellular functions and mechanisms of YTHDF proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Recent studies indicated that YTHDF1 is responsible for translation promotion, and that YTHDF2 is responsible for mRNA decay, while the function YTHDF3 is unclear, but likely to aid in the temporal-spatial transport and delivery of mRNA (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wang and He, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wang et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2015</a>). Indeed, we observed a unique high peak within the <i>rev</i> gene of HIV-1 RNA bound by YTHDF1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), while YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 appear to have similar inhibitory effects on HIV-1 infection. It is possible that YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 may interact with different host proteins that directly or indirectly affect HIV-1 replication and lead to similar effects on viral inhibition. Furthermore, these three YTHDF proteins may have functional redundancy, and individual knockdown of one YTHDF protein may result in a modest effect because the other two could compensate the function. A recent study suggests that the dynamic m<sup>6</sup>A modification of cellular mRNA is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization and upregulation of YTHDF2 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). It is conceivable that HIV-1 infection of cells may induce the changes of cellular localization and expression levels of YTHDF proteins, thereby affecting HIV-1 RNA replication and viral infection."

The m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA could serve as an immune evasion strategy, wherein the virus may escape detection by innate immunity against infection. In response to HIV-1 infection, the host may evolve and utilize the YTHDF1\u20133 proteins to bind the m<sup>6</sup>A-modified viral RNA and inhibit its reverse transcription and subsequent viral mRNA expression. Our findings can stimulate further studies on the precise role of m<sup>6</sup>A in HIV-1 RNA replication and the mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A regulation pathways that impact HIV-1 infection in cells. Because m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA has also been found in other viruses (<a href=\"#bib1\">Beemon and Keith, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Canaani et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hashimoto and Green, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Krug et al., 1976</a>), this modification pathway may represent a novel and conserved target for antiviral development."

Cells were infected with HIV-Luc/VSV-G at an MOI of 5 for 3\u2009hr. Cells were UV-cross-linked, lysed in cell lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 10\u2009min on ice with frequent mixing and were sonicated to ensure maximum lysis. The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 9,300 \u00d7g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes and equal amount of cell lysates were mixed with anti-FLAG-conjugated protein G beads and rotated for 2\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C. After the incubation, beads were washed 3 times with cell lysis buffer. Co-immunoprecipitated RNA was isolated from the immunoprecipitates using Trizol (Invitrogen), and RNeasy columns (Qiagen) with an on-column DNase I treatment (Qiagen) and eluted with RNase-free water.

As HIV-1 infection was inhibited by the addition of 4-thiouridine (data not shown), we omitted that step and performed crosslinking directly. Briefly, six 15-cm plates of HeLa cells stably expressing YTHDF1\u20133 proteins were seeded at day 1. At day 2, the HeLa cells were infected with the HIV-1-Luc/VSV-G at an MOI of 0.5 for 2\u2009hr, cells were washed to remove cell-free HIV-1. At day 3, the cells were washed once with 10\u2009mL ice-cold PBS. Cell plates were placed on a tray with ice and irradiated, uncovered, with 0.15\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup> of 254 nm UV light three times in a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene,\u00a0Santa Clara, CA). Cells were scraped off in PBS and transferred to centrifugation tubes and collected by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7g for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellets were lysed in 3 volumes of 1% NP40 lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10\u2009min. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 \u00d7g for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Anti-FLAG antibodies were used in the IP as previously described. The recovered RNA samples were further cleaned by RNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (Zymo Research,\u00a0Irvine, CA) before library construction using the small RNA sample preparation kit (NEB). The first round of RNase T1 digest was carried out at 0.2 U/\u03bcl for 15\u2009min and the second round digestion was conducted at 10 U/\u03bcl for 8\u2009min."

The authors find that this modification of viral RNA has both positive and negative effects; it is inhibitory to reverse transcription due to binding by YTHDF1-3 proteins. The authors also confirm prior studies indicating that N6-methyladenosine incorporation is necessary for maximal HIV protein expression. Thus, N6-methyladenosine has both positive and negative effects depending on the stage of the viral life cycle. Overall, the experiments were well-controlled and interpreted accurately. In particular, the inhibitory effects of YTHDF1-3 on reverse transcription and viral gene expression in HeLa cells in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> are quite striking. The authors also elegantly determine the binding sites of YTHDF1-3 proteins on the HIV genome and demonstrate that these sites partially correspond with sites containing N6-methyladenosine. Interestingly, YTHDF1 had a unique binding site within the <i>rev</i> gene, suggesting it plays a unique role. The data are significant and important to our understanding of this poorly understood RNA modification and its role in HIV replication."

However, m<sup>6</sup>A mapping was never performed in the natural target cell (primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) of HIV-1 virus.

However, in the present manuscript, the authors demonstrate that YTHDF 1-3 show a similar effect on Gag protein expression. Overexpression of YTHDF proteins leads to a decreased expression of Gag protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, the authors demonstrate the effects of YTHDF protein overexpression and knockdown on gag mRNA expression. Similar to the decrease in Gag protein expression, gag mRNA expression decreases upon the overexpression of YTHDF proteins. Furthermore, a shRNA-mediated knockdown leads to an increase in gag mRNA levels. From their previous findings, YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 should exhibit opposing effects on gag mRNA and protein levels. This contradictory data is not addressed. It is also possible that the changes in gag expression is due to some secondary effects of YTHDF knockdown and overexpression."

Protein encoded by these mRNAs (19 out of 56) were previously identified as regulators of HIV replication. Some of these proteins also directly interact with HIV proteins. These m<sup>6</sup>A-containing host RNAs could also be targets of YTHDF proteins. Therefore, the role of YTHDF interaction with the viral genome and inhibition of viral reverse transcription is not convincing. In cells, HIV-1 RNA can be covered with hundreds of proteins before and during reverse transcription. Why would the presence of YTHDF protein on HIV-1 genomic RNA hinder reverse transcription? It is highly likely that recruitment of YTHDF proteins induce HIV-1 RNA degradation or function in an indirect manner to affect HIV. Little mechanistic insight is provided."

The authors find that this modification of viral RNA has both positive and negative effects; it is inhibitory to reverse transcription due to binding by YTHDF1-3 proteins. The authors also confirm prior studies indicating that N6-methyladenosine incorporation is necessary for maximal HIV protein expression. Thus, N6-methyladenosine has both positive and negative effects depending on the stage of the viral life cycle. Overall, the experiments were well-controlled and interpreted accurately. In particular, the inhibitory effects of YTHDF1-3 on reverse transcription and viral gene expression in HeLa cells in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> are quite striking. The authors also elegantly determine the binding sites of YTHDF1-3 proteins on the HIV genome and demonstrate that these sites partially correspond with sites containing N6-methyladenosine.
