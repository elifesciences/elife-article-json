In this regard <i>eLife</i> aspires to encompass all of the life sciences. Another more contentious dimension is quality: is a given paper significant enough for the journal in question? A recent <i>eLife</i> editorial addressed this matter (<a href=\"#bib4\">Malhotra and Marder, 2015</a>): \u2018For us,\u2019 the article explained, \u2018the ideal <i>eLife</i> paper presents an accurate description of data that makes others in the field think differently and moves the field forward\u2019. Crucially, there are no constraints on the number of papers that can be published in <i>eLife</i>: we accept all the papers that meet our standards (<a href=\"#bib7\">Schekman et al., 2013</a>). A third dimension concerns the types of article that a journal publishes. The National Library of Medicine in the US, for example, recognizes a remarkable <a href=\"http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1d2/attribute/article-type.html\">30 different types of article</a>, from abstracts and addendums to review articles and translations. PubMed offers even more \u2018<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/pubtypes.html\">publication types</a>\u2019. It is this aspect of scope that we discuss here."

Since then the <i>Research Article</i> has been joined by several other formats. <i>Short Reports</i>, as their name suggests, are short pieces of original research: although there is no minimum length for a <i>Research Article</i>, authors submitted relatively few short manuscripts in the early days of the journal, so we created a specific format to encourage shorter submissions. <i>Research Advances</i> are papers that build on previously published eLife articles in an important way (<a href=\"#bib6\">Patterson et al., 2014</a>). The <i>Registered Report</i> has emerged as part of efforts to improve the reproducibility of research (<a href=\"#bib3\">Errington et al., 2014</a>): in essence it is an experimental protocol that explains how its authors intend to replicate a previously published result. In due course the results of these experiments will be published in a <i>Replication Study</i>."
