Frequently co-opted to pattern new structures, the pathway is conserved among eumetazoans yet flexible and pleiotropic in its effects. The Hedgehog receptor, Patched, is transcriptionally activated by Hedgehog, providing essential negative feedback in all tissues. Our locus-wide dissections of the <i>cis</i>-regulatory landscapes of fly <i>patched</i> and mouse <i>Ptch1</i> reveal abundant, diverse enhancers with stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. The seemingly simple, constitutive Hedgehog response of <i>patched/Ptch1</i> is driven by a complex regulatory architecture, with batteries of context-specific enhancers engaged in promoter-specific interactions to tune signaling individually in each tissue, without disturbing patterning elsewhere. This structure\u2014one of the oldest cis-regulatory features discovered in animal genomes\u2014explains how <i>patched/Ptch1</i> can drive dramatic adaptations in animal morphology while maintaining its essential core function. It may also suggest a general model for the evolutionary flexibility of conserved regulators and pathways."

Frequently co-opted to pattern new structures, the pathway is conserved among eumetazoans yet flexible and pleiotropic in its effects. The Hedgehog receptor, Patched, is transcriptionally activated by Hedgehog, providing essential negative feedback in all tissues. Our locus-wide dissections of the <i>cis</i>-regulatory landscapes of fly <i>patched</i> and mouse <i>Ptch1</i> reveal abundant, diverse enhancers with stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. The seemingly simple, constitutive Hedgehog response of <i>patched/Ptch1</i> is driven by a complex regulatory architecture, with batteries of context-specific enhancers engaged in promoter-specific interactions to tune signaling individually in each tissue, without disturbing patterning elsewhere. This structure\u2014one of the oldest cis-regulatory features discovered in animal genomes\u2014explains how <i>patched/Ptch1</i> can drive dramatic adaptations in animal morphology while maintaining its essential core function. It may also suggest a general model for the evolutionary flexibility of conserved regulators and pathways."

Hh signaling is used for cell-cell communication in many contexts during development, and is maintained into adulthood to control tissue homeostasis. Disruption of signaling has been directly linked to several human cancers such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma in addition to developmental disorders including spina bifida, exencephaly and cleft lip/palate (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barakat et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Scales and de Sauvage, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Teglund and Toftg\u00e5rd, 2010</a>). The Hh pathway itself is highly pleiotropic, regulating many different cell fate decisions in different cellular contexts, but the vast majority of the direct transcriptional targets of Hh/Gli respond to signaling in a strictly limited, tissue- and stage-specific pattern (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barolo and Posakony, 2002</a>). A very small number of target genes, such as <i>patched</i> in flies and <i>Ptch1, Gli1,</i> and perhaps <i>Hhip1</i> in vertebrates, all of which encode components or modifiers of the Hh pathway itself, seem to respond to Hh signaling in a universal, constitutive manner (or nearly so), to the extent that the expression of these target genes is sometimes considered diagnostic for the presence of Hh signaling (<a href=\"#bib20\">Epstein, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shahi et al., 2015</a>). Although the regulation of these 'universal' target genes, which respond to Hh/Gli in most or all signaling contexts, has been studied to some extent\u2014for example, an enhancer of <i>Drosophila patched</i> was the first direct Hh/Gli target discovered in any organism (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexandre et al., 1996</a>)\u2014the basis of a constitutive response to Hedgehog/Gli, or to any pleiotropic signaling pathway, is not understood. One could imagine a simple 'master' response element that is universally activated by a given signal in all developmental and adult stem-niche contexts where that signal is present. But while efforts have been made to synthesize such generic response elements by multimerizing binding sites, with varying degrees of success (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barolo, 2006</a>), so far no such element has been found in nature."

The Hh receptor Patched (Ptc) normally inhibits the function of Smoothened, blocking signal transduction and favoring the production of the repressor isoform of the Ci/Gli transcription factor (Gli<sup>R</sup>). This inhibition is relieved upon binding of Hh ligand to Ptc, allowing the activator isoform (Gli<sup>A</sup>) to accumulate. Ptc is expressed broadly, keeping the Hh pathway silent in the absence of ligand, but it is also directly transcriptionally activated by Gli in all Hh-regulated tissues, where it moderates signal levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This constitutive negative feedback circuit, which is conserved from flies to mammals and is essential for normal development, has been extensively studied in <i>Drosophila</i>, especially in the contexts of the developing wing and embryonic ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexandre et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Briscoe and Th\u00e9rond, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen and Struhl, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Milenkovic et al., 1999</a>).

Our previous work has demonstrated that high-affinity Gli motifs identical to those in <i>ptc<sup>prox</sup></i> (GACCACCCA) can repress enhancer activity in embryos, even in Hh-responding cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">White et al., 2012</a>). These results presented a potential paradox: the same Gli motifs that have been shown to repress transcription in embryonic stripes are also found in an enhancer of <i>patched</i>, a gene which is directly activated by Hh/Gli in those same cells. Two explanations that could reconcile these results were (1) that optimal Gli motifs can either activate or repress transcription in the same cells, depending on their <i>cis</i>-context, or (2) that the <i>ptc<sup>prox</sup></i> element is not a universally Hh/Gli-responsive enhancer. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the <i>ptc<sup>prox\u00a0</sup></i>enhancer in the embryonic ectoderm, and found that it fails to respond to Hh/Gli in this context (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). This is also consistent with reports that a larger 3.2 kb fragment including <i>ptc<sup>prox</sup></i> is also insufficient for a complete embryonic response, but larger fragments that include extensive 5\u2019 sequences are sufficient to drive <i>ptc</i>-like embryo patterns (<a href=\"#bib22\">Forbes et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Millard and Martin, 2008</a>). Because the promoter-adjacent cluster of conserved, optimal Gli motifs produces a tissue-restricted expression pattern, it is not sufficient to explain the universal Hh response of the <i>patched</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013G</a>), suggesting that the control region for embryonic stripe expression is located elsewhere in the locus. We then set out to identify the enhancer module responsible for <i>ptc</i> expression in embryonic ectodermal stripes and to characterize its Hh/Gli response, hypothesizing that it may depend on lower-affinity Gli inputs than the <i>ptc<sup>prox</sup></i> element."

The mouse <i>Ptch1</i> locus seems to be regulated by a very similar overall structure, making this an uncommonly ancient <i>cis</i>-regulatory strategy in the animal genome, perhaps as old as the Hh-Gli-Ptc negative feedback circuit itself. We propose that this regulatory structure, in which many context-specific Hh-responsive enhancers together produce a 'simple' constitutive response pattern, can explain why <i>patched</i> is an important locus for morphological divergence: it allows Hh signaling levels to be adjusted independently in each tissue and stage, without disturbing pathway activity in other developmental and stem cell contexts."

A small promoter element, fragment BA, which does not include the cluster of three optimal Gli sites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), drives broad, low-level, non-Hh-regulated expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,J\u2019</a>), while several separable embryonic enhancers, when examined in vivo as GFP reporters containing the BA promoter element, drive <i>patched</i>-like segment-polarity stripe patterns (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K\u2013N</a>). In order to distinguish the information encoded in these embryo stripe enhancers from that provided by the endogenous <i>ptc</i> promoter, we also tested several <i>ptc</i> stripe enhancers with a minimal heterologous <i>Hsp70</i> TATA/Inr-containing promoter ('hspmin') driving GFP. When paired with the hspmin promoter, three <i>ptc</i> enhancers drive <i>ptc</i>-like responses in the embryonic ectoderm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The intronic element 1EH is activated in stripes to the anterior and posterior of each segmental stripe of Hh-expressing cells, much like the <i>ptc</i> gene's expression pattern in this tissue, though with broader stripes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>). The distal 5' enhancer VT is active in a subset of <i>ptc</i>-positive cells on the anterior side of Hh-producing stripes in each segment\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), while the more proximal 5' enhancer LK drives expression in <i>ptc</i>+ cells to the posterior of each Hh stripe\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Conditional overexpression of the Hh ligand augmented the posterior-stripe expression of enhancer LK, but did not affect the context specificity of its expression pattern (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

These Ci/Gli motifs were then altered by overlap extension PCR to abolish Ci binding (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> for in vitro binding assays). Mutating Ci/Gli motifs in each embryonic stripe enhancer of <i>ptc</i> severely reduced its Hh responsiveness in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), demonstrating that low- to moderate-affinity Gli motifs\u2014which account for most or all of the Ci/Gli sites in these modules (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)\u2014are required for strong activation in the embryonic ectoderm.

Because this two-site optimization increased Ci binding to those sites in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and augmented the Gli1-responsiveness of the enhancer modules in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M</a>), we conclude that the sequence alteration improves Ci/Gli binding as predicted. In vivo, however, the Gli-optimized 1EH and VT enhancers are significantly less active in the embryonic ectoderm than their wild-type counterparts\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> compare to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Though perhaps counterintuitive, this finding is consistent with our group's previous reports that optimizing Ci/Gli motifs in Hh-regulated embryonic ectodermal enhancers of the <i>wingless</i> and <i>stripe</i> genes causes a decrease in enhancer activation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib63\">White et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</a>). Interestingly, this effect appears to be tissue-/stage-dependent: optimizing two Gli motifs in the VT module decreases its activity in the embryonic ectoderm, as described above, but the same alteration conversely causes an increase of enhancer activity in the wing disc\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J'</a>), where VT is normally weakly active\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H'</a>). These results suggest that there is no level of Gli occupancy that allows optimal activity of this <i>ptc</i> enhancer in both the embryonic segments and the wing disc. Thus, nonconsensus Gli motifs can influence both the strength and the stage/tissue specificity of transcriptional responses to Hedgehog signaling."

We examined a few of these enhancers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)\u2014all of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin in wing discs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McKay and Lieb, 2013</a>)\u2014in greater detail with respect to their direct Gli inputs, using GFP reporters with a minimal TATA+Inr 'hspmin' promoter. All of these wing stripe enhancers depend on Gli motifs for full activity in the wing imaginal disc (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, the number and quality of Gli motifs in these modules bears no obvious relationship to the strength of enhancer activity in Hh-responding cells. For example, the previously characterized wing enhancer <i>ptc<sup>prox</sup></i> (referred to here as module DB), with its cluster of three well-conserved optimal sites, is a weaker wing enhancer than several other regions of the <i>ptc</i> locus with fewer and/or lower-affinity Gli motifs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

However, the relative change in expression upon mutation of the Gli motifs, both in vitro and in vivo, was usually greater in modules with higher-quality Gli sites such as DB and ZY, compared to modules with weaker sites such as HF and YU (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Taking these results altogether, we conclude that, while Gli motif quality plays a role in Hh/Gli responsiveness (positively or negatively, depending on the developmental context), it is not in itself a good indicator of which enhancers will be the most strongly active in a given tissue. Note that of the five wing enhancers examined here, the two with the highest expression levels in wings (HF and YU) have relatively few and/or low-quality Gli motifs, which nevertheless make significant contributions to their activity."

This result led us to hypothesize that the high-affinity Gli sites in the DB module may require additional flanking sequence in order to exert a strong influence on gene expression in vivo. We first addressed this by testing a nested set of fragments from the -5.5 kb region upstream of <i>ptc,</i> all containing the 3 proximal optimal GBS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <i>top).</i> All of the fragments (DB, GB, HB, and JB, in order of increasing size) drove <i>ptc</i>-like stripes in the wing, but while the anterior-posterior positions of these stripes were the same, the levels and dorsal-ventral extents of gene expression increased greatly with the addition of 5\u2019 flanking sequence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). 5\u2019 sequences containing relatively few and weak Gli motifs provided significant boosts to gene expression in the wing: for example, compare GB to DB, and HB to GB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). We next examined the direct contribution of the three optimal Gli sites (located within region D) to the in vivo activity of the nested fragments DB, GB, and JB. In all cases, mutating these three Gli sites (while leaving any other Gli motifs intact) significantly reduced peak gene expression in the wing stripe (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>) (Student\u2019s t-test; p&lt;0.0015). However, the relative contribution of those three sites, measured as reduction of expression of a 3xGli-mutant enhancer compared to wild-type, decreased as more <i>cis</i>-regulatory context was included\u2014from a 99.9% reduction in module DB, to a 62% reduction in module GB, to a 26% reduction in module JB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>). When taken out of their native sequence context and tested as a synthetic reporter, three optimal Ci/Gli sites are not capable of activating gene expression in the wing, though they can strongly synergize with other activator binding sites (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</a>)."

Note that of these fragments, only module DB contains the cluster of three optimal Gli motifs. All of these modules were sufficient to drive expression in the wing disc, and as with the more distal <i>patched</i> wing enhancers examined above, little or no correlation between predicted Gli affinity and in vivo expression levels was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). In general, transcriptional synergy among sub-fragments was observed in vivo, such that the activity of a large fragment (JB, HB, GB) was greater than the sum of the individual activities of its constituent sub-fragments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013J</a>)."

These are all hallmarks of Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PREs), <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences which mediate epigenetic regulation by PcG/TrxG factors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brown and Kassis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schaaf et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bowman et al., 2014</a>).

A motif analysis of DNA sequences located 5\u2019 of the <i>ptc</i> promoter using the CIS-BP database (<a href=\"#bib62\">Weirauch et al., 2014</a>) identified conserved binding motifs for the PcG protein Pho (ortholog of vertebrate YY1) and the TrxG transcription factor Trl/GAF (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with our tissue-specific ChIP-seq binding data. These motifs are frequently enriched in PREs and often required for their function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brown and Kassis, 2013</a>). We also compared the core promoter motifs present in our two test promoters. The <i>ptc</i> core promoter region lacks a TATA box but contains a <i>Drosophila</i> Initiator element (Inr) and multiple GAF-binding GAGA motifs, as well as a pause button (PB) and a Downstream Promoter Element (DPE) 3\u2019 of the transcription start site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The GAGA + Inr + [PB and/or DPE] promoter configuration is associated with RNA polymerase II stalling at <i>Drosophila</i> promoters (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hendrix et al., 2008</a>), and embryonic GRO-seq data identify <i>ptc</i> as one of the most heavily promoter-paused genes in the <i>Drosophila</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib49\">Saunders et al., 2013</a>). The <i>ptc</i> promoter is highly dissimilar from the minimal <i>Hsp70</i> 'hspmin' promoter fragment used here as an alternative heterologous promoter, which has a TATA + Inr motif configuration (<a href=\"#bib19\">Emanuel and Gilmour, 1993</a>)."

In light of this unusually ancient evolutionary linkage, we asked whether the <i>cis</i>-regulation of the mammalian <i>Ptch1</i> gene resembles that of its insect ortholog. Two Gli-bound enhancers of mouse <i>Ptch1</i> have been reported: a high-affinity promoter-proximal neural tube module (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vokes et al., 2007</a>) and a lower-affinity intronic limb bud mesenchyme module (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lopez-Rios et al., 2014</a>). Our ChIP-seq analysis and previous studies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lopez-Rios et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Peterson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vokes et al., 2007</a>) identify many sites of significant Gli binding near <i>mPtch1</i> and extending far upstream of the gene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). We tested seven of these Gli-bound regions as lacZ reporters in transgenic mice. As with enhancers of <i>Drosophila ptc</i>, we found that all tested <i>Ptch1</i> modules are active in different, overlapping subsets of the <i>Ptch1</i> expression pattern: no single module, no matter how strongly bound by Gli, recapitulates the complete Hh/Gli-responsive expression pattern of the parent gene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Binding of Gli transcription factors to numerous sites in the <i>Ptch1</i> locus is dynamic across several different developmental contexts, perhaps suggesting that enhancer modules are differentially accessible in a developmentally regulated manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, red arrows). Even taken together, the novel enhancers that we identify here and the previously identified modules do not account for the complete <i>Ptch1</i> pattern, suggesting that there are still more yet uncharacterized <i>Ptch1</i> enhancers to be found\u2014presumably with relatively lower levels of Gli factor binding, since the highest-occupancy ChIP-seq peaks have now been tested.

The Gli-regulated enhancers discovered to date at both the <i>Drosophila patched</i> and vertebrate <i>Ptch1</i> loci range from remote 5\u2019 elements, to promoter-proximal modules with optimal Gli motifs, to intronic enhancers. Hi-C topographical domain mapping and ChIP-seq occupancy data for the chromatin insulator/boundary factor CTCF indicate that both <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>patched</i> are flanked by a nearby 3\u2019 boundary (associated with a closely neighboring downstream gene) and a far more remote 5\u2019 boundary (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In both fly and mouse, all mapped enhancers fall within this topographical domain; they rely on Gli sites across a wide range of affinities; they appear to also require additional tissue-specific transcription factor inputs (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>); and they act through a PcG-bound, H3K27me3-marked promoter. This combination of regulatory mechanisms, ranging in scale from the single binding site to the locus as a whole, allows independent tuning of <i>ptc/Ptch1</i> expression\u2014and therefore of Hh signaling levels\u2014in individual tissues, without disrupting overall signaling required for normal development and adult tissue homeostasis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,D,E</a>)."

These remote, tissue- and sub-tissue-specific enhancers work synergistically and are integrated with additional information from promoter-proximal sequences and the core promoter, responding to Hh signaling differently in each stage and tissue type. The basis for the tissue-specific activity of the numerous enhancers of <i>ptc</i> has not been directly examined yet, but in some cases we have identified likely candidate selector inputs by a combination of sequence motif searching and DNA conservation analysis (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>)."

Previous studies from our group and others have shown that low-to-moderate-affinity transcription factor binding sites can be important for limiting the response of a target gene to a pleiotropic, broadly active transcription factor or pathway (<a href=\"#bib55\">Swanson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Crocker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Farley et al., 2015</a>; additional references within). Our results with embryonic stripe enhancers of the <i>ptc</i> gene, however, point to a different type of regulatory control by weak binding sites, in which the occupancy of a transcription factor is modulated to an optimal level of activation within a tissue. The fact that optimal activation is achieved via suboptimal Gli binding sites in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo may reflect the fact that Ci/Gli acts both as an activator and as a repressor through the same binding sites. Considering that the area and duration of Hh production in embryonic segments is vastly lower than that in larval/pupal wings, where half of the organ produces Hh protein for most of the developmental period of the animal, it is to be expected that the Gli<sup>A</sup>:Gli<sup>R</sup> ratio may be significantly lower in Hh-responsive cells in the embryonic segments than in late-larval wing discs. If so, the relatively high concentration of Gli<sup>R</sup> in Hh-responding embryonic cells may create selective pressures favoring lower Gli occupancy, as we have argued previously (<a href=\"#bib40\">Parker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">White et al., 2012</a>). Alternatively (or in addition), other mechanisms, such as overlapping binding specificities for non-Gli transcription factors, could play a role in the sub-optimization of Gli motifs observed here."

However, we do not mean to propose that the specific <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences that regulate <i>patched</i> and its orthologs are conserved across such large evolutionary distances. Individual <i>patched</i> enhancers show no obvious sequence conservation from insects to mammals\u2014unsurprisingly, given that most <i>ptc</i>-expressing, Hh/Gli-regulated organs present in modern animals did not exist at the time of the protostome-deuterostome divergence. Rather, we propose that <i>patched</i> and its orthologs share an ancient regulatory structure composed of relatively young enhancers. Based on our motif analyses and mutational studies, we propose that <i>patched</i> enhancer evolution likely involved both tuning of Gli occupancy and the co-option of tissue-specific inputs to produce new aspects of the <i>patched</i> expression pattern over time. This elaboration of new sub-patterns would not be necessary if <i>patched/Ptch1</i> were regulated by a unified 'master' Hedgehog response element; under such a simple regulatory scheme, new domains of <i>patched</i> expression would appear automatically whenever Hh signaling were activated in new contexts. By contrast, our analysis suggests that\u00a0a robust response to Hh/Gli in both embryonic segment-polarity stripes and in larval wing stripes may not be achievable by the same enhancer module, perhaps due to conflicting requirements for Gli occupancy, or perhaps for other reasons whose basis in <i>cis</i>-regulatory logic is not yet clear."

Conversely, while the collinear structure of animal Hox gene clusters predates the Bilateria, the upstream regulators of Hox genes do not appear to be shared between protostomes and deuterostomes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Duboule, 2007</a>). Our results suggest that the locus-wide multi-modular structure by which <i>patched</i> responds to Hh/Gli to provide feedback inhibition is an unusually old <i>cis-</i>regulatory strategy. This strategy has the potential advantages of transcriptional precision and robustness ascribed to regulation by \u2018shadow\u2019 enhancers (<a href=\"#bib23\">Frankel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Perry et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barolo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wunderlich et al., 2015</a>), but more importantly it allows for the independent modulation of signaling levels in a stage- and tissue-specific manner, without disturbing pathway activity in other contexts."

For example, it helps to explain two reported cases of morphological divergence caused by changes at the vertebrate <i>Ptch1</i> locus: modifications to an intronic enhancer of <i>Ptch1</i> produced major developmental adaptations in the bovine limb (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lopez-Rios et al., 2014</a>), while sequence variation upstream of <i>Ptch1</i> is linked to cichlid craniofacial diversification (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>). In both cases, Hh signaling levels in other developmental contexts (for example, the spinal cord) were apparently unaffected by the adaptation, indicating that the affected enhancer module is stage/tissue-specific. Our conserved structure with flexible enhancers model of <i>patched</i> regulation is also consistent with the finding that, while zebrafish <i>ptch1</i> resembles its mouse and fly orthologs in having multiple Gli-bound regions, few such sites are conserved among vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib42\">Peterson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Thus, while the <i>cis</i>-regulatory structure of <i>patched</i> appears to have ancient roots, it is also highly flexible, allowing a core component of the Hedgehog pathway to function as an adaptable tissue-specific modifier of pathway activity and as a substrate for morphological evolution."

This repression is relieved by Hedgehog-Patched interactions, leading to the induction of a variety of target genes, including Patched itself."

In earlier drafts of our figures, enhancer diagrams had colored backgrounds, exactly as the reviewer suggests. However, because the indicated motifs range from dark to light, most background tones mask the medium-gray sites, which are the ones most relevant to this report (see examples, below). Also, this effect depends on the background color used, with the result that the same site looks different in different enhancers. The advantage of the white background is that, by the visual logic of the greyscale heatmap, white represents the lowest, or background, affinity. Thus Gli motifs fade into the white background as their predicted affinity decreases."

Do they represent binding sites? If so, the visual convention for binding sites has changed from the heatmaps for the Drosophila enhancers, which is confusing.

We chose to use red for all Gli motifs in this figure, rather than the red+greyscale of other figures, for the sake of consistency and simplicity within this complex summary diagram. In addition to all the other information presented in these panels, indicating affinity with a range of colors would (in our opinion, after much experimentation) be visually overwhelming. However, we have followed the reviewer\u2019s excellent suggestion and replaced the \u201cthermometer\u201d shapes with simple bands, consistent with the visual logic of previous figures in which binding motifs are vertical bands. These changes are reflected in revisions to the text and figure legend."
