Using the cellulolytic fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i> as a model, we identified a xylodextrin transport and consumption pathway required for its growth on hemicellulose. Reconstitution of this xylodextrin utilization pathway in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> revealed that fungal xylose reductases act as xylodextrin reductases, producing xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as metabolic intermediates. These xylosyl-xylitol intermediates are generated by diverse fungi and bacteria, indicating that xylodextrin reduction is widespread in nature. Xylodextrins and xylosyl-xylitol oligomers are then hydrolyzed by two hydrolases to generate intracellular xylose and xylitol. Xylodextrin consumption using a xylodextrin transporter, xylodextrin reductases and tandem intracellular hydrolases in cofermentations with sucrose and glucose greatly expands the capacity of yeast to use plant cell wall-derived sugars and has the potential to increase the efficiency of both first-generation and next-generation biofuel production."

Using the cellulolytic fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i> as a model, we identified a xylodextrin transport and consumption pathway required for its growth on hemicellulose. Reconstitution of this xylodextrin utilization pathway in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> revealed that fungal xylose reductases act as xylodextrin reductases, producing xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as metabolic intermediates. These xylosyl-xylitol intermediates are generated by diverse fungi and bacteria, indicating that xylodextrin reduction is widespread in nature. Xylodextrins and xylosyl-xylitol oligomers are then hydrolyzed by two hydrolases to generate intracellular xylose and xylitol. Xylodextrin consumption using a xylodextrin transporter, xylodextrin reductases and tandem intracellular hydrolases in cofermentations with sucrose and glucose greatly expands the capacity of yeast to use plant cell wall-derived sugars and has the potential to increase the efficiency of both first-generation and next-generation biofuel production."

In current industrial methods, cellulose and hemicellulose, the two major polysaccharides found in the plant cell wall (<a href=\"#bib37\">Somerville et al., 2004</a>), are generally processed into monomers of glucose and xylose, respectively (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chundawat et al., 2011</a>). In addition to harsh pretreatment of biomass, large quantities of cellulase and hemicellulase enzyme cocktails are required to release monosaccharides from plant cell wall polymers, posing unsolved economic and logistical challenges (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lynd et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Himmel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jarboe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chundawat et al., 2011</a>).

By using transcription profiling data (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tian et al., 2009</a>) and by analyzing growth phenotypes of <i>N. crassa</i> knockout strains, we identified separate pathways used by <i>N. crassa</i> to consume cellodextrins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galazka et al., 2010</a>) and xylodextrins released by its secreted enzymes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A strain carrying a deletion of a previously identified cellodextrin transporter (CDT-2, NCU08114) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galazka et al., 2010</a>) was unable to grow on xylan (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and xylodextrins remained in the culture supernatant (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As a direct test of transport function of CDT-2, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains expressing <i>cdt-2</i> were able to import xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Notably, <i>N. crassa</i> expresses a putative intracellular \u03b2-xylosidase, GH43-2 (NCU01900), when grown on xylan (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sun et al., 2012</a>). Purified GH43-2 displayed robust hydrolase activity towards xylodextrins with a degree of polymerization (DP) spanning from 2 to 8, and with a pH optimum near 7 (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The results with CDT-2 and GH43-2 confirm those obtained independently in <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al. (2014)</a>. As with <i>cdt-1</i>, orthologues of <i>cdt-2</i> are widely distributed in the fungal kingdom (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galazka et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that many fungi consume xylodextrins derived from plant cell walls. Furthermore, as with intracellular \u03b2-glucosidases (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galazka et al., 2010</a>), intracellular \u03b2-xylosidases are also widespread in fungi (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sun et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

Reconstitution of a cellodextrin transport and consumption pathway from <i>N. crassa</i> in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> enabled this yeast to ferment cellobiose (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galazka et al., 2010</a>). We therefore reasoned that expression of a functional xylodextrin transport and consumption system from <i>N. crassa</i> might further expand the capabilities of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to utilize plant-derived xylodextrins. Previously, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> was engineered to consume xylose by introducing xylose isomerase (XI), or by introducing xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jeffries, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">van Maris et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Matsushika et al., 2009</a>).

Analyses of the supernatants from cultures of the yeast strains expressing CDT-2, GH43-2 and the <i>S. stipitis</i> XR/XDH pathway surprisingly revealed that the xylodextrins were converted into xylosyl-xylitol oligomers, a set of previously unknown compounds rather than hydrolyzed to xylose and consumed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To test whether the xylosyl-xylitol oligomers resulted from side reactions of xylodextrins with endogenous <i>S. cerevisiae</i> enzymes, we used two separate yeast strains in a combined culture, one containing the xylodextrin hydrolysis pathway composed of CDT-2 and GH43-2, and the second with the XR/XDH xylose consumption pathway. The strain expressing CDT-2 and GH43-2 would cleave xylodextrins to xylose, which could then be secreted via endogenous transporters (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hamacher et al., 2002</a>) and serve as a carbon source for the strain expressing the xylose consumption pathway (XR and XDH). The engineered yeast expressing XR and XDH is only capable of consuming xylose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). When co-cultured, these strains consumed xylodextrins without producing the xylosyl-xylitol byproduct (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate that endogenous yeast enzymes and GH43-2 transglycolysis activity are not responsible for generating the xylosyl-xylitol byproducts, that is, that they must be generated by the XR from <i>S. stipitis</i> (<i>Ss</i>XR)."

In bacteria such as <i>B. subtilis</i>, xylosyl-xylitol may be generated by aldo-keto reductases known to possess broad substrate specificity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barski et al., 2008</a>). The discovery of the xylodextrin consumption pathway along with cellodextrin consumption (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galazka et al., 2010</a>) in cellulolytic fungi for the two major sugar components of the plant cell wall now provides many modes of engineering yeast to ferment plant biomass-derived sugars (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). An alternative xylose consumption pathway using xylose isomerase could also be used with the xylodextrin transporter and xylodextrin hydrolase GH43-2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">van Maris et al., 2007</a>). However, the XR/XDH pathway may provide significant advantages in realistic fermentation conditions with sugars derived from hemicellulose. The breakdown of hemicellulose, which is acetylated (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sun et al., 2012</a>), releases highly toxic acetate, degrading the performance of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> fermentations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bellissimi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sun et al., 2012</a>). The cofactor imbalance problem of the XR/XDH pathway, which can lead to accumulation of reduced byproducts (xylitol and glycerol) and therefore was deemed a problem, can be exploited to drive acetate reduction, thereby detoxifying the fermentation medium and increasing ethanol production (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wei et al., 2013</a>)."

Nitrogen was used as the instrument gas. The source voltage (Vcap) was 3000 V in negative ion mode, and the fragmentor was set to 100 V. The drying gas temperature was 300\u00b0C; drying gas flow was 7 l/min; and nebulizer pressure was 45 psi. The ESI source used a separate nebulizer for the continuous, low-level introduction of reference mass compounds (112.985587, 1033.988109) to maintain mass axis calibration. Data were collected at an acquisition rate of 1 Hz from m/z 50 to 1100 and stored in centroid mode."

Spectra were imported to Qualtitative Analysis module of Agilent MassHunter Workstation software using m/z and retention time values obtained from the calibration samples to search for the targeted ions in the data. These searches generated extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) based on the list of target compounds. Peaks were integrated and compared to the calibration curves to calculate the concentration. Calibration curves were calculated from the calibration samples, prepared in the same oMM medium as all the samples, and curve fitting for each compound resulted in fits with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.999. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES), the buffer compound in the oMM medium with constant concentration and not utilized by yeast, was used as an internal standard (IS) for concentration normalization."

Thus, the only novelty of this manuscript is the production of xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as a side-activity of <i>S. stipitis</i> and <i>N. crassa</i> xylose reductases (XR). These oligomers appear to be inhibitory in engineered <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to utilize xylodextrins. The authors solved this problem by the identification and expression of a new hydrolyase, GH43-7, which can cleave the xylosyl-xylitol oligomers. Although the authors claim that these oligomers appear to be widely distributed in nature, evidence for this statement is lacking. By contrast, the production of these oligomers might just result from the strategy applied. In general, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can be engineered to consume xylose either by expressing a xylose isomerase (XI) or by applying the XR/XDH pathway. Surprisingly, the authors used the XR/XDH pathway, although it is generally accepted that the XI pathway is more favorable for yeast (Biotechnol Biofuels, 2013, 6, 89; Metab Eng., 2012, 14: 611-22). As far as I know, the available xylose fermenting yeast strains from industry (DSM, Lesaffre, Terranol) are all based on the XI strategy. When the authors had used the XI strategy, they never would have encountered the problem of generating the xylosyl-xylitol oligomers by the heterologous XR."

The pathway was identified in <i>N. crassa</i> and then transferred to yeast. The pathway involves two transporters and three intracellular hydrolysases, which were all identified in <i>N. crassa</i> based on RNAseq analysis. The xylose consumption pathway relies on the less efficient xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase pathway, but it still seems to work due to the partly reduction of xylodextrins intracellularly. This activity is, however, only conferred by the <i>P. stipidis</i> XR, so the pathway for uptake of xylodextrins could work equally well (and probably better) with the xylose isomerase pathway, which is to be preferred as it does not result in accumulation of xylitol (also here observed by the authors, but not commented)."

Xylose is transported through the HXT transporters and has competitive inhibition by glucose. This pathway may work in concert with glucose consumption, and this may be the real benefit. The data presented by the authors even indicate this. I suggest that this is clearly stated in the paper."

In short, hot water pretreatment could be used to release xylodextrins from bagasse, and the resulting water could be used as the diluent for the cane juice used in ethanol fermentations. This would have the benefit of increasing ethanol yield beyond that possible from using cane juice alone. Indeed, we find this to be the case (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in the new manuscript). Thus, cofermentation of sucrose and xylodextrins is a new and promising direction for producing biofuels."
