Using a biosensor to visualize p53 action, we find that <i>Drosophila</i> p53 is selectively active in gonadal stem cells after exposure to stressors that destabilize the genome. Similar p53 activity occurred in hyperplastic growths that were triggered either by the Ras<sup>V12</sup> oncoprotein or by failed differentiation programs. In a model of transient sterility, p53 was required for the recovery of fertility after stress, and entry into the cell cycle was delayed in p53<sup>-</sup> stem cells. Together, these observations establish that the stem cell compartment of the <i>Drosophila</i> germline is selectively licensed for stress-induced activation of the p53 regulatory network. Furthermore, the findings uncover ancestral links between p53 and aberrant proliferation that are independent of DNA breaks and predate evolution of the ARF/Mdm2 axis."

Using a biosensor to visualize p53 action, we find that <i>Drosophila</i> p53 is selectively active in gonadal stem cells after exposure to stressors that destabilize the genome. Similar p53 activity occurred in hyperplastic growths that were triggered either by the Ras<sup>V12</sup> oncoprotein or by failed differentiation programs. In a model of transient sterility, p53 was required for the recovery of fertility after stress, and entry into the cell cycle was delayed in p53<sup>-</sup> stem cells. Together, these observations establish that the stem cell compartment of the <i>Drosophila</i> germline is selectively licensed for stress-induced activation of the p53 regulatory network. Furthermore, the findings uncover ancestral links between p53 and aberrant proliferation that are independent of DNA breaks and predate evolution of the ARF/Mdm2 axis."

This change promotes cancer because cells can now divide faster and fail to die when they should. Much remains to be learned about how p53 functions to restrain growth. As p53 is found in primitive organisms, and cancer is unlikely to have significantly influenced evolution, suppressing tumor formation was almost certainly not the original function of this gene. Furthermore, p53 works in a different way compared to many other tumour suppressors. Therefore, prevention of cancer is likely to have evolved as a side effect derived from more ancient functions."

Stem cells are special because they can develop into many different types of cells, and they are crucial for the growth and repair of tissues. To form a particular type of cell, the stem cell divides to create two daughter cells. Commonly, one daughter cell stays in the stem state, whereas the other becomes a particular type of cell, such as a nerve cell or muscle cell. Because of this special property, scientists hypothesize that stem cells have special mechanisms to protect them from DNA damage that might partially depend on p53. This would prevent the spread of damaged genomes that would otherwise occur among daughter cells."

They found that damaging DNA activates p53 in stem cells and their daughter cells, but not in other types of cells that have been damaged. In addition, p53 is activated by the uncontrolled growth and division of stem cells in the gonad, even when DNA is not damaged. This is unexpected since molecules linking inappropriate growth to p53 were thought to be present only in mammals. Therefore, it appears that the tumor-suppressing behavior of p53 in mammals was adapted from its more ancient ability to regulate stem cell growth\u2014an ability that evolved before organisms divided into vertebrates and invertebrates."

The protein integrates diverse signals associated with DNA damage and uncontrolled proliferation to govern adaptive downstream responses such as increased DNA repair, arrested cell cycle, and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vousden and Lane, 2007</a>). Where examined, the genes encoding p53 are not essential for viability but have been implicated as regulators of aging (<a href=\"#bib9\">Derry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Donehower et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sogame et al., 2003</a>). It is now well appreciated that ancestral roles for this gene family must have predated functions in tumor suppression. In support of this, members of the p53 gene family are present in unicellular protists and short-lived multicellular organisms (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mendoza et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nordstrom and Abrams, 2000</a>). Furthermore, cancer was probably a negligible source of selection pressure during the course of human evolution (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aranda-Anzaldo and Dent, 2007</a>) and the combined removal of canonical p53 effectors (p21, Puma, and Noxa) does not account for tumor suppression in mice (<a href=\"#bib41\">Valente et al., 2013</a>). These and other observations suggest that tumor suppressive roles for the p53 family were co-opted from primordial functions, some of which may have been linked to meiotic recombination (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "In recent years, considerable evidence has surfaced linking p53 action to stem cell biology. For example, in mammary stem cells p53 promotes asymmetric division and cell polarity, thereby helping to limit the population of stem cells in the mammary gland (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cicalese et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is greatly increased in p53 deficient cells, suggesting that p53 may act as a \u2018barrier for induced pluripotency\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Krizhanovsky and Lowe, 2009</a>). Consistent with this, several labs have shown that p53 induces embryonic stem cell differentiation to maintain genomic stability after DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Neveu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao and Xu, 2010</a>). Together with recent studies in planaria, these observations indicate that an ancestral focus of p53 action could operate in stem cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pearson and Sanchez Alvarado, 2009</a>). We directly tested this possibility using a p53 biosensor to visualize <i>Drosophila</i> germline stem cells and their progeny. When DNA breaks were exogenously imposed or intrinsically engineered, <i>Drosophila</i> p53 (Dp53) was activated selectively in germline stem cells (GSCs) and their immediate daughters, indicating that these cells are uniquely licensed for p53 action. Furthermore, in various germline tumor models Dp53 was constitutively hyperactivated, suggesting that ancient links between p53 and inappropriate growth predate canonical effectors that connect these regulatory networks (e.g., ARF and MDM2)."

In the ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) undergo self-renewing divisions that typically produce a GSC and a cystoblast (CB). These GSCs support egg production throughout the lifespan of female adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We used in vivo biosensors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brodsky et al., 2000</a>) to visualize p53 activity as GSCs responded to various sources of stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To exclude technical artifacts, two GFP reporters were used\u2014one localizes to the nucleus (p53R-GFPnls) and the other does not (p53R-GFPcyt). As previously described (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>), programed p53 activity triggered by meiosis was only observed in region 2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). After exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) stress, p53 activity was induced in virtually all germaria. However, despite widespread damage to the organ (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this unprogrammed response was remarkably restricted to germline stem cells (GSCs) and their immediate progeny (CBs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). Furthermore, as seen in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1A</a>, this response was highly penetrant. Since we rarely observe reporter activation only in CBs, the signal seen in CBs probably reflects GFP perduring from the parental stem cells. Furthermore, post-irradiation levels of GFP were noticeably more robust than the programed activity during meiosis (compare solid arrows to open arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>).

Therefore, to determine whether DSBs are sufficient to induce the p53 reporter, we ubiquitously expressed the I-SceI endonuclease in the germline of flies engineered to harbor a single I-SceI recognition site in each nucleus. As seen with IR exposure, p53 activity occurred only in GSCs/CBs when DSBs were induced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1B</a>). Furthermore, it is notable that a single DSB was sufficient to provoke robust p53 activity in GSCs/CBs. Therefore, whether exogenously imposed or intrinsically engineered, DSBs triggered p53 selective activation that was confined to GSCs and their immediate progeny. Furthermore, this stem cell restricted response is clearly under genetic control. For example, in directed tests of chosen mutants we identified a class of lesions that exhibit non-selective p53 action throughout the ovary only after IR challenge (see <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1C</a>).

To examine the effect of deregulated retrotransposons, we introduced the p53 biosensor into <i>cutoff</i> or <i>aubergine</i> mutant animals. These genes encode essential components of the piwi-associated RNA (piRNA) pathway, acting to silence retrotransposons in the germline (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). The corresponding mutants exhibit disregulated retrotransposition, reduced fecundity, and egg shell ventralization (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows that in <i>cutoff</i> mutants induction of p53R-GFP occurs exclusively in GSCs and their progeny at a penetrance comparable to irradiated wild-type animals (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Frequent p53 activation in the germline was similarly observed in the GSCs of <i>aubergine</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and <i>rad54</i> mutants defective for DNA repair (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

However, it is not known whether this regulatory axis is conserved beyond mammals. To test whether inappropriate growth triggers <i>Drosophila</i> p53 function, we examined the p53 biosensors in various germline tumor models. First, we expressed an oncogenic form of RAS commonly found in human cancers together with the p53 biosensor (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 1996</a>). Transient expression of the <i>Drosophila</i> Ras<sup>V12</sup> counterpart provoked robust p53 activation mainly in the GSCs and CBs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> shows that another oncoprotein, Cyclin E, produced similar results. We also examined these biosensors in <i>bam</i> mutants, where a block in differentiation causes extensive hyperplasia (<a href=\"#bib26\">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</a>) and in these tumors extensive reporter activity was also seen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Likewise, expanded BMP (bone morphogenic protein) signaling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen and McKearin, 2003</a>) or reduced <i>Lsd1</i> (lysine-specific demethylase 1) activity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eliazer et al., 2011</a>) in neighboring somatic cells can also cause inappropriate growth and robust p53 activity was similarly observed in these germline tumors as well (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G,H</a>). Therefore, whether caused by forced oncoprotein expression (panels B, E), failed differentiation programs (panels C, D), or expansion of the stem cell niche (panels F\u2013H), inappropriate growth of <i>Drosophila</i> tissues was consistently accompanied by p53 activity. As seen with genotoxic stress, biosensor responses seen in these contexts was somewhat variable, perhaps reflecting complex signaling and/or cell cycle dynamics that occur in these tumor models. Technical sources of variation linked the UAS-GAL4 driver system and/or non-uniform accumulation of the oncogenic product could also contribute to variability in these contexts."

The modest signal in region 2 reflects meiotic p53 activity (dotted bracket) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>). When perturbed by Ras<sup>V12</sup> (<b>B</b>) the p53 biosensor (green) is induced in GSCs/CBs (solid bracket in <b>B</b>, see <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Perturbation from failed differentiation programs caused by the <i>bam</i> mutation <b>(C</b>\u2013<b>D)</b> or Cyclin E over-expression (<b>E</b>) provokes similar p53 biosensor activity. Likewise, increased DPP signaling caused by a constitutively active Tkv receptor (<b>F</b>) or ectopic DPP ligand expression (<b>G</b>) also prompts induction of the p53 reporter. Induction of the p53 reporter is also seen, when the stem cell niche is expanded by silencing of <i>Lsd1</i> (<b>H</b>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eliazer et al., 2011</a>).

We note that stem cell specificity was not an artifact intrinsic to the biosensors, since independent reporters behaved similarly in both the female and male germline and required the wild-type Dp53 locus in both cases. Furthermore, in certain mutant backgrounds stress-induced activity restricted to GSCs was lost and non-selective p53 activation was widespread throughout the ovary (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2032</a>). Therefore, despite the fact that it is present and activatable throughout the gonad, functional p53 is restricted to stem cells and their immediate progeny by specific genetic determinants."

Our findings also offer rare and novel opportunities to operationally mark the stem cells in the fly germline, as visualized by p53R-GFP. This marker is distinct from conventional stem cell labels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deng and Lin, 1997</a>) since it is not constitutively expressed but, instead, represents a functional output that is conditional upon a perturbation. We further note that like all reporter systems, our p53 biosensors may not reflect the full scope of effector output regulated by this network, and activities visualized here could transmit only subsets of p53-mediated responses. Nevertheless, despite this possible limitation, our results are consistent with suggestions that stem cells may be acutely sensitive to sources of genomic instability with a higher propensity for engaging adaptive responses relative to other cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mandal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sperka et al., 2012</a>). We propose that in reproductive tissues, the p53 regulatory network is either preferentially licensed in stem cells or selectively blocked outside of this compartment."

Second, the canonical ARF/MDM2 pathway that links aberrant growth to p53 is absent outside of higher vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2009</a>).

The parent BAC CH322-15D03 was obtained from the P[acman] resource library (<a href=\"#bib42\">Venken et al., 2009</a>) and Rainbow Transgenic Flies performed the injection and screening for recombinants. The I-SceI endonuclease strain was generated by K Galindo (<a href=\"#bib13\">Galindo et al., 2009</a>), which was crossed to p53R-GFPnls(STI150); HS-(70Flp)(70 I- Sce I)/TM6 for heat-inducible I-SceI endonuclease expression. Adult females were fattened for 2\u20133 days after eclosion and then subjected to heat shock in a circulating water bath at 37\u00b0C for 90 min and repeated for three consecutive days. 24 hr after the last heat shock, ovaries were dissected for immunostaining. For forced proliferation assays, two GAL4 lines were used: <i>nanos</i>-GAL4VP16 was used to achieve overexpression in the germline with UAS constructs for Ras<sup>V12</sup>, CyclinE, and Thickveins (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rorth, 1998</a>). <i>c587</i>-GAL4 was used to achieve overexpression of UAS constructs of <i>Dpp</i> or <i>Lsd1-RNAi</i> in the somatic cells of the ovariole tip (<a href=\"#bib38\">Song et al., 2004</a>). For cyclinE overexpression, stocks were maintained at 25\u00b0C and female virgins were collected upon eclosion, shifted to 29\u00b0C for 4\u20135 days then subjected to immunostaining. For the Ras<sup>V12</sup> studies, female virgins were shifted to 29\u00b0C for 1 day and then shifted down to 25\u00b0C for 3 days prior to immunostaining. The Gal4-UAS system (adapted from yeast) often produces optimal expression at temperatures higher than 25\u00b0C. Since the UAS-Rasv12 and UAS-CyclinE constructs were not optimized for expression in the germline we applied these temperature shifts to produce more penetrant phenotypes."

Without such knowledge, which is admittedly nontrivial to obtain, the main conclusion that \u201cadult <i>Drosophila</i> exposed to genotoxic stress or genome destabilizers selectively activated p53 in GSCs and their immediate progeny\u201d cannot be made. The data in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 3B'</a> may actually address this point somewhat. These data show that the reporter can be activated in non-GSCs of the ovary when ATR is mutated (both follicle cells and nurse cells it appears, although a better image is needed to make this call). Is this activation p53 dependent? If so, then the restriction of reporter activity to GSCs in response to IR is ATR dependent, which would be somewhat counter intuitive since ATR normally activates p53. What is the activity of the reporter in ATR mutants in the absence of IR?

In our experience, immunohistochemistry with the CC3 antibody is a reliable and robust marker for apoptotic cells. However, like all cell death markers, labeling is transient because the affected cells and their corpses ultimately disappear. For this reason \u2013 and to insure a comprehensive examination for possible apoptogenic defects \u2013 we completed a well- resolved time course at 2hr, 4hr, 8hr and 24hr post-irradiation (see current <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Because we obtained a negative result from these exhaustive studies, we did not pursue this point further. Furthermore, tests could be conducted to ask whether inhibition of apoptosis produces a phenotype in the germarium as suggested \u2013 however, the results would not help us deconstruct p53 action in the context of stem cells, since a role for cell death was not indicated. Therefore, in our view, the results could be of interest in their own right but would not advance the story we are driving at here."

The dissimilarities in activation patterns seen here most likely trace to differences in the underlying histology and/or differentially deranged signaling in the hyperplasias themselves. In the revised submission we discuss these differences and consider possible explanations where appropriate. The dissimilarities could be related to signaling dynamics, response dynamics, cell cycle dynamics etc. Technical sources of variation linked to subtle differences in the action of the UAS-GAL4 driver system and/or non-uniform accumulation of the oncogenic product are also possible. Please note that none of these considerations detract from the compelling positive findings that we are documenting here. In each of the models tested here (original <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, now <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) supernumerary and/or ectopic germline stem cells are already very well documented (Chen 2003; Elazier 2011; Xie 1998; Song 2004). Furthermore, we are confident that p53-activated cells are indeed supernumerary germline cells and, in many cases, a rounded fusome is visible in GFP+ cells. In response to this concern, we revised current <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> so that it now includes higher magnification insets in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E-H</a>. These images show that p53R-GFP+ cells also have a rounded fusome, which marks germline stem cells.

Also, given that ATR is not universally required for p53 in mammalian systems (see Nghiem, 2002) the findings are not unexpected. The fact that we see ectopic activation is actually consistent with the probability that ATR exerts constitutive genome stabilizing activities. Where possible, the biosensors are routinely validated by testing them in the p53<sup>-</sup> background. However, we are unable to recover viable animals that are simultaneously homozygous for the biosensor, homozygous for ATR<sup>-</sup> and also homozygous for p53<sup>-</sup>. Ectopic induction of the biosensor here (and in other mutants) raises intriguing implications. But, for purposes of discussion here, the findings have strong merit because they also exclude trivial explanations for the restricted stem cell activity that we observe in the wild type context. For example, it was possible that p53 was simply confined to stem cells or was somehow inert in other cells. It was also possible, for technical reasons, that the biosensor was somehow unable function in somatic cells of the ovary. Our rationale for including these results was twofold: first, we felt it was important to demonstrate that p53 and the biosensor are normally present and \u2018activatable\u2019 throughout the ovary; second, we felt it was useful to include additional examples showing that stem cell selectivity is under genetic control."

We emphasize that our \u2018licensing\u2019 model refers to the stimulus-dependent action of p53 in a wild type setting. When wild type ovaries are radiation challenged, functional p53 activation is seen only in the stem cell and their immediate progeny \u2013 under these conditions, the p53 biosensor is never observed outside of the germ stem cell compartment. This could reflect independent activation in stem cells and their immediate progeny or, alternatively, the GFP signal in cystoblasts could reflect perdurance of GFP from parental stem cells (we favor this for reasons discussed in the text). However, in the ovaries of mutants that affect genome stability, we do observe reporter activation outside of the germline and this observation provides us with important insights. In these cases, we propose that the corresponding genes normally function in ways that ultimately restrict widespread activation. In mutants that produce oncogenic stress, p53 is more broadly activated but the ectopic activation here still occurs within germline cells."
