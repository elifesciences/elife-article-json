Importantly, both excitation and suppression vary spatially within the receptive field: excitation is largely restricted to the classical receptive field (cRF), while suppression extends far beyond into the surround (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cavanaugh et al., 2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sceniak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Desimone and Schein, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carandini et al., 1997</a>). Crucially, how attention interacts with the receptive field structure of neurons remains unclear. For example, the way that attention acts on neuronal responses when shifted among stimuli inside the cRF versus when shifted to stimuli inside the surround has not been compared directly (<a href=\"#bib25\">Motter, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sanayei et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sundberg et al., 2009</a>). Differences may occur because feedforward-, feedback- and intracortical circuitries are thought to contribute differentially to the suppressive and excitatory inputs associated with stimuli in either the cRF or the surround (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angelucci et al., 2014</a>), and because the cRF and the surround presumably serve different functional roles (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angelucci et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</a>). More generally, it remains unknown if and how attention operates on the spatially-varying excitation and suppression of a neuron's receptive field. This is a pivotal open question because, as we will show below, the interaction between attention and the receptive field structure determines which neurons are most affected by attention and consequently are most likely to influence attentional behavior."

We find that the principles that drive attention modulation are remarkably similar within the classical receptive field and the surround. We show that stimuli induce excitation and suppression that varies spatially, and that attention interacts with this spatially-varying excitation and suppression. This interaction explained the large differences in attention modulations across neurons, and a non-additive relationship among\u00a0stimulus selectivity, stimulus-induced suppression and attention modulation. A spatially-tuned normalization model, wherein attention multiplies both the excitatory and spatially-varying normalization term, precisely accounted for all neuronal responses to either single or multiple stimuli, either attended or unattended, presented inside either the cRF or the surround. The model relates stimulus selectivity, stimulus-induced suppression and attention-related modulation to each other, and unifies spatial summation and attention-related modulation across different regions of the receptive field."

A small amount of baseline suppression is further added (<i>\u03c3</i> parameter; not shown). Directing attention toward a stimulus location has a multiplicative effect (<i>\u03b2</i>) on the parameters (<i>L<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>\u03b1<sub>2</sub></i>) corresponding to the attended receptive-field location (location 2 in the schematic).

Grey: modeled responses. P, P<sup>att</sup>, N, N<sup>att</sup> show the responses to the individually-presented preferred and non-preferred stimulus with attention <i>away</i> (P, N), or attention directed to the stimulus (P<sup>att</sup>, N<sup>att</sup>). PN shows the condition in which both stimuli were presented simultaneously with attention <i>away</i> (PN), attention directed toward the preferred stimulus (P<sup>att</sup>N), or directed toward the non-preferred stimulus (PN<sup>att</sup>). The values of the model parameters for each example neuron are shown on the right. Note that these parameter values correspond to spike counts in a 250\u00a0ms window and should be multiplied by four to obtain spikes/s. This neuron's response is suppressed when a non-preferred stimulus is added to a preferred stimulus (P vs. PN). The model accounts for this difference because the non-preferred stimulus induces few excitation (small <i>L<sub>2</sub></i>) but large enough suppression (\u03b1<sub>2</sub>). So suppression dominates over excitation. The model also captures the strong attention modulation (P<sup>att</sup>N vs. PN<sup>att</sup>) through the \u03b2 parameter, which multiplies the excitatory drive (<i>L</i>) and suppressive drive (\u03b1) of the attended stimulus. By increasing the weight of both drives, attention effectively focuses on the inputs related to the attended stimuli, as if the inputs from other stimuli were attenuated. So attention to a weak stimulus decreases the response, while attention to a strong stimulus increases the response (i.e. attention modulation).

Similar to these previous studies, we reproduced the above findings using the data from conditions with low spatial selectivity. When attention shifted between stimuli at two approximately-equally responsive cRF positions (less than 2 spike/s response difference when each of two cRF positions is stimulated with an identical single stimulus), similar effects were observed (main effect of orientation selectivity: p&lt;0.001; main effect suppression: p=0.7; interaction between feature selectivity and suppression: p=0.02; multiple linear regression)."

We found similar attention-related modulations using Gabor pairs consisting of identical Gabor stimuli presented at various cRF positions. Note that in this situation selectivity to the component Gabors of a Gabor pair originates solely from a neuron's spatial preferences (receptive field), because the Gabors are identical. All of the above findings were replicated using only the data obtained with Gabor pairs consisting of identical Gabors (main effect spatial selectivity: p=4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221222</sup>; main effect suppression: p=0.29; interaction between spatial selectivity and suppression: p=6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22126</sup>; multiple linear regression). This indicates that attention-related modulation depends on a differential response to the component stimuli of a compound stimulus, regardless of the origin of the response difference (feature or spatial). Accordingly, at their most abstract level, models of neuronal attention modulation only need to account for the responses arising from different component stimuli, whether they arise from preferences for specific stimulus features, preferences for certain parts of the receptive field, or both."

We found that stimulus selectivity and stimulus-induced suppression strongly interact to determine the magnitude of attention modulation in neurons. This interaction determined attention modulation within both the classical receptive field and the surround, indicating that remarkably similar principles drive attention modulation inside the center and surrounding regions of the receptive field. A spatially-tuned normalization model, fitted to the responses of individual neurons, captured the dependency of attention modulation on both stimulus selectivity and suppression, and provided an excellent account of how attention operates across different regions of the receptive field, with either single or multiple stimuli shown inside. Each stimulus configuration induced variable amounts of excitation and suppression in different neurons, depending on the receptive field position of the stimuli. Attention operates on this variable excitation and suppression, thereby explaining why the magnitude of attention-related modulations varies so widely across neurons."

It is important to note that this strong correlation is not a general property of spatial summation in visual cortex. Instead, the correlation they observed likely arose from the experimental design used in that study. Specifically, for each neuron Reynolds and colleagues presented different stimulus pairs that fell on two locations that were always chosen to lie well within the cRF at similar distances from the receptive field center. The authors kept the stimulus at one location fixed (reference stimulus), but varied the orientation and color of the stimulus at the second location. But varying the orientation and color of a stimulus, but not its location, varies predominantly the excitation and not the suppression to the neuron (see Appendix; we found no evidence for orientation-tuned suppression in our data). Consequently, both the selectivity and the stimulus-induced suppression index varied with a single variable, the strength of the second stimulus relative to the strength of the fixed stimulus. This explains the strong correlation between stimulus selectivity and suppression in that study. In contrast, we presented stimuli at locations across both the classical and surrounding receptive field, allowing both stimulus-induced excitation and suppression to vary across stimulus configurations. This is the primary reason for the difference between the studies. The variable reference stimulus across neurons in Reynolds et al., and the slightly different indices used in the two studies will have further amplified the differences in findings in both studies. Hence, under more general stimulus conditions wherein stimuli can fall on any receptive field location, stimulus selectivity and stimulus-induced suppression are not correlated."

Shifting attention between a strong and a weak stimulus, each presented at different receptive-field locations, changes which neuronal inputs are emphasized, thereby causing neuronal-response modulations. However, we show that such clear-cut differential processing only occurs if the weaker stimulus also induces strong suppression: without suppression, attention has no leverage to amplify input differences. The spatially-tuned normalization model captures the dependency of attention-related modulation on both selectivity and suppression, and does so for neurons with stimuli in either the cRF or the surround."

This comparison is crucial to determine whether the neuronal effects of attention differ between the cRF and the surround.

Two of the more elaborate models explicitly assumed that attention acts on a specific receptive-field structure, namely one that encompasses a relatively narrow excitatory field in addition to a wider suppressive field (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ghose, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</a>). This receptive-field structure is based on findings from primary visual cortex (V1) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cavanaugh et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sceniak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">DeAngelis et al., 1994</a>). It is important to note, however, that none of these studies empirically tested if attention actually operates on the spatially-varying excitation and suppression implied by such a receptive field structure. We started with a spatially-tuned normalization model that made no assumptions about the structure of excitation and suppression in the receptive field of V4 neurons. Furthermore, and in contrast to the earlier-mentioned studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ghose, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</a>), we explicitly fitted models to the responses of individual neurons to test relationships with the underlying receptive field structure. Interestingly, this naive model reveals that the receptive field organization of V4 neurons strongly resembles that of V1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cavanaugh et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sceniak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">DeAngelis et al., 1994</a>): both excitation and suppression are maximal near the receptive-field center, but excitation is more spatially concentrated, while suppression stretches over larger distances. These findings suggest that similar receptive field organizations can be found throughout different stages of visual cortex. Importantly, our findings show that attention operates uniformly across the spatially-varying excitation and suppression of a receptive field: throughout the receptive field, including the surround, attention-related modulations of neuronal responses is governed by very similar normalization rules."

We also show that the origin of the stimulus-induced excitation is not important for determining the magnitude of attention modulation: we found no distinction between excitation related to a neuron's feature tuning (i.e. orientation tuning) or spatial tuning (i.e. receptive field). What matters for neuronal attention modulation is stimulus-induced excitation, regardless of its origin, in conjunction with spatially-tuned suppression. It follows that when a particular stimulus configuration induces variable amounts of excitation and suppression in different neurons, attention-related modulations will vary across these neurons."

For instance, with a given number of stimuli presented inside the receptive field, attention to a preferred stimulus shown inside the center of the receptive field typically has the greatest potential to elevate neuronal responses. This is true not only because stimuli near the receptive field center generally elicit most excitation, but also because such stimuli are most likely to induce the greatest suppression. The elevated suppression by center stimuli gives them more weight in normalization mechanisms as it allows them to better discount the suppressive influences from other simultaneously presented stimuli. Similarly, attention to a weak stimulus inside the receptive field center will in general reduce responses more than attention to a weak stimulus elsewhere in the receptive field, including the surround. This does not mean that stimuli in the surround, which induce relatively less suppression, have little impact on attention modulation. Indeed, because the surround is so much larger than the cRF it can contribute considerable suppression. Such strong surround suppression likely occurs under natural viewing conditions where stimuli are shown throughout the visual field, many of them covering the surround (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ozeki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Haider et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coen-Cagli et al., 2015</a>).

Note that the stimulus-induced suppression index is distinct from the <math id=\"inf9\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math>\u00a0terms in the model. This is because the stimulus-induced suppression index is based on the observed neuronal responses, which comprise both an <math id=\"inf10\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> and <i>L</i> term (i.e. response = <i>L/(</i><math id=\"inf11\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math>+<math id=\"inf12\"><mi>\u03c3</mi></math>)). In terms of the model parameters, the stimulus-induced suppression index is given by:"

Similarly, the main effect of suppression measures the contribution of suppression to attention modulation given that selectivity is zero. For example, if suppression is zero, the suppression and the\u00a0interaction term (selectivity \u00d7 suppression \u00d7 \u03b2<sub>3</sub>) both go to zero, leaving only the selectivity term \u03b2<sub>1</sub>, which specifies the contribution of selectivity to attention modulation. Conversely, if selectivity is zero, the only non-zero term is the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> term, which specifies the contribution of suppression to attention modulation. Thus the main effects are not estimated from a particular selection or a\u00a0subset of the dataset, but follow mathematically from the linear regression model with interaction term.

The spatially-tuned normalization model is described by <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation (1)</a>. This spatially-tuned normalization model was fitted to the neuronal responses of all 728 neurons used in the analyses. The model parameters are: <i>L<sub>11</sub>, L<sub>12</sub>, L<sub>21</sub>, L<sub>22</sub>, L<sub>31</sub>, L<sub>32</sub></i>, <i>\u03b1<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>\u03b1<sub>3</sub></i>, <i>\u03c3</i>, <i>\u03b2</i>. Specifically, <i>L<sub>ij</sub></i> (adopted from <i>linear</i> response) is the excitatory drive from a stimulus of orientation <i>j (j</i> = 1, 2) at receptive-field location <i>i (i</i> = 1, 2, 3). <i>\u03b1<sub>p</sub> </i>is the suppression parameter associated with stimulated receptive-field location p=1, 2, 3). <i>\u03b2</i> adds attention to the model and is multiplied with the parameters associated with the attended location (<i>L</i> and <i>\u03b1;</i> see Results and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In the conditions with attention directed away from the receptive fields (<i>attend away) \u03b2 = 1\u00a0</i>(see <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation (1)</a>). <i>\u03c3</i> is the semi-saturation constant that is fixed across conditions and serves as a baseline suppression parameter. The <i>\u03c3</i> parameter was introduced in Heeger's (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heeger, 1992</a>) original divisive normalization model to model the shape of contrast-response functions of neurons in primary visual cortex. It also stabilized the response when stimuli of low (or zero) contrast are presented by preventing division by zero. For our data, which involve only high-contrast stimuli, it represents baseline suppression, which may arise from spontaneously active inhibitory neurons or suppression caused by constant stimuli (e.g. the edge of the stimulus display) visible to the monkey. It is an important parameter to accommodate the neuronal effects of attention to single stimuli inside the receptive field (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A vs. B</a>: P vs. P<sup>att</sup>). The median value of the sigma parameter was 0.06 (median absolute deviation (MAD): 0.26). A model with no sigma term performs significantly worse at explaining responses to isolated attended stimuli (median two-fold cross-validated percentage explained variance 84%, compared to 87% for the model with sigma term; p=0.006; sequential F-test). We also fit for each neuron a model with only one free excitatory (<i>L</i>) term capturing excitation across all stimulus conditions. This model with one <i>L</i> term performed significantly worse at explaining neuronal responses than the full model with all <i>L</i>-terms (median two-fold cross-validated percentage explained variance 48%, compared to 87% for the model with all <i>L</i> terms; p&lt;0.0001; sequential F-test)."

All parameters were constrained to be nonnegative. For each neuron, the model was fitted to the neuronal responses of 36 distinct attention and stimulus combinations by minimizing the sum of squared error using a simplex optimization algorithm (MATLAB fminsearch.m; MathWorks). The goodness-of-fit of the model was calculated for each neuron as the percentage explained variance, which was determined by taking the square of the correlation coefficient between the model-predicted responses and the observed neuronal responses across all stimulus conditions. The explained variance was calculated using the average neuronal responses from trials not used to fit the model. For this purpose, we employed two-fold cross-validation, fitting the model based on half of the randomly-chosen trials, and using the remaining data to measure the goodness of fit of the model. This procedure was repeated five times, each time using a different random draw, and subsequently averaged across all cross-validations to produce the reported goodness-of-fit."

These receptive fields were modeled as a circular two-dimensional Gaussian with a standard deviation of eight pixels for the excitatory field and 40 pixels for the suppressive field. The model neurons computed local contrast within their excitatory and suppressive receptive field. The excitatory input was divisively normalized by the suppressive input to generate the model neuron's response. Model neurons without a surround experienced no suppression from stimuli positioned outside their classical receptive field. The classical receptive field was defined as all pixels within 16 pixels, i.e. two standard deviations from the excitatory receptive field, from the receptive-field center. Attention was modeled as a circular two-dimensional Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of five pixels and amplitude equal to six. Attention weighed the excitatory and suppressive inputs with its kernel, resulting in stronger responses of the model neurons near the locus of attention relative to model neurons outside the locus of attention."

In the spatially-tuned normalization model, the <i>L</i> and <math id=\"inf17\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> terms are independent of each other. However the <math id=\"inf18\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> terms are fixed at each RF location. Consequently, varying only the stimulus at one RF location, while keeping the other stimulus fixed, corresponds to keeping <i>L<sub>1</sub>, \u03b1<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>\u03b1<sub>2</sub></i> fixed. Here, <i>L<sub>1</sub></i> is the excitatory drive from the fixed stimulus, <i>\u03b1<sub>1</sub></i> is the suppressive drive from the fixed stimulus, and <i>\u03b1<sub>2</sub></i> is the suppressive drive from stimulating the RF location from the variable stimulus. Thus <i>L<sub>2</sub></i>, the excitatory drive from the variable stimulus, is the only variable that varies when different stimuli are presented at that RF location. The variable <i>L<sub>2</sub></i> term changes both the selectivity and suppression indices in similar ways. In model terms, this can be seen as:"

The paper is also beautifully written. Verhoef and Maunsell performed array recordings in macaque to study the effects of attention on stimuli either inside the classical receptive field of a neuron or in the surround. They show that attention acts uniformly on the response of neurons by amplifying the effect of the attended stimulus, i.e. increasing the response for the preferred stimulus and exacerbating the suppression for a non-preferred stimulus, regardless of whether it is in the classical RF or the surround, and regardless whether the preferred stimulus is preferred due to its location in the RF or its orientation. Importantly, they found that selectivity and suppression strength are not correlated, and an interaction between selectivity and suppression strength is needed to predict the attention modulation strength, which could be accounted for by a fitting a model where attention has a multiplicative effect on both the excitatory input and the normalization strength of the attended stimulus. This showed that the effect of attention is the same for classical receptive fields as the surround receptive field."

But can you show from your data that feature selectivity alone can reproduce your results (e.g. look at conditions where neuron has low spatial selectivity, i.e. the neurons response is the same if you present the same stimulus at one of two locations; or by pairwise comparisons of different stimuli at the same locations)?"

The authors were interested in comparing attentional modulation under conditions where two Gabor stimuli were placed within the classical receptive field versus conditions where one Gabor was placed within the classical receptive field and the second Gabor was placed in the adjacent region of the extraclassical surround. They observed a variety of attentional modulations in both conditions and they found that attentional modulation correlates with stimulus selectivity and also with stimulus-induced suppression in both conditions. Importantly, the relationships between attentional modulation and stimulus selectivity and induced suppression were complicated as stimulus selectivity and induced suppression were not themselves correlated among the recorded neuronal population. Instead, attentional modulation was greatest when selectivity was high and stimulus-induced suppression was also high. The authors then proposed a normalization model that nicely accounts for these relationships. Two aspects of this study were particularly novel and interesting."

In the Introduction, the authors state that \"the way that attention acts in the cRF versus the surround has not been compared directly\" and they cite the work of Sundberg et al. (2009) and Sanayei et al. (2015), both of which examined attentional modulation of responses to visual stimuli within the classical receptive field and the extraclassical surround. In the Sundberg et al. study, the stimuli were similar and similarly placed in the receptive field relative to the current study. The authors' statement therefore seems inaccurate. But additionally, the authors never directly compare their findings with those of Sundberg et al. and Sanayei et al. If the authors are going to make the case that their work overturns or expands upon that of prior groups, then this needs to be explicitly described in the Introduction and/or Discussion."

In the Abstract and Introduction the authors relate their work to the rich literature on relative contributions of classical and extraclassical regions of the receptive field. The data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> indicate that there is actually very little surround suppression observed in the sRF-cRF condition. The authors are aware of this and use careful wording (stimulus-induced suppression) and they include <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> to illustrate that the stimulus-induced suppression they observe is qualitatively similar to surround suppression measured previously. But throughout the study, the results are consistent across the cRF-cRF and sRF-cRF conditions. The authors interpret this finding as evidence that attention acts uniformly across both the center and surround of the receptive field. But another possible explanation is that surround suppression was never in fact activated by the stimulus configurations used and thus contributions of the extraclassical surround were not accurately assessed."

First, the stimulus configuration of two adjacent Gabors may not be ideal for activating surround suppression in V4 neurons because the stimuli are not covering large enough extents of the center or surround. Second, and perhaps more importantly, if recordings are multi-unit rather than single-unit measurements, this will underestimate the extent of surround suppression. The electrodes used in this study are similar to those used previously by the Maunsell group and prior studies often reported data from multi-unit rather than single-unit recordings. Low impedance electrodes, such as those reported here, are not optimal for recording well-isolated single units. Quantities of well-isolated single-unit versus multi-unit recordings used for the analyses are not reported. Given that surround suppression will vary depending on the type of neuronal activity recorded, it would be helpful to see an example of well-isolated single units and to have a quantification of the number of single-unit versus multi-unit recordings that were utilized for each measurement involving stimulus-induced suppression."

Their main empirical finding is that attention modulation (change in response when attention is shifted between two stimuli in or near the receptive field) is a function not only of selectivity (difference in response to the two stimuli presented individually) but also suppression (reduction of response to the preferred stimulus when the non-preferred stimulus is added) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Moreover, they argue that selectivity and suppression interact to determine the strength of attention effects, and that attention modulation is weak or absent if either is low (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). They fit a model incorporating selectivity and suppressive effects to each neuron. Based on the fitting results, they argue that the strength of attentional modulation is entirely determined by selectivity combined with suppression, and that attention is a uniform multiplier interacting with these terms."

The Discussion mentions that attentional modulation depends in part on the suppression value at the location of the driving stimulus. How could the model capture that value if it is always fixed? Alpha2 can vary, and must be near 0 for cases where suppression is low (in order to produce equivalent responses when the non-preferred stimulus is added). But if alpha1 is always equal to 1, a low alpha2 value actually contributes to larger attentional modulation, i.e. a larger difference between response with attention at location 1 and response with attention at location 2. This would be the opposite of the empirical finding that low suppression results in low attentional modulation.

The variance explained values are extremely high, but I would guess this is because most of the response variance depends on differences in stimulus type and location (rather than attention), and the model fits a separate excitatory value for each stimulus type/location combination and a separate suppression value for each location. With all these separate terms, high variance explained seems guaranteed, even with cross-validation, since fitting all these terms requires that the training set contains all stimulus type/location combinations and all suppression locations. (The manuscript does not specify how training and testing conditions were divided.) The variance due to attention is a small fraction of overall response variance, less than 10% based on <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> (and on average modulation at median suppression shown in 4E,F), and variability in attention effects across stimulus conditions looks even smaller. Thus, in most cases the individual models could get attention effects completely backwards and still produce high average variance explained values.

The authors effectively confirm this by showing that the fitted attention parameter is unnecessary for the high variance explained results."

Even at a fixed location, it seems L1, L2, alpha1, and alpha2 are independent in theory, and selectivity and suppression could be uncorrelated. Furthermore, as shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, excitation and suppression fall off at independent rates with distance from RF center, and presumably Reynolds sampled a variety of locations wrt RF center. Thus the authors need to clarify and explain precisely the statement in the quotation marks above (preferably with reference to equations). Are the authors claiming that Eq1 logically implies that suppression and selectivity should be correlated when measured in the manner of Reynolds? Related to this, it would be helpful if the authors actually analyzed the subset of their data corresponding to Reynold's paper, and show that they can reproduce the correlation between suppression and selectivity of that paper."

My main point had simply been that these were both extremely high values, and this is due to the fact that the number of terms in the model is on the same order as the number of conditions, so a close fit is not surprising or informative in either case. The cross-validation does not change this because, given the low number of conditions and the description now given in methods, it amounts to simply splitting repetitions from identical trial types into two groups and proving they give the same result. I don't think the 87% explained variance with the full model or the 8% drop in explained variance by themselves establish that \"attention acts uniformly across the cRF and the surround\". (The exceedingly close fits are due to the similar number of terms and conditions; the 8% drop shows that the attention term mattered, but it doesn't address how exactly attention behaved.) Nor, as explained above, do I think this is established by visual similarity between <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a> or the linear regression analysis. As stated above, I think the direct test of this proposition would be a statistical comparison of 5A and 5B.

Alpha2 can vary, and must be near 0 for cases where suppression is low (in order to produce equivalent responses when the non-preferred stimulus is added). But if alpha1 is always equal to 1, a low alpha2 value actually contributes to larger attentional modulation, i.e. a larger difference between response with attention at location 1 and response with attention at location 2.

The variance explained values are extremely high, but I would guess this is because most of the response variance depends on differences in stimulus type and location (rather than attention), and the model fits a separate excitatory value for each stimulus type/location combination and a separate suppression value for each location. With all these separate terms, high variance explained seems guaranteed, even with cross-validation, since fitting all these terms requires that the training set contains all stimulus type/location combinations and all suppression locations. (The manuscript does not specify how training and testing conditions were divided.) The variance due to attention is a small fraction of overall response variance, less than 10% based on <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> (and on average modulation at median suppression shown in 4E,F), and variability in attention effects across stimulus conditions looks even smaller. Thus, in most cases the individual models could get attention effects completely backwards and still produce high average variance explained values. That seems quite possible, since the fitting procedure will be driven primarily by the large variance between stimulus conditions. The authors effectively confirm this by showing that the fitted attention parameter is unnecessary for the high variance explained results.</i> "

This is also because the responses of some neurons were little affected by attention (see neurons with weak selectivity and suppression in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>), producing small decreases in explained variance when leaving out the \u03b2 parameter. Other neurons' responses were strongly affected by attention (see neurons with strong selectivity and suppression in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>) and a model with no \u03b2 parameter explained up to 50% of the variance less than a model with \u03b2 parameter. Our results show that the magnitude of attention modulation, and thus how much of the response variance is explained by attention and \u03b2, varies with suppression and selectivity. Thus the critical test of the model lies in its ability to explain the full range of attention modulations across the range of observed suppression and selectivity. We show that the model does an excellent job of fitting the observed attention modulations across the full range of selectivity and suppression values and in different stimulus and receptive field conditions. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a> plot attention modulation vs. selectivity in both RF configurations. The light grey values in these plots represent the average attention modulations predicted by the model and show that the model precisely captures these trends in the population of neurons across the full range of selectivity values. Similarly <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a> show (light grey values) that the model also precisely captures how attention modulation varies with stimulus-induced suppression in the population of neurons across the full range of suppression indices. In addition, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a> show that the model captures attention modulation in the population of neurons within the entire space created by the selectivity and suppression induces, i.e. the model clearly predicts the interaction, and does so very similar to the observed data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Aand B</a> . Finally, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> shows that the model precisely reproduces the average attention modulation within the population of neurons in the conditions where single stimuli are presented at different RF locations.

If <i>\u03b1<sub>1</sub></i> (= 1) corresponds to the non-preferred stimulus then a low <i>\u03b1<sub>2</sub></i> (i.e. the <i>\u03b1</i> corresponding to the preferred stimulus) will indeed cause more attention modulation. This is because the non-preferred stimulus has the greatest <i>\u03b1</i>, so that when the non-preferred stimulus is added to the preferred stimulus it will decrease the neuronal response (<i>\u03b1<sub>1</sub></i> is relatively high, but <i>L<sub>1</sub></i> is low), and attention can amplify or weaken this suppression. If the small <i>\u03b1<sub>2</sub></i> corresponds to the non-preferred stimulus, there will instead be little attention modulation.

We included the p-values of the main effects for completeness, although these effects are clearly small (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). One option would be to mention the regression coefficients in the main text. However, as is known from the statistical regression literature, regression coefficients of main effects become hard to interpret in the context of interactions. This is because the coefficients of the main-effects cannot be interpreted without considering the coefficient of the interaction. Furthermore, the interaction can completely dominate a main effect, because the dependent variable grows non-linearly due to the interaction, as is apparent in our data for high values of the selectivity and suppression indices (upper right corner <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Thus including the regression coefficients is probably more confusing than elucidating."

The cross-validation does not change this because, given the low number of conditions and the description now given in methods, it amounts to simply splitting repetitions from identical trial types into two groups and proving they give the same result.

In other words, attention modulation as a function of selectivity and suppression does not differ significantly between the cRF and the surround. Note that this is a direct test of the hypothesis that attention modulation as a function of selectivity and suppression is the same in the cRF and surround, without appeal to goodness of model fits. We emphasize that classical statistical tests (i.e. direct tests) are not designed to test the veracity of a null-hypothesis such as, in our case, identical attention modulation in the CRF and the surround: a non-significant p-value provides little information about the truthfulness of the null hypothesis. This is why we also included a Bayesian test, which does not suffer from this drawback."

In any case, the changes in the attention term depend on a complex interaction between the specific neuron, stimulus conditions and the type of the omitted parameter.
