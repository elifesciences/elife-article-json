In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate, while sister chromatids remain together. Determining how this unusual chromosome segregation behavior is established is central to understanding germ cell development. Here we show that preventing microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I is essential for establishing the meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern. Premature interactions of kinetochores with microtubules transform meiosis I into a mitosis-like division by disrupting two key meiosis I events: coorientation of sister kinetochores and protection of centromeric cohesin removal from chromosomes. Furthermore we find that restricting outer kinetochore assembly contributes to preventing premature engagement of microtubules with kinetochores. We propose that inhibition of microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I is central to establishing the unique meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern."

In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate, while sister chromatids remain together. Determining how this unusual chromosome segregation behavior is established is central to understanding germ cell development. Here we show that preventing microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I is essential for establishing the meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern. Premature interactions of kinetochores with microtubules transform meiosis I into a mitosis-like division by disrupting two key meiosis I events: coorientation of sister kinetochores and protection of centromeric cohesin removal from chromosomes. Furthermore we find that restricting outer kinetochore assembly contributes to preventing premature engagement of microtubules with kinetochores. We propose that inhibition of microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I is central to establishing the unique meiosis I chromosome segregation pattern."

Humans, for example, have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the chromosomes within each pair are said to be homologous because they are similar to each other in a number of ways, including length and shape. When it comes time for one of these cells to duplicate, each chromosome is first replicated to generate a pair of identical chromosomes called sister chromatids, which subsequently separate in a cell division process known as mitosis to produce two identical daughter cells."

During meiotic cell division, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of nuclear division called meiosis I and meiosis II.

The other end of each microtubule is attached to a structure that is called a centrosome in human cells and a spindle pole body in yeast cells. Human cells have two centrosomes, which reside on the opposite poles of the cell, and likewise for the spindle pole bodies in yeast cells. In mitotic cells and in meiosis II, microtubules attach to kinetochores in a way that means the sister chromatids are pulled apart. During meiosis I, on the other hand, they attach to kinetochores in a manner so the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart."

They found that premature interactions resulted in the separation of sister chromatids (as happens in mitosis) rather than the separation of homologous chromosomes, as is supposed to happen in meiosis I. They also showed that cells prevent such premature interactions by dismantling the outer regions of the kinetochore and reducing the levels of enzymes called CDKs in the cell. These results demonstrate that preventing premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions is essential for establishing a meiosis I-specific chromosome architecture, and they also provide fresh insights into how the molecular machinery that is responsible for mitotic chromosome segregation can be modulated to achieve meiosis."

This task is especially complex in meiosis, the cell division used by sexually reproducing organisms to generate gametes. The goal of meiosis is to reduce the genome content by half such that proper ploidy is maintained upon fusion of gametes. To achieve this, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of nuclear division called meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I homologous chromosomes segregate. Meiosis II resembles mitosis in that sister chromatids segregate from each other. The establishment of this specialized chromosome segregation pattern requires three changes that modulate how chromosomes interact with each other and with the microtubule cytoskeleton: (1) reciprocal recombination between homologous chromosomes, (2) the way linkages between sister chromatids, known as sister-chromatid cohesion, are removed from chromosomes and (3) the manner in which chromosomes attach to the meiotic spindle."

Subsequent repair of DSBs by crossover recombination generates physical linkages between homologous chromosomes. This, in turn, allows homologs to attach to the meiosis I spindle such that each homolog interacts with microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. As a result, homologous chromosomes biorient on the meiosis I spindle. The spindle assembly checkpoint prevents the onset of chromosome segregation until this process is completed. Once each pair of homologs is bioriented, checkpoint signaling ceases and anaphase entry ensues. A ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome and its specificity factor Cdc20 (APC/C-Cdc20) targets Securin for degradation, relieving Separase inhibition (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cohen-Fix et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ciosk et al., 1998</a>). Separase is a protease that cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin, the protein complex that mediates sister-chromatid cohesion (<a href=\"#bib53\">Uhlmann et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schleiffer et al., 2003</a>). In meiosis I, cleavage of cohesin at chromosome arms allows homologs to segregate (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buonomo et al., 2000</a>). However, cohesin around the centromeres is protected from cleavage during meiosis I, which is essential for the accurate segregation of sister chromatids during meiosis II. Protection of centromeric cohesin is accomplished by preventing phosphorylation of Rec8, the meiosis-specific kleisin. This occurs, at least in part, by Sgo1 (MEI-S332)-dependent recruitment of the protein phosphatase PP2A to centromeric regions where it antagonizes Rec8 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kerrebrock et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Katis et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kitajima et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Riedel et al., 2006</a>)."

In meiosis I, kinetochores of sister chromatid pairs (henceforth sister kinetochores) attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole, a process called sister kinetochore coorientation. During meiosis II, as during mitosis, sister kinetochores attach to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles and are thus bioriented (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib36\">Marston and Amon, 2004</a>). In budding yeast, sister kinetochore coorientation is brought about by the monopolin complex, which consists of Mam1, Lrs4, Csm1 and the casein kinase 1, Hrr25 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Toth et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rabitsch et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Petronczki et al., 2006</a>). Lrs4 and Csm1 localize to the nucleolus during interphase. During exit from pachytene, a stage of prophase I, Lrs4 and Csm1 associate with Mam1 and Hrr25 at kinetochores, a process that requires the Polo kinase Cdc5 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clyne et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee and Amon, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Matos et al., 2008</a>).

This, in turn, disrupts both sister kinetochore coorientation and protection of centromeric cohesin during meiosis I, revealing that the temporal control of microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions is essential for meiosis I chromosome morphogenesis. Furthermore, we define the mechanism by which premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions are prevented; through regulation of cyclin-CDK activity and of outer kinetochore assembly.

Expression from the <i>GAL1-10</i> promoter led to Clb3 accumulation in meiosis I to levels that are comparable to those seen in meiosis II in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carlile and Amon, 2008</a>). However, estrogen interferes with meiotic progression when added during early stages of sporulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To circumvent this problem we utilized the copper-inducible <i>CUP1</i> promoter to drive Clb3 expression. Expression from the <i>CUP1</i> promoter led to approximately fivefold higher levels of Clb3 protein compared to expression from the <i>GAL1-10</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To examine the consequences of the two <i>CLB3</i> constructs on chromosome segregation we used <i>GAL-CLB3</i> and <i>CUP-CLB3</i> strains in which one of the two homologs of chromosome III was marked by integrating a tandem array of tetO sequences \u223c20 kb from CENIII (heterozygous LEU2-GFP dots). These cells also expressed a tetR-GFP fusion, which allowed visualization of the tetO arrays (<a href=\"#bib38\">Michaelis et al., 1997</a>). The analysis of GFP dot segregation during the first meiotic division revealed that despite the difference in Clb3 protein levels, the extent of sister chromatid segregation in meiosis I was similar between <i>GAL-CLB3</i> and <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This finding indicates that expression of Clb3 from either the <i>CUP1</i> or <i>GAL1-10</i> promoter efficiently induces sister chromatid segregation during meiosis I. Furthermore, the timing of when Clb3 is expressed, rather than the amount of Clb3 present, appears to be the primary determinant of this phenotype. Based on this observation and the finding that all four cyclins showed equal expression when produced from the <i>CUP1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) we utilized the <i>CUP1</i> promoter for most subsequent analyses."

We first asked whether misexpression of various cyclins is sufficient to induce spindle formation in cells arrested in pachytene of prophase I, due to lack of the transcription factor Ndt80 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Xu et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chu and Herskowitz, 1998</a>). We induced cyclin expression from the <i>CUP1</i> promoter 135 min after the induction of sporulation when typically 40\u201365% of the cells have replicated their DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>) and examined spindle pole body (SPB, centrosome equivalent in budding yeast) separation and spindle morphology following induction. As expected, wild-type cells did not form spindles in the absence of <i>NDT80</i> function. Expression of <i>CLB5</i> from the <i>CUP1</i> promoter did not lead to SPB separation and spindle formation either, although expression of <i>CLB5</i> in the prophase I arrest led to a significant increase in total CDK activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1F and 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, <i>CUP-CLB1</i>, <i>CUP-CLB3</i> and <i>CUP-CLB4</i> cells separated SPBs and formed bipolar spindles, shortly after copper addition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar results were observed in cells with intact <i>NDT80</i> (data not shown). We conclude that expression of <i>CLB1</i>, <i>CLB3</i> or <i>CLB4</i> is sufficient to promote bipolar spindle assembly in <i>NDT80</i>-depleted cells."

In wild-type and <i>CUP-CLB5</i> cells, sister kinetochores remained closely associated with each other and did not appear to be tightly associated with SPBs, consistent with the observation that these cells failed to form a spindle. In contrast, we observed dynamic separation of heterozygous CENV-GFP dots upon expression of <i>CLB1</i> or <i>CLB3</i>, with sister kinetochores frequently splitting and coming together (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>).

Cdc28-associated kinase activity was low during prophase I and increased more than 25-fold during metaphase I/anaphase I in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Expression of all four cyclins led to a significant increase in total CDK activity in prophase I (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), but importantly, the degree of increase did not correlate with the ability to induce sister chromatid splitting in the <i>NDT80</i> arrest. For example, Clb1 expression led to a similar increase in Cdc28-associated kinase activity as expression of Clb4, yet Clb1 induced sister chromatid splitting whereas Clb4 did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1F and 2B,C</a>). We conclude that the ability to induce sister chromatid splitting does not correlate with total CDK activity produced by the various <i>CUP-CLB</i> fusions. Furthermore, SPB separation and spindle formation are not sufficient to induce microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions. Events that can be triggered by Clb1 and Clb3, but not Clb4 are also necessary to promote attachments sufficient to generate tension. Determining why <i>CLB4</i> expressing cells fail to form productive microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions could provide important insights into substrate specificity of cyclin-CDK complexes."

In contrast, <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells segregated sister chromatids immediately after Pds1 degradation (median = 7 min after Pds1 degradation; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These results demonstrate that <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells segregate sister chromatids during the first meiotic division. Thus, <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells must be defective in two key aspects of meiosis I chromosome segregation: coorientation of sister kinetochores and maintenance of centromeric cohesion. We note that another essential aspect of meiosis I chromosome segregation, homologous recombination, was not affected by premature <i>CLB3</i> expression. We observed no major defects in DSB formation, synaptonemal complex assembly and generation of recombination products, nor did preventing homologous recombination affect the phenotypes caused by premature <i>CLB3</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 5\u20138</a>)."

In contrast, Rec8 was not detected around centromeres in a substantial fraction of binucleate <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Functional assays confirmed the defect in centromeric cohesion maintenance in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells. Although <i>mam1\u2206</i> cells biorient sister chromatids during meiosis I, they delay nuclear division until meiosis II due to the presence of centromeric cohesin (<a href=\"#bib50\">Toth et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rabitsch et al., 2003</a>). The delay in nuclear division of a <i>mam1\u2206</i> was partially alleviated by the expression of <i>CUP-CLB3</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This partial effect is likely due to not all <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells losing centromeric cohesion prematurely in meiosis I (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

The two phospho-specific antibodies immunoprecipitated similar amounts of Rec8 in wild-type and <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells at the arm site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), which is consistent with arm cohesin being primed for Separase cleavage. However, the amount of phosphorylated Rec8 was increased at the centromere in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells compared to wild-type cells, albeit not to the same extent as in cells depleted for Sgo1 (<i>sgo1-mn</i>), in which meiosis I centromeric-cohesin protection is completely defective (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

However, this reduction during anaphase I is most likely a consequence rather than a cause of premature loss of centromeric cohesin. In cells expressing a phosphomimetic version of Rec8 (<i>rec8-4D</i>) that cannot be retained at centromeres beyond meiosis I, Rts1 localization is also reduced in anaphase I (<a href=\"#fig4s11\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 11</a>). It is thus unlikely that the reduction of Sgo1 and Rts1 at centromeres during anaphase I contributes to the premature loss of centromeric cohesin. These findings, together with our observation that centromeric Rec8 phosphorylation is increased in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells, indicate that Sgo1-PP2A function, but not localization, is impaired in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells."

The comparison of the effects caused by <i>CLB3</i> and <i>CLB4</i> misexpression provided insight into this question. Both cyclins induce spindle formation in prophase I. However, chromosomes are able to attach to this spindle and experience pulling forces only in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells. Thus, the ability to form tension-generating attachments (i.e. <i>CUP-CLB1</i> or <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells) correlates with defects in meiosis I chromosome morphogenesis and segregation. This correlation suggests that premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore engagement during premeiotic S phase/early prophase I is the underlying cause of chromosome missegregation in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells and predicts that tension generating microtubule\u2013kinetochore attachments should inhibit meiosis I chromosome morphogenesis.

However, when cells are allowed to form microtubule\u2013kinetochore attachments prior to <i>CDC5</i> and <i>MAM1</i> expression, cosegregation of sister chromatids is prevented. We reversibly arrested cells in metaphase using a methionine repressible <i>CDC20</i> allele (<i>MET-CDC20</i>) and induced <i>MAM1</i> and <i>CDC5</i> expression after cells had arrested in metaphase and had formed microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions.

To test this, we used a temperature sensitive allele of <i>NDC80</i> (<i>ndc80-1</i>), which encodes a component of the outer kinetochore. <i>ndc80-1</i> cells grow and sporulate normally at 25\u00b0C, but fail to undergo any nuclear divisions at temperatures above 34\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Using the <i>NDT80</i> block-release system, we induced cells to sporulate at 25\u00b0C. After 165 min, we induced cyclin expression and concurrently transferred cells to 34\u00b0C to inactivate the <i>ndc80-1</i> allele. Cells were then incubated for an additional 135 min to arrest them in the <i>NDT80-</i>depletion block. We then transferred cells to the permissive temperature and released them from the <i>NDT80</i> block into a metaphase I-arrest by depleting <i>CDC20</i> (<i>cdc20-mn</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Under these conditions, wild-type and <i>ndc80-1</i> cells arrested in metaphase I with the monopolin subunit Lrs4 localized to kinetochores, while <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells showed a defect in Lrs4 localization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Remarkably, <i>CUP-CLB3 ndc80-1</i> cells showed near wild-type levels of Lrs4 association with kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Transient inactivation of <i>Ndc80</i> also restored Lrs4 phosphorylation in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Our results demonstrate that premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions prevent sister kinetochore coorientation by disrupting proper localization of the monopolin complex. The finding that transient disruption of microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions also suppresses the Lrs4 phosphorylation defect of <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells, furthermore suggests that Lrs4 hyperphosphorylation occurs not at the time of nucleolar release, but once Lrs4 localizes to kinetochores."

Remarkably, disrupting microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions at the time of Clb3 expression caused a considerable increase in the percentage of <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells that retained Rec8 around centromeres during anaphase I (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

We further observed a striking improvement in overall chromosome segregation and spore viability in <i>CUP-CLB3 ndc80-1</i> compared to <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). The suppression of chromosome missegregation in <i>CUP-CLB3 ndc80-1</i> cells did not depend on the spindle assembly checkpoint, because deletion of <i>MAD3</i> had no discernable effect on the extent of <i>ndc80-1</i> mediated suppression (<a href=\"#fig5s7\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 7 and 8</a>), nor was it due to the <i>ndc80-1</i> allele lowering Clb3-CDK activity (<a href=\"#fig5s9\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 9</a>). In summary, our results demonstrate that the defects associated with <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells are due to premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions.

One possibility is that <i>CLB3</i>-induced sister chromatid segregation depends on additional factors that become limiting.

This analysis revealed two major expression classes, one included kinetochore components that peak in expression prior to or during prophase I (early class), and the other contained components that instead show peak expression during the meiotic divisions (late class). The early class was enriched for inner kinetochore components (16 of 23), while the late class included primarily outer kinetochore components (13 of 18) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1\u201310</a>). The inner kinetochore binds to the centromere and generates a platform for the assembly of the outer kinetochore, which mediates microtubule attachments (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tanaka, 2010</a>). The temporal difference in expression suggests that the inner kinetochore is assembled prior to the meiotic divisions, while the outer kinetochore is constructed only as cells enter the meiotic divisions."

This decline in Ndc80 expression is consistent with a previous study in fission yeast, showing that Ndc80 becomes undetectable at kinetochores during prophase I (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asakawa et al., 2005</a>). Analysis of Ndc80 protein levels provided an explanation for why cells upregulate the synthesis of outer kinetochore components during entry into meiosis I. Ndc80 levels declined during premeiotic S phase and became undetectable during late prophase I (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Importantly, the ability of <i>CUP-CLB3</i> to induce sister-chromatid segregation during meiosis I tightly correlated with Ndc80 protein levels; as Ndc80 protein declines, so does <i>CLB3-</i>induced meiosis I sister chromatid segregation (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,E</a>)."

Our findings indicate that the assembly of the outer kinetochore is restricted prior to <i>NDT80</i> expression and pachytene exit due to low levels of a subset of outer kinetochore components."

We first assessed whether expression of the two proteins allows for the recruitment of the DASH complex to kinetochores, which occurs via delivery through microtubules and can thus be used as a means of assessing end-on attachment of kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheeseman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tanaka, 2010</a>). Cells were induced to sporulate and after 4 hr, a time when Ndc80 levels are normally diminished, we induced the expression of <i>CLB3</i>, <i>NDC80</i> and/or <i>HSK3</i>. Whereas expression of either gene alone caused only a few cells to recruit Ask1 to kinetochores, cells simultaneously expressing <i>NDC80</i>, <i>HSK3</i> and <i>CLB3</i> during prophase I showed colocalization between Ask1 and the inner kinetochore component Ndc10, to an equal or greater extent than what was observed in metaphase I-arrested wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). The difference in Ask1 localization was not due to a difference in <i>ASK1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In addition, induction of <i>CLB3</i> under the conditions mentioned above gave rise to bipolar spindles that appeared fragile with a weakened midzone. In contrast, consistent with stable microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions, coexpression of <i>CLB3</i>, <i>HSK3</i> and <i>NDC80</i> resulted in the formation of robust bipolar spindles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). Importantly, the expression of <i>NDC80</i> and/or <i>HSK3</i> during an <i>NDT80</i> block caused a considerable increase in meiosis I sister chromatid segregation in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Furthermore, under conditions in which <i>CLB3</i> expression alone failed to induce meiosis I sister chromatid segregation, expression of <i>CLB3</i> together with <i>NDC80</i> and <i>HSK3</i> caused a substantial increase in meiosis I sister chromatid segregation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). This occurred even when cells were maintained in a prolonged <i>NDT80</i> block prior to expression of <i>CLB3</i>, <i>NDC80</i> and <i>HSK3</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), ruling out the possibility that the expression of <i>NDT80</i> targets, such as <i>CDC5</i>, early during sporulation contributes to sister chromatid segregation during meiosis I. We conclude that limiting outer kinetochore assembly is an additional mechanism to prevent microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions during premeiotic S phase and prophase I."

The observation that the transient disruption of microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions, either by inactivating the outer kinetochore or by microtubule depolymerization, allowed coorientation factors to associate with kinetochores, despite <i>CLB3</i> misexpression, led us to conclude that it is premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions that interfere with the establishment of sister kinetochore coorientation during meiosis I. It is currently unclear how preexisting microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions prevent monopolin association with kinetochores. Precocious attachment of microtubules to kinetochores could occlude the monopolin complex from binding to kinetochores. Alternatively, tension between sister kinetochores generated from stable microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions could induce a conformational change at the kinetochore and/or pericentric chromatin such that coorientation factors can no longer associate with the kinetochore."

The same logic as outlined for coorientation factors applies to the conclusion that it is Clb3-CDK mediated premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions that lead to loss of centromeric cohesin protection in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells; disrupting microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions by various means restores stepwise loss of cohesin in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells. A simple interpretation of this result is that the centromeric-cohesin protective domain can be disrupted by tension between sister kinetochores at any meiotic stage prior to anaphase I. This does not appear to be the case. In cells lacking the coorientation factor <i>MAM1</i>, sister kinetochores come under tension in metaphase I, yet in these cells centromeric cohesin is not removed prematurely (<a href=\"#bib50\">Toth et al., 2000</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, the timing of microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions is of importance. It is tempting to speculate that the establishment of the centromeric-cohesin protective domain, which occurs during prophase I or perhaps even earlier, is sensitive to premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions and/or tension that promote biorientation of sister kinetochores. However, once this domain is established, its maintenance during meiosis I can no longer be disrupted by tension between sister kinetochores."

A defect in localization of the protective machinery to kinetochores does not appear to be the cause of this defect. Sgo1 and PP2A localize normally to kinetochores in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> cells. Therefore, lack of cohesin protection upon premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore engagement must either result from a defect in an unknown cohesin protection pathway or from a decrease in the activity of Sgo1 and/or PP2A. Premature association of kinetochores with microtubules could result in the untimely recruitment of a factor (e.g. Clb-CDKs themselves) to the pericentromere that inhibits the cohesin protective machinery. Alternatively, microtubule\u2013kinetochore engagement could directly affect the activity of the protective machinery. Two mechanisms have been previously proposed whereby tension modulates the activity of the cohesin protective machinery. In mammalian cells, tension spatially separates centromeric cohesin from Sgo1-PP2A, perhaps leading to loss of protection (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2008</a>). Tension has also been proposed to cause a deformation in PP2A, thus inhibiting its catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grinthal et al., 2010</a>). Irrespective of whether it is tension-dependent perturbation of Sgo1-PP2A and/or recruitment of inhibitory factors, it is clear that premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore engagement is a bona fide modulator of the cohesin protective machinery."

This difference is likely due to the outer kinetochore being present only until early prophase I. When Ndc80, Hsk3 and Clb3 are coexpressed during late prophase I, sister chromatid segregation occurs in meiosis I. This result demonstrates that the presence of Clb3-CDKs alone during late prophase I is not sufficient to cause meiosis I sister chromatid segregation but that outer kinetochore components must also be expressed. Whether outer kinetochore disassembly solely occurs to prevent microtubule kinetochore interactions remains to be determined. Outer kinetochore disassembly could also serve additional purposes during prophase I such as enabling telomere-mediated chromosome movements. Further study of the kinetochore assembly/disassembly cycle during meiosis will provide insights into the full impact of kinetochore regulation on meiotic chromosome segregation."

This dissociation depends on the mating pheromone signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asakawa et al., 2005</a>). Intriguingly, ectopic induction of meiosis without mating pheromone signaling (i.e. in <i>pat1</i> mutants), results in segregation of sister chromatids instead of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yamamoto and Hiraoka, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yamamoto et al., 2004</a>). Perhaps this change in the pattern of chromosome segregation in <i>pat1</i> mutants arises from premature microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions due to a defect in outer kinetochore disassembly. Interestingly, in mouse oocytes, the Ndc80 complex is recruited to chromosomes only after nuclear envelope breakdown (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sun et al., 2011</a>), raising the possibility that outer kinetochore assembly is also prevented in meiotic prophase I in vertebrates."

Thus, it is crucial to understand how accurate meiotic chromosome segregation is achieved. We discovered that the establishment of a meiosis-specific chromosome segregation pattern depends on the regulation of microtubule\u2013kinetochore interactions. This is achieved by regulating cyclin-CDK activity as well as assembly of the outer kinetochore.

Butler, PA). Sporulation medium was heated to 30\u00b0C, aerated using an aquarium air pump (Petco Animal Supplies, Inc. Cambridge, MA) and was perfused into the fluidic chamber using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI) with a flow rate of 4\u20137 ml/h. Alternatively, cells were induced to sporulate as above and transferred to a microfluidic chamber (CellASIC Corp. Hayward, CA). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer-Z1 with a 100\u00d7 objective (NA = 1.45), equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera. 11 Z-stacks (1 micron apart) were acquired and maximally projected. Metamorph software was used for image acquisition and processing. Images for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> was processed using Metamorph deconvolution software. For <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, a cell was scored as harboring a separated pair of sister kinetochores if the heterozygous CENV-GFP dot signal underwent transient splitting for at least two time points for the duration of the movie."

Here, Miller et al. show that this is due to early development of bipolar spindles and present evidence that premature kinetochore-microtubule attachments disrupt normal morphogenesis of kinetochores and pericentric cohesion. That these connections must be at least transiently disrupted to allow development of monopolar kinetochores and in particular a protective cohesin domain formed around the centromeres is an important and new discovery. This is a typical tour de force effort from the Amon lab, with cleverly designed and well-executed experiments and several novel observations. The data are for the most part impeccable. However, the simple message is perhaps lost by emphasis on other points that are either overstated or speculative without careful comment to these issues. Furthermore, certain novelty claims are unwarranted and need rewriting (see point 1). Substantial points that must be addressed in a revision are given below in no particular order with regard to significance."

Thus, when Clb3 is driven from the <i>GAL1-10</i> promoter the protein is not overexpressed, just prematurely expressed. Expression from the <i>CUP1</i> promoter results in a 5-fold overexpression compared to the <i>GAL1-10</i> promoter. This is now shown in Figure 1B. Importantly, the degree of expression has no effect on the phenotype. The percentage of cells segregating sister chromatids during meiosis I is similar in <i>CUP-CLB3</i> and <i>GAL-CLB3</i> cells (shown in Figure 1C). This result indicates that degree of ectopic expression is irrelevant for the phenotype. The only aspect that matters is <i>premature</i> expression. This is now explained in detail in the text."

Similarly it is an overstatement to write categorically that the work shows two independent mechanisms for timely engagement of the microtubules with the kinetochore. Manipulating the synthesis of the outer kinetochore proteins enhances the Cdk effects, but perhaps this is because the unknown kinase targets are not completely modified? One might suggest that the transcription or translation of the kinetochore proteins is regulated by a repressor whose activity is ablated by Cdk function</i>."
