We have identified a mouse mutant, <i>bloto</i>, that harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335. <i>Zfp335</i><sup>bloto/bloto</sup> mice exhibit a na\u00efve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins to manifest in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335<sup>bloto</sup> are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation."

We have identified a mouse mutant, <i>bloto</i>, that harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335. <i>Zfp335</i><sup>bloto/bloto</sup> mice exhibit a na\u00efve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins to manifest in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335<sup>bloto</sup> are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation."

T cell development is a complex and highly regulated process that involves multiple stages of selection and maturation, both within the thymus and after thymic export. In the thymus, productive rearrangement of the TCR \u03b2-chain in CD4<sup>\u2212</sup>CD8<sup>\u2212</sup> double negative (DN) thymocytes drives progression to the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP) stage (<a href=\"#bib59\">Starr et al., 2003</a>). After rearrangement of the TCR \u03b1-chain, DP thymocytes express mature TCRs which are then used to survey self-peptide/MHC complexes presented by specialized epithelial cells in the thymic cortex (cTECs) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Klein et al., 2014</a>). A small percentage of DP thymocytes receive positively selecting TCR signals which promote their survival, in part through upregulation of IL-7R\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sinclair et al., 2011</a>). Positively selected thymocytes become committed to either the CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) lineage and migrate to the thymic medulla, where they undergo further negative selection mediated by interactions with antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) or AIRE-dependent medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hogquist et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Klein et al., 2014</a>), during which thymocytes expressing self-reactive TCRs either undergo apoptosis or are diverted to alternative fates, such as becoming regulatory T cells (Tregs) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stritesky et al., 2012</a>)."

As such, SP thymocytes may be further divided into two phenotypically distinct populations, often referred to as semi-mature (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>) and mature (CD62L<sup>hi</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup>). These phenotypic changes are associated with an important functional difference: semi-mature SP thymocytes are susceptible to apoptosis upon TCR stimulation, whereas mature SP thymocytes are not and respond instead by proliferating (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sprent and Kishimoto, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Weinreich and Hogquist, 2008</a>). In addition, only mature SP thymocytes upregulate sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1), which is required for egress from the thymus (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matloubian et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Weinreich and Hogquist, 2008</a>). The process of SP thymocyte maturation, from entry into the SP compartment to thymic egress, has been estimated to take 4\u20135 days (<a href=\"#bib37\">McCaughtry et al., 2007</a>). New T cells, also referred to as recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), undergo a phase of post-thymic phenotypic and functional maturation before they are incorporated into the long-lived peripheral na\u00efve T cell pool (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fink, 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "The transition from the semi-mature to mature stage of SP thymocyte development is marked by numerous changes in gene expression. Some of these changes, including the upregulation of S1PR1 and CD62L, are mediated by the transcription factor KLF2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carlson et al., 2006</a>). In the periphery, the process of post-thymic maturation is also associated with transcriptional changes, though on a smaller scale (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mingueneau et al., 2013</a>). For instance, an increase in IL-7R\u03b1 expression during this period has been shown to promote recent thymic emigrant (RTE) survival (<a href=\"#bib54\">Silva et al., 2014</a>). Proper regulation of the transcriptional program underlying late-stage SP thymocyte and post-thymic T cell maturation is thus critically important for the establishment of a normal na\u00efve T cell compartment. Multiple genes involved in NF-\u03baB signaling have been reported to be required for the development of mature T cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guerin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sato et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhang and He, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Silva et al., 2014</a>), primarily through mechanisms related to TCR signaling and protection from apoptosis. In addition, roles for the transcriptional repressor Nkap (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsu et al., 2011</a>) and chromatin remodeling factor Bptf (<a href=\"#bib28\">Landry et al., 2011</a>) have been identified in recent years.

Here, we report that an ENU-induced mutant allele of Zfp335 results in defective accumulation of na\u00efve T cells, largely as a consequence of impaired maturation in SP thymocytes and RTEs. We show that this maturation defect is independent of thymic selection or effects on proliferation, but is associated with reduced viability. We identify a set of Zfp335 target genes in thymocytes and present evidence that decreased Zfp335 occupancy at a subset of these targets alters gene expression in mutant thymocytes. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of a transcriptional program required for T cell maturation."

                                "text": "As described earlier, <i>blt/blt</i> mice have a more severe defect in the accumulation of na\u00efve T cells compared to that of mature SP thymocytes, suggesting that Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup>-induced dysregulation extends to events in the periphery following thymic export. To assess the impact of Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> on na\u00efve T cell homeostasis, we adoptively transferred <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> peripheral T cells together with wild-type controls into congenic lymphoreplete hosts and assessed their relative maintenance over 7 days. Surprisingly, <i>blt/blt</i> T cells persisted just as well as control wild-type T cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> does not significantly impair the survival of the bulk na\u00efve T cell population. This led us to hypothesize that the <i>bloto</i> defect may be largely confined to new T cells that have recently left the thymus, otherwise known as recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). In adult mice, these cells comprise a relatively small percentage of total na\u00efve T cells and may therefore not be significantly represented in measurements involving the bulk na\u00efve T cell population. We initially assessed the ability of SP thymocytes to survive once introduced into the periphery, in essence behaving as surrogate RTEs. Significantly, <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> cells decayed more rapidly than co-transferred controls, hinting that RTE survival may be impaired in <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "In order to study the RTE population in <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> mice in greater detail, we crossed the <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> mutant to the Rag1-GFP reporter line (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kuwata et al., 1999</a>). In these reporter mice, GFP signal intensity is inversely proportional to time spent in the periphery (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boursalian et al., 2004</a>), allowing for the identification of RTEs as GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within the na\u00efve T cell population. We found that the GFP<sup>hi</sup> subset was significantly overrepresented in <i>blt/blt</i> na\u00efve T cells and was skewed towards cells with the highest GFP signal intensities that have most recently exited the thymus, consistent with a partial block in post-thymic na\u00efve T cell maturation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To directly assess RTE maintenance in vivo, a test population of either Rag1-GFP <i>blt</i>/+ or Rag1-GFP <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> peripheral T cells was mixed with control non-fluorescent T cells and injected i.v. into congenic lymphoreplete hosts. Consistent with previous experiments (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), there was no significant decline in relative numbers of total <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> na\u00efve T cells recovered from the spleen 1, 3, and 5 days post-transfer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, the <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> population declined more rapidly than <i>blt</i>/+ Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> controls, particularly within the first day of adoptive transfer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Interestingly, in contrast to the spleen, we noted a small decrease in the maintenance of total <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> na\u00efve T cells, relative to <i>blt</i>/+ cells, that were recovered from peripheral lymph nodes. Similarly, the lymph nodes exhibited a larger decline in <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> relative to <i>blt</i>/+ Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These data suggest that some of the apparent decline in <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> RTEs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) may be due to less efficient short-term accumulation in lymph nodes. Nonetheless, the fact that we observe in both spleen and lymph nodes a higher rate of decay in the Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> population as compared to the overall effect on the bulk na\u00efve T cell pool strongly suggests that <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> RTEs survive less well than control RTEs."

To test this hypothesis, we treated mice with FTY720, a potent inhibitor of thymic egress (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matloubian et al., 2004</a>). This strategy ensured that new T cells, which would have otherwise been exported into the periphery, were trapped in the thymus where their accumulation could be measured. After 4 days of thymic egress blockade, <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> mice showed greatly impaired accumulation of SP cells with a mature CD62L<sup>hi</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), suggesting that most of the losses in RTEs take place within a short period after they enter the periphery. These data also indicate that the cell loss is due to intrinsic defects in the maturing T cells and is not dependent on their location in a particular lymphoid compartment."

Relative to <i>blt</i>/+ controls, <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> DP thymocytes had no detectable differences in the expression of <i>Mrps5</i> and <i>Rabggtb</i>, even though these genes exhibit strongly reduced Zfp335 binding in <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> thymocytes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This is not an unexpected finding given that transcription factors are known to bind sites which they do not functionally regulate (<a href=\"#bib56\">Smale, 2014</a>). Nonetheless, we did observe deregulated expression of many Zfp335 target genes in our CD4SP array data, including many which did not exhibit reduced Zfp335 occupancy according to our stringent criteria (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). For example, although <i>Wdr47</i> failed to meet these criteria because it showed decreased Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> binding in the ChIP-C but not ChIP-N data set (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), its expression was nonetheless significantly downregulated in <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> thymocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,F</a>). With the exception of a handful of strongly downregulated targets, gene expression changes were usually mild. Most deregulated target genes exhibited decreased expression, though a few were modestly upregulated (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Interestingly, this small group of upregulated targets include <i>Zfp335</i> itself, which we confirmed by RT-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), suggesting that Zfp335 participates in an autoregulatory negative feedback loop. It is probably reasonable to assume that many of these differentially expressed genes do in fact have reduced Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> binding at their promoters, which we failed to detect owing to limitations in ChIP-seq sensitivity and/or the inability of our approach to identify differential binding events that are not evident at the whole population level because they occur exclusively in mature CD4SP thymocytes."

We found that Zfp335 formed a gel shift complex with the labeled probe (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). This complex increased in abundance proportional to the amount of Zfp335 protein and was eliminated by competition with excess unlabeled probe, demonstrating that it is sequence-specific and Zfp335-dependent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Competition experiments with unlabeled probes containing mutations of conserved nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) showed that Zfp335 binding was abolished when both DNA elements of the bipartite motif were mutated, whereas mutations in either the first or second element had an intermediate effect, indicating that both parts of the consensus motif are required for full Zfp335 binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). We noted a stronger effect on competition upon mutation of the first element compared to the second, suggesting that it makes a greater contribution to Zfp335 binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). We also performed gel shift assays with an oligonucleotide containing the previously reported Zfp335 recognition motif (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), but failed to detect binding above the negative control (Ikaros binding site) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Re-analysis of the embryonic brain ChIP-Seq data published by Yang et al. according to the parameters we applied to our data set (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) identified the motif shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>. These observations suggest that the discrepancy between our and the previously reported motif arises from differences in motif finding strategy. Importantly, the identification of a common motif in these distinct data sets strongly suggests that this sequence element is recognized by Zfp335 in a diversity of cell types."

By analyzing mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a C2H2 zinc finger of Zfp335, we reveal a selective defect in the accumulation of na\u00efve T cells resulting from a maturation block in SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. In line with another recent study (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), we have shown that Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. We have identified a set of direct targets in thymocytes and provide evidence that Zfp335 occupancy at a small subset of target sites was significantly decreased in mutant T cells. Zfp335 target genes were enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. In addition, we identified a new DNA recognition motif that is bound by Zfp335. Taken together, our findings suggest that Zfp335 acts as a novel transcription factor required for regulating expression of multiple genes required for late stage na\u00efve T cell maturation."

Although our data do not provide support for altered thymic selection being an explanation for the reduced T cell numbers in <i>blt/blt</i> mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that the selection of some T cell specificities is affected by the Zfp335 mutation and future deep sequencing studies will be needed to fully address this issue. The intact proliferation of <i>blt/blt</i> T cells contrasts with the defective proliferation of human lymphoblastic cells and neuronal stem cells carrying a H1111R mutation in ZFP335 (ZNF335) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2012</a>).

In our mature CD4SP thymocyte data set, of the 1504 genes passing a p-value threshold of &lt;0.05, only 16 genes, or 1% of the total had a twofold or greater change in expression, while the vast majority (93%) showed a less than 1.5-fold difference between <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> and WT. This may not be a surprising result, given that we were only able to detect strongly diminished Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> occupancy at a limited subset of target sites. However, due to the highly conservative criteria used and other technical limitations discussed earlier, this is most likely an underestimate of the true degree of differential binding, which may affect a broader range of target genes and account for many of the more subtle changes in gene expression. Consistent with this notion, we observed that 33 direct Zfp335 targets, representing \u223c20% of the total, were differentially expressed in mature CD4SP thymocytes (p &lt; 0.05), and of these genes, only four (<i>Ankle2</i>, <i>Cnpy2</i>, <i>Nme6</i>, <i>Tbck</i>) met our differential binding criteria. Furthermore, several known or putative transcriptional regulators are among genes directly targeted by Zfp335 (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>) or differentially expressed in <i>blt/blt</i> thymocytes and RTEs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), suggesting that Zfp335 operates within the context of a broader gene regulatory network. It is likely that the T cell maturation defect arises from the cumulative effects of relatively small gene expression changes within the Zfp335 regulatory network, possibly resulting in mild perturbations of multiple pathways whose functional consequences may not be individually significant but in combination may negatively impact overall T cell fitness."

If we extend this observation to the genome-wide level to assume that Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup>-induced transcriptional dysregulation in mature na\u00efve T cells approximates the situation in RTEs, one way to explain why mature T cells are less affected could be that the deregulated genes and their associated pathways are most critical during late-thymic to early post-thymic maturation, after which they become dispensable. In support of this concept, it has been reported that IKK2 is required transiently in RTEs but not in mature T cells for normal IL-7R\u03b1 upregulation and homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Silva et al., 2014</a>), although we have no evidence that this pathway is affected in <i>blt</i>/<i>blt</i> T lymphocytes.

Given its widespread expression and the early embryonic lethality resulting from its complete ablation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), it is highly likely that Zfp335 serves wider developmental roles. The poor contribution of Zfp335-overexpressing cells to hematopoietic lineages in BM chimeric mice also hints at a wider role. It may therefore seem remarkable that a mutation in such a ubiquitously expressed gene could produce a defect that appears to be selective for this particular stage of T cell development. It is possible that the loss of Zfp335 binding to the target sites described in our study may be unique to T lymphocytes, resulting in T cell-specific dysregulation; however, this hypothesis is not favored by preliminary evidence showing that target genes such as <i>Ankle2</i> were also downregulated in B cells (data not shown). As discussed earlier, our data that only a small number of target genes are significantly deregulated suggests that other aspects of the Zfp335-dependent transcriptional program may remain sufficiently intact to allow most developmental processes, except for T cell maturation, to proceed relatively normally. For future studies, it will be important to test whether a null allele has additional consequences for immune regulation beyond the selective T cell maturation effects revealed by the <i>bloto</i> mutation."

Our study detected approximately 150 ChIP-seq peaks in thymocytes, consistent with the generally accepted principle that additional molecular requirements beyond DNA sequence preference determine the stability of transcription factor binding to a given site. At this early stage, it is not known what these requirements are for Zfp335, but they are likely to involve local chromatin context and interactions with co-binding partners which remain to be defined. It is also unclear whether Zfp335 displays cell type-specific binding patterns, which may allow Zfp335 to fulfill various developmental roles by regulating different gene expression programs. Finally, although it has been proposed that Zfp335 activates target genes by recruiting H3K4 methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), it is not clear if this is the sole mechanism, or that Zfp335 functions exclusively as a transcriptional activator. Consistent with the view that Zfp335 drives transcriptional activation, we observed that most target genes with deregulated expression in <i>blt/blt</i> thymocytes tended to be downregulated. However, we have noted exceptions in which some target genes\u2014including Zfp335 itself\u2014were modestly upregulated, suggesting the possibility that Zfp335 may also act as a repressor.

In future work, it will be important to build from these findings to understand how this broad set of gene expression changes are integrated to promote formation of a normal sized compartment of cells.

The top-scoring motif obtained with MEME was replicated using HOMER's motif finding function. HOMER was used to detect Zfp335 motif occurrences and locations within defined genomic regions. HOMER was used to generate a histogram of motif density (bin size = 50 bp) for a region from \u2212500 bp to +500 bp of Zfp335 ChIP-seq peaks. DNase I-seq signal and phyloP conservation scores for motifs occurring within Zfp335 peaks or \u00b12 kb of RefSeq TSS were aggregated using bwtool. The DNase I digital genomic footprinting (DGF) signal track for mouse thymus was obtained from ENCODE/UW (<a href=\"#bib11\">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</a>); sequence conservation tracks were downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser (<a href=\"#bib48\">Raney et al., 2014</a>)."

To elucidate the defect by identifying the target genes of Zfp335, the authors found several possible target genes that Zfp335 directly binds.

Homozygous bloto mice show a defect in the formation of the naive T cell compartment that cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, cell proliferation or survival. ChIP-seq and microarray analyses to identify Zfp335-occupied and -regulated genes indicate that a very small number of genes are differentially bound and regulated in mutant and wild type thymocytes.

We hope this additional explanation helps clarify what is admittedly a complex experiment as we are not aware of a simpler way to perform this analysis.
