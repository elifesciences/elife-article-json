However, the cellular and genetic changes that ultimately led to the evolution of multicellularity are not known. In this study, we describe an aggregative multicellular stage in the protist <i>Capsaspora owczarzaki</i>, a close unicellular relative of metazoans. Remarkably, transition to the aggregative stage is associated with significant upregulation of orthologs of genes known to establish multicellularity and tissue architecture in metazoans. We further observe transitions in regulated alternative splicing during the <i>C. owczarzaki</i> life cycle, including the deployment of an exon network associated with signaling, a feature of splicing regulation so far only observed in metazoans. Our results reveal the existence of a highly regulated aggregative stage in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> and further suggest that features of aggregative behavior in an ancestral protist may had been co-opted to develop some multicellular properties currently seen in metazoans."

However, the cellular and genetic changes that ultimately led to the evolution of multicellularity are not known. In this study, we describe an aggregative multicellular stage in the protist <i>Capsaspora owczarzaki</i>, a close unicellular relative of metazoans. Remarkably, transition to the aggregative stage is associated with significant upregulation of orthologs of genes known to establish multicellularity and tissue architecture in metazoans. We further observe transitions in regulated alternative splicing during the <i>C. owczarzaki</i> life cycle, including the deployment of an exon network associated with signaling, a feature of splicing regulation so far only observed in metazoans. Our results reveal the existence of a highly regulated aggregative stage in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> and further suggest that features of aggregative behavior in an ancestral protist may had been co-opted to develop some multicellular properties currently seen in metazoans."

In fact, multicellular life has evolved independently at least 25 times, in groups as diverse as animals, fungi, plants, slime molds and seaweeds. There are broadly two ways to become multicellular. The most complex multicellular species, such as animals, will replicate a single cell, over and over, without separating the resultant cells. However, in species that are only occasionally multicellular, free-living cells tend instead to join together in one mass of many cells."

These levels were shaped by both physiochemical constraints and historical circumstances, the latter being more important in more complex systems (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jacob, 1977</a>). Therefore, it is important to identify the phylogenetic inertia (<i>sensu</i> <a href=\"#bib11\">Burt, 2001</a>) imposed by the raw starting material in order to properly understand major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of metazoan multicellularity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Knoll, 2011</a>). Examination of both the genetic repertoire (<a href=\"#bib29\">King, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rokas, 2008</a>) and the cell types present in the immediate unicellular relatives of metazoans can provide insights into this evolutionary transition, as they reveal the historical constraints in early metazoan evolution. In this regard, the analyses of unicellular holozoan genomes, that is choanoflagellates and filastereans, have shown that the genetic repertoire of the metazoan unicellular ancestor was much more complex than previously thought (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abedin and King, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">King et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Suga et al., 2013</a>)."

Multicellular organisms evolved through two major strategies: aggregation of different cells or clonal division of a single cell. Multi-level selection theory has proposed that the most complex multicellular organisms likely arose through clonal development rather than by aggregation of genetically diverse cells, since intra-organismal competition in the latter might be expected to be evolutionarily unstable (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Michod, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Newman, 2012</a>). Accordingly, eukaryotic lineages that attained the most complex multicellular lifestyles (i.e., plants and metazoans) arose through clonal cell division (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</a>). In contrast to clonal multicellularity, aggregative cell behavior typically represents a transient life cycle stage. This type of multicellularity arose within several eukaryotic clades, including the dictyostelids (Amoebozoa) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schaap, 2011</a>), acrasid amoebas (Heterolobosea, Discicristata, Discoba) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 2011</a>), <i>Guttulinopsis vulgaris</i> (Cercozoa, Rhizaria) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown et al., 2012</a>), the genus <i>Sorogena</i> (Ciliata, Alveolata) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lasek-Nesselquist and Katz, 2001</a>), the holomycota <i>Fonticula alba</i> (Opisthokonta) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brown et al., 2009</a>) and the genus <i>Sorodiplophrys</i> (Labyrinthulomycetes, Heterokonta) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dykstra and Olive, 1975</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of an aggregative multicellular stage in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> in which many orthologs of genes important for metazoan clonal multicellularity are upregulated."

At this stage, active DNA replication occurs (with &gt;10% of the cells in S-phase) and, within 48 hr, the cells enter an exponential growth phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). Subsequently, the cells start to detach from the surface and begin to retract their filopodia and encyst (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). After 8 days, no attached amoebas remain and growth is stabilized (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). This cystic stage may represent a dispersal resistance form. Strikingly, we observe an alternative path to this process involving the active formation of cell aggregates (<a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2 and 3</a>). In these aggregates, the cells attach to each other and produce cohesive extracellular material (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) until a compact cell aggregate, in which cells no longer bear filopodia, is formed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates the presence of a thick, unstructured, extracellular material within the aggregates that appears to prevent direct contact between cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Clusters of cells appear to occur at random under normal culture conditions."

This indicates that cell clusters are not composed of daughter cells resulting from successive cell divisions, which would result in single-color cell clusters, but instead by aggregation of multiple cells. We also observed that aggregates could form efficiently even when cell division was blocked by two different inhibitors, hydroxyurea and aphidicolin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Finally, by flow cytometry, we observed that the proliferation rate of aggregative cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is extremely low (compared with the observations in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

We can then infer that multiple cell types and behaviors (including aggregative behavior, flagellar motility, amoeboid movement, clonal colony formation, etc) were most likely present among the unicellular ancestors of metazoans. This range of cell behaviors may have provided the basis for the evolution of the diverse cell types seen in animals (<a href=\"#bib2a\">Arendt, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arendt et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, each one of the three known unicellular lineages closely related to Metazoa (choanoflagellates, ichthyosporeans and filastereans) has some kind of simple multicellularity. Moreover, the tight regulation observed in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> (see below) emphasizes that a regulated temporal cell differentiation was already in place among unicellular ancestor of animals. This reinforces the view that, during the transition to animal multicellularity, ancestral premetazoan cell types may have been integrated into a single multicellular entity by means of controlling cell differentiation spatially, rather than temporally (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mikhailov et al., 2009</a>). An alternative explanation is that some of the cell behaviors observed in extant unicellular relatives of Metazoa may had evolved independently in some particular unicellular holozoan lineages or species, and do not represent ancestral states. The limited taxon sampling in many of these poorly studied lineages makes it difficult to reliably assess whether these are derived or ancestral characters and this situation is especially dramatic in the case of filastereans, in which only two species have been described so far (<i>C. owczarzaki</i> and the free-living <i>M. vibrans</i>)."

Moreover, when performing one-versus-all comparisons, each cell stage had a specific transcriptomic profile (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), indicating tight regulation at the level of gene expression. Using both pairwise and one-versus-all comparisons, we identified significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) categories (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a>) and Pfam protein domains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) in each set of differentially expressed (both up and down-regulated) genes (p&lt;0.01 for each significant category; Fisher\u2019s exact test).

Genes involved in protein synthesis and DNA replication were also significantly upregulated, consistent with the rapid cell proliferation at this stage observed by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and further suggesting a high metabolic rate."

These differences may reflect recycling of intracellular components triggered by starvation or other adverse conditions, as has been observed under conditions of adaptive cell survival in other eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kiel, 2010</a>).

In contrast, differential intron retention is the most widespread form of AS found in non-metazoan eukaryotic species (<a href=\"#bib36\">McGuire et al., 2008</a>). To assess the extent to which these forms of AS may contribute to gene regulation in <i>C. owczarzaki</i>, we systematically mapped reads from each life cycle stage to a comprehensive set of intron\u2013exon and exon\u2013exon junctions (i.e., formed by exon/intron inclusion and skipping) to score their differential usage. Of 25,677 introns with sufficient RNA-Seq read coverage across the three life cycle stages, 2986 (11.6%) showed \u226520% PSI (Percent Spliced In, percent of transcripts from a given gene in which the intron sequence is present) in at least one stage, and approximately a third of genes had at least one such intron retention event.

A low fraction of read-through introns (with length-multiples of three and no in-frame stop codons) were found among the two sets of differentially retained introns, suggesting that most if not all of these retained introns act by reducing the levels of spliced mRNAs exported from the nucleus and translated into protein, as has been observed previously for regulated retained introns in metazoan species (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yap et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, we observe that multiple introns belonging to a gene can be retained in a stage-specific manner. For instance, &gt;73% and &gt;29% of multi-intronic genes with one differentially retained intron had at least one additional differentially retained intron at the filopodial or cystic-specific stages, respectively, and 22% and 5% of genes at these stages showed evidence of high retention for all introns in the same genes. Furthermore, RT-PCR analyses and mate information from paired-end read analyses suggested that multiple intron retention events often occur in a combinatorial manner (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), thereby increasing the potential impact of intron retentions on mRNA regulation. All of the above observations were highly consistent across three biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), and not observed for neighbouring genes, ruling out contamination of genomic DNA."

While filopodial-specific differentially retained introns have a similar length distribution to constitutive (PSI less than 2% across all stages) introns, cystic stage-specific introns were significantly longer (p=1.7e<sup>\u221214</sup> Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). In line with this observation, the average level of intron retention increased steadily with intron length only in the cystic stage (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). Furthermore, cystic stage-specific retained introns harbored significantly weaker canonical 5\u00b4 and 3\u00b4 splice site signals than other intron sets (p&lt;0.0013 Wilcoxon rank sum test for all comparisons). Collectively, these data suggest that differential intron retention in the cystic stage may be associated with suboptimal introns (i.e., long and with weak splice sites) that are more efficiently spliced in the other cell stages. In the case of the filopodial-specific differentially retained introns, analyses of sequence motif enrichment with MEME show enrichment of a long T/G-rich motif that highly resembles a recently identified consensus binding site for Elav-like protein in mammals (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Interestingly, the single ortholog for this gene in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> shows a highly-regulated expression pattern, with lowest expression in the filopodial stage (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that Elav-like protein may negatively regulate filopodial-specific intron retention of some introns. Experimental depletion of Elav-like protein in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> will require the development of RNAi or gene-targeting methods in this species before this hypothesis can be tested."

In particular, the observation of an aggregative multicellular stage in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> represents the first example of such cellular behavior in a close unicellular relative of metazoans. This observation therefore adds to the repertoire of reported complex cellular behaviors among extant unicellular relatives of metazoans\u2014including clonal colony formation in choanoflagellates and sporangia formation by hypertrophic syncytial growth in ichthyosporeans (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dayel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suga and Ruiz-Trillo, 2013</a>), thus expanding the potential starting \u2018raw material\u2019 available for the evolution of animal multicellularity. We note that the current evolutionary framework on the opisthokonts, based on phylogenomic analyses (<a href=\"#bib57\">Steenkamp et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shalchian-Tabrizi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Torruella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Paps et al., 2013</a>), discards the possibility that <i>C. owczarzak</i>i (or choanoflagellates) derives from a more complex multicellular lineage.

Our discovery of an exon network associated with tyrosine kinase genes in <i>C. owczarzaki</i> further adds to the metazoan-like features of this species. Together with genes resembling those that function in metazoan multicellular processes, the emergence of an exon network that functions in conjunction with differentially-regulated intron retention may have provided a degree of proteomic and regulatory complexity that was key in the evolution of cell type complexity in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</a>). Based on the collective results from our investigation of <i>C. owczarzaki</i>, it is intriguing to consider that the integration of regulatory innovations involving differential expression and splicing of metazoan-like genes set the stage for the evolution of cell specialization in the common ancestors of metazoans and <i>C. owczarzaki</i>."

In short, for exon-skipping analyses, multifasta libraries of exon\u2013exon junctions were built by combining all forward annotated splicing donors and acceptors. A minimum of eight base pairs was required at each boundary to assure specificity. Next, the number of effective mappable positions was calculated for each exon\u2013exon junction, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</a>). Then, RNA-seq reads (previously trimmed to 50 nucleotides and combining each three replicates to increase read depth) were aligned to these sequences using Bowtie, with\u2212m 1 \u2212v 2 parameters (single mapping and two or fewer mismatches). Percentage of exon inclusion was calculated and a minimal read coverage was required, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib26\">Khare et al., 2012</a>). For intron retention, a similar approach was taken for each contiguous intron\u2013exon and exon\u2013exon junction, and percentage of intron inclusion (PSI, Percent Spliced In, the percentage of transcript for a given gene that contain the intron) was calculated as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Curtis et al., 2012</a>). For comparisons among cellular stages, only events with enough read coverage in the three samples were considered (either (i) \u226510 reads in the exon\u2013exon junction or (ii) \u226510 reads in one intron\u2013exon junction and \u22655 in the other), and introns showing &gt;95% inclusion in the three samples were discarded. To assess whether differentially retained introns in the same genes were included in a coordinated or in a combinatorial manner, mate information of read pairs was used. If each end of a read mapped to two different intron retention events, each end may be providing support for retention of both introns or splicing of both introns (coordinated regulation), or retention of one and splicing of another (combinatorial intron retention). For the 555 pairs of retained introns that had read mate information, 196 (35.3%) showed evidence for combinatorial regulation. Finally, for sequence motif enrichment analyses, full intron sequences were compared using MEME (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bailey et al., 2009</a>)."

The samples were subsequently fixed and stained with Propidium Iodide (as described in <a href=\"#bib15\">Darzynkiewicz and Huang, 2004</a>) and DNA content estimated using FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). For cell counting, 1 ml of fresh sample (one from the supernatant and one from the flask surface) was mixed in a BD Trucount Tube (Becton Dickinson), with a known number of beads, so absolute cell number counts could be calculated, using an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Two replicate experiments (R1 and R2) were performed independently in order to confidently establish growth dynamics. Two measures were calculated from the DNA-content analysis. First, the proliferation rate, which indicates the proportion of number of cells in S and G2/M phases vs the number of cells in G0/G1. Second, the percentage of cells in S-phase."

For example, <i>Capsaspora</i> has a number of genes in its genome that seem to be missing from the Choanoflagellata. What has not been clear is the extent to which the study of <i>Capsaspora</i> cell biology (beyond the study of its genome) will help to illuminate animal origins."

The images in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> nicely document the morphology of various differentiated cell types. The authors further report that the life history of <i>Capsaspora</i> is associated with regulated and coordinated changes in transcriptional regulation and in mRNA splicing. The transition to cell aggregation in particular is associated with differential transcription of genes that are also involved in the regulation of development and cell adhesion in animals, raising the possibility that the clonal multicellularity of animals evolved through the co-option of genes that previously functioned in cell aggregation."

A primary concern is that the authors observe that a significant portion of the genome is differentially transcribed during the life cycle of <i>C. owczarzaki</i>, yet they are making the leap to very specific molecular pathways that are linked to these life cycle stages. As the analyses to generate gene expression lists that are significantly correlated are not fully documented, it is impossible to evaluate if the authors are indeed making a significant advance in our understanding of multicellular evolution, or if they are selectively highlighting one of many interesting pathways that change during the life cycle of <i>C. owczarzaki</i>."

My concern with these types of enrichment analyses are if the authors are specifically looking at genes they are interested in, or are annotated, versus actually testing against the null hypothesis. For example, are protein kinases actually more likely to have exon skipping than just any random set of genes in the genome (Blast2Go annotated or not)? What is the actual meaning of \u201cgenes with differential exon skipping are significantly enriched in protein kinase activity\u201d and other related statements? These are key conclusions to this paper and as submitted it is difficult to evaluate if these statements are indeed true. Indeed, the authors claim, regarding protein kinases, that \u201c[t]his represents the first example of a regulated exon network linked to a specific biological function in a unicellular organism\u201d.

First, we used two live staining protocols (Chromeo Live Cell Mitochondrial Staining Kit and Lysotracker Green DND-26) that appear to be efficient (staining virtually all cells in the culture), stable (remaining for days), and non-toxic (with the cells exhibiting normal morphological shape and behavior) in <i>C. owczarzaki</i>.

A major open question raised by the finding that <i>Capsaspora</i> has a complex repertoire of genes involved in multicellularity (Suga et al. Nat Commun 4, 2325 (2013)), as also seen for choanoflagellates (King et al. Nature 451, 783-788 (2008); Fairclough et al. Genome Biol 14, R15 (2013)) is whether differential gene regulation played an important role in the origins of multicellularity; however, gene regulation among unicellular relatives of Metazoa remains poorly understood. In our manuscript we provide the first description of transcriptomic changes associated with transitions between different cell stages in <i>Capsaspora</i>, both at the level of mRNA expression and alternative splicing. The nature of the genes that are differentially regulated is highly suggestive of possible mechanisms that underlie origins of multicellular.

Since the heteroduplex forms unpredictable secondary structures its formation varies between PCR reactions. In some cases it is also possible that unspecific bands are amplified in the PCR reaction. Nevertheless these effects do not impact the validation of the alternative splicing events in our study as we have confirmed the identity of the inclusion and exclusion isoforms by Sanger sequencing. We have added a note in the legend to acknowledge the presence of heteroduplexes in the RT-PCR reactions, and to confirm that the specific products have been confirmed by sequencing."

My concern with these types of enrichment analyses are if the authors are specifically looking at genes they are interested in, or are annotated, versus actually testing against the null hypothesis. For example, are protein kinases actually more likely to have exon skipping than just any random set of genes in the genome (Blast2Go annotated or not)? What is the actual meaning of \u201cgenes with differential exon skipping are significantly enriched in protein kinase activity\u201d and other related statements? These are key conclusions to this paper and as submitted it is difficult to evaluate if these statements are indeed true. Indeed, the authors claim, regarding protein kinases, that \u201c[t]his represents the first example of a regulated exon network linked to a specific biological function in a unicellular organism\u201d. This conclusion needs more documentation of how it was reached for me to agree</i>."

We tested GO enrichment by using Ontologizer, and not by \u201cspecifically looking at genes we were interested in\u201d. What Ontologizer does is to test whether within a particular list of genes (in this case, genes that were found to be significantly overexpressed in one stage vs another) there is an overrepresentation of any GO (tested against the full list of genes and its associated GOs, the null hypothesis thus being that the proportion of genes for a specific GO category in the subset is a representation of the proportion of genes of these category in the complete list). We used the Topology-Weighted option to avoid having to apply a multiple hypothesis correction on the obtained p-values. Then, we used a p-value threshold of 0.01. The cytoscape networks, which seems to concern the reviewer as well, were built after the Ontologizer analysis had been done. That is, the network is only a visualization tool of the results obtained by Ontologizer (including number of genes in each GO, p-values, etc). Therefore, in response to answer the reviewer\u2019s concern, protein kinases are significantly enriched for exon skipping when comparing any random set of genes in the genome."
