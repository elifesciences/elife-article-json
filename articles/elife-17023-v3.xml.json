Here, we dissect how light and metabolic signals are integrated to overcome stem cell dormancy at the shoot apical meristem. We show on the one hand that light is able to activate expression of the stem cell inducer <i>WUSCHEL</i> independently of photosynthesis and that this likely involves inter-regional cytokinin signaling. Metabolic signals, on the other hand, are transduced to the meristem through activation of the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase. Surprisingly, TOR is also required for light signal dependent stem cell activation. Thus, the TOR kinase acts as a central integrator of light and metabolic signals and a key regulator of stem cell activation at the shoot apex."

Here, we dissect how light and metabolic signals are integrated to overcome stem cell dormancy at the shoot apical meristem. We show on the one hand that light is able to activate expression of the stem cell inducer <i>WUSCHEL</i> independently of photosynthesis and that this likely involves inter-regional cytokinin signaling. Metabolic signals, on the other hand, are transduced to the meristem through activation of the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase. Surprisingly, TOR is also required for light signal dependent stem cell activation. Thus, the TOR kinase acts as a central integrator of light and metabolic signals and a key regulator of stem cell activation at the shoot apex."

Energy captured from sunlight during a process called photosynthesis is the main source of energy for most plants. Therefore, the amount and quality of light in the environment has a big influence on how plants grow and develop. An enzyme called TOR kinase can sense energy levels in animal cells and regulate many processes including growth and cell division. Plants also have a TOR kinase, but it is less clear if it plays the same role in plants, and whether it can respond to light."

Here, Pfeiffer et al. studied how shoot stem cells are activated in response to environmental signals in a plant known as <i>Arabidopsis.</i> The experiments show that light is able to activate the production of WUSCHEL independently of photosynthesis via a signal pathway that depends on TOR kinase. The stem cells do not directly sense light; instead other cells detect the light and relay the information to the stem cells with the help of a hormone called cytokinin."

Therefore, Pfeiffer et al.\u2019s findings suggest that the activation of TOR by light allows plant cells to anticipate how much energy will be available and efficiently tune their growth and development to cope with the environmental conditions. Future challenges are to understand how TOR kinase is regulated by light signals and how this enzyme is able to act on WUSCHEL to trigger stem cell division."

Consequently, several of the core developmental decisions during the lifecycle of a plant from germination to seedling development and flowering are strongly influenced by light conditions. After germination, higher plants undergo two distinct developmental programs depending on the availability of light, termed skotomorphogenesis and photomorphogenesis. Skotomorphogenesis, the dark adaptation program, is characterized by an etiolated phenotype, including an elongated hypocotyl, closed cotyledons, the formation of an apical hook and etioplast development. Importantly, stem cells at the shoot and root tip remain dormant and thus growth in etiolated seedlings is mainly dependent on cell elongation rather than cell division. In contrast, photomorphogenesis, the developmental program triggered in light, leads to seedlings with short hypocotyls, unfolded cotyledons and development of chloroplasts. In the light, shoot and root meristems are activated, leading to root growth and development of the first leaves by cell division and expansion (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib43\">Nemhauser and Chory 2002</a>)."

With the advance of land plants and resulting new environmental challenges, such as growth in dense canopy and germination in soil, the evolution of the dark-adapted skotomorphogenesis program ensued an advantage: It allowed plants to allocate the limited energy sources supplied by the seed to maximally grow by elongation, in order to reach favorable light conditions that will provide energy for further growth and development. To faithfully execute these opposing developmental programs, plants have evolved complex mechanisms to perceive light quality and quantity through a whole range of photoreceptors that are mainly absorbing in the blue, red and far-red range of the spectrum. Activation of the blue absorbing CRYPTOCHROMES (crys) and/or the red and far-red absorbing PHYTOCHROMES (phys) overrides the skotomorphogenic program and plants undergo photomorphogenesis within minutes after perception of a light stimulus (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Chory, 2010</a>). On the molecular level, activated light receptors inhibit the function of the core repressor of photomorphogenesis, CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets positive regulators of photomorphogenesis for degradation in darkness (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yi and Deng, 2005</a>). At the same time, a group of potent transcription factors, the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs), which promote skotomorphogenesis in darkness, are degraded upon light perception through the PHYTOCHROMES (<a href=\"#bib28\">Leivar and Quail, 2010</a>). The activities of these pathways converge on the differential regulation of thousands of genes resulting in a massive reprogramming of the transcriptome in response to light (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ma et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tepperman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Peschke and Kretsch, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pfeiffer et al., 2014</a>)."

Plants are able to monitor their metabolic state with several signaling systems (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lastdrager et al., 2014</a>) and recent studies have focused on the evolutionary conserved TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase complex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dobrenel et al., 2016</a>). In other eukaryotes, TOR functions as a central integrator of nutrient, energy, and stress signaling networks\u00a0and\u00a0consistently, TOR regulates cell growth and proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, cell wall integrity and autophagy (<a href=\"#bib14\">D\u00edaz-Troya et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Henriques et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lastdragere et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Xiong and Sheen, 2014</a>). While other eukaryotes possess two TOR complexes, so far only a single complex has been identified in plants. It is comprised of TOR, FKBP12, LST8 and RAPTOR (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mahfouz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Moreau et al., 2012</a>) and thus resembles the mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1). AtTOR is expressed in the embryo and endosperm and in meristematic regions of the adult plant (<a href=\"#bib36\">Menand et al., 2002</a>). While <i>tor</i> null mutants show premature arrest of embryo development (<a href=\"#bib36\">Menand et al., 2002</a>), knock down of TOR leads to growth reduction and affects the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caldana et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, the presence of sugars in general promotes TOR kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ren et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dobrenel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Xiong et al., 2013</a>). So far, the only known direct downstream targets of AtTOR kinase are S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schepetilnikov et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Xiong et al., 2013</a>), TAP46 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahn et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2014</a>) and E2 promoter binding factor a (E2Fa) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xiong et al., 2013</a>). S6K1 plays an important role in reinitiating translation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schepetilnikov et al., 2011</a>) as well as in the regulation of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henriques et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, E2Fa is associated with cell cycle control through the expression of S-phase genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Polyn et al., 2015</a>). Though little is known about how TOR is activated on a molecular level\u00a0in plants, reports from the past decade suggest that TOR functions as a central regulator of protein synthesis, cell proliferation and metabolism in response to metabolic signals."

Stem cells in turn express CLAVATA3 (CLV3), a short secreted peptide, that acts via the CLV /\u00a0CORYNE receptor system to limit the expression of WUS in the organizing\u00a0center (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schoof et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Daum et al., 2014</a>).

With the help of these tools, we were able to genetically dissect the individual contribution of light signaling and photosynthesis-driven nutrient sensing on the stem cell system of the SAM. We show that both pathways ultimately converge at the level of TOR kinase activation, revealing a role for TOR as a central regulator of stem cell activation in response to environmental cues."

However, since light acts as signal and energy source alike, we first asked which of the two roles is dominant for SAM development. While supplementation of sugar to wild-type seedlings grown in the dark is known to be inefficient to trigger development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), activation of the light pathway alone, either physiologically by low level illumination, or genetically by introduction of the <i>cop1</i> mutation, was shown to induce photomorphogenic development of the hypocotyl and cotyledons in darkness (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deng and Quail, 1991</a>). Despite this stark developmental transition, SAMs of <i>cop1</i> mutants were unable to produce organs when grown in the dark. However, the SAM was activated and organogenesis initiated in 100% of the dark-grown <i>cop1</i> mutants when supplemented with sucrose as external energy source (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, see also <a href=\"#bib34\">McNellis et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nakagawa and Komeda, 2004</a>). Conversely, the SAM of light-grown wild-type seedlings remained dormant when photosynthesis was compromised by the carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor norflurazon. In line with our observation of <i>cop1</i> mutants, supplementing the growth medium of these plants with sucrose rescued the dormant phenotype in approximately every third seedling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, neither the availability of energy metabolites, nor light perception alone was sufficient for SAM activation. In contrast, light and energy, likely in the form of photosynthetic products, seemed to be sensed independently, and both factors need to act cooperatively to trigger SAM development."

Therefore, we tested whether the availability of photosynthetic products is a prerequisite for light-induced <i>WUS</i> expression by chemical interference. However, the inhibition of photosynthesis by either norflurazon or lincomycin, did not affect <i>WUS</i> promoter activity in red or in blue light (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In the presence of lincomycin, <i>WUS</i> expression was even slightly increased under both light conditions. To avoid potential side effects of the pharmacological treatments we also tested the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> withdrawal on seedling development and <i>WUS</i> expression. Preventing photosynthetic assimilation in a CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient atmosphere inhibited development of seedlings even when grown in light. This phenotype could be rescued in one third of the plants by adding 1% sucrose to the media, similar to what we observed using norflurazon treatment (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

To confirm that these effects were not caused by second site mutations present in the <i>cop1-4</i> background or specific to the allele tested, we used qRT-PCR to assay <i>WUS</i> expression in seedlings carrying other <i>cop1</i> loss-of-function alleles. However, since this approach lacked the spatial resolution provided by microscopic quantification of the <i>WUS</i> reporter, it proofed to be much less sensitive. Still, we were able to detect accumulation of endogenous <i>WUS</i> mRNA in response to light in 7d old wild-type seedlings, as well as in <i>cop1-4</i> mutants in the dark (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, all three <i>cop1</i> mutant alleles tested showed robust elevation of <i>WUS</i> mRNA levels when grown in the dark (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), demonstrating that loss of COP1 function leads to activation of WUS."

However, <i>hy5</i> mutants were unaffected in activation of <i>WUS</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), suggesting that SAM stem cell activation is dependent on another COP1-targeted transcriptional transducer, such as HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH), or a so far unknown regulator."

We therefore tested the competence of different tissues to perceive light signals and translate them into a stem cell activating output. To this end, we expressed a constitutive active form of phyB (<a href=\"#bib61\">Su and Lagarias, 2007</a>) under different tissue specific promoters (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Expression of phyB Y276H under an ubiquitous promoter (<i>pUBI10</i>) caused strong <i>cop1</i>-like phenotypes and a substantial activation of the <i>WUS</i> promoter in the SAM showing that transgenic activation of light signaling is sufficient to trigger stem cell activation in darkness (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G,H,J</a>). In line with our hypothesis that light is likely perceived by cells outside the SAM, vascular specific expression of phyB Y276H by the <i>pSUC2</i>, or mesophyll specific expression by <i>pCAB3</i> promoters (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ranjan et al., 2011</a>) initiated constitutive photomorphogenic phenotypes and <i>WUS</i> expression in dark-grown seedlings. Similar results were also obtained for the epidermal <i>pML1</i> promoter, in lines showing high expression levels of phyB Y276H (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>). These results suggested that the stimulus\u00a0downstream of light perception can be transmitted between tissues by a mobile signal and raised the question whether the SAM itself even has the ability to respond to light. To explore this, we expressed phyB Y276H specifically in the SAM under the promoter of <i>At3g59270</i> (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yadav et al., 2009</a>), but in contrast to expression outside of the SAM, we observed fully etiolated seedlings without detectable <i>WUS</i> expression when these plants were grown in the dark. Even when we drove <i>PHYB Y276H</i> expression in cells surrounding the organizing center by the promoter of <i>At1g26680</i> (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yadav et al., 2009</a>), we only observed a minor reduction in hypocotyl elongation in darkness compared to wild-type and marginal <i>WUS</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G,H,J</a>). We therefore concluded that light is perceived by cells outside of the SAM, likely in the cotyledons or the hypocotyl and that this stimulus is transmitted to the SAM by a so far unidentified mobile signal. Amazingly, the SAM does not possess the competence to perceive and/or translate the light stimulus into stem cell activation, but rather is limited to responding to the signals that are transmitted from distant plant organs."

Obvious candidates for inter-regional signaling components are plant hormones and there are a number of studies demonstrating their importance in regulating the shoot stem cell niche, especially for cytokinin (CK) and auxin (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib41\">Murray et al., 2012</a>). A previous study had analyzed the environmental influence on organ initiation at the SAM using transfer of light grown tomato plants to darkness as a model and found that light is required for CK signaling and polarized membrane localization of the auxin export carrier PIN1 (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yoshida\u00a0et\u00a0al.,2011</a>). However, these studies could not distinguish whether light was perceived as informational cue or energy source. We therefore analyzed CK signaling activity using the <i>pTCSn:GUS</i> cytokinin output sensor (<a href=\"#bib74\">Z\u00fcrcher et al., 2013</a>) as well as auxin flux directionality using polarization of <i>pPIN1:PIN1-GFP</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benkov\u00e1 et al., 2003</a>) as a proxy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013K</a>). In line with the findings of Yoshida et al., CK signaling was strongly activated by light when compared to etiolated seedlings (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,G</a>). Furthermore, we also found that PIN1 polarly localized to the plasma membrane in a light dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). Interestingly, sucrose treatment of etiolated seedlings did not affect the localization of PIN1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) but lead to a mild activation of the <i>TCS</i> reporter also in the absence of light (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), suggesting that there is specificity in the hormonal response."

While PIN1 localization was still light responsive, no activity of the <i>TCS</i> reporter was detectable under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,J</a>). We also observed a reduction of <i>TCS</i> signal when plants were grown in a CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient environment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Since in both cases <i>TCS</i> reporter activity could be restored by sucrose supplementation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), we concluded that CK signaling output is dependent on the availability of energy metabolites. However, light signaling and photosynthesis together had a much stronger effect on CK output than nutrient availability alone, suggesting that both signals synergize to stimulate CK signaling at the SAM. In contrast, PIN1 localization to the plasma membrane was fully dependent on light perception and could not even be restored by the <i>cop1</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>)."

In line with this idea, the importance of CK in light dependent SAM activation had already been demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chory et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Skylar et al., 2010</a>) and Yoshida et al. had shown that the application of CK to tomato apices can induce organogenesis in the dark (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yoshida\u00a0et\u00a0al.,2011</a>). Consistently, etiolated <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings treated with CK produced leaf like structures even in darkness (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a> and <a href=\"#bib9\">Chory et al. 1994</a>). However, this developmental transition was strictly dependent on the presence of an external energy source, similar to the behavior of <i>cop1</i> mutants and in the absence of sucrose, CK treated seedlings failed to develop leaves in the dark (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>). Thus, our experiments were consistent with CK being an important component of, but not the sole signal for environmental stem cell activation."

                                "text": "Since we had found <i>WUS</i> expression to be a much more sensitive readout for SAM activation than organ development, we made use of our reporter system to dissect the role of CK for overcoming stem cell dormancy. Using hormone treatment assays we found that CK alone was sufficient to induce low levels of <i>WUS</i> expression even in darkness in line with its known role in SAM regulation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gordon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buechel et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, we observed the strongest stimulation of reporter activity in plants on sucrose medium, whereas the light response was largely unaffected by CK treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These results suggested that application of CK can at least partially replace the perception of light and thus supported a role for CK as a mobile transducer for light signals upstream of <i>WUS</i> expression. However, as demonstrated by our results using the <i>TCS</i> reporter, in the absence of energy metabolites downstream CK signaling cannot be fully activated, resulting in a lack of organ development. Having established an environment specific role for CK in the initial steps leading up to stem cell activation, we wondered about the mechanism of regulating endogenous hormone levels. We therefore mined the literature for light responsive genes, expressed in the meristem and functionally related to CK metabolism, perception, or signaling. Only <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE 5 (CKX5</i>), which codes for one of seven homologous cytokinin dehydrogenases involved in CK catabolism in <i>Arabidopsis</i> met all criteria (<a href=\"#bib18\">Frebort et al., 2011</a>). <i>CKX5</i> is a direct transcriptional target of several PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) and is highly expressed in etiolated seedlings as well as under shade conditions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hornitschek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pfeiffer et al., 2014</a>). Similar to <i>cop1</i> mutants, also <i>pifq</i> mutants form leaves in darkness when supplied with sugars externally, therefore the PIFs are likely to play an important role in suppressing SAM activation in darkness (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>CKX6,</i> a close homologue of <i>CKX5,</i> had already been described to limit primordia growth in response to shade treatment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carabelli et al., 2007</a>) and both <i>CKX5</i> and <i>CKX6</i> had been shown to be expressed around the shoot apex (<a href=\"#bib40\">Motyka et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bartrina et al., 2011</a>). When we tested the contribution of <i>CKX5</i> and <i>CKX6</i> to SAM activation by crossing the single mutants to our reporter line, we found that loss of either did not promote <i>WUS</i> activity in the dark as CK treatment. In contrast, the responses to sucrose and light were robustly enhanced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), revealing that genetically removing etiolation specific antagonists of CK accumulation is sufficient to replace one of the essential environmental signals, but not both. Because <i>CKX</i> genes act partially redundantly (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartrina et al., 2011</a>), we decided to remove <i>CKX6</i> in the <i>ckx5</i> mutant reporter background by CRISPR/Cas9. Of 27 plants tested in T1, three were homozygous <i>ckx6</i> mutants, with either insertions or deletions at the 5\u00b4end of the <i>CKX6</i> locus leading to a shift in the reading frame (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Seedlings of all three independent <i>ckx5/ckx6</i> mutant reporter lines were analyzed in the T2 generation and showed comparable effects on <i>WUS</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> includes data from one representative <i>ckx5/ckx6</i> line, AP101.9). In contrast to either single <i>ckx</i> mutant, <i>ckx5/ckx6</i> double mutants showed basal <i>WUS</i> reporter activity in darkness, similar to its behavior under CK treatment. Furthermore, we observed a dramatic enhancement of the effect of sucrose on <i>WUS</i> activity and also light dependent reporter induction was increased two-fold over either single mutant, which was also detectable by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Based on these results we concluded that CKX5 and CKX6 repress activation of the SAM by degradation of the plant hormone CK in darkness. Interestingly, the level of <i>WUS</i> expression in the <i>ckx5/ckx6</i> double mutant background was almost comparable to one found in <i>cop1</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, in striking contrast to <i>cop1</i>, the <i>ckx5/ckx6</i> double mutant displayed a fully etiolated phenotype in darkness (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>), demonstrating that stem cell activation was fully uncoupled from photomorphogenesis in these plants. Thus, CK can act as an interregional transmitter of light signals specifically for <i>WUS</i> expression, but not for general regulators of photomorphogenic growth, suggesting that the developmental integration of light and metabolic signals might occur downstream of CK and locally at the SAM."

To this end, plants were grown on plates supplemented with equimolar amounts (15\u2009mM) of different sugars with diverse energy content for four days in darkness (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). While mannitol, a non-metabolizable sugar, did not affect <i>WUS</i> activity, <i>WUS</i> expression could be observed in etiolated seedlings in the presence of glucose and sucrose, with sucrose being approximately twice as effective as glucose. Conversely, palatinose, a non-metabolizable sugar structurally related to sucrose and able to induce the sugar-dependent bud burst of roses in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib48\">Rabot et al., 2012</a>), was not sufficient to induce <i>WUS</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Using the same experimental setup as described above for glucose we indeed found that light-induced <i>WUS</i> expression was efficiently inhibited by AZD-8055 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This suggested that TOR kinase might play a specific role in light signaling independent of energy production, since the plants were exposed to a rather low light intensity of 30 \u00b5mol*m<sup>\u22122</sup>*s<sup>\u22121</sup>. To further test this, we analyzed TOR dependency in the absence of photosynthesis and found that light dependent <i>WUS</i> expression was repressed by the TOR inhibitor even under norflurazon treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Working under the hypothesis that TOR activity should correlate with energy and light signals if the inhibitor results were meaningful, we quantified the phosphorylation level of the direct TOR target S6K by a phospho-specific antibody (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Surprisingly, light treatment was even more efficient in activating TOR kinase than supplying plants with external glucose. Consistently, <i>cop1-4</i> mutant seedlings displayed high S6K phosphorylation levels under all conditions, including the dark-grown control. Also in this case we were able to detect a similar activation of the TOR pathway in other <i>cop1</i> alleles (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), supporting our previous observation that the TOR pathway is repressed by the negative light signaling component COP1 in darkness. Taken together, TOR kinase seems to play a central and so far underestimated role not only for metabolic, but also for light dependent activation of <i>WUS</i> and ultimately stem cells in the SAM."

                                "text": "After having shown that light and energy status converge to activate stem cells, we wondered about the underlying metabolic changes in response to these environmental cues. We were most interested to analyze metabolic re-programming in response to light signaling because we hypothesized that TOR could be indirectly activated following at least two scenarios: First, since in the wild light signaling and photosynthesis usually go hand in hand, we were wondering whether signaling alone would trigger a metabolic shift in expectation of photosynthesis derived energy metabolites. And second, since <i>COP1</i> regulates more than 20% of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ma et al., 2002</a>), we speculated that this could also extend to the activity of metabolic enzymes. In both cases the metabolic state of the seedlings, especially with respect to glucose levels, could be affected by light signaling and this in turn could indirectly trigger TOR. We therefore analyzed metabolites in seedlings that were subjected to the same experimental workflow as for studying TOR activity described above, namely wild-type and <i>cop1-4</i> seedlings grown in darkness compared to seedlings treated with either 15\u2009mM glucose or light for 24\u2009hr before harvest (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot clearly identified light signaling triggered by the <i>cop1</i> mutation (PC1) and energy availability caused by glucose supplementation (PC2) as the two major components in our sample set, with light treated samples being influenced by both components. Interestingly, glucose treatment only had a mild effect on seedling metabolism. We detected slight increases of glucose, fructose and sucrose as well as a clear increase of mannose levels in glucose treated seedlings, while raffinose levels were reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,H</a>). The fact that under these conditions TOR activity is markedly increased and <i>WUS</i> expression is robustly detectable demonstrates that the energy sensing machinery must be exquisitely sensitive to small changes in metabolite content, most likely glucose. To our surprise, <i>cop1</i> and light treated seedlings showed similar metabolic profiles that were clearly different from the glucose treated samples. Since <i>cop1</i> seedlings were grown in darkness, the metabolic re-programming in <i>cop1</i> and light treated seedlings is likely caused by light signaling dependent transcriptional regulation of metabolic enzymes, rather than simple photosynthesis dependent accumulation of sugars. We detected a clear reduction of fructose and sucrose levels and a decrease in the cell wall monosaccharides fucose, arabinose and galactose in both samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). In addition, ADP and ATP levels were slightly increased by light and <i>cop1</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). <i>Cop1</i> seedlings also displayed an accumulation of glyoxylate, an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle that allows plants to use lipids as carbon source (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Another noteworthy exception from the similarity between <i>cop1</i> and light treated seedlings was glucose. Importantly, only the light- and glucose-treated samples, but not <i>cop1</i> seedlings showed an increase in glucose levels that might be responsible for the observed activation of TOR kinase. However, since it is not known how the TOR complex is activated in plants, we cannot exclude that the obvious metabolic re-programming indirectly triggered TOR kinase activity in <i>cop1</i> seedlings. Nevertheless, since <i>cop1</i> seedlings showed an overall reduction of energy rich metabolites, it seemed unlikely that the nutrient state was exclusively responsible for activation of the TOR pathway in the <i>cop1</i> background."

Conversely, time amino acids whose levels were reported to be increased upon TOR repression (Thr, Tyr, Val, Ile and Leu) were unchanged or reduced in <i>cop1</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caldana et al., 2013</a>). The inverse correlation of amino acid levels in <i>cop1</i> and <i>amiR-tor</i> lines was not apparent in the other samples, suggesting that the permanent de-regulation of the TOR pathway during either <i>cop1</i> or <i>amiR-tor</i> seedling development strongly affected the metabolome while the short term nature of the glucose or light treatments was insufficient for such a profound change."

While most characteristics of skotomorphogenesis can be revoked by the perception of light through the photoreceptors alone, we showed that activation of the SAM in addition requires the presence of energy metabolites. Thus, for stem cell activation, light not only acts as a signal, but also needs to fuel the photosynthetic apparatus to produce sugars and despite the dual role of a single environmental factor, both inputs are sensed independently. Amazingly, it is not stem cell fate that is dependent on these signals, but rather the expression of <i>WUS</i>, which defines the niche and at the same time acts as a mobile stem cell activator. Thus, stem cell fate as defined by <i>CLV3</i> promoter activity can exist without WUS in a physiologically and developmentally relevant setting, strongly suggesting that WUS is not the primary stimulating input for <i>CLV3</i> expression."

Similarly, in light signal transduction, the etiolation regulator COP1 plays a prominent part and <i>cop1</i> mutations can substitute for light in essentially all experiments, apart from PIN1 membrane localization. In contrast, HY5, another core component of the photomorphogenesis network, does not seem to have any apparent role in light dependent stem cell activation. This is even more striking when taking into account the recently discovered role in shoot-to-root signaling of HY5 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2016</a>), and our observation that the meristem region itself does not possess the competence to perceive and process light signals.

Also the activity of the CK output reporter <i>pTCSn:GUS</i> strictly depended on sucrose, but could be further stimulated by light, suggesting that CK signaling mainly acts to transmit light signals, but that elevation of CK levels genetically or by treatment are insufficient to elicit the full developmental response. Based on these results we suggest that light enhances CK levels by reducing the expression of <i>CKX</i> genes, however we cannot rule out other explanations, such as stimulation of CK biosynthesis."

Intriguingly, TOR activity was not only required for the response to energy availability, but also for <i>WUS</i> stimulation by light. This activity was independent of photosynthesis, because the TOR pathway was also activated under norflurazon treatment, in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub> or the suppression of COP1 function. The direct regulation of TOR kinase by light signaling elegantly explains the recently discovered impact of phytochromes on the metabolic state of the plant (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yang et al., 2016</a>), but also represents another striking example of a so far undiscovered re-wiring of a core regulatory component within the stem cell network. Consistently, upstream regulators of TOR kinase described in other organisms are not well conserved in plants (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dobrenel et al., 2016</a>) and thus evolution seems to have found alternative mechanisms to activate the TOR pathway in a highly context dependent manner. Coupling light and energy sensing via TOR could help plants to prepare for the dramatic developmental transition from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis, which involves transcriptional re-programming of almost a quarter of the genome (<a href=\"#bib30\">L\u00f3pez-Juez et al., 2008</a>). Light dependent activation of TOR kinase could allow etiolated seedlings to build up the photosynthetic apparatus, initiate ribosome biogenesis and prime stem cells via the expression of <i>WUS</i> to efficiently shift gear towards organogenic growth and development, once energy becomes available."

Several analyses are based on experiments with a mutant in COP1, a central negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. Understandably, the authors use one of the viable <i>cop1</i> alleles in their work, the <i>cop1-4</i> mutant. However, within the <i>cop1</i> allelic series, this allele has always been the most mysterious. Unlike true null alleles, <i>cop1-4</i> produces a truncated protein that comprises both the RING finger and coiled coil domains, yet alleles that retain these domains as well but are truncated further C-terminal or carry certain point mutations in the WD40 repeat domain also have a strong phenotype."

In particular, the authors could repeat the experiment of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5E</a>. They could also try to detect the effect of <i>cop1</i> on <i>WUS</i> expression by qPCR instead of a reporter, the difference appears strong enough although it is restricted to few cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

If their conclusions with respect to <i>cop1</i> are right, multiple mutants combining various COP1 targets should eventually show the pertinent defect. Among others, the <i>hy5 hyh</i> double mutant comes to mind. In the shoot, HYH is stronger expressed than HY5, and <i>hy5 hyh</i> double mutants have been reported to have meristematic defects, like \"delayed\" organ formation. I believe the authors should check light-dependent SAM activation at least in <i>hyh</i> single and <i>hy5 hyh</i> double mutants, and maybe also pertinent triple mutants with additional factors."

The SAM is dormant in etiolated seedlings and gets activated upon light perception. As shown previously the SAM of etiolated <i>cop1</i> seedlings is activated by adding sugar thereby leading to the formation of leaves (even flowers) in darkness. This suggests that both light signals (constitutively on in <i>cop1</i>) and metabolic signals cooperate to enable SAM activation. The authors explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this activation. The authors show that the <i>CLV3</i> expression domain is rather constant across conditions while <i>WUS</i> expression is induced by light. A number of experiments indicate that this light activation comprises both light and metabolic signals. TOR is implicated in the metabolic regulation of <i>WUS</i> expression while the phytohormone CK is involved in light regulation of <i>WUS</i> expression. This paper should be of broad interested for developmental biologists. Below I list a few issues that the authors should clarify."

How can we be sure that NF and Linc were really effective in the experiment shown in 2A? More generally, if at all possible it would more elegant/convincing to show the role of light on the production of sugars by performing at least one experiment in a CO<sub>2</sub> free environment (see for example Kircher and Schopfer 2012). This would not lead to the rather drastic effects of these drugs on chloroplasts. In principle the effect of CO<sub>2</sub>-free air could be complemented by adding sucrose. Haydon et al., 2013 also complemented the NF effect by adding sucrose which to some extent rules out non-specific effects of NF."

The authors propose that CK promote <i>WUS</i> expression by transmitting the light signal (e.g. subsection \u201cMechanisms of hormonal stem cell activation\u201d, end of last paragraph). In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> one can observe that light-grown plants treated with NF still show strong <i>WUS</i> expression. However, on <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a> light grown seedlings treated with NF show absolutely no TCS:GUS signal, indicating no CK activity. How then could such seedlings express <i>WUS</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) given that the metabolic signal should be gone (in the presence of NF) and TCS:GUS is also gone? A second problem with the model is the role of light-regulated <i>CKX5/6</i> expression. The authors propose that this is how light regulates the CK function in this process. However, light regulation of <i>WUS</i> expression is just as robust in the <i>ckx5/ckx6</i> double mutant than in the WT (4B). It therefore rather appears that these genes are involved in basal regulation of <i>WUS</i> expression and not in light regulation. It would actually be interesting to test this by adding sucrose to the double mutant and look for signs of leaf development in darkness rather than hypocotyl elongation as shown in supplementary <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

If their conclusions with respect to cop1 are right, multiple mutants combining various COP1 targets should eventually show the pertinent defect.

How can we be sure that NF and Linc were really effective in the experiment shown in 2A? More generally, if at all possible it would more elegant/convincing to show the role of light on the production of sugars by performing at least one experiment in a CO<sub>2</sub> free environment (see for example Kircher and Schopfer 2012). This would not lead to the rather drastic effects of these drugs on chloroplasts. In principle the effect of CO<sub>2</sub>-free air could be complemented by adding sucrose. Haydon et al., 2013 also complemented the NF effect by adding sucrose which to some extent rules out non-specific effects of NF.</i>"

The authors propose that CK promote WUS expression by transmitting the light signal (e.g. subsection \u201cMechanisms of hormonal stem cell activation\u201d, end of last paragraph). In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> one can observe that light-grown plants treated with NF still show strong WUS expression. However, on <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a> light grown seedlings treated with NF show absolutely no TCS:GUS signal, indicating no CK activity. How then could such seedlings express WUS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) given that the metabolic signal should be gone (in the presence of NF) and TCS:GUS is also gone? A second problem with the model is the role of light-regulated CKX5/6 expression. The authors propose that this is how light regulates the CK function in this process. However, light regulation of WUS expression is just as robust in the ckx5/ckx6 double mutant than in the WT (4B). It therefore rather appears that these genes are involved in basal regulation of WUS expression and not in light regulation. It would actually be interesting to test this by adding sucrose to the double mutant and look for signs of leaf development in darkness rather than hypocotyl elongation as shown in supplementary <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>.</i>"

Therefore, additional development promoting components are still missing in line with the CKX genes being only one element in the system. The reviewer is also right to point out the discrepancy between WUS activation and TCS activity, but since TCS is merely a read out B-type ARR activity and not of CK levels, and we have no knowledge on the relative sensitivities of the two promoters, or the directness of WUS regulation, we are unable to provide any further mechanistic insight into that matter at the moment."
