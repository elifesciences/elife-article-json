                    "text": "NMDA receptors, which regulate synaptic strength and are implicated in learning and memory, consist of several subtypes with distinct subunit compositions and functional properties. To enable spatiotemporally defined, rapid and reproducible manipulation of function of specific subtypes, we engineered a set of photoswitchable GluN subunits ('LiGluNs'). Photo-agonism of GluN2A or GluN2B elicits an excitatory drive to hippocampal neurons that can be shaped in time to mimic synaptic activation. Photo-agonism of GluN2A at single dendritic spines evokes spine-specific calcium elevation and expansion, the morphological correlate of LTP. Photo-antagonism of GluN2A alone, or in combination with photo-antagonism of GluN1a, reversibly blocks excitatory synaptic currents, prevents the induction of long-term potentiation and prevents spine expansion. In addition, photo-antagonism in vivo disrupts synaptic pruning of developing retino-tectal projections in larval zebrafish. By providing precise and rapidly reversible optical control of NMDA receptor subtypes, LiGluNs should help unravel the contribution of specific NMDA receptors to synaptic transmission, integration and plasticity."

To enable spatiotemporally defined, rapid and reproducible manipulation of function of specific subtypes, we engineered a set of photoswitchable GluN subunits ('LiGluNs'). Photo-agonism of GluN2A or GluN2B elicits an excitatory drive to hippocampal neurons that can be shaped in time to mimic synaptic activation. Photo-agonism of GluN2A at single dendritic spines evokes spine-specific calcium elevation and expansion, the morphological correlate of LTP. Photo-antagonism of GluN2A alone, or in combination with photo-antagonism of GluN1a, reversibly blocks excitatory synaptic currents, prevents the induction of long-term potentiation and prevents spine expansion. In addition, photo-antagonism in vivo disrupts synaptic pruning of developing retino-tectal projections in larval zebrafish. By providing precise and rapidly reversible optical control of NMDA receptor subtypes, LiGluNs should help unravel the contribution of specific NMDA receptors to synaptic transmission, integration and plasticity."

They trigger long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength and are implicated in memory formation, synapse development, circuit refinement, neuropsychiatric disorders, excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lau and Zukin, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nabavi et al., 2014</a>). NMDA receptors are heterotetramers, consisting of two glycine-binding GluN1 subunits paired with two glutamate-binding GluN2 and/or glycine-binding GluN3 subunits, yielding a combinatorial diversity of channel composition and function (<a href=\"#bib68\">Paoletti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Traynelis et al., 2010</a>). The glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits (GluN2A-D) are encoded by four genes, which appear at specific developmental stages, bind distinct regulatory proteins, and are situated at diverse cellular locations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</a>). The complexity of subunit stoichiometry and receptor localization has made it difficult to unravel the roles of NMDA receptor signaling in circuit function and behavior."

However, pharmacological agents need to be used at low concentrations to maintain selectivity, resulting in slow onset, and are slow to wash out due to high affinity, are\u00a0difficult to confine spatially, and generally cannot be targeted to a specific cell. Genetic manipulations, like gene-knockout or RNA-interference, provide subunit-specificity, but are either for the life of the organism or, when conditional, slow to turn on and cannot typically be turned off. These chronic effects can lead to circuit changes and compensation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Nakazawa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Rossi et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, the ability to confine these manipulations to specific brain regions and cell types is limited. The problems of spatial and temporal control have been addressed by the advent of caged versions of glutamate, NMDA and the pore blocker MK-801, which can be photo-uncaged in very small volumes at precise times (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kohl et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Palma-Cerda et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Rodr\u00edguez-Moreno et al., 2011</a>). MK-801 can work from inside the cell and, therefore, can be loaded <i>via</i> the patch pipet, whereas glutamate and NMDA cannot and so cannot be targeted precisely to a specific cell; furthermore, none of these compounds are selective for receptor subtype. A recent development has been the subunit-specific control of an ion channel with a photo-reactive unnatural amino acid that enables photo-inactivation. So far, this methodology has been applied to a potassium channel (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kang et al., 2013</a>), AMPA receptor (<a href=\"#bib39\">Klippenstein et al., 2014</a>) and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib106\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>).

The first three LiGluN subunits enable selective manipulation of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing receptors, whereas the fourth operates as a general controller of <span class=\"underline\">all</span> plasma membrane NMDA receptors, owing to the obligatory occurrence of GluN1 in all NMDA\u00a0receptors. We show that LiGluN-containing NMDA receptors function normally, incorporate into synapses, and that their expression does not alter NMDA receptor expression levels. Photoswitching can be sculpted to generate NMDA receptor currents that mimic the fast (GluN2A-like) or slow (GluN2B-like) deactivation kinetics of native excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Widefield illumination and photo-activation of LiGluN2A or LiGluN2B-containing receptors in primary hippocampal neurons robustly drives activity, whereas photo-antagonism of LiGluN2A and LiGluN1a reversibly block excitatory synaptic currents. Spatially-targeted photo-activation of LiGluN2A-containing receptors on single dendritic spines can be used to trigger a spine-specific increase in calcium and the spine expansion that is associated with LTP. Complementarily to this, photo-antagonism of LiGluN2A-containing receptors can block LTP-induction via Schaffer collateral stimulation or prevent spine expansion. LiGluNs fulfill a major promise of chemical optogenetic photo-pharmacology by providing the kind of spatio-temporally precise control that is obtained with heterologous microbial opsins, that over-ride normal cellular signals, but in this case to control the native neuronal signaling proteins of the synapse that play central roles in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Together, these tools may open the door to advanced studies of receptor biophysics, and their function in synapses and neural circuits."

Since the isomerization of the azobenzene is fast (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib73\">Reiner and Isacoff, 2014</a>) and fully reversible, opening and closing of the channels could be accomplished by toggling between near-UV and green-light illumination, at various frequencies and repeatedly, to mimic various physiological patterns (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b,c</a>). No inhibition of the current was observed during photo-agonism in the presence of saturating glutamate or NMDA, suggesting that when MAG in its <i>cis</i> form competes with free glutamate in LiGluN2A, and is as good an agonist as glutamate."

                                "text": "MAG photoswitching provides two advantageous properties for the remote control of NMDA receptors. First, since the speed of MAG photoswitching depends on light intensity so that switching can be achieved either with short high intensity pulses or longer low intensity pulses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gorostiza et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Reiner and Isacoff, 2014</a>), it should be possible to sculpt the photocurrent to resemble NMDA receptor excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC<sub>NMDA</sub>). Using LiGluN2A(V713C) conjugated to L-MAG1, a 2 ms pulse of 375 nm light could be used to trigger substantial receptor activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>), with the fast rise kinetics comparable to those of EPSC<sub>NMDA</sub> kinetics observed for GluN2A-containing synaptic NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bidoret et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Erreger and Traynelis, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Vicini et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>). Then, off-photoswiching could be triggered over tens of milliseconds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a>), as typical of GluN2A, or more slowly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h</a>) to mimic the slower GluN2B deactivation kinetics (<a href=\"#bib15\">Erreger and Traynelis, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Vicini et al., 1998</a>). Triggering these EPSC<sub>NMDA</sub> waveforms by only regulating light intensity avoids the need for piezo-driven fast perfusion systems and a cocktail of inhibitors typically used to isolate EPSCs<sub>NMDA</sub>. Since variations in the off-kinetics leads to variation in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration, this kind of control could be employed to study the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and specific NMDA receptor subtypes in the induction of LTP and LTD, as it is still debated how the magnitude, temporal pattern and NMDA receptor subunit type contribute to plasticity changes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cummings et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">K\u00f6hr et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Pawlak et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Shipton and Paulsen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Zhou et al., 2005</a>). A second advantageous property is the bistability of MAG photoswitches (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gorostiza et al., 2007</a>). After switching with a brief 380 nm light pulse, photo-agonism (or photo-antagonism, as described below) is sustained in the dark for extended periods of time, until it is reversed by a brief 500 nm light pulse, as illustrated in both hippocampal neurons, (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1i</a>) and HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3e</a>)."

The largest photo-antagonism was generated by L-MAG0 anchored at G712C of the GluN2A subunit when expressed in hippocampal neurons (56.4 \u00b1 2.9% inhibition of the total current induced by 1 mM NMDA, n\u00a0=\u00a07) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b, c and f</a>), similar to the block observed in HEK293 cells (65.8 \u00b1 4.3% inhibition of the total current induced by 1 mM glutamate in HEK cells, n\u00a0=\u00a09). This photo-antagonism is on par with the antagonism of GluN2A by NVP-AAM077, when applied at concentrations that maintain subunit selectivity (<a href=\"#bib58\">Monaghan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Neyton and Paoletti, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Paoletti and Neyton, 2007</a>), and so, although incomplete (likely due to labeling efficiency, see below and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), would be predicted to have utility. Whereas the specific photo-antagonism of GluN2A enables fast, reversible inhibition of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors <i>only</i>, we also sought to develop a general tool for photo-antagonizing <i>all</i> NMDA receptor-subtypes within a given neuron, by creating a photo-antagonized GluN1. The GluN1 subunit is activated by glycine or D-serine, but not glutamate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). In fact, GluN1 antagonists resemble MAG in that they consist of an \u03b1-amino acid attached to a larger structure that prevents closure of the LBD (<a href=\"#bib31\">Inanobe et al., 2005</a>). We therefore reasoned that MAG tethered near the GluN1 ligand binding pocket would prevent normal agonist binding when photo-docked and would thereby function as a photo-antagonist. Indeed, a screen of cysteine mutants around the glycine-binding pocket identified a labeling site, E406C, where L-MAG0 functioned as photo-antagonist (30.7 \u00b1 1.7% inhibition of the total current neurons, n\u00a0=\u00a06) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b, d and f</a>), without affecting the glycine potency of the subunit (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2e,f</a>). When the photo-antagonizable GluN1a(E406C) and GluN2A(G712C) subunits were co-expressed in dissociated hippocampal neurons and incubated with L-MAG0, their combined effect resulted in 73.8 \u00b1 5.2% (n = 4) photo-inhibition of the total NMDA-induced current in neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e,f</a>)."

Then, Schaffer collaterals were stimulated at 0.03\u2009Hz and evoked EPSCs were recorded from CA1 neurons for a 8-minute baseline period. Illumination was then applied for 2 s at either 390 nm (photo-antagonism ON; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>, violet) or 497 nm (photo-antagonism OFF; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>, green). Because of the bistability of MAG (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1i</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3e</a>), LiGluNs remain blocked (following violet light) or unblocked (following green light) in the dark for many minutes. Following the brief illumination protocol, we immediately applied a tetanic stimulation with a pair of 1\u00a0s long 100\u2009Hz bursts in the dark. Stimulation was then returned to 0.03\u2009Hz for an extended period to measure changes in synaptic strength (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Slices, in which L-MAG0 was maintained in <i>trans</i> (photo-antagonism off) by green light, exhibited robust LTP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>, black circles; EPSC amplitude increased to 185 <span class=\"underline\">+</span> 31% (n\u00a0=\u00a010) of baseline, averaged over 20\u201330\u2009min. post-tetanus; summary in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>), whereas slices in which L-MAG0 was switched to <i>cis</i> (photo-antagonism on) by violet light did not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>, open circles; EPSC amplitude dropped to 67 <span class=\"underline\">+</span> 28% (n\u00a0=\u00a010) of baseline, averaged over 20\u201330\u2009min. post-tetanus; summary in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). Slices to which L-MAG0 was not added, but which were illuminated at 390 nm, exhibited the same level of LTP as those labeled with L-MAG0 and illuminated with 497 nm light (174 <span class=\"underline\">+</span> 31.74%, n\u00a0= 4), demonstrating that the light protocol did not interfere with the generation of LTP and that the\u00a0block of LTP-induction is a specific outcome of photo-antagonism. Thus, photo-antagonism of post-synaptic NMDA receptors can be used to gate the induction of LTP that is induced by presynaptic bursts of action potentials."

The 405 nm illumination was well-confined (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>) and reliably induced spine expansion (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) when LiGluN2A was transfected, as shown earlier for GluN2A-<i>wt</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</a>), but stable expansion did not occur in slices that were not transfected with LiGluN2A (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). To determine if the spine expansion that is triggered by glutamate uncaging could be prevented by photo-antagonism of LiGluN (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>), we co-expressed LiGluN2A(G712C) and LiGluN1a(406C) with tdTomato and labeled the slices with L-MAG0.

In this experimental design, the second bout of uncaging was crucial to determining that a spine that did not respond to the first bout of uncaging was nevertheless competent to expand, asmany spines are not (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lynch et al., 2013</a>). The first uncaging bout, during GluN1a/GluN2A photo-antagonism, induced only a small, transient increase in spine head volume, which peaked in 1 min (<i>F<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>i</sub></i> = 1.18 \u00b1 0.07 of baseline, n = 12, p&gt;0.1, two tailed, paired t-test) and shrank back to near baseline (<i>F<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>i</sub></i> F = 1.05 \u00b1 0.05 of baseline, n = 12, p&gt;0.1, two tailed, paired t-test) within 5 min (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>, red symbols), indicating a lack of the long-lasting expansion that is associated with LTP (<a href=\"#bib99\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). After turning off the GluN1a/GluN2A photo-antagonism with green light, the second bout of near-spine glutamate uncaging induced a large persistent expansion (<i>F<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>i\u00a0</sub></i>= 1.47 \u00b1 0.13 compared to new moderately elevated baseline between t = 3\u2009min and 15\u2009min, n = 12, p&lt;0.01, two tailed, paired t-test) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>, red symbols). Nearby, non-illuminated spines did not respond (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b and c</a>, black symbols). These experiments show that photo-antagonism of GluN1a/GluN2A can block the induction of spine expansion and that this block is reversible, enabling a morphological correlate of LTP to be gated temporally at single synapses."

The photo-agonized subunits can be photoactivated to yield persistent currents or be sculpted in time to mimic synaptic activation of the receptors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Photo-antagonism blocks the effects of perfused ligands (glutamate/NMDA) and of synaptically released glutamate, thus controlling NMDA receptor mediated EPSCs and LTP.

Fortunately, in some preparations, GluN2A overexpression does not appear to increase synaptic content of NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barria and Malinow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Prybylowski et al., 2002</a>), most likely because of the limiting supply of the native obligatory partner GluN1 subunit. We find that expression of LiGluN2A makes NMDA receptors sensitive to light without altering whole cell NMDA-induced current or NMDA receptor EPSCs evoked by action potential-driven glutamate release at autaptic synapses. The degree of photo-block of NMDA receptor EPSCs in autapses from neurons from <i>wt</i> rats (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) is small on average (mean 25\u201335%, range ~20\u201350% without inclusion of non-responding cells, see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but shows that functional light-controlled receptors can be obtained in a wild-type background where the LiGluN subunits compete with <i>wt</i> subunits to assemble into receptors that are properly trafficked to the plasma membrane of the synapses. It should be noted that, the expression of the photoswitchable subunits in a wild-type background where the native subunit is expressed yielded variable effects, ranging from very strong block to no block at all (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). This may result from a combination of factors, including variation in expression level that results in variable\u00a0incorporation into GluN2-containing\u00a0receptors. Nevertheless, in responding cells, regardless of the magnitude of fractional optical control, the control is reproducible (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). The degree of photo-block in other preparations, such as organotypic slices from the GluN2A-KO mice, where we demonstrated block of LTP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and either induction or block of spine expansion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>), is likely greater because of absence of the native GluN2A subunit."

For photouncaging experiments, 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged-L-glutamate (MNI-glutamate, Tocris) was added to the bath (0.5 mM) and uncaged with a short 375 nm laser pulse centered at the cell (~50 W/mm<sup>2</sup>, ~ 15 \u03bcm spot diameters). Uncaging pulses of 0.5 ms, 1 ms and 2 ms yielded identical activation kinetics, demonstrating that these reflected the intrinsic receptor activation kinetics rather than concentration-dependent second order binding. Deactivation due to diffusion of glutamate out of the uncaging site occurred on the timescale of seconds and became slower, as more glutamate was uncaged with longer pulse lengths. Rise times (10\u201390%) were used to describe the speed of activation and were compared to <i>wt</i>-receptors using two-tailed, unpaired t-tests."

The authors employ a previously developed strategy to render different NMDAR subunits sensitive to light, by incorporating cysteines in key locations in the glutamate binding pocket of GluN subunits, allowing attachment of photoswitch-tethered ligands (a maleimide and a photoisomerizable azobenzine-glutamate) that when exposed to UV light enable activation or inactivation. The authors performed a detailed analysis of photo-antagonism and photo-agonism of these constructs in HEK cells, cultured neurons and in brain slices, demonstrating their ability to modulate NMDAR signaling at synapses to control excitation and plasticity with unprecedented precision. One major advantage of this approach is that the alteration of receptors is reversible, as the ligands can be switched from inactive trans to active cis states by different wavelengths of light. Remarkably, overexpression of these modified receptors does not appear to alter normal synaptic function (e.g. lead to enhanced NMDARs at synapses or alter the ability of endogenous glutamate to activate these receptors) and activation of photoswitches appears affected primarily NMDARs, despite the many accessible cysteines found in other proteins. Thus, it is likely that these tools will be very useful in defining the roles of distinct NMDAR subunits in synaptic function and plasticity, and provide a new optogenetic approach for eliciting cellular excitation."

Some are spectacular, e.g. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> is very strong. In other aspects, the approach is piecemeal. Effects on spine size are of exceptional interest, but what does photo-antagonism of synaptic currents look like on a KO? Is the effect limited by labelling in slice? Or by the ratio of wt:mut subunits? It's possible that long stimulation overcomes this problem for the photo-agonism experiments. No matter the results on LTP and spines, which are strong, the labelling/efficiency question is very important. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, the effect is small and not much of much practical use. What happens on a KO background? Is the effect small because of limited labelling, or because of limited expression, or both or is it something else? This paper primarily introduces a tool. If the authors want their tool to be widely accepted, this kind of information is essential. The simplest way to address this is \u2013 to what extent are synaptic currents inhibited on KO background? If this experiment can't or won't be done, then there must be an explanation of this caveat in the paper. I would not include the latter (albeit impressive) effects on spines as a justification that the effect of light is all or nothing. We don't know how much NMDA current is needed for the effects on spines."

The main question that arose had to do with the reporting of results relating to the efficiency of the manipulations in a manner that would be most useful the readers who might wish to implement the technique. A specific issue was the separation of responding and non-responding wild-type cells after transfection. The basis for this separation was not clearly stated in the manuscript, and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> came across as ambiguous, since the 4 non-responding cells of 10 tested were neither reported nor illustrated in the main text. Because the strength of this manuscript lies in the development of tools, the reviewers agree that a clear statement here and throughout the manuscript of n values and fraction of cells responding is crucial for others to evaluate the usefulness of the technique. A related point is that in our discussion of the reviews, the reviewers raised the possibility that the fraction of non-responders could result either from efficiency of labeling (as stated in the text) or from expression of the target (not stated in the text), which you may wish to comment upon.

My interpretation is that these cells were transfected, exposed to MAG but did not get inhibited. Otherwise, they would be controls of some description. 6 further cells were used (in each case pooled across 2 conditions) and are shown in the main figure. The non-responders are not included in the average effect. They did have typical synaptic currents, in 3 out of 4 cases. The statistical analysis for inhibition included in the supplementary figure seems distinct from that for the tau and epsc size. Overall, for whatever reason, be it weak/variable expression of the target subunits, or poor labelling with the optically active element, the impression I have here is that 6/10 experiments gave inhibition, but 4/10 did not. Thus, the range cited in the third paragraph of the Discussion is misleading.

The main question that arose had to do with the reporting of results relating to the efficiency of the manipulations in a manner that would be most useful the readers who might wish to implement the technique. A specific issue was the separation of responding and non-responding wild-type cells after transfection. The basis for this separation was not clearly stated in the manuscript, and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> came across as ambiguous, since the 4 non-responding cells of 10 tested were neither reported nor illustrated in the main text. Because the strength of this manuscript lies in the development of tools, the reviewers agree that a clear statement here and throughout the manuscript of n values and fraction of cells responding is crucial for others to evaluate the usefulness of the technique. A related point is that in our discussion of the reviews, the reviewers raised the possibility that the fraction of non-responders could result either from efficiency of labeling (as stated in the text) or from expression of the target (not stated in the text), which you may wish to comment upon. The full reviews are included below. Reviewer #1: The authors have made a comprehensive response that largely answers all the previously raised points of difficulty. However, the analysis that has been added to answer concerns about the fundamental mechanisms underlying partial effects is itself possibly problematic. <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> indicates 4 non-responding cells. My interpretation is that these cells were transfected, exposed to MAG but did not get inhibited. Otherwise, they would be controls of some description. 6 further cells were used (in each case pooled across 2 conditions) and are shown in the main figure. The non-responders are not included in the average effect. They did have typical synaptic currents, in 3 out of 4 cases. The statistical analysis for inhibition included in the supplementary figure seems distinct from that for the tau and epsc size. Overall, for whatever reason, be it weak/variable expression of the target subunits, or poor labelling with the optically active element, the impression I have here is that 6/10 experiments gave inhibition, but 4/10 did not. Thus, the range cited in the third paragraph of the Discussion is misleading. If the authors want to exclude these cells for an objective reason, they should state in the main figure, and where they cite the range, that 4 cells were excluded.</i> "

We note that non-responding cells were excluded from the averages shown in the main figure in both legends (main <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) because of the very small degree of block (&lt;10%). These small effects (though likely real) are hard to discern from the naturally occurring rundown that results from the depletion of the ready-releasable pool of vesicles, as shown by Goda and Stevens (Goda &amp; Stevens, 1998) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> legend). Therefore, we applied this rigorous exclusion criteria to prevent inclusion of rundown-dependent decreases in EPSC amplitude."

If I have understood correctly, these data indicate that, on a wild-type background, the method is not that reliable. There is a stark contrast here with the very reproducible and important effects when rescuing GluN2A expression on a knockout background, and the new results in zebrafish which are also convincing. There is no sense in which this limitation with wild-type backgrounds detracts from the overall study and its groundbreaking nature. The weak and variable effects are not surprising and can be circumvented with standard methods (genetically-targeted animals). But at the moment, I have the impression that authors are not accurately reporting the work on wild-type backgrounds.</i> We have rephrased our conclusions to clarify this issue. We note that the expression of the light-gated variants in a wild-type background yielded variable effects, ranging from very strong block to no block at all (Discussion, third paragraph). These observations may result from a combination of factors, among which the variable replacement of the endogenous receptors likely plays a major role. However, in responding cells, despite the small fractional optical control, the control is reproducible (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."
