Despite its profound effects, the cellular processes affected by aneuploidy are not well characterized. Here, we examined the consequences of aneuploidy on the proteome of aneuploid budding yeast strains. We show that although protein levels largely scale with gene copy number, subunits of multi-protein complexes are notable exceptions. Posttranslational mechanisms attenuate their expression when their encoding genes are in excess. Our proteomic analyses further revealed a novel aneuploidy-associated protein expression signature characteristic of altered metabolism and redox homeostasis. Indeed aneuploid cells harbor increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, increased protein turnover attenuates ROS levels and this novel aneuploidy-associated signature and improves the fitness of most aneuploid strains. Our results show that aneuploidy causes alterations in metabolism and redox homeostasis. Cells respond to these alterations through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms."

Despite its profound effects, the cellular processes affected by aneuploidy are not well characterized. Here, we examined the consequences of aneuploidy on the proteome of aneuploid budding yeast strains. We show that although protein levels largely scale with gene copy number, subunits of multi-protein complexes are notable exceptions. Posttranslational mechanisms attenuate their expression when their encoding genes are in excess. Our proteomic analyses further revealed a novel aneuploidy-associated protein expression signature characteristic of altered metabolism and redox homeostasis. Indeed aneuploid cells harbor increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, increased protein turnover attenuates ROS levels and this novel aneuploidy-associated signature and improves the fitness of most aneuploid strains. Our results show that aneuploidy causes alterations in metabolism and redox homeostasis. Cells respond to these alterations through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms."

How do these cells cope with this excess? Previous work identified one strategy where a gene called <i>UBP6</i> is mutated to prevent it from working correctly. The <i>UBP6</i> gene normally encodes a protein that removes a small tag (called ubiquitin) from other proteins. This tag normally marks other proteins that should be degraded; thus, if <i>UBP6</i> is not working, more proteins are broken down."

In general, the amount of each protein produced by these yeast increased depending on the number of extra copies of the matching genes found on the extra chromosome. However, this was not the case for around 20% of the proteins, which were found in lower amounts than expected. Dephoure et al. revealed that this was not because fewer proteins were made, but because more were broken down. These proteins may be targeted for degradation because they are unstable, as many of these proteins need to bind to other proteins to keep them stable\u2014but these stabilizing proteins are not also over-produced."

However, Dephoure et al. found that, as well as reducing the number of proteins produced, deleting the <i>UBP6</i> gene also increased the fitness of the cells. Targeting the protein encoded by the <i>UBP6</i> gene, or others that also stop proteins being broken down, could therefore help to reduce the negative effects of aneuploidy for a cell. Whether targeting these genes or proteins could also help to treat the diseases and disorders that result from aneuploidy, such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease, remains to be investigated."

Furthermore, they exhibit increased sensitivity to inhibitors of protein translation, degradation, or folding (<a href=\"#bib46\">Torres et al., 2007</a>). Aneuploid mammalian cells are also sensitive to compounds that interfere with protein quality control mechanisms such as chaperone activity or autophagy (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tang et al., 2011</a>).

The majority of the attenuated proteins are components of multi-subunit complexes. This finding has implications not only for understanding how cells respond to aneuploidy, but also for how protein complexes are formed and maintained in euploid cells. Importantly, our analysis revealed the existence of both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally mediated protein expression changes indicative of slow growth as well as oxidative and metabolic stress.

Because aneuploidy increases genomic instability including higher rates of chromosome loss, disomic strains are grown in medium that selects for the presence of the duplicated chromosome (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In addition, SILAC relies on the use of synthetic medium supplemented with \u2018heavy\u2019 or \u2018light\u2019 amino acids. To determine whether growth conditions affect the proteome composition of disomic strains, we grew cells in rich medium (YEPD) for a small number of generations and utilized isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative mass spectrometry (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) to assess the proteome of the 12 disomic yeast strains. In total, we obtained quantitative information for \u223c65\u201374% of all verified ORFs in the disomes relative to wild-type-cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). As seen in the SILAC-based quantifications, analysis of protein levels of genes encoded on the duplicated chromosomes of 12 disomes showed an average increase of \u223ctwofold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The log<sub>2</sub> ratios of control wild-type/wild-type cells showed low noise and high reproducibility in the data (SD of log<sub>2</sub> ratios = 0.2, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Importantly, comparison of the changes in gene expression and protein abundances of disomes compared to wild-type cells grown under similar conditions revealed significant correlations between mRNA and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). These results indicate that on average, increases in gene copy number lead to proportional increases in mRNA and protein levels independent of growth conditions."

Whether dosage compensation also occurs on autosomes and if so, which genes are affected and how it is brought about are critical questions not only to understand the effects of aneuploidy but also to understand how protein homeostasis is maintained in normal cells. Our set of disomic yeast strains, which comprises duplications of 12 of the 16 chromosomes (corresponding to 73% of the yeast genome), allowed us to address this question. We grew the 12 disomic strains in rich medium, split the cultures and analyzed mRNA and protein levels. In total, we obtained quantitative information for both mRNA and protein, reported as log<sub>2</sub> ratios, for 2,581 genes located on duplicated chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) and 39,011 paired measurements for genes on non-duplicated chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). The ratios of mRNA levels of duplicated genes fit a normal distribution with a mean increase of 1.9-fold (SD = 0.3 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Parallel analysis of the corresponding protein changes did not fit as well to a normal distribution (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96, Pearson's mode skewness = \u22120.12). Nonlinear regression analysis of the protein data best fit a sum of two normal distributions; one with a mean increase of twofold, the other with a significantly reduced mean increase of \u223c1.6-fold (R<sup>2</sup> = 1.00, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, analysis of both mRNA and protein changes of non-duplicated genes showed nearly perfect normal distributions (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). These analyses indicate that although acquisition of an extra chromosome leads on average to twofold increases in mRNA levels of the duplicated genes, a large and statistically significant number of proteins do not increase proportionally with copy number. Importantly, neither the growth conditions nor the quantitative approach affected the degree of attenuation, as analysis of mRNA and protein levels from cells grown in selective medium and analyzed by SILAC showed similar results (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Using a stringent cutoff of log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 0.6 (3*SD) lower than the expected value of 1.0, we identified a total of 550 proteins encoded by the duplicated chromosomes that were significantly attenuated in disomic strains grown in rich medium (\u223c21% of detected ORFs). Gene ontology analysis revealed that components of macromolecular complexes were significantly enriched (369 of 550, p value = 5.1 E\u221232), including all ribosomal subunits detected (113 of 550, p value = 6.2 E\u221243) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). Furthermore, enrichment of subunits of macromolecular complexes among the attenuated proteins was observed for every disome analyzed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Analysis of the identity of the attenuated proteins in disomes grown in selective medium and analyzed by SILAC showed similar results; a significant number of proteins encoded by genes located on the duplicated chromosomes were attenuated in every disomic strain and components of macromolecular complexes were significantly enriched (295 of 486, p value = 2.7 E\u221217, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). Importantly, there was a significant overlap between the two experiments; 287 proteins (57%) were significantly attenuated in both experiments (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Among these proteins, 76% are subunits of macromolecular complexes (218 of 287)."

Consistent with our findings presented here, preliminary analyses indicated that subunits of macromolecular complexes were enriched among the dosage compensated genes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Torres et al., 2010</a>). A subsequent quantitative proteomic study of five aneuploid yeasts obtained as progeny from triploid or pentaploid meioses found no evidence for the attenuation of proteins that form multi-subunit complexes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pavelka et al., 2010</a>). To better understand this discrepancy, we analyzed the protein measurements generated by <a href=\"#bib32\">Pavelka et al. (2010)</a> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In two strains, the ratios of protein levels of duplicated genes fit a sum of two normal distributions; one with a mean increase close to twofold, the other with significantly reduced mean close to zero (R<sup>2</sup>\u2019s = 0.94 and 0.92, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In the other three strains, the ratios of protein levels of duplicated genes fit normal distributions and show average increases significantly lower than the predicted twofold change (mean log<sub>2</sub> ratios equal to 0.79, 0.77 and 0.65) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Pavelka et al. showed that attenuation of protein levels of subunits of macromolecular complexes were small but not significant compared to proteins not found in complexes. Using the same list of complexes in <a href=\"#bib32\">Pavelka et al. (2010)</a> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gavin et al., 2006</a>), we obtained similar results (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). However, when we used a more up to date and manually curated list of subunits of macromolecular complexes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pu et al., 2009</a>), we found that statistically significant attenuation in proteins that form part of complexes takes places in all the strains (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Next, we focused on the identity of the most attenuated proteins and asked whether subunits of complexes were enriched among them. We used a stringent cutoff of log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 0.6 lower than the mean increase in protein levels of the duplicate genes in each of the five aneuploid strains and found that between 23 and 38% of duplicated proteins were significantly attenuated (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, the attenuated proteins are enriched for subunits of macromolecular complexes in all five strains (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We conclude that significant attenuation of subunits of macromolecular complexes is a general feature of aneuploid yeast strains."

In addition, we compared mRNA footprints of disome XVI previously published (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thorburn et al., 2013</a>) to the proteome quantification of disome XVI grown in similar conditions. In both disomic strains, we found that duplicated genes, both attenuated and not attenuated at the protein level, show similar increases in ribosomal footprints (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). While we cannot exclude the possibility that translational control may play a role in the attenuation of a small subset of genes, these results indicate that most of the duplicated genes are transcribed and translated. Our results show that dosage compensation is predominantly mediated by posttranslational mechanisms."

We hypothesized that after very short times, 90 and 300 s, of protein turnover inhibition, only proteins with increased translation and that are rapidly degraded could show significant increases in abundance. These experiments revealed quantitative information for \u223c75% of all verified ORFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). As expected, very small changes in protein levels were detected in wild-type cells and the two disomes upon protein turnover inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, analysis of the average increase in protein levels per chromosome revealed that duplicated genes increased more than the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Analysis of the identity of the duplicated genes revealed that attenuated proteins, which are enriched for subunits of complexes, account for most of the increases in protein levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Strikingly, individual proteins show increases between 4 to 20% in their levels upon inhibition of protein turnover in such short times (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These results provide direct evidence for protein degradation as being a mechanism for dosage compensation in aneuploid cells."

We found that more than half of the proteins designated as members of macromolecular complexes were significantly attenuated in the disomes grown in rich medium (469 of 923 showed log<sub>2</sub> ratios \u2264 0.6). Nonlinear regression analysis of the distribution of the log<sub>2</sub> ratios of their levels relative to wild-type cells showed two populations, one of which encompassed the majority with a mean ratio of 0.46 (1.4-fold), a value significantly lower than the predicted increase of twofold that would be expected if protein levels scaled with gene copy number (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Similar results were obtained with cells analyzed by SILAC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, proteins encoded by duplicated genes that are not found in complexes showed little attenuation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Nonetheless, levels of a small number of uncomplexed proteins were attenuated. To assess how these proteins contribute to the total attenuation, we analyzed their identity and the reproducibility of their attenuation in selective and rich media. We identified 88 proteins not known to function in complexes that were attenuated in both growth conditions. Gene ontology analysis did not reveal any significant enrichment for a particular function, cellular process or component. In fact, the biological function of 15 of 88 proteins is unknown (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Our analysis not only indicates that most of the proteome attenuation observed in aneuploid cells is caused by the attenuation of components of protein complexes but also leads us to estimate that about half of all cellular proteins found in complexes (469 of 923 detected proteins) are unstable and rapidly degraded unless they find their binding partners."

The other 42 complexes showed average increases in their subunits higher than log<sub>2</sub> ratios of 0.6 in one or both proteome datasets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Strikingly, with the exception of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase complex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reinders et al., 1997</a>), every complex analyzed showed significant attenuation in at least one of its subunits (83 of 84)."

                                "text": "Interestingly, nearly every complex also contains one or more subunits that are not attenuated, the ribosome and nucleosome being notable exceptions. A few examples include Arp3 of the heptameric Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib36\">Robinson et al., 2001</a>), Mtw1 of the tetrameric MIND complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maskell et al., 2010</a>), Gim5 of the hexameric prefoldin complex (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vainberg et al., 1998</a>), Rpp1 of the nonameric ribonuclease P complex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chamberlain et al., 1998</a>), Prp19 of the octameric Prp19-associated complex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>), Orc5 of the hexameric origin recognition complex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell and Stillman, 1992</a>), and, Ost1 of the nonameric oligosaccharyltransferase complex (<a href=\"#bib40\">Spirig et al., 1997</a>). Examples of complexes with two stable subunits include Ccr4 and Not5 of the CCR4/NOT core complex which contains seven other subunits (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2001</a>), Sec21 and Glo3 of the COPI complex which contains six other subunits (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hosobuchi et al., 1992</a>), and Vma2 and Vma13 of the proton-transporting ATPase which contains 11 other subunits (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kawasaki-Nishi et al., 2001</a>). Other stable subunits include proteins that can be found in more than one complex such as Rpb5 which is part of all three RNA polymerase I, II and III complexes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Woychik et al., 1990</a>). While most cellular protein complexes appear to contain subunits that are highly unstable when present in excess, they may also require one or more stable subunits that serve as scaffolds for complex assembly."

Alternatively, specific cellular responses to the presence of an extra chromosome could be a contributing factor. For example, the attenuation of ribosome subunit levels could be due to down-regulation of mRNA levels, which occurs as part of the environmental stress response (ESR) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gasch et al., 2000</a>). To distinguish between these mechanisms, we analyzed the effects of expressing ribosomal genes from centromeric plasmids on their protein levels. Western blot analysis of cells harboring plasmids with an extra copy of the ribosomal subunits <i>RPL1B</i>, <i>RPL3</i> or <i>RPL30</i> showed that protein levels of these genes did not increase with copy number (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In contrast, cells harboring plasmids with an extra copy of <i>ARP5</i> or <i>CDC28</i>, which encode proteins that are not attenuated, showed increased levels. Our results indicate that the protein attenuation of ribosomal subunits is at least in part driven by protein instability rather than aneuploidy-induced cellular responses."

The ESR signature was also present in disomic yeast strains grown in rich medium, although with reduced intensity (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We hypothesize that this reduced ESR is in part due to smaller differences in proliferation rates between disomic and wild-type cells grown in rich medium compared to selective medium (<a href=\"#bib46\">Torres et al., 2007</a>).

In addition, the APS included proteins upregulated during oxidative stress such as the yeast orthologue of the translationally controlled tumor protein (p23) Tma19, the essential NTPase required for ribosome synthesis Fap7, the 3\u2032-5\u2032-exodeoxyribonuclease YBL055C, and the polyamine synthases Spe3 and Spe4 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gasch et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Juhnke et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chattopadhyay et al., 2006</a>). These results indicate that aneuploid cells may be exposed to higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (see below). Another GO category of APS-enriched genes is \u2018metabolic processes\u2019, including functions such as amino acid biosynthesis and cellular bioenergetics. Interestingly, the intensity of the APS, measured as the average increase of its 92 proteins, correlated with the size of the additional chromosome (Pearson r = 0.62, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), indicating that it may be a direct consequence of the cellular imbalances caused by the presence of the extra chromosome, rather than due to increased dosage of specific genes. In addition, we found that the APS is also present in aneuploid strains isolated from random meiosis and that its intensity also correlated with the size of the additional chromosomes in those aneuploid strains (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In addition, APS genes included several proteins involved in protein trafficking including Arc1, Sec53, Ric1, Vti1 and Ykt6. The upregulation of these proteins is consistent with increases in flux through protein folding, trafficking, and turnover machinery in aneuploid cells and will form the basis for future investigations. In support of a proposed need for increased protein degradation, we found that the average levels of proteasome subunits in all the disomic strains showed a small but significant increase compared to wild-type cells in almost every disomic strain independent of growth conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

The studies described here show that aneuploidy profoundly impacts the proteome of all aneuploid yeast strains.

To this end, we binned proteins into three categories: upregulated (log<sub>2</sub> ratio \u2265 0.4), downregulated (log<sub>2</sub> ratio \u2264 \u22120.4), and those that do not significantly change (\u22120.4 &lt; log<sub>2</sub> ratio &lt; 0.4). We then compared the average of each category to the average change of the same proteins in the disomes lacking <i>UBP6</i>. We found that all 12 disomes showed significant attenuation in the levels of their most upregulated proteins upon loss of <i>UBP6</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Importantly, analysis of the changes in gene expression of this set of proteins showed minimal attenuation of mRNA levels, indicating that the increased attenuation upon loss of <i>UBP6</i> is mediated posttranscriptionally (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All disomes also showed significant increases of downregulated proteins upon the deletion of <i>UBP6</i> bringing their levels closer to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). The effect on downregulated proteins impacts fewer proteins than the upregulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). These results indicate that protein attenuation upon loss of <i>UBP6</i> occurs in all aneuploid strains examined. Importantly, it affects both downregulated, and to a greater extent, upregulated proteins. Increased proteasomal degradation due to the loss of <i>UBP6</i> could be responsible for the downregulation of overexpressed genes. Which proteins are direct targets of Ubp6 remains to be investigated. So far, we found that deletion of <i>UBP6</i> in wild-type cells did not affect the half-life of six proteins, Fap7, Glc8, Bna5, Tma19, Trx1 and Trx2, whose increased abundance in disomic strains is attenuated when <i>UBP6</i> is deleted (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is thus possible that the <i>ubp6\u0394</i>-mediated attenuation of overexpressed proteins in the disomes is indirect.

Despite the mechanisms that exist for dosage compensation of sex chromosomes, eukaryotic cells do not seem to have evolved mechanisms to silence genes upon the acquisition of an extra copy of an autosome. Therefore, a direct consequence of gaining an extra chromosome is increased flux through the transcription and translation machineries. However, the near comprehensive quantitative proteomic assessment of 12 disomic yeast strains described here reveals that levels of a sizeable portion of the proteome (\u223c20%) do not scale with gene copy number. Most of the attenuated proteins are members of multi-protein complexes. Importantly, we show that attenuation of protein levels is mediated by posttranslational mechanisms, mostly by protein degradation. We hypothesize that these proteins only acquire a stably folded state when they are incorporated into their native complexes. Cells produce stoichiometric amounts of individual subunits of multiprotein complexes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Approximately one third of all yeast genes, which are randomly scattered in the genome, encode subunits of macromolecular complexes. Therefore irrespective of which chromosome is duplicated, significant protein attenuation must take place (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). For example, the ribosome, which consists of 79 unstable proteins (encoded by 137 genes), is one of the most abundant multi-subunit complexes in the cell. It is estimated that 50% of all RNA Polymerase II transcription is devoted to the production of ribosomal proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Warner, 1999</a>). Except for chromosomes I, III and VI, every yeast chromosome encodes several subunits, ranging from 5 in disome V to 19 in disome IV. Thus even a single excess chromosome leads to a substantial increase in transcription and translation of individual subunits without upregulation of the total number of ribosomes. Our results indicate that the majority of excess subunits, not only of the ribosome but also of most complexes, are destined for degradation. Altogether, our results provide direct evidence that a major consequence of aneuploidy is an increased burden on the protein quality control pathways including protein degradation."

Our analysis indicates that two of the most stable and long-lived complexes in cells, the ribosome and the nucleosome, consist of subunits that may not exist for long unless assembled into their complex (<a href=\"#bib10\">elBaradi et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Meeks-Wagner and Hartwell, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsay et al., 1988</a>). Most other complexes show a large range of subunit stabilities. Remarkably, almost every complex analyzed in our study contains at least one attenuated subunit. Conversely, most macromolecular complexes with the exception of the nucleosome and ribosome contain at least one subunit that appears to be stable on its own. The existence of unfolded or partially folded unstable subunits may provide the necessary free energy to drive complex formation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kiefhaber et al., 2012</a>). Our results suggest that a stable scaffold protein may also be required for complex assembly. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that dictate which subunits are degraded and which are not will significantly contribute to our understanding of the regulation of macromolecular complex formation."

Here, we showed that such gene expression responses affect the proteome content of cells. Paradoxically, one facet of the ESR is the downregulation of ribosomal protein genes leading to lower ribosome protein levels in the disomic strains compared to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). This is despite the apparent increase in total translation in cells harboring an extra chromosome. In addition, ribosomal footprinting analyses of disomic strains did not reveal any signs of impairment in translation efficiency. Therefore, the functional consequences of downregulation of ribosomes may be due to slower proliferation rates and may not affect the translational capacity of the cell. Nonetheless, increased translation and downregulation of ribosomal genes may provide the molecular explanation for the increased sensitivities of aneuploid cells to drugs that target the translational machinery."

This signature is present in all disomes analyzed and consists of 92 upregulated proteins involved in the regulation of redox homeostasis and metabolism. The upregulation of several of these proteins appears to occur in response to higher basal levels of intracellular ROS in the disomes. At present, we do not know the source of elevated intracellular ROS but our results indicate that disruption of protein homeostasis may be the culprit. Increased protein translation, folding and turnover create a high demand for ATP, which leads to the accumulation of ROS (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gorrini et al., 2013</a>). In addition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to increased protein folding could also contribute to ROS accumulation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tu and Weissman, 2002</a>). Another not mutually exclusive possibility is that altered metabolism due to upregulation of anabolic processes alters redox homeostasis in aneuploid cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gorrini et al., 2013</a>). Consistently, several proteins involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides and lipids are upregulated in the disomes (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Lastly, our analysis indicates that the average increase in levels of the APS strongly correlates with the size of the extra chromosomes in the disomes, suggesting that this response may be a direct consequence of the acquisition of extra genes."

However, we found no detectable changes in translational efficiency of the APS genes in disomes V or XVI. We note that a more comprehensive ribosomal footprinting analysis would be necessary to reveal small but significant changes in translational control for a particular gene. It is also possible that the APS is the result of protein stabilization. Consistently, stabilization of proteins following transcriptional downregulation has been observed in cells exposed to mild oxidative stress over the course of several hours (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vogel et al., 2011</a>). How stabilization occurs is not yet known but changes in posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation are certainly one possibility. Most of the proteins of the APS have been shown to be ubiquitinated or phosphorylated (76 of 92, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Because aneuploidy alters cellular metabolism, posttranslational modifications involving metabolites could also play a role. Interestingly, 34 of 92 APS proteins have been shown to be acetylated and/or succinylated in yeast (<a href=\"#bib18\">Henriksen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Weinert et al., 2013</a>)."

Whether the most attenuated proteins in the disomes upon <i>UBP6</i> loss are direct targets of Ubp6\u2019s deubiquitinating activity is not clear and requires further investigation. Nonetheless, loss of <i>UBP6</i> leads to the clearance of protein aggregates in aneuploid cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oromendia et al., 2012</a>). This raises the possibility that the removal of protein aggregates could contribute to the beneficial effects of <i>UBP6</i> deletion. Because protein aggregates sequester numerous proteins with essential cellular functions (<a href=\"#bib29a\">Olzscha et al., 2011</a>), their removal upon loss of <i>UBP6</i> may release sequestered proteins and could account for increases of downregulated proteins in the disomes. Alternatively, protein aggregates may consist of other metastable proteins simply as a consequence of impaired folding and/or chaperone activity and attenuation in protein abundance mediated by <i>UBP6</i> alleviates such stress. Establishing which proteins are direct targets of Ubp6 will help us understand the molecular mechanisms by which its loss of function suppresses aneuploidy-associated phenotypes."

This increase in ROS may in part be responsible for the genomic instability observed in aneuploid cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sheltzer et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this, aneuploid mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as most cancer cells are characterized by high levels of reactive oxygen species (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gorrini et al., 2013</a>). Unexpectedly, cells respond to increases in ROS by maintaining elevated levels of ROS scavenger proteins by posttranscriptional mechanisms. Our studies raise an important question: how do cancer cells exploit posttranscriptional mechanisms to alter protein levels and respond to intrinsic genomic alterations? Quantification of the cancer proteome remains a formidable challenge; but such efforts hold significant potential to reveal novel insights into the mechanisms by which cancer cells thrive despite their unbalanced genome. Deciphering such mechanisms could significantly impact our understanding of tumorigenesis."

Our studies indicate that targeting genes in the protein degradation pathway, such as <i>UBP6</i>, holds significant potential to ameliorate the detrimental consequences of aneuploidy in humans.

Between 17 and 25 fractions were analyzed for each experiment. In some cases, depending on separation quality and/or instrument performance, samples were run twice pooling both sets of data. Peptides were introduced into the mass spectrometer by nano-electrospray as they eluted off a self-packed 18 cm, 100 \u00b5m (ID) reverse-phase column packed with either 5 \u00b5m or 3 \u00b5m, 200 \u00c5 pore size, Maccel C18 AQ resin (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA). Peptides were separated using a 95 min or 65 min (Velos, Germany) gradient of 5\u201327% buffer B (97% ACN, 0.125% FA) with an in-column flow rate of 0.3\u20130.5 \u00b5l/min. For each scan cycle, one high mass resolution full MS scan was acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer and up to 10 or 20 (Velos) parent ions were chosen based on their intensity for collision induced dissociation (CID) and MS/MS fragment ion scans at low mass resolution in the linear ion trap. Dynamic exclusion was enabled to exclude ions that had already been selected for MS/MS in the previous 60 s. Ions with a charge of +1 and those whose charge state could not be assigned were also excluded. All scans were collected in centroid mode."

Each full scan was followed by the selection of the most intense ions, up to 10, for collision-induced dissociation (CID) and MS2 analysis in the linear ion trap for peptide identification and subsequent higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and MS3 analysis in the Orbitrap for quantification of the TMT reporter ions. AGC targets of 4 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> and 2 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> were used for MS2 and MS3 scans, respectively. Ions selected for MS2 analysis were excluded from reanalysis for 90 s. Ions with +1 or unassigned charge were also excluded from analysis. A single MS3 scan was performed for each MS2 scan selecting the most intense ions from the MS2 for fragmentation in the HCD cell. The resultant fragment ions were detected in the orbitrap at a resolution of 7500. Maximum ion accumulation times were 1000 ms for each full MS scan, 150 ms for MS2 scans, and 250 ms for MS3 scans."

Total RNA was then ethanol precipitated and further purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Germany). RNA quality was checked using the Bioanalyzer RNA Nano kit, and 325 ng was used for microarray labeling with the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit. Reactions were performed as directed except using half the recommended reaction volume and one quarter the recommended Cy-CTP amount. Dye incorporation and yield were measured with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Equal amounts of differentially labeled control and sample cRNA were combined such that each sample contained at least 2.5 pmol dye. Samples were mixed with control targets, fragmented, combined with hybridization buffer, and hybridized to a microarray consisting of 60mer probes for each yeast open reading frame (Agilent). Microarrays were rotated at 60\u00b0C for 17 hr in a hybridization oven (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Arrays were then washed according to the Agilent SSPE wash protocol, and scanned on an Agilent scanner. The image was processed using the default settings with Agilent Feature Extraction software.

A comprehensive approach is used with two quantitative proteomic (mass spectrometry based) methods to test on a genome wide basis the idea of proteome imbalance in haploid yeast with a second copy of a chromosome (diploidy for twelve yeast chromosomes is tested!). The overall analysis revealed the existence of both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally mediated protein expression changes indicative of slow growth as well as oxidative and metabolic stress. Due to the comprehensive nature and high technical quality of analysis (e.g. use of orthogonal growth and labeling conditions), as well as the importance of aneuploidy in a range of diseases, the manuscript will be an important resource for scientists from diverse fields ranging from yeast biology, neurobiology and cancer biology."

The 50% of the protein that are not assembled into complexes are highly unstable whereas the other 50%, that are assembled into the complex will have very long half-lives.

Thus 50% of the protein must be degraded within seconds. Therefore, the total decay must consist of two rate constants, one that accounts for the long-lived stable and abundant population (k<sub>s</sub>), while the other describes the short-lived and undetectable population (k<sub>u</sub>). The total rate of degradation k is the sum of rate of degradation of stable proteins plus the rate of degradation of unstable proteins (k = k<sub>s</sub> + k<sub>u</sub>). If k<sub>u</sub> is in the range of seconds and k<sub>s</sub> in minutes, then k = k<sub>s</sub> + k<sub>s</sub>/60. Then the apparent rate of degradation is simply given by k<sub>s</sub>. Therefore, most experimental designs to measure changes in protein turnover will only detect the degradation of the abundant, stable and long-lived population. Consistently, experimental half-lives of most of the attenuated protein is long. To mention a few examples, attenuated genes in chromosome V (identified in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, see below) include IES5, GIM4, SCC4, BUR6 and RSM18 which show half-lives of 75, 300, 136, 300 and 66 minutes, respectively. Attenuated genes in chromosome II include ROX3, PAF1, NTC20,MED8, and HIR1 with half-lives of 123, 117, 300, 300 and 49 minutes, respectively (values obtained from (Belle et al., 2006))."

Protein turnover inhibition may elicit cellular responses including transcriptional feedback mechanisms that could significantly alter the proteome composition of cells. To avoid this, we inhibited the proteasome and vacuolar degradation for very short times (90 and 300 seconds) and measured protein abundances of wild-type cells and 2 disomic strains. We found that the levels of several attenuated proteins increased ranging from 4 to up to 30% upon inhibition of protein turnover even after such short times. These results provide direct evidence for protein degradation being a mechanism for the attenuation of duplicated genes.

Furthermore, because in an exponentially growing population the total amounts of attenuated proteins in disomic strains are similar to wild-type cells; it would be not expected to find significant differences in their ubiquitylation levels. Presumably, the attenuated proteins have been ubiquitinated and are rapidly degraded making them really difficult to detect and quantify. One possibility to detect changes in ubiquitination may be to combine the protein turnover inhibition plus quantitative antibody pulldowns of GG-containing peptides. Because of the results presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, we could expect that only 4 to 20% of total level of attenuated proteins would show changes in ubiquitination.

Importantly the identification of this signature provided novel insights into the cellular responses to aneuploidy. First, it lead us to discover that aneuploid strains accumulate higher levels of intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) compared to wild-type cells. Second, analysis of individual genes revealed that the upregulation of the APS is mediated by posttranscriptional mechanisms and that the average increase in protein levels correlates with the size of the extra chromosome, indicating that the APS is a direct consequence of the cellular imbalances resulting from the acquisition of an extra chromosome. Third, amelioration of the APS upon UBP6 loss of function led us to discover that intracellular ROS levels observed in the aneuploid cells were restored close to wild-type levels upon the deletion. Finally, we found that the APS is also present in aneuploid strains recovered from random meiosis indicating that this signature is present in all aneuploid yeast strains. Altogether, the identification of the APS which include proteins that regulate responses to cellular stress and altered metabolism revealed significant and novel insights into the cellular responses to aneuploidy."
