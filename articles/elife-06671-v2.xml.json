Geminivirus code for TrAP protein to suppress the TGS pathway. Here, we identified an <i>Arabidopsis</i> H3K9me2 histone methyltransferase, Su(var)3-9 homolog 4/Kryptonite (SUVH4/KYP), as a bona fide cellular target of TrAP. TrAP interacts with the catalytic domain of KYP and inhibits its activity in vitro. TrAP elicits developmental anomalies phenocopying several TGS mutants, reduces the repressive H3K9me2 mark and CHH DNA methylation, and reactivates numerous endogenous KYP-repressed loci in vivo. Moreover, KYP binds to the viral chromatin and controls its methylation to combat virus infection. Notably, <i>kyp</i> mutants support systemic infection of TrAP-deficient Geminivirus. We conclude that TrAP attenuates the TGS of the viral chromatin by inhibiting KYP activity to evade host surveillance. These findings provide new insight on the molecular arms race between host antiviral defense and virus counter defense at an epigenetic level."

Geminivirus code for TrAP protein to suppress the TGS pathway. Here, we identified an <i>Arabidopsis</i> H3K9me2 histone methyltransferase, Su(var)3-9 homolog 4/Kryptonite (SUVH4/KYP), as a bona fide cellular target of TrAP. TrAP interacts with the catalytic domain of KYP and inhibits its activity in vitro. TrAP elicits developmental anomalies phenocopying several TGS mutants, reduces the repressive H3K9me2 mark and CHH DNA methylation, and reactivates numerous endogenous KYP-repressed loci in vivo. Moreover, KYP binds to the viral chromatin and controls its methylation to combat virus infection. Notably, <i>kyp</i> mutants support systemic infection of TrAP-deficient Geminivirus. We conclude that TrAP attenuates the TGS of the viral chromatin by inhibiting KYP activity to evade host surveillance. These findings provide new insight on the molecular arms race between host antiviral defense and virus counter defense at an epigenetic level."

The Geminiviruses are a family of plant viruses that are transmitted by insects and infect tomato, cabbage, and many other crop plants. These viruses hijack the plant cells that they infect and force the plant cells to make viral proteins using instructions provided by the genes in the virus' own DNA. To make proteins, DNA is first copied into molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (or mRNA) in a process called transcription. However, plants can defend themselves by blocking the transcription of viral DNA through \u2018transcriptional gene silencing\u2019."

The commonly used model plant, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, was genetically engineered to produce high levels of these TrAP proteins. These \u2018transgenic\u2019 plants did not develop properly: they grew more slowly, had abnormal leaves, and flowered earlier. Furthermore, hundreds of plant genes were more active than usual in the transgenic plants, which suggests that TrAP inhibits transcriptional gene silencing. Further experiments showed that TrAP directly binds to a plant enzyme called KYP\u2014which normally deposits methyl groups on chromatin and prevents it from working. This reduces the number of methyl groups that are attached to histones associated with both viral and plant chromatin, which results in the activation of genes that would normally be switched off."

In PTGS, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are processed by Dicer-like ribonucleases into small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Mature siRNAs are incorporated into an Argonaute (AGO)-centered RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to regulate expression of target genes through RNA cleavage or translational repression. PTGS has evolved as a universal defense response toward all viruses because dsRNAs can result from intermediates in RNA virus replication, highly structured RNA virus genomes, or from viral transcripts. To evade this surveillance mechanism, virtually all plant viruses are known to encode suppressor proteins that are able to block different key steps of the PTGS pathway (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</a>)."

In eukaryotes, the nuclear DNA is wrapped onto histone octamers to constitute chromatin. The chromatin undergoes various DNA and histone methylations, and these modifications have variable effects on gene expression depending on the precise residues, contexts, and modification complexity. Histone methylation takes place on lysine and arginine residues of the amino-terminal tails (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Greer and Shi, 2012</a>). The prevailing dogma is that histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) is mostly associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin, while H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are repressive marks (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deal and Henikoff, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Feng and Jacobsen, 2011</a>). Histone methylation is catalyzed by SET domain containing methyltransferases, specifically, H3K9me2 is deposited by <i>Arabidopsis</i> Su(var)3-9 homolog 4, Kryptonite (KYP) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Du et al., 2014a</a>), and its paralogs (SUVH5,6), while H3K27 methylation is carried out by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)<i>,</i> which includes Curly Leaf (CLF) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng and Chen, 2011</a>). Local H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 can spread over wide regions to elicit heterochromatin configuration. In animals, the propagation of histone methylation entails co-repressor heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), whereas in plants, KYP acts synergistically with DNA methyltransferases (i.e., Chromomethylase 3 [CMT3]) to constitute a mutually reinforcing cycle of DNA and histone methylation to secure TGS (<a href=\"#bib16\">Du et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2014a</a>)."

Plant DNA viruses, exemplified by Geminivirus, form minichromosomes in the host (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2013</a>). Both Geminivirus DNA and associated histones are methylated in infected cells, whereas viral methylation is reduced in methylation-deficient hosts, methylation-compromised <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutants are hypersusceptiple to Geminivirus infection and show exacerbated disease symptoms (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2008</a>). Thus, plants appear to employ methylation of viral chromatin to limit viral replication and transcription (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aregger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pumplin and Voinnet, 2013</a>). On the other hand, Geminiviruses encode a multi-functional protein called transcriptional activation protein (TrAP/AL2/AC2) that counters the epigenetic defense (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buchmann et al., 2009</a>). It has been shown that TrAP inhibits adenosine kinase (ADK) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). ADK catalyzes the synthesis of 5\u2032 AMP from adenosine and ATP, a process that promotes the regeneration of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), the major methyl donor in the cell (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moffatt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buchmann et al., 2009</a>). Consequently, the TrAP-mediated inhibition of ADK activity likely impedes downstream trans-methylation events, including viral chromatin methylation in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bisaro, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buchmann et al., 2009</a>). In parallel, some Geminivirus encode a TrAP positional homolog, named C2, that is able to stabilize SAM decarboxylase 1 to downregulate the methyl group metabolism (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). It seems that interfering with the methyl cycle is a common suppression mechanism for Geminivirus-encoded TrAP/AL2/C2 proteins. In addition, C2 also subverts the activity of COP9 signalosome to inhibit jasmonate signaling (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lozano-Dur\u00e1n et al., 2011</a>), suggesting its multiple functions in viral counter-defense."

We found that constitutive expression of TGMV-<i>TrAP</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> caused morphological abnormalities that mimic loss-of-function mutants of numerous TGS components including <i>lhp1</i> (<i>like-heterochromatin1</i>) and <i>clf</i>. Microarray analyses of <i>TrAP</i> transgenic plants and <i>lhp1</i> mutants revealed a substantial overlap in reprogrammed host genes at a genome-wide level. Through biochemical screening, we identified KYP as the bona fide target of TrAP. We demonstrated in vitro that TrAP binds to the catalytic domain of KYP and inhibits its enzymatic activity; while in vivo, <i>TrAP</i> decreases the repressive H3K9me2 marks and H3K9me2-dependent CHH methylation in gene-rich regions. We also found that KYP directly associates with the Geminivirus minichromosome and deposits H3K9me2 marks on viral chromatin. In addition, <i>kyp</i> mutants but not wild-type plants sustain low systemic infection of CaLCuV lacking TrAP protein. Taken together, we propose that KYP-catalyzed H3K9me2 is a line of the innate immunity against invading DNA pathogens, and Geminivirus TrAP functions to inactivate KYP to counter host defense. Thus, this study provides new insight into the host\u2013virus interaction at the TGS level."

Analysis of the microarray data challenged this possibility as no significant changes in the transcripts of any canonical TGS components were revealed (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). An alternative hypothesis was that TrAP directly interferes with the function of a TGS component (s). To test this in an unbiased manner, we used luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assay to screen 34 TGS-related proteins and some other cellular factors for TrAP interaction (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). In the LCI experiments, the N- and C-terminal parts of firefly luciferase (NLuc and CLuc) are fused to different test proteins to be transiently expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (<i>N. benthamiana</i>). When NLuc and CLuc are brought together through interaction of the test proteins, catalytic activity is restored and recorded through CCD camera. In our LCI screening, we recovered LHP1 and KYP, a SUVH-type H3K9me2 methyltransferase, suggesting that TrAP is physically close to LHP1 and/or KYP proteins in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Next, we carried out confocal microscopy imaging assays. TrAP co-localized with both LHP1 and KYP in scattered but not yet clearly defined nuclear foci, whereas co-expression of TrAP-CFP and other YFP-tagged proteins in <i>N. benthamiana</i> cells did not show such patterns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These observations further suggested that TrAP was in the same complexes as LHP1 or KYP. To further examine if TrAP interacted with these proteins, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Interestingly, we validated the TrAP-KYP interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) but not TrAP-LHP1 (data not shown), indicating that the LCI signal resulting from the TrAP-LHP1 combination likely involved additional cofactors between TrAP and LHP1 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Alternatively, TrAP-LHP1 interaction might be transient or unstable in our stringent co-IP condition. We observed that expression of CLuc-HA3-KYP in <i>N. benthamiana</i> yielded truncated proteins of various lengths that accumulated to comparable levels as the full-length protein; only the full-length KYP showed specific interaction with TrAP, implying the KYP C-terminal domain as the interaction interface with TrAP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We further confirmed the in vivo TrAP-KYP interaction by F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer-acceptor bleaching (FRET-AB), using TrAP-CFP as a donor and YFP-KYP as an acceptor. Shortly, FRET involves the energy transfer from an excited donor to an adjacent acceptor when the fluorophores are less than 10 nm apart. If the fluorophores are coupled, the excited donor leads to acceptor emission; bleaching the acceptor allows the emission of the donor to be measured (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Consecutive cycles of YFP-KYP bleach/recovery correlated with release/quench on the TrAP-CFP signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>); the positive FRET-AB (CaLCuV-TrAP 2.699 \u00b1 0.23, TGMV-TrAP 3.8228 \u00b1 0.58, p &lt; 0.05) corroborated TrAP-CFP/YFP-KYP interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). To examine whether TrAP interacted with KYP under physiological conditions, we isolated TrAP complexes through two-step immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>) from stable transgenic plants expressing <i>Flag-Myc4-TrAP</i> under the inducible promoter (<i>XVE</i>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zuo et al., 2000</a>) followed by mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 624 peptides representing 288 unique sequences were recovered from the TrAP sample; of those, 31 unique peptides matched specifically to KYP/SUVH4 and were not found in control immunoprecipitates using Col-0 plants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, all these assays clearly indicated that TrAP and KYP interact in vivo."

                                "text": "We performed in vitro pull-down assays to examine whether TrAP interacts directly with KYP. We found that maltose-binding protein (MBP)-KYP, but not MBP and other MBP-tagged control proteins, was able to pull down GST-tagged TGMV- and CaLCuV-encoded TrAP proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). This interaction was specific as MBP-KYP was unable to pull down GST protein alone. Notably, we did not observe direct LHP1-TrAP interaction in the parallel pull-down experiments (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); and this result was consistent with the in vivo Co-IP experiments. From N- to C- termini, KYP contains SRA, PreSET, SET, and PostSET domains. To further define the protein domain (s) responsible for the specific interaction, we generated five truncations of KYP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Pull-down assays showed that the SET domain interacted with TrAP proteins from both TGMV and CaLCuV at a higher affinity, whereas SRA domain might interact with CaLCuV TrAP at a reduced affinity in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). These results were consistent with the results of the in vivo Co-IP experiments in which only full-length KYP, but not C-terminal-truncated versions, could recover TrAP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Recent structural analysis on KYP revealed that SET and pre-SET domains constitute two modules: one forms a narrow pocket harboring the H3 tail (1\u201315aa), whereas the other binds the SAM cofactor, together with the post-SET domain (<a href=\"#bib14\">Du et al., 2014a</a>). Because the post-SET domain does not seem to contribute to the KYP-TrAP interaction, TrAP could potentially occupy the histone-binding cavity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

Under our experimental conditions, 1 \u00b5M GST-KYP methylated 3 \u00b5M of histone 3 in less than 5 min at 37\u00b0C, as detected by saturation of the radioactive signal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Excitingly, incubation of His-GST-KYP with His-MBP-TrAP from either TGMV or CaLCuV reduced the initial velocity of KYP transmethylation activity in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas His-MBP alone did not affect KYP catalysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

First, we screened numerous loci that showed transcriptional deregulation in the <i>TrAP</i> overexpression lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D,G,H</a>) for the presence of various histone modifications. We identified a dozen loci in which H3K9me2 marks are easily detected in wild-type plants. We then conducted ChIP-qPCR for these loci in the <i>TrAP</i> transgenic plants. As expected, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 were reduced in most of the tested loci in <i>ddm1</i>, <i>kyp</i> and <i>lhp1</i> mutants, whereas H3K4me3 was enriched. These results are consistent with the generally antagonistic roles of H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 modifications. Specifically, six out of seven TrAP deregulated loci including the flowering-promoting genes displayed greater than twofold reduction in H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 in the <i>TrAP</i> overexpression plants compared to wild-type Col-0, while changes in H3K4me3 were inconsistent. This scenario was similar to that observed for TEs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>).

In plants, Geminivirus constitutes into a minichromosome that also undergoes epigenetic regulation. The specific TrAP-KYP interaction, inhibition of KYP activity in vitro, and reduction of H3K9me2 and CHH methylation in vivo suggest that KYP is a major factor in combating viruses. Previous studies showed that <i>kyp</i> mutants are hypersusceptible to Geminivirus infection (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2013</a>); these experiments were reproducible in our hands (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>). Moreover, the hypersusceptibility of <i>kyp</i> mutant to the virus could be rescued by the wild-type <i>KYP</i> transgene under the control of both the native and the constitutive 35S promoters (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>); further validating a role for KYP in regulation of viral infection. In line with the phenotypic complementation, wild-type <i>KYP</i> almost completely rescued H3K9me2 defects of the TEs in the <i>kyp</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, lanes 1\u20134). Interestingly, although the accumulation of <i>KYP</i> transcripts was substantially increased when transcribed from the <i>35S</i> promoter when compared to the native promoter, the steady-state protein level was only twofold to threefold higher in the <i>35S-Flag-4Myc-KYP</i> than in the <i>P</i><sub><i>KYP</i></sub>-<i>Flag-4Myc-KYP</i> transgenic plants (data not shown). These observations suggest a possible homoeostatic regulation of this critical TGS component."

Interestingly, H3K9me2 marks were dramatically decreased on several, but not all tested loci in the viral genome in <i>kyp</i> mutant, and the methylation marks were further restored by the <i>KYP</i> transgene, suggesting that viral chromatin H3K9me2 is catalyzed by KYP. Notably, the H3K9me2 amount was substantially enhanced in the locus defined by Primer #9 in the transgenic <i>KYP</i> overexpression plants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). It is noteworthy that this locus harbors the promoter element for <i>TrAP</i> itself (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shung and Sunter, 2009</a>). This result suggests that the tight control of <i>TrAP</i> expression likely determines the balance between the host and virus interactions. If so, the result might also explain the relatively milder viral symptoms of <i>35S-Flag-Myc4-KYP</i> lines compared to WT control or <i>P</i><sub><i>KYP</i></sub><i>-Flag-Myc4-KYP</i> complementation lines (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>). To further test whether KYP methylated the viral chromatin, we performed ChIP assays using monoclonal anti-Flag antibody to pull down <i>Flag-Myc</i><sub><i>4</i></sub><i>-KYP</i> bound chromatin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). Excitingly, KYP was found at all tested loci in the viral chromatin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>). Notably, regions delineated by the primer #7 showed KYP-independent H3K9me2 marks but were still immunoprecipitated in the KYP-chromatin complex. A possible explanation is incomplete chromatin shearing of the small viral mini-chromosome under the conditions used in this experiment, which were standardized for host chromatin ChIP. Alternatively, this might suggest the presence of additional epigenetic regulation that masks KYP activity on this locus. This notwithstanding, our results indicate that KYP directly deposits the H3K9me2 mark on the Geminivirus minichromosome to reinforce the silent status of the virus."

CaLCuV-infected plants showed 60\u2013100% H3K9me2 loss in the tested loci compared to the amount in the mock-inoculated plants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), this is reminiscent of the molecular phenotype of <i>TrAP</i> transgenic plants, which showed lower enrichment of H3K9me2 mark at the studied loci (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results indicated that Geminivirus infection largely removed the repressive H3K9me2 marks in the transposons, and that the removal resulted at least in part from TrAP function. Given that TrAP is known to activate the expression of viral genes in the minichromosome and that endogenous transposons can serve as a proxy for viral genomes, it is conceivable that virus-encoded TrAP acts to suppress KYP in order to prevent the deposition of H3K9me2-repressive marks in the epigenome, to activate the expression of viral genes."

TrAP is indispensable for systemic infection of Begomoviruses because it activates the expression of the viral ssDNA binding proteins (nuclear shuttle protein and coat protein), which are essential for releasing the virus from the nucleus and for cell-to-cell spreading (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sunter and Bisaro, 1992</a>). If TrAP-mediated transcriptional activation and accumulation of ssDNA result from inhibition of KYP and correspondingly heterochromatin formation, then infectivity of CaLCuV lacking TrAP should be impaired in wild-type but recovered in <i>kyp</i> plants. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a CaLCuV variant without functional TrAP protein (CaLCuV \u0394<i>trap</i>) by changing a single nucleotide (T to A) that produces an amber mutation and introduces an XbaI restriction site after the sixth codon in the <i>TrAP</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Then, we assessed systemic infection of CaLCuV and CaLCuV \u0394<i>trap</i> on wild-type and <i>kyp</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Consistent with the hypersusceptible phenotype of <i>kyp</i> mutants to CaLCuV (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>), these plants accumulated significantly higher titers of CaLCuV relative to wild-type control as both the replicative intermediate, open circle (OC), and the infective particle, SS DNA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Consistent with previous reports, the wild-type plants did not show any symptoms of infection (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>) or systemic accumulation of CaLCuV \u0394<i>trap</i>, as evidenced by Southern blot analyses and PCR (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Particularly, PCR amplification followed by XbaI digestion of the viral <i>TrAP</i> region in wild-type plants infected with CaLCuV \u0394<i>trap</i> showed loss of the XbaI restriction site (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Excitingly, the viral DNA was detected, in low amount but reproducibly, in <i>kyp</i> mutants. Further PCR amplification of the <i>TrAP</i> gene followed by XbaI digestion, confirmed that the detected viral DNAs in <i>kyp</i> mutants indeed came from CaLCuV \u0394<i>trap</i> and not from a reversion of the mutation in the virus genome. These results show that <i>kyp</i> plants sustained systemic infection of CaLCuV \u0394<i>trap</i>. Noticeably, the titers of accumulated CaLCuV \u0394<i>trap</i> were much lower than the ones of CaLCuV, suggesting either redundant activity of <i>KYP</i> paralogs in host defense or necessity of additional functions of TrAP besides inhibition of KYP activity for the virus to achieve efficient infection."

Animals use histone modifications to reinforce the latency of integrated viruses (<a href=\"#bib13\">du Chene et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Narasipura et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Park et al., 2014</a>). Plant DNA viruses including Geminiviruses and pararetroviruses replicate as nuclear minichromosomes or episomes. Clearly, TGS functions as an immune system to control virus replication and the expression of viral genes, in a similar fashion as the repression of endogenous TEs and transposon remnants. In previous studies and here in our experiments, <i>kyp</i> mutants displayed hypersusceptibility to Geminivirus infection, which could be rescued by exogenous wild-type <i>KYP</i> gene. KYP directly acts on viral chromatin and deposits the repressive H3K9me2 mark on the viral chromatin. Moreover, viruses lacking the essential TrAP protein can, although inefficiently, cause systemic infection in <i>KYP</i>-deficient hosts. All these facts point out the unambiguous role of KYP-mediated TGS in defense against viral infection. On the other hand, TrAP functions to inhibit KYP catalytic activity, reducing the repressive H3K9me2 mark, to activate transcription of viral genes. Our KYP reconstitution assays show that TrAP:KYP molar ratio of around 2 is enough to cause \u223c50% inhibition of KYP activity, indicating that TrAP is a potent inhibitor of HMTase activity. Thus, direct inhibition of KYP represents a novel counter-defense mechanism for virus survival in the hosts. This mechanism could account for the long-documented essential role of TrAP in expression of viral genes including the coat protein and the nuclear shuttle protein (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sunter and Bisaro, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "In plants, H3K9me2 marks often correlate with non-CG DNA methylation, and in particular with CHG modification. The tight coordination results from a self-enforcing loop consisting of KYP and CMT3 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Du et al., 2014a</a>). Briefly, KYP methylates H3K9 to generate the binding sites for CMT3, which further methylates CHG DNA to create more binding sites for KYP. Consequently, the crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation ascertains the silent status of heterochromatin. We hypothesized that TrAP targets KYP to reduce H3K9me2 marks, and this inhibition would further decrease DNA methylation both on the host and on the viral genome. Here, we found that ectopic expression of TrAP had no effect on CHG but only on CHH methylation, at sites that are up to 96.7% overlapped with the hypo-methylated regions in <i>kyp</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In plants, sequence contexts of CHG and CHH methylation are largely overlapped throughout the genome and are maintained to a limited extent by all non-CG methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stroud et al., 2014</a>). One outstanding question would be how could TrAP differentially alter methylation of CHH rather than CHG, given that TrAP targets KYP? Methylation in the CHH context is catalyzed by CMT2 and DRM1/2 in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and the sites regulated through the two sets of enzymes are mostly non-overlapping. Thus, the functions of CMT2 and DRM1/2 are mostly non-redundant at CHH sites (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stroud et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2014</a>). DRM1/2 largely catalyze CHH methylation at the TE-rich regions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stroud et al., 2014</a>). In our study, we did not observe any effect of TrAP on CHH methylation in the TEs, suggesting that TrAP might not (or not sufficiently) interrupt the RdDM pathway that entails DRM1/2 and 24-nt siRNAs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stroud et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, it has been recently discovered that bulk CHH methylation is maintained by CMT2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stroud et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dubin et al., 2015</a>) and that its activity is largely dependent on H3K9me2. In this scenario, CMT2 recognizes methylated H3K9 but preferentially binds to di-methylated over mono-methylated histone tails. This preference towards H3K9me2 is not observed in the CHG methyltransferase CMT3, which can equally bind to all forms of H3K9 methylation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stroud et al., 2014</a>). We envision that methylation at CHH sites could be more sensitive to changes in H3K9me2 than CHG, since CMT3 could still maintain CHG DNA methylation in the presence of H3K9me1 resulting from residual activity of HMTase, as would be the case when KYP is inhibited by TrAP. Alternatively, CHH methylation might play an important but yet unappreciated regulatory role in host defense genes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). If so, preferentially targeting these loci by TrAP protein might represent a new counter-defense mechanism."

In our study, TrAP reduces CHH methylation in the host and possibly in the viral genome, too. Remarkably, the Geminivirus replicase, Rep/AC1/C1 and the embedded protein AC4/C4, downregulate the expression of host DNA methyltransferases <i>MET1</i> and <i>CMT3</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pumplin and Voinnet, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rodriguez-Negrete et al., 2013</a>); hence, it interrupts the reinforcing loop of histone and DNA methylation. Consistent to this study, <i>cmt3</i> mutants exhibit hypersusceptibility to viral infection (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2008</a>). The fact that Rep/C4 repress <i>CMT3</i> expression in the host is in perfect alignment with our ChIP assay results on CaLCuV-infected plants, where the loss of H3K9me2 is even more severe than the observed in TrAP transgenic plants. Thus, interruption of the compelling feedback loop of histone and DNA methylation represents an important strategy to sustain transcription of viral chromatin. Together, it seems that the synergistic inhibition of histone and DNA methyltransferases by Geminivirus proteins evolves as a powerful tactic to win the arms race between host and pathogen."

We note, however, that <i>Arabidopsis</i> has 49 SET domain containing proteins of which 31 are considered to have HMTase activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). Arising from this fact is whether TrAP specifically targets KYP or promiscuously acts on additional HMTases. Although TrAP overexpression plants display molecular features in common with <i>kyp</i> mutant (i.e., reduced H3K9me2 levels), and an early flowering phenotype similar to loss-of-function mutant of the <i>kyp</i> paralog, <i>SUVH2</i>, the transgenic plants are phenotypically different from <i>kyp</i> single mutant.

Moreover, the substantial overlapping of <i>TrAP</i>-responsive genes with <i>lhp1</i>-regulated genes strongly suggested that TrAP might target the <i>LHP1</i>-related H3K27me3 pathway (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng and Chen, 2011</a>). Indeed, most of our tested loci in the host genome exhibited decreased H3K27me3 levels, consistent with the fact that \u223c50% genes were co-regulated by TrAP and <i>LHP1</i> in a genome-wide scale. Interestingly, recent ChIP\u2013chip studies revealed that H3K27me3 and <i>LHP1</i>-bound sites are predominantly distributed in the euchromatic regions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Turck et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2007b</a>). This distribution is not correlated with KYP-dependent H3K9me2 marks that are highly enriched at pericentromeric regions as large and uninterrupted heterochromatic blocks (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Black et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Du et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). H3K9me2 can also occur in euchromatic regions but rather exist as small heterochromatin patches (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng and Chen, 2011</a>). In our current study, we did not further examine whether TrAP physically targets H3K27me3 HMTases in the <i>LHP1</i> pathway. But it is plausible that TrAP inhibits both KYP and <i>LHP1</i> pathways. Notably, we did not observe the repression of transcriptionally active histone methylation marks, such as H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. This observation suggests that TrAP does not target the HMTases that are writers for the active marks. How can TrAP distinguish KYP from those active writers remains unclear, but we propose that structural components other than the SET domain might contribute to the recognition and affinity of TrAP binding to HMTases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Alternatively, additional cellular factors might also contribute to the specificity."

Thus, Geminvirus TrAP functions clearly different from most of previously characterized viral suppressors, which target various steps of the PTGS pathway (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</a>). Together with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2008</a>), we provide evidence that KYP evolves as a critical immune system to control invading nucleic acids in plants; this is reminiscent of the roles of human SUV39H1 in maintaining the latency of HIV (<a href=\"#bib13\">du Chene et al., 2007</a>), Epsteinn-Barr virus (Imai et al., 2014), and some other mammalian viruses. Thus, sequestering or interfering with this core component is an effective strategy for Geminivirus to block TGS and to subvert host defense; we expect this strategy to be used by other suppressors in plants and mammals. Given that many viral suppressors interrupt different steps in the PTGS pathways to efficiently combat host surveillance, it would not be surprising that additional key cellular factors in the TGS pathway, besides HMTase, were readily targeted by invading viruses in eukaryotes. Importantly, it is believed that compounds or drugs that alter chromatin methylation might ultimately be the most effective means of combating disease. Our discovery that TrAP inhibits a histone-modifying enzyme also offers a new natural strategy to develop epigenetic-targeted drugs to cure human diseases that arise from epigenetic dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib25a\">H\u00f8jfeldt et al., 2013</a>) or to engineer new biotechnological products to improve agricultural productivity."

YFP and CFP signals were captured with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal Microscope (Zeiss, Germany). FRET was determined by the acceptor photobleaching method (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kenworthy, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Daelemans et al., 2004</a>). First, to define the base line, the signal intensities of a pre-photobleach CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) were acquired by exciting with the 458 and 514-nm laser lines, respectively. Then, three regions of interest in the cell were selected: #1, Autofluorescence control; #2, non-photobleaching control; and #3, FRET-AB region. The CFP donor was excited with the 458 nm laser line for all FRET experiments; the emission of both CFP and YFP was recorded at 485 nm and 540 nm. Regions #1 and #3 were rendered free of YFP by consecutive cycles of bleaching recovery with the 514-nm laser line until no recovery of YFP was detected. The CFP and YFP signals were monitored throughout the experiment. After correction for background with control region #1 and for photobleaching of the donor because of imaging with control region #2, the FRET efficiencies (E) in the region #3 was calculated from the CFP signal using <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>FRET</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>Eff</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2212</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mtext>D</mtext><mrow><mtext>pre</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mtext>D</mtext><mrow><mtext>post</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>, where D is the mean intensity of the donor CFP in the area where the acceptor was bleached, before (Dpre) and after (Dpost) acceptor bleaching. The FRET efficiency is considered positive when Dpost &gt; Dpre. The image and statistical analyses were performed with the FRET module for the ZEN software (Zeiss). The average FRET efficiency and its standard deviation were calculated from the FRET efficiencies of each individual cell in 27\u201330 cells per experiment. The standard Student's <i>t</i>-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the results."

The sonicated samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 21000 \u00d7 rcf in 4\u00b0C. 100 \u03bcl of the clarified chromatin was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1.2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 167 mM NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1 pellet/25 ml Complete EDTA-free Protease inhibitor [Roche]) per ChIP. The immunoprecipitation was accomplished by the addition of 40 \u00b5l of Anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# M8823), followed by 2 hr incubation at 4\u00b0C on mild rotation. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of Washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 2 mM PMSF, 1 pellet/25 ml Complete EDTA-free Protease inhibitor [Roche]) incubating 5 min at 4\u00b0C in between; then, two more washes with 1 ml TE buffer incubating 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Finally, the samples were eluted twice at room temperature with 125 \u03bcl of Elution buffer (100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5% SDS), for 15 and 30 min, respectively. The samples were decrosslinked and the DNA extracted as above."

The enrichment levels of specific genes after ChIP assay were also tested by quantitative PCR. Primers are listed in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 8</a>. The quantitative PCRs were performed in 384-well plates with an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system using the SYBR Green I master mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, United States) in a volume of 10 \u03bcl. PCR conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 96\u00b0C for 10 s followed by 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Three biological repeats were performed, and the reactions were performed in triplicate for each run. The comparative CT method was used to evaluate the relative quantities of each amplified product in the samples. The threshold cycle (CT) was automatically determined for each reaction by the system according to the default parameters. The specificity of the PCR was determined by dissociation curve analysis of the amplified products using the standard method installed in the system."

The topic is of broad interest given the conservation of HMTases in multicellular eukaryotes and the existence of other DNA viruses that affect animals, including humans. Your findings expand upon the previously proposed pleiotropic functions of TrAP proteins in suppression of TGS, such as adenosine kinase inhibition and SAMDC1 stabilisation. As well as illustrating a new role for TrAP during viral pathogenesis, your work could provide a useful tool for scientists, who could employ TrAP as a dominant inhibitor of H3K9me modification."

For example, you demonstrate that constitutive expression of TrAP causes developmental defects reminiscent of mutations affecting various epigenetic modifications. However, such defects are not observed in the <i>suvh4</i> single mutant, nor the <i>suvh456</i> triple mutant, in which H3K9me levels are drastically reduced. In fact, you start out by comparing <i>TrAP</i> overexpressers with <i>lhp1</i> mutants. In any case, the phenotypic discrepancies suggests that expression of TrAP disrupts many biological processes not connected with SUVH4 or its closest homologs, and it raises the possibility that TrAP generally targets SET domain HMTases, a possibility that you acknowledge in the Discussion. In and of itself, such potential promiscuity of TrAP is not an issue, as it would be just as interesting if a single viral protein could inhibit many SET domain HMTases. However, to make the argument that part of the effects of TrAP are through inhibition of SUVH4, you should compare the effects of <i>TrAP</i> overexpression to the effects of <i>suvh4</i> mutants rather than the effects of other chromatin regulatory factors like LHP1. As there are very few genes mis-regulated in <i>suvh4</i> single mutants, you should compare global levels of DNA and H3K9 methylation in <i>TrAP</i> overexpressers to those observed in a <i>suvh4</i> mutant (or <i>suv456</i> triple mutants). We also note that LHP1 has been shown to bind H3K27me3 and that it is in the CURLY LEAF/Polycomb pathway, and that there is no evidence that LHP1 is related to SUVH4 function. It is not clear how these distinct effects can be easily reconciled, and it tends to make the current presentation appear disjointed.

However H3K9me modification of the viral genome is largely unaffected by loss of SUVH4, and there is no evidence that the observed changes influence expression of viral genes. You should compare viral gene expression in wild type and <i>suvh4</i> mutants, to determine if transcriptional gene silencing by SUVH4 does indeed affect viral gene expression. If no change in expression is observed in the <i>suvh4</i> mutant, this would argue against the presented model and suggest TrAP is functioning via an alternative mechanism."

Regarding the in vivo relevance of the KYP-TrAP interaction, the authors conducted TrAP IP mass spectrometry experiments and found many peptides corresponding to KYP, confirming an interaction under biologically relevant conditions. A second concern was in regards to the H3K9me2 ChIP data supporting the conclusion that <i>TrAP</i> overexpression affects the activity of KYP in vivo. As outlined below, I remain concerned about the interpretation of this data. Regarding the final point, the role of KYP in regulating the expression of virus genes, the authors provide additional genetic evidence supporting a role of KYP in virus infection in a manner that is specifically connected to the <i>TrAP</i> gene. While this is not a direct assessment of the role of KYP in transcriptional regulation of viral genes, it does further support a link between TrAP, KYP, and viral defense. Taken together, the new experiments presented significantly strengthen the connection between KYP and TrAP, but the extent to which the TrAP protein modulates KYP HMTase activity at endogenous loci remains less clear."

Each gene will be predominantly marked by only one modification (H3K4me, H3K9me, or H3K9me). Without knowing the levels of each modification in WT plants, the data cannot be fully interpreted as presented because the WT sample is artificially set to one. For example if a gene (like RDR1) is expressed and marked by H3K4me in Wt plants, but is not marked by H3K9me or H3K27me then a ChIP signal showing reduced H3K9me or H3K27me is likely noise rather than a real signal. This is a critical point in the paper, as they use this data make the statement that TrAP causes decreased H3K9me levels. In the subsection \u201cTrAP reduced H3K9me2 repressive marks in vivo\u201d they state: \u201cspecifically, eight out of 10 TrAP deregulated loci, including the flowering-promoting genes, displayed reduced H3K9me in the <i>TrAP</i> overexpression plants compared to WT plants\u2026\u201d. However, in looking at available H3K9me2 data on the UCSC browser, these genes are largely devoid of H3K9me signal. To determine if there is H3K9me2 signal at the sites tested in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a> in WT plants, and to determine if this signal is meaningfully reduced in the <i>TrAP</i> overexpression lines, the WT signal should not be normalized to one and instead should be presented as a % input (and/or normalized to H3) alongside the enrichment level at a gene without H3K9me (like actin). Such analysis should not require repeating the ChIP assays and thus can be done in the absence of a good lot of Abcam 1220 antibody. However, if these sites do not have sufficient H3K9me2 signal in Wt plants then testing additional loci will become necessary. In this case, looking at DNA methylation levels (even if they have been shown to be affected by other TrAP proteins the Bisaro lab) in Wt plants, <i>TrAP</i> overexpressor lines, and <i>kyp</i> mutants can serve in support of the authors\u2019 claims without relying on the Abcam H3K9me2 antibody."

However, to clarify the concern from this reviewer, we pursued an alternative genetic approach: First of all, we performed Southern blot analysis of virus titers in <i>kyp</i> mutant and Col-0 (new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A-C</a>), and observed substantial increase of virus replication in the <i>kyp</i> mutant compared to wild-type plants. This result indicates that KYP is a major immune system for defense of virus. More importantly, we created a mutant virus without functional TrAP (CaLcV \u2206TrAP), inoculated <i>kyp</i> mutants and Col-0 control. We found that control plants did not allow replication of CaLCuV \u2206TrAP at a detectable level. In contrast, the <i>kyp</i> mutant plants displayed systemic virus accumulation to a certain extent (as shown in single-stranded viral DNA, New <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B-E</a>). Thus, these new results clearly boosted our model that TrAP targets KYP to counter host defense (also see response below)."

Regarding comparison of DNA methylation levels in <i>suvh4</i> and <i>TrAP</i> transgenic lines, we would like to mention that this assay is not a priority for this manuscript \u2013 the reason is that the impact of TrAP and SUVH4 on host and viral genomes has been reported by Dr. David Bisaro's lab (Buchmann et al., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> in 2009 JV. 83 p5005-5013; and Raja, et al., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> in 2008 JV. 82 p8997-9007). These results are well in line with our current work. Thus, additional sequencing might not increase the novelty and concept advance of our study; moreover, our biochemical study shows that TrAP mainly interacts with SET domain of KYP, which is the methyltransferase domain, and we presume that changes in histone methylation might be the primary cause for the TrAP function, while DNA methylation changes might be a downstream effect."

For example if a gene (like RDR1) is expressed and marked by H3K4me in Wt plants, but is not marked by H3K9me or H3K27me then a ChIP signal showing reduced H3K9me or H3K27me is likely noise rather than a real signal.
