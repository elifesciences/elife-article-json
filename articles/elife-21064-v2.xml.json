Here, we demonstrate that PCGF6-PRC1 plays a role in repressing a subset of PRC1 target genes by recruiting RING1B and mediating downstream mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A. PCGF6-PRC1 bound loci are highly enriched for promoters of germ cell-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Conditional ablation of <i>Pcgf6</i> in ESCs leads to robust de-repression of such germ cell-related genes, in turn affecting cell growth and viability. We also find a role for PCGF6 in pre- and peri-implantation mouse embryonic development. We further show that a heterodimer of the transcription factors MAX and MGA recruits PCGF6 to target loci. PCGF6 thus links sequence specific target recognition by the MAX/MGA complex to PRC1-dependent transcriptional silencing of germ cell-specific genes in pluripotent stem cells."

Here, we demonstrate that PCGF6-PRC1 plays a role in repressing a subset of PRC1 target genes by recruiting RING1B and mediating downstream mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A. PCGF6-PRC1 bound loci are highly enriched for promoters of germ cell-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Conditional ablation of <i>Pcgf6</i> in ESCs leads to robust de-repression of such germ cell-related genes, in turn affecting cell growth and viability. We also find a role for PCGF6 in pre- and peri-implantation mouse embryonic development. We further show that a heterodimer of the transcription factors MAX and MGA recruits PCGF6 to target loci. PCGF6 thus links sequence specific target recognition by the MAX/MGA complex to PRC1-dependent transcriptional silencing of germ cell-specific genes in pluripotent stem cells."

PcG-mediated gene silencing involves at least two distinct enzymatic activities directed to histone tails: the first mediates Histone H2A mono-ubiquitination at K119 (H2AK119ub1) by the polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1), while the second mediates H3 tri-methylation at K27 (H3K27me3) by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Czermin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">M\u00fcller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shao et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2004</a>). According to the canonical view, H3K27me3 deposition by the EZH1/2 (enhancer of zeste homologs 1 and 2) histone methyltransferases leads to binding of the H3K27me3-reader protein CBX2 (chromobox protein homolog 2), in turn facilitating sequential recruitment of canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Czermin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fischle et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</a>).

For example, canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) may include PCGF2 (also known as MEL18: melanoma nuclear protein 18) or PCGF4 (also known as Bmi1: B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1). These cPRC1 complexes can be further classified into specific sub-complexes according to their association with CBX (CBX2/4/6/7/8) or PHC (PHC1/2/3: polyhomeotic homologs 1, 2 and 3) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vandamme et al., 2011</a>). CBX proteins contribute to recognition of H3K27me3, and therefore mediate recruitment of cPRC1 into target loci; while PHC proteins mediate gene compaction through polymerization of the SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain to facilitate transcriptional silencing (<a href=\"#bib28\">Isono et al., 2013</a>)."

In addition to the core subunits RING1A/B and PCGF1, ncPRC1-containing PCGF1 (PCGF1-PRC1) also incorporates KDM2B [Lysine (K)-Specific Demethylase 2B], BCOR (BCL6 Corepressor), BCORL1 (BCL6 Corepressor-Like 1), RYBP, YAF2 and SKP1 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Protein 1) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Farcas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gearhart et al., 2006</a>). Non-canonical PRC1 complexes are functionally linked with their canonical counterparts (cPRC1), and most of their target genes overlap with each other (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blackledge et al., 2015</a>). These overlapping genes often possess unmethylated CpG islands (CGI) in their promoters, and these are preferentially bound by the CXXC (two cysteines separated by two other residues) domain of KDM2B via recognition of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (<a href=\"#bib18\">Farcas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">He et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wu et al., 2013</a>).

As PRC2 further recruits cPRC1, non-canonical PCGF1-PRC1 can therefore activate the PRC2-cPRC1 axis to ensure robust transcriptional silencing of developmental genes that harbor unmethylated CGIs."

We demonstrate that PCGF6 mediates repression of target genes by recruiting RING1B and facilitating H2AK119ub1. Taking advantage of a <i>Pcgf6</i> conditional allele, we show that PCGF6 and RING1B common targets are enriched for meiosis- and germ cell-related genes in ESCs, and that such genes are robustly de-repressed in the absence of PCGF6 (<i>Pcgf6</i>-KO). Importantly, silencing of germ cell-related genes by PCGF6 likely plays a role in proliferation and growth of ESCs. We further demonstrate that PCGF6 is involved in pre- and peri-implantation mouse development. Indeed, loss of <i>Pcgf6</i> leads to pleiotropic defects in vivo, including aberrant axial development and impaired placenta formation. We also reveal a unique recruitment mechanism amongst PRC1 complexes whereby PCGF6-PRC1 utilizes its MGA and MAX components as a heterodimeric DNA binding module to directly recognize and repress expression of germ cell- and meiosis-related genes to support ESC maintenance and embryonic development."

We observed exogenous FLAG-PCGF6 expressed at the similar level of endogenous PCGF6. We then tested the interaction of these tagged proteins with endogenous RING1B, RYBP, L3MBTL2 and MAX (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We indeed found considerable association of MAX with both FLAG-PCGF6 and FLAG-RING1B as well as the other three proteins. We further observed PCGF1 or PCGF2 was not co-IPed with FLAG-PCGF6 while both of them associated with FLAG-RING1B. We finally confirmed EZH2 or SET1 were not co-IPed with either FLAG-PCGF6 or FLAG-RING1B. These results suggested that PCGF6 would be primarily involved in non-canonical PRC1 (ncPRC1), particularly PCGF6-PRC1, in mouse ESCs."

We observed considerable association of MAX at PCGF6 targets irrespective of RING1B binding. In contrast, H3K27me3 deposition at PCGF6 targets was mainly seen at RING1B-bound genes. We also noted that PCGF6 target genes harbor CGIs that tend to be slightly shorter and more methylated than CBX7 targets (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Consistently, PCGF6 targets were bound by KDM2B. KDM2B loss induced a subtle increase of RING1B binding at PCGF6 targets while RING1B binding at CBX7 targets was marginally decreased (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>).

                                "text": "We next wondered whether PCGF6 binding was functionally required for transcriptional repression. To test this, we performed RNA-seq and found that more than 250 genes were considerably up-regulated in <i>Pcgf6</i>-KO ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Importantly, these genes were a subset of the genes up-regulated in the <i>Ring1A</i> and <i>Ring1B</i> double knockout (<i>Ring1A/B</i>-dKO) ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To gain insight into the association of PCGF6 and RING1B for gene regulation, we divided RING1B- or PCGF6-bound genes into three categories (PCGF6+RING1B+, PCGF6-RING1B+ and PCGF6+RING1B-) and examined their expression in WT ESCs using FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped sequence reads) values (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This analysis showed that the PCGF6+RING1B+ genes were barely transcribed in WT ESCs; likewise, the PCGF6-RING1B+ genes were marginally expressed. In contrast, the PCGF6+RING1B- group that harbors CGIs was robustly expressed. We went on to examine changes of respective gene expression levels in each category in the absence of <i>Pcgf6</i> (<i>Pcgf6</i>-KO) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left). We found both PCGF6+RING1B+ and PCGF6-RING1B+ genes were significantly up-regulated while expression levels of PCGF6+RING1B- or PCGF6-RING1B- genes were barely altered in <i>Pcgf6</i>-KO ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left). We however also found that expression levels of highly up-regulated genes (more than 5-times; indicated by red lines in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) in the PCGF6+RING1B+ category were considerably higher than those in the PCGF6-RING1B+ category in <i>Pcgf6</i>-KO ESCs. Those categories were also up-regulated in <i>Ring1A/B</i>-dKO ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right), suggesting a functional link between PCGF6 and RING1A/B for down-regulation of such genes. We further confirmed these changes in expression levels of selected PCGF6+RING1B+ and PCGF6-RING1B+ genes by RT-qPCR in <i>Pcgf6</i>-KO and <i>Ring1A/B</i>-dKO ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Together, PCGF6 is suggested to contribute to RING1B-mediated repression of target genes primarily in the PCGF6+RING1B+ category but also in RING1B targets not bound by PCGF6 to a lesser extent. We thus suggest PCGF6+RING1B+ category as a primary target for PCGF6-PRC1-mediated gene repression."

Furthermore, this H2AK119ub1 enrichment was dramatically diminished in the absence of <i>Pcgf6</i>, revealing a role for PCGF6 in mediating H2AK119ub1 deposition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, H2AK119ub1 enrichment at <i>Zic1</i> and <i>Hoxd11,</i> cPRC1 targets, was marginally affected in <i>Pcgf6</i>-KO ESCs, further supporting our model that PCGF6 is not primarily involved in cPRC1-dependent repression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, middle)."

Previous reports have demonstrated that mutations of RING1B residue I53 (i.e., I53S or I53A), abrogated its E3 ligase activity by disrupting its interactions with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH5C (also known as UBE2D3: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D3) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ben-Saadon et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buchwald et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Endoh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Eskeland et al., 2010</a>).

We observed enrichment of the E-box motif CACGTG, a DNA sequence that is recognized by the bHLH-containing transcription factors including MAX (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991</a>), within these promoters (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, this motif was not enriched in RING1B- or CBX7-bound genes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), suggesting that the E-box motif is a feature of PCGF6-PRC1 targets. Consistent with this notion, we observed considerable overlap between PCGF6-bound and MAX-bound genes, while the overlap between PCGF6-bound and MYC-bound genes was much less (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Interestingly, MGA, a transcription factor that also forms a heterodimer with MAX and binds the CACGTG E-box motif (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hurlin et al., 1999</a>), is included in the PCGF6 complex determined by us (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and others (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hauri et al., 2016</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib30\">Kloet et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ogawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Qin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Trojer et al., 2011</a>).

Indeed, ChIP-qPCR in the <i>Max</i>-KD or <i>Mga</i>-KD ESCs revealed that PCGF6 binding to target loci depends on MAX and MGA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Importantly, MAX and MGA bind these targets in mutually dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This suggests that MAX and MGA may form a dimer to bind to their targets. We further used a previously reported <i>Max-</i>KO ES cell line to test MAX-dependent recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hishida et al., 2011</a>). RING1B and RYBP, which form stoichiometric complexes with PCGF6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), did not bind to PCGF6-PRC1 target loci in the <i>Max-</i>KO ESCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Likewise, local H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 levels were considerably decreased, and binding of L3MBTL2, another key regulator of ncPRC1, into PCGF6-PRC1 target genes was also depleted in the <i>Max-</i>KO ESCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In contrast, enrichment of RING1B, H2AK119ub1, H3K27me3 and RYBP at <i>Zic1</i>, a cPRC1 target, did not show considerable changes in the <i>Max</i>-KO ESCs. These results suggest that recruitment of both PCGF6 and L3MBTL2 requires MAX. We finally checked whether the decreased binding of PCGF6 is not due to secondary effects of transcriptional activation upon MAX depletion. We have selected genes bound by MAX and PCGF6, which were not up-regulated in <i>Max</i>-KO ESCs, and confirmed MAX-dependent binding of PCGF6 at these targets (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>).

The mutant MAX proteins also retained the ability to associate and form stable complexes with HA-PCGF6, RING1B and L3MBTL2 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). As expected, ChIP-qPCR revealed that the FLAG-tagged MAX could restore binding of the HA-tagged PCGF6 into target loci in <i>Max</i>-KO ESCs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>), whereas the mutant MAX proteins failed to bind targets and recruit HA-tagged PCGF6. These observations demonstrate a role of the MAX/MGA heterodimer in recruiting PCGF6-PRC1 by direct DNA motif recognition for maintenance of ESCs. To further examine this model, we expressed MAX/TETR, and ectopically tethered this fusion protein to a pre-integrated TetO array in ESCs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). ChIP-qPCR analysis showed binding of the MAX/TETR fusion protein at the TetO array, which was accompanied by mild enrichment of HA-tagged PCGF6, H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), but barely RING1B (data not shown). These data again support MAX-dependent recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1. The limited effect of MAX/TETR to recruit PCGF6 could be due to a potential dimerization of MAX with other partners than MGA in this experimental setup."

We therefore examined the impact of <i>Pcgf6</i> deletion in primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), which already express such germ cell-related genes. We induced the PGCLCs via epiblast-like cells (epiLCs), using an in vitro culture system that we have previously developed (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayashi et al., 2011</a>). In particular, we cultured the ESCs in 2i-containing (MAPK inhibitor and GSK3 inhibitor) media without feeders for 3 days (from day \u22125 to day \u22122 in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), and induced epiLC by adding Activin A and bFGF into the media for 2 days (from day \u22122 to day 0).

Genetic ablation of <i>Pcgf6</i> at day \u22125 induced growth arrest and cell death of ESCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>); while ablation of <i>Pcgf6</i> at day \u22122 caused significant growth defects in epiLCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), revealing a stage-specific role of PCGF6 for growth and survival of ESCs and epiLCs.

We therefore performed RNA-seq before and after knocking out <i>Pcgf6</i> in ESCs, epiLCs and PGCLCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). We observed that the same group of genes (the PCGF6+RING1B+ category in ESCs) were de-repressed in ESCs, epiLCs and PGCLCs in the absence of <i>Pcgf6</i>. Furthermore, the extent of derepression of PCGF6 target genes was also similar among these three cell types. We observed similar trends for meiosis- and germ cell-related genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, right). Thus, these results indicate that the different phenotypic impacts of <i>Pcgf6</i> ablation in ESCs, epiLCs and PGCLCs are not due to up-regulation of different sets of genes, but rather suggest that PCGF6-PRC1-mediated gene silencing is essential to maintain ESC and epiLC, but not PGCLC.

PCGF6 physically interacts with RING1B, and plays a role in recruitment of RING1B to target genes, followed by deposition of H2AK119ub1 and transcriptional silencing. We have previously reported that the PCGF1-associated ncPRC1 (PCGF1-PRC1) recruits PRC2 to target genes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackledge et al., 2014</a>). Here, we demonstrate that PCGF6-PRC1 also has a similar role, as ectopic targeting of a PCGF6 protein fused to the Tet repressor (PCGF6/TETR) to a pre-integrated TetO array leads to sequential binding of RING1B, H2AK119ub1 deposition and PRC2 recruitment in cis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

However, these genes are distinct from those bound by PCGF1-PRC1 and canonical PRC1, which mainly include developmental genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013G</a>). Such developmental genes are evolutionarily conserved targets of PcG complexes, and are characterized by long CpG island (CGI) promoters that are usually not marked by DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sharif et al., 2013</a>). The CXXC domain containing protein KDM2B recruits PCGF1-PRC1 into these loci by binding unmethylated CGIs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackledge et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, PCGF6-PRC1 target loci tend to have slightly shorter and more DNA methylated CGIs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), where KDM2B seems to play distinct roles from PCGF1-PRC1.

Thus, our findings reveal that there are at least two major modes of gene silencing by PRC1; the first involves PCGF1-PRC1 and cPRC1 and silences developmental genes, while the second involves PCGF6-PRC1 and silences germ cell-specific and meiosis-specific genes (see the model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)."

PCGF6-bound genes are enriched for short CGIs, frequently marked by methylated DNA, and are not bound by PCGF1-PRC1. Indeed, developmental genes, which are the main targets of PCGF1-PRC1, are not bound by PCGF6-PRC1, revealing distinct functional roles of these two ncPRC1 complexes.

Following up on the recent characterization of non-canonical PRC1 sub-complexes the authors investigate the function of one such sub-complex containing the PCGF6 protein. They present data suggesting that PCGF6 is involved in the recruitment of non-canonical PRC1 to a subset of genes that encode germ cell regulators. Mechanistically, they propose that recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 is mediated by MAX/MGA transcription factors."

In the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cPCGF6 recruits RING1B to target genes and facilitates downstream H2K119ub1 deposition\u201d and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> the authors show ChIP-seq of RING1B in WT and Pcgf6-KO ESCs. In light of the presence of HP1 proteins (as well as G9a and GLP, at least following Ogawa et al. 2002) in the PCGF6-PRC1 complex, it would be really important to perform ChIP-seq of H3K9me2 in the same condition. Likewise, KD of CBX1 and CBX3 followed by RT-PCR would help understand whether K9me2-HP1 repressive chromatin does contribute to silencing of PCGF6-PRC1 target genes."

ChIP-qPCR analysis showed binding of the MAX/TETR fusion protein at the TetO array, which accompanies mild enrichments of HA-tagged PCGF6, H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>) while barely RING1B (data not shown). These data again support MAX-dependent recruitment of PCGF6-PRC1 though its impact is limited in this experimental setup.

In the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cPCGF6 recruits RING1B to target genes and facilitates downstream H2K119ub1 deposition\u201d and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> the authors show ChIP-seq of RING1B in WT and Pcgf6-KO ESCs. In light of the presence of HP1 proteins (as well as G9a and GLP, at least following Ogawa et al. 2002) in the PCGF6-PRC1 complex, it would be really important to perform ChIP-seq of H3K9me2 in the same condition. Likewise, KD of CBX1 and CBX3 followed by RT-PCR would help understand whether K9me2-HP1 repressive chromatin does contribute to silencing of PCGF6-PRC1 target genes.</i>"

Unlike L3mbtl2-KO ESCs (Qin et al., 2012), we did not observe considerable changes in H3K9me2 levels in Pcgf6-KO. Consistent with this we also showed L3MBTL2 bound to the targets in Pcgf6-KO. We suggest L3MBTL2/G9A axis acts in parallel with PCGF6/RING1 pathway within the same complexes. Indeed, we also found L3MBTL2 bound to the targets in MAX-dependent manner. MAX/MGA heterodimer likely recruit PCGF6 and L3MBTL2 mutually independently as summarized in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."
