We performed crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and RNAseq on human brain, and identified nELAVL binding sites on 8681 transcripts. Using knockout mice and RNAi in human neuroblastoma cells, we showed that nELAVL intronic and 3' UTR binding regulates human RNA splicing and abundance. We validated hundreds of nELAVL targets among which were important neuronal and disease-associated transcripts, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) transcripts. We therefore investigated RNA regulation in AD brain, and observed differential splicing of 150 transcripts, which in some cases correlated with differential nELAVL binding. Unexpectedly, the most significant change of nELAVL binding was evident on non-coding Y RNAs. nELAVL/Y RNA complexes were specifically remodeled in AD and after acute UV stress in neuroblastoma cells. We propose that the increased nELAVL/Y RNA association during stress may lead to nELAVL sequestration, redistribution of nELAVL target binding, and altered neuronal RNA splicing."

We performed crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and RNAseq on human brain, and identified nELAVL binding sites on 8681 transcripts. Using knockout mice and RNAi in human neuroblastoma cells, we showed that nELAVL intronic and 3' UTR binding regulates human RNA splicing and abundance. We validated hundreds of nELAVL targets among which were important neuronal and disease-associated transcripts, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) transcripts. We therefore investigated RNA regulation in AD brain, and observed differential splicing of 150 transcripts, which in some cases correlated with differential nELAVL binding. Unexpectedly, the most significant change of nELAVL binding was evident on non-coding Y RNAs. nELAVL/Y RNA complexes were specifically remodeled in AD and after acute UV stress in neuroblastoma cells. We propose that the increased nELAVL/Y RNA association during stress may lead to nELAVL sequestration, redistribution of nELAVL target binding, and altered neuronal RNA splicing."

Mammalian ELAVL proteins include the ubiquitously expressed paralog ELAVL1 (also termed HUA or HUR) and the three neuron-specific paralogs, ELAVL2, 3 and 4 (also termed HUB, C, and D, and collectively referred to as nELAVL; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</a>). nELAVL proteins are expressed exclusively in neurons in mice (<a href=\"#bib75\">Okano and Darnell, 1997</a>), and they are important for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akamatsu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Kasashima et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Mobarak et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Anderson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Antic et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Aranda-Abreu et al., 1999</a>).

A more comprehensive approach was taken by immunoprecipitating an overexpressed isoform of ELAVL4 in mice, although such RNA immunoprecipitation experiments cannot distinguish between direct and indirect targets (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bolognani et al., 2010</a>). Recently, direct binding of nELAVL to target RNAs in mouse brain was demonstrated by high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</a>); these data, coupled with transcriptome profiling of <i>Elavl3/4</i> KO mice, demonstrated that nELAVL directly regulates neuronal mRNA abundance and alternative splicing by binding to U-rich elements with interspersed purine residues in 3\u2019UTRs and introns in mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</a>)."

We validated the functional consequences of nELAVL binding in mice and cultured human neuroblastoma cells and showed that the loss of nELAVL affected mRNA abundance and alternative splicing of hundreds of transcripts. We further investigated RNA regulation in AD brains, and found that numerous transcripts were differentially spliced in AD, which correlated with differential nELAVL binding in some cases. Remarkably, we observed the most significant increase in nELAVL binding in AD on a class of non-coding RNAs, Y RNAs. We recapitulated these findings in human neuroblastoma cells, showing that nELAVL binding is linked to Y ribonucleoprotein (RNP) remodeling acutely during UV-induced stress, and chronically in AD."

We searched for and identified nELAVL RNA binding sites (peaks) that were significant (p&lt;0.01) and that were present in at least five out of 8 individuals (n = 75,592). nELAVL binding at these sites correlated between individuals (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and these peaks were further investigated. We determined the nELAVL binding motif by analyzing the top 500 nELAVL peaks (+/- 25nt) using MEME ChIP (<a href=\"#bib64\">Machanick and Bailey, 2011</a>) and HOMER (<a href=\"#bib44\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>). This revealed that nELAVL binds polyU RNA stretches in human brain, particularly when interrupted by a G (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is in excellent agreement with the nELAVL binding motif identified in mouse brain using CLIP and in vitro binding assays (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</a>). Because nELAVL has been shown to regulate alternative splicing and mRNA abundance in mouse brain by binding to introns and 3\u2019UTRs, respectively, we analyzed the genomic distribution of the peaks defined here. As previously reported for mouse nElavl (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</a>), nELAVL binding sites are found in 3\u2019UTRs and introns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), with far higher per-nucleotide density in 3\u2019UTR regions (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Consistently we observed that nELAVL peaks in 3\u2019UTRs were higher than intronic peaks (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These results suggest that nELAVL could regulate splicing and mRNA abundance in the human brain."

We observed that nELAVL binding correlated with mRNA abundance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This was not unexpected, as nELAVL 3\u2019 UTR binding has previously been shown to increase mRNA abundance, due to its role in mRNA stabilization. The correlation between nELAVL binding and mRNA abundance might therefore not only reflect the dependence of nELAVL binding on mRNA abundance, but also a role of nELAVL in mRNA stabilization. Consistently, we observed that intronic nELAVL binding correlated less with mRNA abundance than 3\u2019UTR binding (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

Top targets were identified based on normalized nELAVL binding (binding sites were normalized for mRNA abundance and summarized per gene). Thirty-seven\u00a0percent of nELAVL peaks (n = 27,581) mapped to these top targets. We constructed a subnetwork that connects top nELAVL target gene products based on a literature-based network of protein-protein interactions (PPI) created from multiple online databases (<a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Six clusters were identified within the resulting network (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and gene set enrichment analyses were performed for top nELAVL targets found in the different clusters with Enrichr (<a href=\"#bib22\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Each cluster was examined for enrichment of Biological Processes (BP), Molecular Functions (MF), Cellular Components, and Mammalian Phenotypes (MP) terms (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>). Enriched terms included RNA processing and transcription regulation, signal transduction, synaptic transmission, synaptic proteins, and abnormal neuron morphology and physiology. Three of the six clusters were particularly important for neuronal function. Cluster 1 is especially enriched in members of the TGFbeta/SMAD signaling pathways and the FOX protein family. Cluster 2 contains many actors of the IGF-I axis, which is important for neuronal development including neurogenesis, myelination, synaptogenesis, dendritic branching and neuroprotection after neuronal damage. Finally, cluster 3 is almost exclusively formed of synaptic proteins including many postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, members of the neuroligin/neurexin families and glutamatergic receptors or voltage-gated channels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that nELAVL associates with transcripts encoding proteins involved in key aspects of neuronal physiology."

At the transcript level, we found that more than 90% of mouse nELAVL targets were among human nELAVL targets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, only 20% of human targets were bound by nELAVL in mouse brain, which is at least partly due to the 10-fold increased depth of the human dataset (more than 10 million human CLIP tags compare to less than a million mouse CLIP tags). Yet these differences could also reflect an increased functional complexity of nELAVL regulation in the human brain, and/or the fact that mouse targets were identified at different developmental stages."

The vast majority of these overlapping binding sites were in 3\u2019UTRs (88%). These results indicate that many nELAVL targets are shared between mouse and human and that nELAVL binding at the transcript level is conserved, whereas individual binding sites have diverged drastically, especially within introns.

We examined nELAVL binding in a set of genes with disease associated 3\u2019UTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bruno et al., 2012</a>). We found that these genes were enriched among nELAVL 3\u2019UTR targets (n = 200; p = 0.001; hypergeometric test), and that nELAVL binding sites directly overlapped with 45 disease associated SNPs, including SNPs associated with autism, schizophrenia, depression, AD, and PD (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3A</a>)."

Indeed, we found that the top nELAVL targets were enriched among AD genes (n = 11; p = 0.03; hypergeometric test; contained in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3B</a>) as well as among AD risk loci identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AD (<a href=\"#bib71\">Naj et al., 2011</a>) (n = 77; p = 1.7e<sup>-14</sup>; hypergeometric test; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3C</a>). To investigate if nELAVL mediated regulation of AD related and other transcripts might be affected in AD, we performed nELAVL CLIP and RNAseq on AD subject brains, age-matched to control subjects (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A/B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">3D</a>). Importantly, ELAVL3/4 mRNA levels were similar between control and AD samples and ELAVL2 showed only a slight decrease in transcript abundance in AD brains (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), which allowed us to compare nELAVL binding profiles between control and AD brains. We did not detect many significant changes in nELAVL binding nor mRNA abundance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A/B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">3D</a>), probably due to the variation between human samples, the small sample size, and the potential heterogeneity of AD. We did however observe that 150 transcripts were differentially spliced in the 9 AD subjects (FDR&lt;0.05 and \u0394I&gt;0.1; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3E</a>).

Precisely this exon was differentially spliced in AD subjects, with AD subjects showing a reduced exon inclusion rate compared to control subjects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Along with the differential exon inclusion, we observed that nELAVL peak binding was fourfold decreased in AD subjects (log2 fold change = -2.35; p = 0.16; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results are consistent with nELAVL-mediated dysregulation of this exon in AD subjects, with decreased binding leading to decreased exon inclusion. In conclusion, while we did not detect global nELAVL binding and mRNA abundance changes in AD subjects, we observed that splicing of 150 transcripts was affected, which in some cases might be linked to nELAVL dysregulation."

RO60 is believed to act as a sensor of RNA quality, targeting defective RNAs for degradation (<a href=\"#bib87\">Sim and Wolin, 2011</a>). RO60 was initially identified as an autoantigen targeted in systemic lupus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Lerner et al., 1981</a>) and some subjects with the paraneoplastic encephalopathy syndrome harbor both anti-RO and anti-nELAVL (Hu) autoantibodies (<a href=\"#bib65\">Manley et al., 1994</a>).

We found that 237 of the 320 nELAVL bound Y RNAs were Y3-like RNAs (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3F</a>), and that nELAVL bound Y RNAs showed an enrichment of the nELAVL binding motif (202 Y RNAs contained UUUUUU, allowing a G at any one position), which is also present in the canonical hY3 RNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A/B</a>). We examined the 118 nELAVL bound Y RNAs that did not fit this consensus in more detail. 91 of these Y RNAs (77%) contained either a 5mer version of the motif or the motif with an A or C instead of a G, and we found U/G rich stretches in the remaining 27 Y RNAs (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3F</a>). In addition, some Y RNAs with a strong binding motif did not show any evidence of nELAVL binding. In general, these Y RNAs showed a lower expression compared to nELAVL bound Y RNA, which may explain the absence of detectable nELAVL binding (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This suggests that Y RNPs undergo nELAVL-dependent remodeling in AD. Interestingly, we did observe a high variability in nELAVL/Y RNA association between AD samples (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), with three of them showing a very strong nELAVL/Y RNA association. Efforts to relate this difference to the expression of stress-related genes, post-mortem interval, age, extent of disease and cause of death were not conclusive, and the cause for the variation in nELAVL binding to Y RNAs among AD subjects remains elusive."

                                "text": "The observation of increased nELAVL/Y RNA association in AD raised the possibility that Y RNP remodeling is associated with neuronal stress. Y RNP remodeling has previously been linked to UV-induced stress (<a href=\"#bib86\">Sim et al., 2009</a>), and both bacterial (<a href=\"#bib25\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Wurtmann and Wolin, 2010</a>) and mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Chen et al., 2003</a>) show an increased sensitivity to UV stress in the absence of RO60. ELAVL binding can be modulated in response to stress in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</a>), and ELAVL proteins, which shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in response to environmental cues, preferentially accumulate in cytoplasmic stress granules upon stress (<a href=\"#bib38\">Gallouzi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Fan and Steitz, 1998b</a>). We therefore examined the effect of acute UV stress on Y RNP remodeling in IMR-32 cells. IMR-32 cells were exposed to a low dose of UV stress (not sufficient to induce RNA:protein crosslinking) and allowed to recover for 24\u00a0h before being analyzed by nELAVL CLIP. We found that nELAVL bound 132 Y RNAs in neuroblastoma cells (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3F</a>), that Y RNAs showed an enrichment of the nELAVL binding motif (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) or at least contained a degenerate version of it (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3F</a>), and that non-bound Y RNAs with a motif show a very low expression (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, nELAVL binding on Y RNAs was dynamic and increased in UV stressed cells compared to non-stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), while their abundance did not change upon UV irradiation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). To assess whether Y RNA levels were affected by nELAVL, we depleted <i>nELAVL</i> by RNAi three days prior to the UV exposure, and analyzed Y RNA levels by RNAseq. Y RNA abundance was not affected by nELAVL depletion in UV stressed IMR-32 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7D</a>). These results indicate that increased nELAVL binding to Y RNAs is not a function of Y RNA levels, and that nELAVL binding during stress is not required for Y RNA stability."

The fraction of the short CLIP reads mapping to Y RNAs was considerably higher using this strategy, revealing that up to 6% of nELAVL CLIP tags map to Y RNAs in AD and UV stressed cells, compared to less than 0.5% in control brain and ~1% in non-stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

We found that the majority of changing nELAVL binding sites decreased in AD subjects with high nELAVL/Y RNA, while nELAVL binding in AD subjects with low nELAVL/Y RNA association was mostly increasing (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Because nELAVL binding in UV-stressed cells also predominantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) and most of the decreased binding sites were in introns (85%, assessed by annotation of peak locations), we speculate that nELAVL/Y RNA association leads to a sequestration of nELAVL specifically from its intron targets, which might induce similar splicing changes as <i>nELAVL</i> depletion by RNAi. Of note is our observation that nELAVL binding decreased at only a subset of intronic binding sites."

Remarkably, nELAVL binding at all of these sites decreased in AD subjects with Y RNA association but not in AD subjects without Y RNA association (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), although nELAVL peak binding changed significantly at only one binding site (boxed in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, FDR = 0.003). We also investigated if decreased nELAVL peak binding was associated with corresponding splicing changes in AD subjects (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The inclusion rate of only one of the 7 exons changed significantly in AD patients with high nELAVL/Y RNA association (FDR = 0.04), and the direction of the splicing change was indeed the same as the splicing changes observed upon UV or <i>nELAVL</i> RNAi treatment.

Importantly, we observed an enrichment of nELAVL bound exons and of <i>nELAVL</i> RNAi dependent exons among the exons that changed upon Y3wt but not Y3mut overexpression (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C/D</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s4\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s5\">5</a>).

Yet the RNA targets of nELAVL in human brain were completely unknown. Here, we generated a comprehensive genome-wide RNA binding map of nELAVL in human brain, identifying 75,592 significant binding events within 8681 transcripts. We observed a significant overlap between these binding sites and disease-associated 3\u2019UTR SNPs, and the potential disruption of nELAVL-mediated RNA regulation at these sites might contribute to disease manifestation. Most deleterious variants to date have been identified by exome sequencing while as many as 50% of disease-causing mutations are thought to affect splicing (<a href=\"#bib99\">Ward and Cooper, 2009</a>). With whole genome sequencing being increasingly available, non-coding variants are also increasingly detected, some of which may be linked to disease. As the majority of nELAVL binding occurs in introns and 3\u2019UTRs, we expect that many binding sites will overlap with prospective disease-associated non-coding variants. The overlap between deleterious variants and nELAVL binding sites, and the observation that nELAVL binding at individual sites diverged between mice and human, underscores the importance of this study and illustrates the caveat of relying solely on mouse models when studying human disease. Considering the widespread nature of nELAVL binding in human brain and that RNA dysregulation has been linked to numerous neurological disorders, we believe that this binding map will be a valuable resource for the scientific community."

Due to the incomplete RNAi depletion of nELAVL in neuroblastoma cells, and potential differences in mRNA abundance and therefore nELAVL binding between the different samples, it is likely that we validated only a fraction of nELAVL-regulated transcripts. Despite these technical limitations we demonstrated that nELAVL impacts mRNA abundance and/or splicing of hundreds of targets. Among the nELAVL regulated transcripts were many transcripts implicated in human disease, including AD, which led us to investigate RNA regulation in AD subjects. Due to the relatively small sample size and the heterogeneity between these samples, likely due to both differences between individuals and sample preservation during postmortem collection, we did not detect many reproducible changes in mRNA abundance or nELAVL binding between AD and non-AD subjects. However, we found that 150 transcripts were differentially spliced in AD subjects, which in some cases coincided with differential nELAVL binding. Unexpectedly, the most significant binding change in AD was a dramatic increase in nELAVL binding to a class of non-coding RNAs, termed Y RNAs. This change was evident on a specific subset of Y RNAs harboring the nELAVL binding site. nELAVL/Y RNA binding also increased during UV stress in human neuroblastoma cells, while the abundance of Y RNAs remained constant in AD subjects and upon UV exposure. The increased nELAVL/Y RNA association correlated with decreased nELAVL binding at a subset of intronic binding sites, and was associated with similar splicing changes as induced by nELAVL depletion, suggesting that nELAVL/Y RNP remodeling during acute and chronic stress sequesters nELAVL from its mRNA targets. We provided further evidence for a Y RNA dependent nELAVL sequestration by overexpressing Y3 RNAs harboring either a wild\u00a0type or mutated nELAVL binding site. Exons that were differentially spliced upon Y RNA overexpression were enriched for nELAVL bound exons, indicating nELAVL sequestration, which was dependent on an intact nELAVL binding site in the Y RNA."

While ELAVL binding is frequently reported to result in an increase in mRNA abundance, we found several cases where nELAVL binding seemed to have an opposing effect.

In contrast to the position-dependent splicing observed for other RBPs (<a href=\"#bib59\">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</a>), we observed that upstream nELAVL binding was associated with both exon skipping and inclusion. While nELAVL binding was observed within 25-50 nucleotides upstream of skipped exons, coinciding with the branch point sequence, nELAVL binding peaked within the proximal 25 nucleotides upstream of included exons, overlapping the polypyrimidine tract. Binding of auxiliary splicing factors, including nELAVL, to the branch point sequence usually interferes with spliceosome assembly and thus leads to exon skipping (<a href=\"#bib59\">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</a>). Polypyrimidine tract binding however can lead to both exon inclusion and skipping (<a href=\"#bib61\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Wei et al., 2012</a>), presumably depending on the recruitment of splicing enhancers or silencers.

For example, intronic nELAVL binding of the gene encoding the amyloid precursor protein, APP, was associated with skipping of exons 7 and 8. Both exons have previously been shown to be alternatively spliced and encode for the Kunitz protease inhibitory (KPI) motif, a domain that has been linked to APP processing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ben Khalifa et al., 2012</a>). Remarkably, KPI domain containing isoforms of APP have been shown to be increased in AD (<a href=\"#bib112\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), indicating that APP splicing might contribute to AD pathogenesis, and that nELAVL binding in human brain might be important to regulate the inclusion of the KPI domain. nELAVL regulates the splicing of two more AD-related transcripts, PICALM and BIN1, by promoting the inclusion of alternative exons 13 and 6a, respectively. Both proteins have been implicated in APP trafficking and both exons lie within domains mediating protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib94\">Tan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Treusch et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, inclusion of the alternative exon 13 in PICALM has been linked to an AD-associated SNP (<a href=\"#bib77\">Parikh et al., 2014</a>), and we observed in this study that exon 6a of BIN1 shows a higher inclusion rate in controls compared to AD subjects. Since nELAVL binding promotes the inclusion of this exon, and control subjects show higher nELAVL binding, we propose that the altered splicing of BIN1 in AD subjects might be due to differential nELAVL binding. In fact, several nELAVL-regulated exons have been shown to be differentially spliced in AD subjects, further strengthening the link between nELAVL dysregulation and AD."

ELAVL proteins can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in response to environmental cues and preferentially accumulate in cytoplasmic stress granules upon cellular stress (<a href=\"#bib37\">Fan and Steitz, 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Gallouzi et al., 2000</a>), and ELAVL binding to the CAT-1 transcript is modulated in response to stress in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, while we found that nELAVL specifically associates with Y RNAs during AD and acute UV stress, the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of nELAVL, RO60, and Y RNAs was not affected by UV stress. Because Y RNA levels remained constant, we propose that Y RNP complexes are specifically remodeled during AD and acute stress, which is not likely due to a change in nucleocytoplasmic protein/RNA distribution. These results are consistent with previous observations that stress induced shuttling might be limited to ELAVL1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Burry and Smith, 2006</a>). Our observation of Y RNP remodeling in two very different systems of neuronal stress suggests that differential nELAVL/Y RNA association may be a widespread phenomenon and a focus of future studies."

The apparent lack of promoters upstream led to a premature designation of these Y RNAs as pseudogenes. Surprisingly, we found that hundreds of these Y RNA copies are expressed in human brain and neuroblastoma cells, although it remains unclear if these Y RNAs can still associate with RO60, because the RO60 binding site in many Y RNA copies is mutated (<a href=\"#bib79\">Perreault et al., 2005</a>). We observed that numerous Y RNA copies were more strongly associated with nELAVL in AD brain and acutely stressed cells, yet nELAVL binding did not affect their levels, indicating a function for this interaction other than Y RNA stabilization. While the outcome of nELAVL/Y RNA remains to be elucidated, our work revealed an aspect of nELAVL/Y RNA association related to stoichiometry. Hundreds of Y RNAs are bound by nELAVL in AD and UV-stress, which corresponds to up to 5% of all nELAVL CLIP tags. This shift of nELAVL binding may distort the normal stoichiometry of nELAVL interactions with its mRNA targets. Indeed, non-coding RNAs have previously been shown to affect RBP-RNA stoichiometry and therefore the biological function of other RNAs or RBPs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Borah et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cazalla et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hansen et al., 2013</a>). Our data indicate that the binding of nELAVL to Y RNAs during stress may lead to a redistribution of nELAVL binding and/or competition of nELAVL from other RNAs. Consistently, we found that high nELAVL/Y RNA association was associated with a general decrease in nELAVL binding at a subset of binding sites, especially within introns, and consequential splicing changes were reminiscent of splicing changes provoked by nELAVL depletion. Consistently, splicing changes induced by Y RNA overexpression showed an enrichment of nELAVL binding that was dependent on the presence of the ELAVL binding motif in Y RNAs. Hence we propose that the increased association of nELAVL and Y RNAs during stress causes sequestration of nELAVL from its mRNA targets."

Our results are consistent with a hypothesis that a relatively subtle and perhaps long-term effect of Y RNA binding on normal nELAVL stoichiometry may underlie subtle and long-term changes in nELAVL biology. Perhaps analogously, the sequestration of the RBP, TDP-43, has previously been linked to neurodegenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). While the underlying mechanisms of TDP-43 and nELAVL sequestration are distinct, relatively subtle and long-term rearrangement of RNA:protein stoichiometry and interactions might be a recurrent theme of neurodegeneration."

This database has both common and human-specific features that confirm and enhance previous work in mice and underscore its value as a resource for scientific inquiry. We have linked the data to genome-wide measurements of both mRNA levels and splicing suggesting specific functions for these important interactions. Moreover, we have uncovered a stress-modulated interaction of nELAVL proteins with non-coding Y RNAs. Y RNPs are remodeled during both UV-induced and chronic AD-related stress, which may be causally related to the pathophysiology of stress by causing a redistribution of nELAVL RNA target binding. Data implicating nELAVL proteins in several neurologic diseases, as well as the overlap of nELAVL binding sites we describe here with SNPs linked to the same and additional human diseases underscore the importance of this resource for the ongoing study of the molecular basis of human neurologic disease."

Data was visualized with UCSC genome browser (<a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/\">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</a>). To reduce mis-alignments due to sequencing errors, reads were initially filtered based on quality score (\u226520 in the degenerate linker region; average of \u226520 in the remaining read). Exact sequences were collapsed to remove PCR duplicates. The degenerate barcode (and index if applicable) were removed and the 3\u2019 linker was trimmed. Using FASTA files as input, reads were subsequently mapped to the hg18 build of the human genome by novoalign (<a href=\"www.novocraft.com\">www.novocraft.com</a>), requiring unambiguous mapping and a maximum of two mismatches. To identify unique CLIP tags, we applied stringent filtering, and collapsed reads with the same starting genomic positions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Darnell et al., 2011</a>), and only unique tags (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) were used for subsequent analyses. Peaks with significant nELAVL binding compared to background (p-value&lt;0.01) were identified utilizing a similar approach from previous studies (<a href=\"#bib109\">Xue et al., 2009</a>). Specifically, we used a scan statistics (<a href=\"#bib41\">Glaz et al., 2013</a>) to compute p-values in which each observed PeakHeight (PH, CLIP tags within a peak) was compared to the PH one would expect by random chance, assuming a background of uniformly distributed CLIP tags in each gene. Bonferroni correction was applied to the resulting p-values to correct for multiple hypothesis testing.

Only expressed genes and robustly bound peaks were analyzed to reduce multiple testing. Expressed genes were defined as genes that had more than one count per million (cpm) in at least 5 control brain samples (out of 8), in 6 AD brain samples (out of 9), or in 4 IMR-32 samples (out of 12 RNAi/UV samples or 9 Y RNA infection samples, respectively). Robustly bound peaks were defined as peaks that had more than one cpm in at least 5 control or AD brain samples (out of 8 and 9, respectively), or in 2 control or 4 UV IMR-32 samples (out of 3 and 6, respectively). We controlled for batch effects of brain samples (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) and estimated the false discovery rate (FDR) with an optimized FDR approach (q-value methodology [<a href=\"#bib92\">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</a>]) to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. PeakHeight (PH, CLIP tags within peaks) was normalized for library size, and, to account for differences in gene expression level, normalized PH was determined by dividing PH by rpkm of the corresponding gene. nELAVL binding was defined as the summary of PH per gene, whereas normalized nELAVL binding was defined as the summary of normalized PH per gene. We similarly defined 3\u2019UTR and intronic binding by summarizing only 3\u2019UTR or intronic peaks, respectively. Top targets were defined as the top 1000 genes according to normalized nELAVL binding. mRNA abundance was defined as cpm RNAseq tags per gene. We did not normalize nELAVL binding nor mRNA abundance for transcript length as we performed differential analysis of the datasets. A pseudocount of 1 was added before log2 transformation. Cross-correlation plots show log2 raw counts of PH or RNAseq reads per gene. Splicing changes were determined using the observed inclusion and exclusion junction read counts and by fitting a generalized linear model with a logit link function. For each exon, GLM likelihood ratio test was conducted to test if there was a significant difference in the fraction of exon inclusion (delta Inclusion, \u0394I) between conditions, and controlling for batch variables of brain samples. \u0394I (equivalent to delta PSI) was calculated by subtracting fraction exon inclusion of Sample 2 from fraction exon inclusion of Sample 1. FDR was calculated as described before using the q-value method. High confidence alternative splicing events were identified by requiring a stringent criteria of FDR&lt;0.05 and \u0394I\u22650.1. P-values to assess the statistical significance of the overlap between gene lists were calculated with a hypergeometric test (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A/9D</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s5\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). A paired Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate differences in Y RNA binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C/7B</a>), and a t-test was used to evaluate changes in mRNA/Y RNA/protein abundance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B/9A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s2\">2</a>). Differences in cumulative density curves were evaluated with a one-sided KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

To discriminate between individual Y RNA copies we used CLIP reads, aligned with novoalign. While this mapping strategy allowed us to discrimate between individual Y RNA copies with high confidence, CLIP reads that mapped to multiple Y RNAs were discarded. Exclusively for <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, CLIP tags were therefore additionally aligned with Bowtie2 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Langmead et al., 2009</a>), allowing multiple alignments and reporting one. This allowed us to estimate the overall amount of CLIP tags on all Y RNAs (shown in <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Y RNA abundance in brain, and UV- and RNAi-treated IMR-32 cells was defined as RNAseq tags on Y RNAs, using unambiguously mapped tags aligned with TopHat. Similar to above, reads that mapped to multiple Y RNAs were discarded using this strategy. To estimate overall Y RNA overexpression upon lentiviral infection, we mapped RNAseq reads of infected samples with Bowtie2, allowing multiple alignments and reporting the best matched alignment (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Y RNA overexpression was determined with two additional strategies. We performed qPCR with primers that recognized infected Y RNAs (Y3wt and Y3mut) but also an unknown number of endogenous Y RNAs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Additionally, we directly searched for 40- and 68-nt sequences of Y3wt and Y3mut sequences in the Illumina sequenced library reads (both 40- and 68-nt sequences spanned the mutated residues). The 68-nt sequence was only present in the infected Y RNAs and the canonical hY3 RNA, and searching for this sequencing length showed that both Y3wt as well as Y3mut were overexpressed. To more accurately estimate the extent of overexpression, we additionally searched for a 40-nt Y RNA sequence. The Y3wt sequence is present in a large number of endogenous Y RNAs, whereas the Y3mut sequence only detects infected Y3mut. By comparing Y3wt and Y3mut reads in Y3mut infected samples, we observed that infected Y RNA reads (Y3mut reads) correspond to 10% of total Y3 RNA reads (Y3wt reads)."

To reduce the false positive interactions in the background network, we excluded interactions reported using high-throughput approaches. Direct interactions with other seed genes were kept for each seed gene, and a connected subnetwork was created using these seed genes as nodes. Organic clustering of the obtained subnetwork was performed using the network visualization software yEd (<a href=\"http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html\">http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html</a>). In a second network, six AD genes (APP, BACE1, MAPT, PICALM, PSEN1 and PSEN2) were concatenated with the input seed gene lists to investigate their relationship with nELAVL target genes. The composition and the clustering of the PPI networks with and without those six genes were identical. Only the network including those additional seeds is shown."

The authors perform CLIP analysis and RNAseq in the BA9 region of the prefrontal cortex. They identify a large set of RNA binding sites and presumed target transcripts. They define the nELAVL binding motif as similar to the previously defined motif for the mouse and show that there is strong overlap between the targets seen in mouse and human. They show that nELAVL knockdown in human neuroblastoma cells causes reduced expression of mRNAs that exhibit 3' UTR binding. Similarly, exons with adjacent nELAVL binding show altered splicing with knockdown. Interestingly, both positively and negatively regulated exons exhibit enriched binding upstream, and thus do not present the same correlation of binding position with positive or negative regulation as seen with some other splicing regulators. Earlier results had made a connection of nELAVL proteins and Alzheimer's disease, and the authors next analyzed splicing and nELAVL binding in AD brains, finding some exons and binding events that differ between AD and control brains. The most significant change was a greatly increased level of nELAVL binding to a subset of Y RNAs in the AD brains. Y RNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs in eukaryotic cells that affect RNA scavenging and quality control pathways. A subset of these RNAs contain an nELAVL binding site. Cellular stress is known to relocalize ELAV proteins to the cytoplasm, and they find that stressing tissue culture cells with low UV doses also increases nELAV/Y RNA binding as measured by CLIP. This is accompanied by changes in nELAV dependent splicing, presumably due to reduced nuclear protein."

We addressed the possibility that a decrease in nuclear nELAVL might lead to the splicing changes in AD and upon UV stress. To address this point, we have added cell fractionation experiments. <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a> shows that the cytoplasmic fraction of nELAVL did not increase upon UV stress in IMR32 cells (using induction of CDKN1A as a positive control for the induction of UV stress). Similarly, the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of YRNAs did not change under the UV stress conditions we used (same Figure). This suggests that changes observed upon UV stress in IMR32 cells are not due to changes in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of nELAVL. This does not address whether there may be changes of nELAVL accessibility within either of these compartments. We note that Burry and Smith (2006; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) did see relocalization of ELAVL1 (HuR) under conditions of stress, but did not see relocalization of ELAVL4 (HuD). Hence the biology of the different nELAVL isoforms may depend on many variables, including cell type and stress conditions.

Each Y RNA family (Y1/Y3/Y4/Y5) consists of multiple variants expressed from different genomic loci. These copies are relatively short and very similar, yet too different to be detected by one Taqman probe or one qPCR primer set. This makes absolute quantification of Y RNA levels difficult, and thus prevented us from quantifying the exact ratio of Y RNAs to nELAVL. Nonetheless, we were able to estimate that up to 6% of nELAVL was bound by Y RNAs, which is shown in <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. To do so, we mapped our CLIP datasets with Bowtie2, allowing multiple mapping events and reporting the best one. The amount of nELAVL bound to Y RNAs was estimated by the percentage of total nELAVL CLIP tags on Y RNAs. We conclude that Y RNAs sequester nELAVL from only a subset of nELAVL targets (85% of binding sites decreasing in AD were intronic, as assessed by annotation of peak locations; please see the subsection \u201cnELAVL/Y RNA association correlates with loss of nELAVL-mediated splicing\u201d). Consistent with this observation, nELAVL-dependent mRNA abundance regulation was not affected, and the splicing of only a subset of nELAVL regulated exons correlated with nELAVL Y RNA binding. Taken together, our data are consistent with a hypothesis that a relatively subtle and perhaps long-term effect of YRNA binding on normal nELAVL stoichiometry may underlie subtle and long term changes in nELAVL biology. We clarified these points in the current version of the manuscript."

We infected IMR-32 cells with lentivirus containing Y3wt RNA (contains an nELAVL binding site) and Y3mut RNA (with a mutated nELAVL binding site), and analyzed changes in RNA regulation upon Y RNA infection.

These plots show correlation between CLIP peaks and tags with mRNA abundance as measured by sequence reads per gene. This is problematic on several levels. First, both CLIP and RNAseq reads will be strongly affected by gene length. A better comparison is to use CLIP clusters per unit length of gene vs RPKM from RNAseq, which will normalize both values by gene length. Second even with length normalization, CLIP clusters will automatically vary strongly with gene expression level. A true comparison would need to look at the distributions of sequence density for genes in the CLIP and RNAseq datasets.</i> "

To address this point and make our datasets more useful to a wider audience, we added hg19 coordinates of all supplied genomic coordinates using the UCSC liftover tool. We hope the reviewers will agree with us that the amount of time it would take us to remap the large number of datasets, and re-do the entire analysis as well as all of the tables and figures, is not justified by the relatively minor improvement in data usage compared with the liftover we included in this revised version. We would also like to emphasize that all raw sequences have been deposited at GEO for future studies."
