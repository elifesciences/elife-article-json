In <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, this process is regulated by the Lap system and the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP. High cytoplasmic levels of cyclic-di-GMP activate the transmembrane receptor LapD that in turn recruits the periplasmic protease LapG, preventing it from cleaving a cell surface-bound adhesin, thereby promoting cell adhesion. In this study, we elucidate the molecular basis of LapG regulation by LapD and reveal a remarkably sensitive switching mechanism that is controlled by LapD's HAMP domain. LapD appears to act as a coincidence detector, whereby a weak interaction of LapG with LapD transmits a transient outside-in signal that is reinforced only when cyclic-di-GMP levels increase. Given the conservation of key elements of this receptor system in many bacterial species, the results are broadly relevant for cyclic-di-GMP- and HAMP domain-regulated transmembrane signaling."

In <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, this process is regulated by the Lap system and the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP. High cytoplasmic levels of cyclic-di-GMP activate the transmembrane receptor LapD that in turn recruits the periplasmic protease LapG, preventing it from cleaving a cell surface-bound adhesin, thereby promoting cell adhesion. In this study, we elucidate the molecular basis of LapG regulation by LapD and reveal a remarkably sensitive switching mechanism that is controlled by LapD's HAMP domain. LapD appears to act as a coincidence detector, whereby a weak interaction of LapG with LapD transmits a transient outside-in signal that is reinforced only when cyclic-di-GMP levels increase. Given the conservation of key elements of this receptor system in many bacterial species, the results are broadly relevant for cyclic-di-GMP- and HAMP domain-regulated transmembrane signaling."

These communities are prevalent in natural as well as industrial and hospital settings and can form on a wide range of biotic and abiotic surfaces. Biofilm-forming pathogenic bacteria have been associated with numerous persistent and nosocomial infections in humans, such as infection of the ear or urinary tract or colonizing the lungs of patients suffering from cystic fibriosis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Parsek and Singh, 2003</a>). Because bacteria in biofilms can withstand antibiotic treatment, many clinically relevant antibiotics are ineffective in the treatment of biofilm-related bacterial infections (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mah and O'Toole, 2001</a>). Such antibiotic tolerance is a matter of concern especially in the context of the increasing number of multi-drug resistant strains and a rather slow rate of discovery of new antimicrobial agents (<a href=\"#bib61\">Spellberg et al., 2004</a>). Hence, it is crucial to understand the molecular basis of biofilm formation, maintenance, and dispersal in order to identify novel targets that could potentially be used for disrupting these bacterial aggregates."

The dinucleotide is synthesized from two molecules of GTP by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) containing a GGDEF domain, and hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) with either an EAL or a HD-GYP domain (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tal et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Simm et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ryan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schirmer and Jenal, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Krasteva et al., 2012</a>). Often these juxtaposing domains appear together in the same polypeptide chain, and in a particular subset, as part of enzymatically inactive multi-domain proteins providing them with the ability to sense and respond to changing levels of intracellular c-di-GMP. In <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, biofilm formation is dependent on such a signaling protein, referred to as LapD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hinsa and O'Toole, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Newell et al., 2009</a>).

Limiting phosphate increases the expression of a PDE, which lowers intracellular c-di-GMP levels, ultimately resulting in the dispersion of <i>P. fluorescens</i> biofilms. Conversely, when environmental phosphate levels are high, multiple DGCs contribute to high intracellular c-di-GMP levels, resulting in stable cell attachment and subsequently biofilm formation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Newell et al., 2011b</a>). LapD is a c-di-GMP receptor that translates changes in the concentration of this cytosolic second messenger into cell-surface events via an inside-out signaling mechanism that ultimately controls cell adhesion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Newell et al., 2009</a>). Specifically, c-di-GMP-bound LapD engages the periplasmic protease LapG through its Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS)-like domain, preventing it from cleaving the cell surface-bound large adhesin LapA, a protein mediating cell adhesion to multiple substrates (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Newell et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">El-Kirat-Chatel et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, c-di-GMP-unbound LapD adopts an autoinhibited conformation and loses its affinity for LapG. LapG in turn accesses and cleaves LapA's N-terminus, releasing the bulk of the adhesin from the cell surface and destabilizing cell attachment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boyd et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chatterjee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boyd et al., 2014</a>). Thus, LapD acts as the central hub in <i>P. fluorescens</i> that converts environmental cues into the formation of or dispersal from biofilms."

The cartoon (bottom panel) summarizes the current model of LapD-mediated regulation of biofilm formation in <i>P. fluorescens</i> by the differential recruitment of the periplasmic protease LapG in response to exogenous inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) availability (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib6\">Boyd and O'Toole, 2012</a>). Low bioavailability of P<sub>i</sub> induces the expression of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) via the Pho system, which results in low intra-cellular concentrations of c-di-GMP and LapD adopting an autoinhibited state. Auto-inhibited LapD cannot sequester the periplasmic protease LapG, allowing the LapG enzyme to cleave the cell-surface adhesin LapA, releasing it from the cell surface. Conversely, when environmental P<sub>i</sub> is present in sufficient concentration, a subset of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) produce intra-cellular c-di-GMP to levels sufficient for binding to the EAL domain of LapD, thus activating this receptor. Activated LapD binds to and sequesters LapG in the periplasm, which promotes biofilm formation by preventing cleavage of LapA. (<b>B</b>) Crystal structures of the periplasmic output domain from <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD and <i>L. pneumophila</i> CdgS9.

Previous work from our groups has begun to establish some of these intrinsic regulatory principles (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Newell et al., 2011a</a>). The PAS-like periplasmic domain of LapD that engages LapG is flanked by two putative transmembrane helices, the second of which connects to an intracellular, juxatamembrane HAMP domain followed by the aforementioned GGDEF-EAL domain module (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). HAMP domains have been extensively studied in several other systems, as this domain is a crucial signal relay module in a large number of diverse proteins, not only in bacteria but also in archaea and eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Galperin et al., 2001</a>). These domains are known to be a homodimeric assembly adopting a parallel four-helix bundle (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hulko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ferris et al., 2011</a>), although the exact mechanism by which conformational changes are propagated through a signaling protein via HAMP domains remains a topic of great interest (<a href=\"#bib63\">Swain and Falke, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ames et al., 2014</a>). In LapD, the HAMP domain couples to the GGDEF-EAL domain module via a common extension of HAMP domains, the so-called signaling or S helix (<a href=\"#bib5\">Anantharaman et al., 2006</a>). Our previous structure-function analyses revealed that the S helix docks onto the lateral surface of the EAL domain and positions the GGDEF domain above the c-di-GMP binding site at the EAL domain, preventing dinucleotide binding, and hence stabilizing the autoinhibited state. Conversely, c-di-GMP binding to the EAL domain is mutually exclusive with this autoinhibited conformation, disrupting inhibitory interactions, leading to an activation of LapD (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>). Through a poorly understood process, these conformational changes in the GGDEF-EAL domain module are sensed by the HAMP domain, which then propagates the signal to the periplasmic domain of LapD, ultimately resulting in a change in affinity for LapG (<a href=\"#bib46\">Newell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Newell et al., 2011a</a>)."

In addition, considering the prevalence of the intracellular HAMP-GGDEF-EAL module (currently 1296 annotated genes in Pfam) and extracellular PAS-like output domain in LapD-like c-di-GMP receptors, as well as in active enzymes for environmental sensing, the mechanism underlying LapD function will be broadly relevant for understanding bacterial transmembrane signaling. Our previous work elucidated the mechanistic underpinnings and regulation of the cytoplasmic portion of LapD (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>). Here, we focus on the periplasmic events and how they are coupled to the cytoplasmic control elements in the context of the global, c-di-GMP-dependent switching mechanism of the full-length, transmembrane receptor. In particular, we present an activation model for inside-out signaling via LapD based on structures of an unliganded and LapG-bound output domain, and further informed by protein and cell-based switching assays. The results shed light on the control of bacterial proteolysis in the periplasm via conserved signal transduction modules."

The former structure revealed an unusual domain-swapped, V-shaped dimer resembling PAS domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), yet several questions remained unanswered. While we identified a surface-exposed loop that contains a strictly conserved GWxQ motif important for LapG binding (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>), how access of LapG to the loop is controlled was not apparent. Also, the structure of LapG revealed a transglutaminase-like fold with functionally important calcium ions bound near its active site (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chatterjee et al., 2012</a>), but did not explain how this protease interacts with LapD. To address these shortcomings, we report here two structures, that of the output domain of a LapD ortholog from <i>L. pneumophila</i>, also known and referred to here as CdgS9 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Levi et al., 2011</a>), and that of LapG in complex with the same output domain.

Such an arrangement is in stark contrast to our previously determined structure of <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD<sup>Output</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left panel), in which the PAS domain dimer originated from an unusually extensive domain-swap. Although the folds of the dimer half-sites between the <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD<sup>Output</sup> and CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> are almost identical (rmsd of 1.9 \u00c5) and the conserved GWxQ motifs, which are important for LapG binding, are positioned in identical, surface-exposed loops within each half-site, the dimer topology of the two output domain ortholog structures is substantially different (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition, one notable difference between the crystallographic models for the output domains of LapD and CdgS9 is the relative position of the conserved GWxQ motifs.

The approach relies on the site-specific incorporation of a non-natural amino acid with altered functionality, in this case <i>para</i>-azido-phenylalanine (pAzF) for target cross-linking (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mehl et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Peeler and Mehl, 2012</a>). Upon UV irradiation, pAzF reacts efficiently with N-H and C-H bonds in its vicinity, forming covalent adducts within a radius of approximately 3 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Keana and Cai, 1990</a>). Specifically, we introduced pAzF via an amber codon-suppression system at sites that we predict would yield cross-links either in only one of the two topologies (A<sup>50</sup>, T<sup>54</sup>, A<sup>115</sup>, based on V-shaped <i>P. fluorescens</i> model; A<sup>48</sup>, S<sup>52</sup>, L<sup>66</sup>, based on a homology model using the parallel <i>L. pneumophila</i> structure as the target), in both (H<sup>41</sup>, Y<sup>75</sup>) or in none (F<sup>71</sup>, V<sup>91</sup>, R<sup>93</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Choosing several sites in each category increases confidence in the results. LapD variants containing pAzF incorporated at these positions were expressed in a construct wherein the protein was fused to super-folder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pedelacq et al., 2006</a>) at its C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), which enables the use of in-gel fluorescence to detect monomeric and cross-linked species in SDS-PAGE with high specificity and sensitivity using crude lysates or partially purified proteins. In this particular case, we expect to observe a second band corresponding to a covalent LapD-sfGFP dimer only if the pAzF residue was incorporated at or very close to the dimerization interface."

This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the isolated output domain is an inefficient competitor for the interaction between LapG and full-length LapD (data not shown).

In order to ascertain the degree of conservation of the two LapG protease orthologs and to detect any potential conformational changes that may occur upon binding to a LapD ortholog, the two structures were superimposed and analyzed for differences (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Despite moderate sequence conservation between the two orthologs (40% identity/54% similarity), the two structures are very similar with regard to their overall fold (C\u03b1 rmsd of 1.09 \u00c5 over 136 atoms). However, there are a few significant differences between the two structures. First, we identified a rare di-calcium binding motif in the N-terminal lobe of <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapG, which is in contrast to the single calcium ion bound at the same site in the <i>L. pneumophila</i> LapG structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Additional experiments will be necessary to ascertain the functional purpose of these alternate calcium-binding modes; however, it is tempting to suggest these differences help tune their respective substrate specificities given the proximity of the calcium atoms to the catalytic triad."

This issue is particularly important considering that intact LapD is a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic module that is crucial for the regulation of signal transmission across the membrane. To assess the soundness of our structure-based models, we again turned to a cross-linking assay utilizing non-natural amino acid pAzF incorporation. The cross-linking assay awards several advantages over other binding experiments. It provides site-specific information that can be directly correlated with crystallographic data. In addition, it is very sensitive, allowing us to work at low, more physiologically relevant protein concentrations that support c-di-GMP-dependent regulation of LapD, which is lost at higher protein concentrations required in alternative binding assays. Also, the assay reflects on equilibrium binding. Finally, although the cross-linking efficiency is low, the results are semi-quantitative since empirically the fraction of the successfully established cross-links appears to be proportional to the number of bound molecules. We followed the strategy that we employed to assess LapD homo-dimerization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), but in contrast to previous experiments, we introduced pAzF site-specifically into sfGFP-tagged LapG and assessed UV-induced cross-linking to LapD variants, which can be detected as up-shifts of a fluorescent band in SDS-PAGE gels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

We also included a control where we do not add any LapD variant, which will allow us to distinguish between LapG\u2013LapD interactions and possible LapG homo-dimers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Without UV irradiation, no cross-links were observed in any of the conditions. We also did not observe any band shift in the sample that only contained pAzF-derivatized LapG variants but no LapD, consistent with our previous studies that did not indicate signs of LapG oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chatterjee et al., 2012</a>). In addition, pAzF at position Y<sup>108</sup> of LapG, which is distal to the LapD\u2013LapG interface, did not support cross-linking. In contrast, all the LapG variants that contained a pAzF residue at positions that, based on the structure, are predicted to be close to the interaction site yielded band shifts to variable extents (V<sup>205</sup>pAzF &gt; Y<sup>206</sup>pAzF/Y<sup>176</sup>pAzF/A<sup>169</sup>pAzF &gt;&gt; Y<sup>108</sup>pAzF) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). It is worth noting that the isolated output domains of <i>L. pneumophila</i> CdgS9 and <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD cross-link to LapG readily, suggesting that they are in a binding-competent state, which is in agreement with our crystallographic analysis. However, cross-linking is more robust in the presence of c-di-GMP-activated full-length LapD protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Deletion of <i>lapD</i> and <i>lapG</i> (\u0394<i>lapD</i>/<i>lapG</i>) results in a hyperbiofilm phenotype, since the adhesin LapA cannot be processed due to the absence of the protease LapG and thus the adhesin is retained at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib48\">Newell et al., 2011a</a>). On the other end of the spectrum, expression of LapG alone in the double-deletion strain results in hypo-biofilm formation or maximal dispersal, since LapG will process LapA in a constitutive, unregulated fashion. Simultaneous expression of wild-type <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD and LapG in the double-deletion strain restores the phenotype of the parent strain with native LapDG levels, characterized by a low-to-intermediate biofilm mass (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). This range of phenotypes allows us to assess the functionality of mutant constructs. A non-functional LapD variant would phenocopy a double-deletion strain overexpressing only LapG. In contrast, a constitutively active LapD variant would present itself in a hyper-biofilm phenotype, resembling the phenotype of the double-deletion strain. Any phenotype in-between the two extremes would be indicative of a functional LapD protein that retained regulation via c-di-GMP and near-wild-type levels of LapG recruitment."

Some of these mutations would have been expected to be activating (i.e., hyper-biofilm forming) via destabilization of the apo-LapD<sup>Output</sup> conformation, but no such phenotypes were observed. The more apparent hypo-biofilm phenotypes of mutant LapD variants D<sup>72</sup>K and Y<sup>76</sup>R can be explained by disturbance of the LapG binding interface by these mutations. The weaker phenotypes of the output domain mutants are in stark contrast to the effect of sequence alterations in the HAMP domain. More than half of the single-point mutations made in the HAMP domain result in hyper-biofilm phenotypes indicative of a constitutive LapD\u2013LapG interaction. Of note, the positions in the helical segments of the HAMP domain, which are important for the differential packing interactions within the dimeric HAMP domain (positions <i>a</i> and <i>d</i> in the knobs-into-holes packing; <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), have the most pronounced effect on LapD function.

This observation indicates that LapD's HAMP domain adopts a canonical fold and is likely subject to a similar mode of regulation as has been described for other HAMP domains. Together, these results confirm the regulatory role of the HAMP domain, but also indicate a clear hierarchy of LapD's control elements, with the HAMP domain driving the main regulatory effects, which may be important to bias the system to inside-out signaling and to prevent accidental activation through basal LapD\u2013LapG encounters."

To take this point further, and to demonstrate conservation of mechanism and regulation in cells, we created chimeric full-length LapD constructs, in which we replaced the <i>P. fluorescens</i> output domain or the cytoplasmic domain with the corresponding domains of CdgS9, the putative <i>L. pneumophila</i> LapD ortholog (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Constructs <i>Lpg-Pfl</i> C1 and C2 contain the <i>L. pneumophila</i> output domain with a cytoplasmic module from <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD. <i>Pfl-Lpg</i> C2 shares the swap point with <i>Lpg-Pfl</i> C2, but is the reciprocal construct consisting of output domain and transmembrane helices of LapD and the entire cytoplasmic fragment of CdgS9. In constructs <i>Pfl-Lpg</i> C3, C4, and C5, the chimeric swap was introduced at different positions in the HAMP domain (in-between secondary structure elements). The swap-point in C5 is at the HAMP-S helix junction, which would leave the intra-molecular S helix-GGDEF-EAL control module intact (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>). The constructs were introduced in the dual expression plasmid that also carried the <i>P. fluorescens lapG</i> gene for the balanced expression of both proteins, similar to the native operon.

Importantly, both the output domain and the cytoplasmic HAMP-GGDEF-EAL module from <i>L. pneumophila</i> appeared fully functional in this context. The only construct that generated a hyper-biofilm phenotype indicative of a constitutive interaction between LapG and LapD was the one in which the <i>L. pneumophila</i> S helix-GGDEF-EAL fragment replaced the respective <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD domains with the HAMP domain coming from <i>P. fluorescens</i> (construct <i>Pfl-Lpg</i> C5). This result hints at the importance of the connection between the HAMP domain and the S helix. Most importantly for this study, these data demonstrate conservation of the key mechanism between moderately conserved LapD orthologs and indicate that, despite the mixed origin of the complex structure components, CdgS9 is a suitable proxy for a c-di-GMP receptor that mediates inside-out signaling to control periplasmic proteolysis. Consequently, the two crystal structures of the output domain of a LapD-like protein in two distinct conformations, one representing the inactive state, the other the active, LapG-bound state, provide fundamental insights into the switching mechanism."

LapG engagement is regulated through conformational changes in LapD that originate from c-di-GMP binding to LapD's cytoplasmic domain and are transmitted through the juxtamembrane HAMP domain. Our structural analyses establish that LapD's output domain adopts a PAS domain fold and forms homo-dimers with distinct differences in the LapG binding-competent, active state and its inactive state (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Notably, the packing transition that the structures depict can be described as a transition from a four-helix to a two-helix bundle, and follows two principle components: in a piston motion, one half-side of the dimeric output domain shifts vertically along the second half-side, whereas scissor-like motions encompass a tilting of the half-sides along the dimer interface. Considering the current model for HAMP domain-switching (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hulko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Airola et al., 2013</a>), which involves undergoing small amplitude translations and/or rotations during signal transduction similar to the ones we describe for CdgS9's periplasmic output domain, we predict that the output domain follows the conformational changes in the HAMP domain as a direct response. The cross-over of the membrane proximal elements observed in both output domain conformations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) may function as the fulcrum about which the output and HAMP domain pivot and/or tilt."

The notion of geometric compatibility, as opposed to an increase in specific per-residue interactions as a predominant driver for high-affinity LapG binding, is supported by the overall low surface conservation of LapD orthologs. The asymmetry of the LapD\u2013LapG complex further suggests mechanisms inherent to the output domain that counteract an activating signal and may ultimately contribute to anti-cooperativity, which has been described for other PAS domain-containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Moore and Hendrickson, 2012</a>).

Based on our lack of success to create a constitutively active LapD through structure-guided mutations in the output domain, we offer two explanations for the apparent disconnect between the crystallographic data that are based on the isolated output domain and the functional analysis of the regulated full-length protein. In the first model, the regulatory HAMP and GGDEF-EAL domains would constrain the conformation of the LapD output domain to an extent that mutations are insufficient to destabilize the output domain dimer interface and/or induce the correct high-affinity LapG-binding state. Another, non-mutually exclusive model also consistent with our data is that the apo-state may be described as a dynamic ensemble, preventing efficient LapG binding. It would follow that the crystallized output domain in the absence of LapG depicts only one possible conformation of the ensemble with the mutations only having minimal effect on the activity. At the same time, crucial interaction motifs are exposed even in this state, consistent with a basal level of LapG binding in the absence of c-di-GMP. LapD activation by c-di-GMP on the other hand increases the affinity of LapG with the output domain following conformational changes dictated by the cytoplasmic HAMP domain. It is interesting to note that both principles, switching through dynamic states or between more stable conformations have also been discussed for HAMP domains (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ferris et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ames et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mechaly et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stewart, 2014</a>), consistent with the idea that the output domain may mirror the behavior of the regulatory domains. Future experiments investigating the dynamics of full-length LapD, including those in a lipid environment (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), should help to distinguish between the two models."

Such a mechanism would explain how c-di-GMP has access to the EAL domain in the first place, given that the autoinhibited conformation is incompatible with c-di-GMP binding. The mechanism would be best described as \u2018coincidence detection\u2019, requiring both c-di-GMP and LapG being available for LapD engagement and full activation.

We came to this conclusion based on the observation that the two independent CdgS9 output domain-containing structures (apo and LapG-bound) revealed a similar topology compared to our previously determined crystal structure of <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapG\u2019s output domain. The CdgS9 topology is also consistent with the canonical PAS fold. More importantly, our validation by site-directed cross-linking leaves little doubt that the output domain in full-length LapD adopts a similar conformation."

We considered the possibility that the two orthologs fold differently, or that they represent different activity states of the output domain, but our biochemical assessment indicated that the LapD output domain must have crystallized in some off-pathway state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Together, the evidence strongly supports that nature (or at least our expression/crystallization conditions) played a trick on us with the previously published isolated output domain of LapD."

Currently, we treat this ortholog as a vehicle to demonstrate conservation of overall mechanism and as a surrogate for structural studies. We would like to note that <i>L. pneumophila</i> has a complex life style, and it is not clear at the moment when this signaling system is expressed. However, it is clear that the regulatory and output domains of CdgS9 can replace the corresponding <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapD domains in our chimeric proteins, strongly suggesting that they retain similar functions (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."
