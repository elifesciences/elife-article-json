Here, we establish that complete transection of corticospinal pathways in the pyramids impairs locomotion and leads to increased spasms and excessive mono- and polysynaptic low threshold spinal reflexes in rats. Treatment of affected forelimb muscles with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding human Neurotrophin-3 at a clinically-feasible time-point after injury reduced spasticity. Neurotrophin-3 normalized the short latency Hoffmann reflex to a treated hand muscle as well as low threshold polysynaptic spinal reflexes involving afferents from other treated muscles. Neurotrophin-3 also enhanced locomotor recovery. Furthermore, the balance of inhibitory and excitatory boutons in the spinal cord and the level of an ion co-transporter in motor neuron membranes required for normal reflexes were normalized. Our findings pave the way for Neurotrophin-3 as a therapy that treats the underlying causes of spasticity and not only its symptoms."

Here, we establish that complete transection of corticospinal pathways in the pyramids impairs locomotion and leads to increased spasms and excessive mono- and polysynaptic low threshold spinal reflexes in rats. Treatment of affected forelimb muscles with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding human Neurotrophin-3 at a clinically-feasible time-point after injury reduced spasticity. Neurotrophin-3 normalized the short latency Hoffmann reflex to a treated hand muscle as well as low threshold polysynaptic spinal reflexes involving afferents from other treated muscles. Neurotrophin-3 also enhanced locomotor recovery. Furthermore, the balance of inhibitory and excitatory boutons in the spinal cord and the level of an ion co-transporter in motor neuron membranes required for normal reflexes were normalized. Our findings pave the way for Neurotrophin-3 as a therapy that treats the underlying causes of spasticity and not only its symptoms."

Physical rehabilitation can restore some muscle control and improve mobility in affected individuals. However, no current treatments provide long-term relief from the unwanted muscle contractions and spasms that affect as many as 78% of people with a spinal cord injury. These spasms can seriously hamper a person\u2019s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks and get around independently. A few treatments can help in the short term but have side effects; indeed while Botox injections are used to paralyse the muscle, these also reduce the chances of useful improvements. As such, better therapies for muscle spasms are needed; especially ones that reduce spasms in the arms."

Several months after the surgery, the rats had spontaneous muscle contractions in their forelimbs and walked abnormally. Further experiments showed that some other neural pathways in the rats became incorrectly wired and hyperactive and that this resulted in the abnormal movements."

Delivering the gene therapy directly into the forelimb muscles of the disabled rats a day after their injury increased the levels of neurotrophin-3 in these muscles. Rats that received this treatment had fewer spasms and walked better than those that did not. Further experiments confirmed that this was because the rats\u2019 previously hyperactive and abnormally wired neural circuits became more normal after the treatment."

Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, and intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles (<a href=\"#bib62\">Pandyan et al., 2005</a>). Current treatments like tizanidine, botulinum toxin and baclofen are only symptomatic, transiently effective and have varying side effects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Hicks, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Thibaut et al., 2013</a>). These symptomatic treatments, which aim at exaggerated reflexes and muscle tone, rarely improve other functional disabilities associated with upper motor neuron lesions such as overground locomotion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Dietz and Sinkjaer, 2007</a>). There has been progress in understanding the potential underlying causes of spasticity. However, it remains challenging to model spastic behaviours in rodents. Models are needed to identify new candidate therapies for spasticity. Upper arm spasticity after spinal cord injury and stroke often persists and hampers rehabilitation and effective new therapies are badly needed (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dietz and Fouad, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Hicks, 2005</a>)."

One main goal of our study was to model a variety of signs of forelimb spasticity in awake, freely moving rats.

Group I and II proprioceptive afferents innervating muscle spindles project via the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) into the spinal cord to synapse onto motor neurons or interneurons whilst Ib afferents from Golgi tendon organs form synapses on interneurons only (<a href=\"#bib30\">Eccles et al., 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dietz, 2002</a>). The spinal circuitry integrating these sensory signals has a highly specific patterning in order to produce complex muscle activation synergies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kiehn, 2016</a>). Proprioceptive neurons provide positive feedback about muscle contractions, which adjusts movements to environmental factors and controls reflex responses via monosynaptic and polysynaptic spinal pathways (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dietz, 2002</a>)."

Intramuscular overexpression of Neurotrophin-3 normalized several spinal reflexes. Analysis of neurophysiological properties of the spinal circuitry and of molecular markers revealed that Neurotrophin-3 acts as a regulator of afferent input connectivity to spinal motor circuitry and as a regulator of motor neuron excitability. Taken together, our study established that proprioceptive afferent input strength and connectivity to the spinal cord changes after supraspinal injury, which affected motor output resulting in signs of spasticity and reduced functional recovery. Overexpression of Neurotrophin-3 in the muscles regulated afferent input specificity and re-balanced excitatory and inhibitory networks in the spinal cord improving functional and neurophysiological outcomes."

The joint movements of the forelimb appeared rigid and the trajectories of the limb were often changed during the swing phase. Rats had narrow stepping with frequently crossed placement of their forepaws. During the loading response of the stance phase we observed vertical oscillatory-like movements, which resulted in bounce-like stepping. Rats displayed spontaneous abnormal prolonged muscle contractions (spasms), and single or repeated muscle jerks (twitch and clonus respectively) with their forelimbs. We observed that spontaneously occurring spasms were more prevalent in forelimb pro-gravity (limb flexor) muscles than anti-gravity (limb extensor) muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Their hindlimbs and tail also displayed signs of spasticity (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). During the swing phase, rats with bilateral pyramidotomies lifted their hindlimbs higher than uninjured rats, which may indicate increased hip pro-gravity (flexor) muscle activity. Based on our observations, we developed a novel open-field scoring system for rats, which measures spasticity and disordered sensorimotor control of the forelimbs during locomotion and spasticity-associated reactions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; compare <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> with <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

An early M-wave is evoked by motor axon excitation and a later H-wave is evoked by excitation of Ia afferents synapsing onto motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The H-wave was often evoked at lower stimulation intensities than the M-wave, consistent with work by others (<a href=\"#bib77\">Tan et al., 2012</a>). To confirm that the putative H-wave is dependent on sensory afferent stimulation, in three uninjured na\u00efve rat we cut six ipsilateral cervical dorsal roots, which abolished the H-wave and did not affect the M-wave (data not shown). <i>n.b.</i>, F-waves are evoked in the rat only at high stimulation intensities and have very low amplitudes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Meinck, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gozariu et al., 1998</a>)."

In uninjured na\u00efve rats, when two stimuli were delivered to the ulnar nerve in close succession (for example using an inter-stimulus interval of 0.5 s) then the second H wave (coloured red in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) was smaller than the first H wave (coloured grey in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), which is known as frequency-dependent-depression. In uninjured rats, the second H-wave was depressed at inter-stimulus-intervals of 5 s and less (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). One day after bilateral corticospinal tract injury, the H-wave depression was comparable to before injury (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). However, at two weeks after bilateral pyramidotomy, the H-wave was less depressed at intervals less than 5 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). The attenuation of H-wave depression at short inter-stimulus intervals lasted at least up to 10 weeks (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>), which suggests there were long lasting changes in synaptic transmission. Frequency-dependent-depression was assessed fortnightly. We measured the area under the stimulus-response curve from inter-stimulus intervals of 10 s to 0.1 s (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>) for each rat at each time point separately and then plotted the group mean values (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>). Uninjured na\u00efve rats showed consistent frequency-dependent depression of the H-wave over 10 weeks, but injured control rats had reduced frequency-dependent depression from 2 weeks up until the end of the testing period at 10 weeks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which is evidence for changed synaptic transmission from Ia afferent fibers to motor neurons."

Rats with bilateral pyramidotomy treated with AAV-GFP frequently missed rungs, but intramuscular Neurotrophin-3 treatment gradually improved precision stepping on the horizontal ladder throughout the 10 weeks testing period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Additionally, Neurotrophin-3 treated rats partially recovered grip strength with their treated forelimb (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Importantly, Neurotrophin-3 did not cause or affect mechanical hypersensitivity, as expected from human clinical trials (<a href=\"#bib63\">Parkman\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sahenk, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chaudhry et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Coulie et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sahenk et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Intramuscular AAV-NT3 treatment did not improve recovery on the pellet reaching task after bilateral pyramidotomy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) which is consistent with the fact that corticospinal injury leads to a persistent deficit in dexterity (<a href=\"#bib83\">Weidner et al., 2001</a>). Taken together, these behavioural results demonstrate that bilateral pyramidotomy is sufficient to cause spasticity in rodents and that these symptoms can be improved by treating flexor muscles with Neurotrophin-3. Treatment also resulted in improved functional recovery of motor behaviour. We next show that NT3 modifies neurophysiological properties of spinal reflexes whose low threshold proprioceptive and cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents and motor neurons are known to express TrkC (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">McMahon et al., 1994</a>)."

In the intact rat, vGluT1 boutons on motor neurons are from proprioceptive afferents (<a href=\"#bib75\">Stepien et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Betley et al., 2009</a>). We determined whether the number of vGluT1 immunoreactive boutons in close proximity to motor neurons changed after bilateral pyramidotomy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). After injury, more vGluT1 boutons were found in close proximity to cervical motor neurons of the ulnar and radial nerves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) which might contribute to the spasticity we report. To explore the specificity of afferent fibers synapsing onto different motor neuron pools, we took advantage of the fact that injection of CTb into the ulnar nerve also transganglionically labels predominantly large diameter afferents (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shehab and Hughes, 2011</a>). CTb-immunoreactive afferents from the ulnar nerve had more vGluT1 boutons in close proximity to radial motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

KCC2, when located to the membrane, expels chloride<sup>-</sup> and potassium<sup>+</sup> ions to regulate the reversal potential of GABA<sub>A</sub> responses; if membrane KCC2 is reduced, motor neurons become hyper-excitable (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boulenguez et al., 2010</a>).

From the clinicoanatomic perspective, there is an extensive debate whether selective pyramidal tract damage (a rare event) is sufficient to cause spastic hemiplegia in humans. Stroke and spinal cord injury, which may or may not affect the corticospinal tract, very commonly lead to spasticity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Hicks, 2005</a>). Spasticity symptoms have sometimes been ascribed to additional damage to extrapyramidal structures, but a recent extensive review of pathological cases gives evidence that damage to the pyramidal tracts is sufficient and necessary to cause spastic hemiplegia in humans (<a href=\"#bib24\">de Oliveira-Souza, 2015</a>). The classic lesion experiments by Lawrence and Kuypers revealed the role of the corticospinal tract in motor control in non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968a</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">1968b</a>). A large cohort of macaque monkeys received bilateral corticospinal tract injuries in the pyramids. While skilled hand function is severely affected by the lesions, the monkeys were still able to walk and climb shortly after the injury. We re-examined their original videos (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lemon et al., 2012</a>) and observed clonic movements (their Supplementary Videos 2, 3 and 8), narrowed stance during locomotion (their Supplementary Video 6) and increased flexor activities in their forelimbs (their Supplementary Video 7) supporting the notion that corticospinal tract injury is sufficient to produce spastic signs and abnormal locomotion in non-human primates as well as humans."

A midthoracic T-lesion, which essentially damages the dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventromedial parts of the corticospinal tracts, results in hindlimb spasms during swimming (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gonzenbach et al., 2010</a>). Whereas these injuries provide models of hindlimb/tail spasticity, which can be measured after stimulation or during specialized behavioural testing for rats, our model of bilateral pyramidotomy allows observation of spasticity in the forelimbs, hindlimbs and tail during awake, free movements in the open field. Our model shows visible signs of spasticity including increased reflexes similar to the human condition. Our model provides further evidence that exclusive corticospinal tract lesioning is sufficient to produce signs of spasticity.

Corticospinal axons and proprioceptive afferents compete for synaptic space in the spinal cord in development and also in adulthood (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jiang et al., 2016</a>). Premotor interneurons receive direct input from the corticospinal tract and cutaneous and proprioceptive afferent fibers (<a href=\"#bib15\">Brownstone and Bui, 2010</a>); following loss of corticospinal input, proprioceptive afferents may invade the empty synaptic space on these interneurons. The synaptic space on motor neurons might be reorganized more indirectly: bilateral pyramidotomy causes a significant loss of input to spinal interneurons, which may then withdraw some of their input to motor neurons (<i>i.e.</i>, anterograde trans-neuronal synaptic loss akin to activity-based synaptic pruning in development) creating more space for sensory afferent synapses. Our data supports this proposition. We have established that after supraspinal injury proprioceptive afferent input reorganized and showed aberrant connection patterns onto motor neurons in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Intramuscular over-expression of Neurotrophin-3 regulated spinal circuitry re-organization and resulted in reduced sensorimotor abnormalities and normalized hyperreflexia."

(<b>B</b>) After loss of corticospinal innervation, there is a loss of specificity in connections between proprioceptive afferents, spinal interneurons and motor neurons. Indeed, excitatory (afferent) terminations in the spinal cord are increased in number and there is a reduction in molecular markers of pre-synaptic inhibition upon proprioceptive afferents. We propose that this causes increased spinal excitability. Moreover, KCC2 is internalized from the membrane of motor neurons rendering them more excitable. Together, these result in increased spinal reflexes, hallmarks of spasticity. (<b>C</b>) Injection of AAV-NT3 into flexor muscles causes trafficking of NT3 to the cervical DRG by retrograde transport (and, possibly, to a lesser extent, by systemic transport). Treatment normalizes the pattern of proprioceptive afferent terminations and restores pre-synaptic inhibition upon proprioceptive afferents. NT3 is also retrogradely transported to motor neurons where KCC2 levels are normalized in the membrane. Multiple spinal reflexes involving treated muscles are normalized. We propose that this is the result of restored specificity of connections between proprioceptive afferents and appropriate motor neurons and normalised motor neuron excitability. Abnormal forelimb movements including spasms are reduced and walking on the ladder is improved. In conclusion, delayed intramuscular treatment with AAV-NT3 results in neurophysiological, molecular and behavioural improvements after CNS injury."

Neurotrophins are retrogradely transported in signaling endosomes (after they bind to and are internalized with their receptors) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Helgren et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Harrington et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sharma et al., 2010</a>). We injected an AAV1 expressing neurotrophin-3 into skeletal muscles, which are innervated both by proprioceptive afferents and motor neurons. We found increased levels of neurotrophin-3 protein in the ipsilateral cervical dorsal root ganglia and in motor neurons. We can exclude transport of the AAV1 viral vector as we did not detect the transgene of human Neurotrophin-3 in the ipsilateral cervical DRG with qRTPCR. We also did not detect increased levels of rat neurotrophin-3 mRNA in the ipsilateral cervical dorsal root ganglia after intramuscular injections of an AAV1 expressing the human NT3 transgene as shown by RNA sequencing (Kathe et al, unpublished). We expect that the majority of changes in spinal cord patterning and excitability was mediated via proprioceptive afferents and motor neurons. However, we cannot exclude the possibilities that cutaneous afferents may have modulated spinal reflexes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Bui et al., 2013</a>) as it is likely that skin afferents were also exposed to a low concentration of Neurotrophin-3; or that neurotrophin-3 acted to some degree through the vascular circulation systemically although we didn't detect a significant increase protein in muscles other than the injected ones or in the spinal cord. Notwithstanding our current results, systemic delivery routes of delivery for neurotrophin-3 may be effective when higher doses of the protein are administered, for example by intrathecal infusion after spinal cord injury (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bradbury et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">1998</a>). Ongoing work in our laboratory seeks to identify the optimal biopharmaceutical delivery route and form (protein, gene therapy, agonist antibody or small synthetic molecule) for neurotrophin-3 and for targeting its receptors after spinal cord injury and stroke."

Firstly, Neurotrophin-3 caused a re-balancing of excitatory and inhibitory networks in the spinal cord. It restored the specificity and number of excitatory boutons from proprioceptive axons onto motor neurons and a marker of presynaptic inhibition to normal. Secondly, neurotrophin-3 normalised the levels of KCC2 in ulnar and radial motor neuron membranes to normal. KCC2 subcellular location was modified either after direct retrograde transport of neurotrophin-3 in motor axons (which might mean even the non-significant trend of increased neurotrophin-3 protein in the triceps brachii was sufficient to affect its radial motor neurons), or it was secondary to changes in afferent or supraspinal fiber organization. Finally, neurotrophin-3 also affected plasticity of extrapyramidal supraspinal pathways. We showed that neurotrophin-3 normalized the pattern of serotonergic fibers in the cervical spinal cord. Given that other pathways like rubrospinal tract neurons also express trkC receptors (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tetzlaff et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">King et al., 1999</a>) it is possible that these pathways also undergo sprouting within the cervical spinal cord and may contribute to functional recovery (<a href=\"#bib66\">Raineteau et al., 2002</a>)."

Two 24-G needle electrodes were inserted across the medial plantar side of the wrist to stimulate the ulnar nerve (via a constant current isolated pulse stimulator, stimulus width 100\u00a0\u03bcs, Neurolog, Digitimer). Two recording electrodes were inserted into the abductor digiti quinti to record electromyograms. The signal was amplified (4000-fold), filtered (with a pass band of 300\u2009Hz to 6 kHz), digitized via PowerLab, visualized and analysed with LabChart. The M-wave is evoked by excitation of motor axons. The H-wave is a short latency reflex which includes monosynaptic connections: Ia proprioceptive afferents synaptically activate motor neurons in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). The threshold (1X) was determined as the lowest stimulation intensity that elicited an H-wave response in at least 75% of the recordings. First, we tested the responses to increasing stimulus intensities at 0.1\u00a0Hz up to 2x Threshold, which activates low threshold afferent fibers. M-wave and H-wave amplitudes were normalized to the maximum M-wave that we recorded at higher stimulation intensities (up to a maximum threshold of 2x threshold). Next, we tested the frequency dependent depression of the H-wave. This is also commonly referred to as post-activation depression or as rate-dependent depression. We stimulated every 10 s with paired stimuli at inter-stimulus intervals from 10\u2009s to 0.1\u2009s. The H-wave amplitude of the test stimulus was normalized to the H-wave amplitude of the conditioning stimulus. 25 paired stimuli per frequency were averaged and plotted as a frequency-depression curve. The area under the curve was calculated to give an H-wave measure of hyperreflexia (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). Post-stimulation, rats were given atipamezole (Antisedan, 2\u00a0mg/ml) and monitored until fully awake."

Z-stacks were analysed by scrolling through the different optical sections. To identify inhibitory boutons in close proximity to terminals, immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies for a pre-synaptic marker for GABAergic synapses (vGAT+) and a pre-synaptic marker labeling proprioceptive or cutaneous sensory afferents terminals (vGluT1+). 250 vGluT1 boutons were scored in the ventral horn for each animal by a single and blinded experimenter: either the bouton was in very close proximity to at least one vGAT bouton (score\u00a0=\u00a01) (e.g., identified by yellow pixels in 15 \u00b5m z-stacks when projected into a single plane; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,J</a>) or not in close proximity to any vGAT boutons (score\u00a0=\u00a00) (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). To identify boutons in close proximity to motor neurons, vGluT1 and vGAT boutons were counted on at least 25 motor neurons per animal, which had been retrogradely traced with CTb or Fast Blue (see above). The average number of vGluT1 boutons in close proximity to ulnar and radial motor neurons was calculated separately. In each case the mean score was calculated for each rat."

To alleviate these problems a major revision of the text and better presentation of data as well as elimination of data from the present manuscript are needed, as outlined below.

The behavioral changes were observed during spontaneous movements while reflex changes were tested in anaesthetized animals. The authors also show changes in synaptic connectivity onto motor neurons and that molecular factors are up- or down-regulated after in the dorsal root ganglia. Interestingly, many of the reflex changes and the changes in synaptic connectivity appear to be normalized by intramuscular over-expression of NT3 using viral vectors in single muscles, while other aberrant motor behaviors are partially improved. The study presents a new model of CNS injury leading to reflex changes and spasms included in the motor symptoms often described as spasticity in humans after spinal cord injury. The study clearly shows an effect of NT3 treatment on these symptoms suggesting that it may be possible to rectify injury released motor symptoms with this therapy."

It is therefore not easy to understand the focus on sema 4. It is interesting but there is not proof or even slight indication that this molecule is involved in any of the changes. To show this would require a KO. We think it unreasonable to ask for this for this study, but we think the data are too preliminary at this point to include as an explanation and propose that the entire RNA-seq story be deleted from the paper and saved for a separate publication where the functional role of individual molecules can be addressed."

When it comes to the mechanisms (subsection \u201cUnderlying mechanisms and treatment choice\u201d) it is not correct that most GABAB receptors are responsible for presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. It is also striking that the KCC2 is the only mechanism proposed for cellular mechanisms for the hyperexcitability of motoneurons. What about the persistent inward currents \u2013 that were first described by Schwindt and Crill, then by Hounsgaard, Hultborn, Kiehn et al., and Dave Bennett et al. (the 2 latter groups also proving that they are increased following chronic spinal cord lesion, and certainly contribute to spasticity)? This is complemented by experiments by several other groups in Seattle, Chicago and Halifax. This paper is not addressing this question, but a couple of sentences in the Discussion should be a minimum. Finally, how can removal of the CST lead to change in competition onto motor neurons. CSTs do not reach MNs in rats?"

We also now discuss the possibility that bilateral CST axotomy leads to anterograde transneuronal loss of synapses from motor neurons in the Discussion section \"Importance of proprioceptive feedback\". Complete bilateral ablation of the CST will cause considerable loss of input to spinal interneurons and it is possible that this loss of descending activity leads to loss of synapses from these interneurons onto motor neurons. In turn a signal from spinal cord motor neurons might lead to synthesis and secretion of factors known to promote sprouting and synapse formation. Indeed, evidence from other groups shows that pyramidotomy leads to changes in the expression profile in the cervical spinal cord of genes known to play roles in axon sprouting and synapse formation (Bareyre and Schwab 2003). This might cause sprouting and synapse formation of vGluT1 expressing afferents onto motor neurons, which we observed in our study."
