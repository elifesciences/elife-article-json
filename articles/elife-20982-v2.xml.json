Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue."

Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue."

Failure to generate or maintain mSCs leads to life-threatening peripheral neuropathy and myelinopathy. Research over the last few decades has made great progress in identifying extra- and intracellular signals that drive SC differentiation and myelination during development, but mechanisms that maintain mSCs and myelination in adults remain unclear (recent reviews in <a href=\"#bib26\">Jessen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Salzer, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Monk et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Taveggia, 2016</a>). Krox20 (also called Egr2) has been identified as the master transcription factor that drives myelin gene expression for both myelin formation and maintenance (<a href=\"#bib61\">Topilko et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Decker et al., 2006</a>). However, it remains unclear how extra- and intracellular signals regulate transcription of Krox20. A major gap in our knowledge concerns the nucleocytoplasmic mediator(s) that converge and deliver extra- and intracellular signals to the SC nucleus to drive Krox20. Although several transcription factors upstream of Krox20 have been identified, they either reside only in the nucleus or play uncertain roles in Krox20 regulation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stolt and Wegner, 2016</a>)."

When activated, YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ) translocate to the nucleus, where they potently induce cell proliferation. Because YAP/TAZ lack DNA binding domains, they act indirectly by binding partner transcription factors, particularly members of the TEA domain (TEAD) family (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Following phosphorylation by activated Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ are inactivated through cytoplasmic retention and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ is critical for developmentally regulating cell proliferation that ensures normal tissue growth and organ size (<a href=\"#bib46\">Piccolo et al., 2014</a>). YAP/TAZ shift to the cytoplasm concomitant with differentiation and the nuclear exclusion of YAP/TAZ is a requisite for adult tissue homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib63\">Varelas, 2014</a>). Indeed, nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ in differentiated adult cells is essential for cancer initiation or growth of most solid tumors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harvey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Moroishi et al., 2015</a>). Accordingly, YAP/TAZ are emerging as attractive targets for cancer therapies (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zanconato et al., 2016</a>). YAP/TAZ also interact with other signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, GPCR, and mechanical signals (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Azzolin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rayon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heallen et al., 2011</a>). These findings suggest that nuclear YAP/TAZ have additional context-dependent functions besides their widely recognized role in promoting cellular proliferation and developmental differentiation."

Poitelon et al. showed that conditional knockout mice lacking YAP/TAZ in SCs are peripherally unmyelinated, as these SCs completely fail to sort out large-caliber axons. This is a pre-requisite step in developmental myelination known as radial or axon sorting. The authors observed no nuclear YAP/TAZ in cultured myelinating SCs, and modest, if any, regulation of Krox20 by YAP/TAZ (<a href=\"#bib47\">Poitelon et al., 2016</a>). Two subsequent studies raised the possibility that YAP/TAZ may regulate myelination more directly: these reports showed upregulation of myelin genes, including Krox20, by TEAD1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</a>) or YAP (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fernando et al., 2016</a>). In addition, Fernando et al. reported that viral inactivation of YAP in developing sciatic nerve reduces SC and myelin length, although myelin thickness remains unaltered (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fernando et al., 2016</a>). How YAP/TAZ regulate developmental myelination is therefore unclear, and whether they also play a role in maintenance of myelination in adulthood is completely unknown."

Sorted axons never became myelinated, however, apparently due to the failure of these SCs to upregulate Krox20 and differentiate into mSCs. We also show that adult mSCs, but not non-myelinating SCs, express nuclear YAP/TAZ, and that induced ablation of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs results in Krox20 downregulation, overt demyelination and, notably, mouse death. Lastly, we report that a YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 complex regulates both developmental and adult myelination, presumably through transcriptional regulation of Krox20. Our results clarify a developmental function of SC YAP/TAZ, and newly establish YAP/TAZ as essential regulators of both developmental and adult myelination in the peripheral nervous system. Our study also calls for caution in targeting YAP/TAZ for cancer therapy."

Notably, YAP/TAZ continued to be expressed strongly in SC nuclei at P4, P18 and P60. YAP/TAZ have distinct functions when they are in the cytoplasm versus in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diepenbruck et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Varelas, 2014</a>): YAP/TAZ actively regulate transcription when they are localized to the nucleus. In contrast, when YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated and in the cytoplasm, they are presumed to be transcriptionally inactive. This result suggest, therefore, that YAP/TAZ act as transcriptional regulators not only in proliferating and differentiating SCs, but also surprisingly in fully mature SCs."

Notably, not all postnatal SCs expressed YAP/TAZ: they were expressed by\u00a0~60% at P4 and\u00a0~75% at P60, approximately corresponding to the percentage of myelinating SCs (mSCs; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We therefore co-immunostained P60 teased sciatic nerve fibers for Sox10, Krox20 (to selectively label mSCs) and YAP. Strikingly, YAP was highly expressed in mSCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; arrows), but virtually undetectable in Krox20-negative, non-myelinating SCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; eg., arrowheads). We verified this result by co-immunostaining teased fibers for YAP/TAZ and for GFAP, which exclusively labels non-myelinating SCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jessen et al., 1990</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These results show that YAP/TAZ are actively regulating transcription in proliferating and differentiating SCs during development and then selectively in differentiated mSCs in the adulthood (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Selective expression of YAP/TAZ in mSCs raise the possibility that YAP/TAZ are directly involved in transcriptional regulation of SC differentiation and myelination."

Those SCs exhibiting low or faint YAP/TAZ immunoreactivity did not express MBP (for example, #2 SC in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E2</a>). Semithin sections and electron microscopy provided additional evidence of the nearly complete absence of myelin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F and G</a>). Notably, however, although we frequently observed small bundles of unsorted axons, many axons were singled out by promyelinating SCs with thick basal lamina in P60 cDKO (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and inset). Similarly, axons in forelimb nerves, dorsal roots and ventral roots in P60 cDKO exhibited complete amyelination, and frequently established a 1:1 relationship with promyelinating SCs (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). We frequently observed small bundles of unsorted axons and occasionally large axon bundles (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>), but we did not observe polyaxonal myelination in which multiple axons were surrounded by a mSC (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>, arrows). These results demonstrate that SCs lacking YAP/TAZ arrest as promyelinating SCs (that is, fail to differentiate into mSCs), and are therefore unable to myelinate axons."

Several considerations excluded the possibility that delayed axon sorting in our cDKO mice was due to incomplete deletion of <i>Yap/Taz</i>. First, we used the same <i>P0 Cre</i>-driver line as Poitelon et al. and observed a major block in radial sorting at P18. Second, if an allele of <i>Yap</i> or <i>Taz</i> remained undeleted, these SCs would have differentiated to mSCs and myelinated axons by P18, as in control nerves. However, we found mSCs to be rare in P18 and P60 cDKO (for\u00a0example, MBP+ and YAP/TAZ+ SCs in cDKO in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E2</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Third, not more than\u00a0~20% SCs in cDKO were immunopositive for YAP/TAZ at P60, which is too few to explain the incomplete but extensive radial sorting and virtually complete amyelination (see below). Fourth, most of these\u00a0~20% SCs were only weakly immunopositive at P4 and did not increase at P60, indicating that they failed to proliferate vigorously. Notably, whereas an allele of <i>Taz</i> was sufficient to complete myelination in P60 <i>Yap</i>-cKO/<i>Taz</i>-cHET (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; leftmost panels), an allele of <i>Yap</i> was insufficient as evidenced by defective sorting and myelination in P60 <i>Taz</i>-cKO/<i>Yap</i>-cHET (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We therefore postulate that most of the weak <i>Yap/Taz</i> immunoreactivity in these\u00a0~20% SCs represents an undeleted allele of <i>Yap</i> or non-specific antibody binding."

These SCs gradually, albeit abnormally slowly, progress through axon sorting, but arrest at the promyelinating stage and fail to initiate myelination. Sequential expression of two core transcription factors is critical for promyelinating SCs to differentiate into mSCs: Oct6 (also known as Scip, Pou3f1) upregulates Krox20/Egr2 in promyelinating SCs and Krox20 upregulates myelin genes and feeds back to turn off Oct6 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ghislain and Charnay, 2006</a>). To investigate the mechanism by which SCs lacking YAP/TAZ arrest as promyelinating SCs, we examined expression of Oct6 and Krox20 in developing and adult cDKO SCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). In control nerves, the number of Oct6+ SCs peaked at P4, and then sharply declined. In striking contrast, an abnormally high number of cDKO SCs expressed Oct6 from P0 to adulthood (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and C</a>). Notably, cDKO SCs failed to upregulate Krox20: in control mice,\u00a0~30% of SCs were Krox20+ at P0, increasing to\u00a0~70% from P18 onwards, whereas in cDKO,\u00a0~15% of SCs were Krox20+ throughout development and adulthood (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and D</a>). Western blotting of P4 and P60 cDKO sciatic nerves confirmed abnormal upregulation of Oct6, in parallel with concomitant reduction in YAP/TAZ expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). As expected, Krox20 mRNA expression was also greatly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Together, these results suggest that YAP/TAZ initiate SC differentiation and myelination, presumably by upregulating Krox20 expression in promyelinating SCs."

Within two weeks of the first tamoxifen injection, <i>Yap/Taz</i> iDKO, but not control, mice displayed persistent shivering, ataxia, hunched posture, weight loss and rapid shallow breathing, which progressively worsened until death within the next two weeks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, n\u00a0&gt;\u00a08).

To test this possibility, we employed two separate assays because simultaneous immunostaining of Sox10, YAP/TAZ and Krox20 was not feasible. Notably, immunostaining of iDKO nerves revealed that many DAPI+ nuclei had only faint Krox20 immunoreactivity and, only occasional nuclei exhibited strong Krox20 immunoreactivity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, arrow). Moreover, YAP/TAZ were virtually undetectable in nuclei that stained weakly for Krox20 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, arrowheads).

Because YAP/TAZ lack DNA binding domains, they act on DNA binding-TFs, most notably the TEAD family (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, we identified four potential TEAD binding sites in the MSE (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diepenbruck et al., 2014</a>).

We sonicated P70 sciatic nerve lysates to generate chromatin fragments of 300\u2013400 bp, and immunoprecipitated with anti-TEAD1 or control Rabbit IgG antibody.

Similarly to P12, the E4 region bound strongly to TEAD1.

YAP/TAZ are required for 1) SC proliferation important for timely axon sorting, 2) SC differentiation critical for myelination, and 3) maintenance of differentiated myelinating SCs essential for myelin maintenance. Notably, transcriptionally active, nuclear YAP/TAZ have not been detected in fully differentiated cells in adult tissues, and nuclear exclusion (that\u00a0is, cytoplasmic retention) of YAP/TAZ is widely regarded as requisite for maintaining homeostasis in differentiated cells and tissues (<a href=\"#bib46\">Piccolo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Varelas, 2014</a>). It was therefore surprising to find that YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed in nuclei of myelinating SCs, and that eliminating them in adulthood evokes demyelination and is rapidly fatal. Our findings are the first to show that YAP/TAZ can be required for adult tissue homeostasis and suggest caution in targeting them for cancer therapy."

Furthermore, mRNA and protein levels of Krox20 were concomitantly reduced in SCs of <i>Yap/Taz</i> cDKO mice. These results suggest that YAP/TAZ directly regulate SC myelination primarily by activating transcription of <i>Krox20</i>. In addition, in our ChIP protocol, we increased specificity by preparing chromatin fragments\u00a0~300 bp. in length. This protocol allowed us to pinpoint binding of TEAD1 to specific Krox20 MSE regions. It also allowed us to show much stronger binding of TEAD1 to the MSE in developing SCs (&gt;50 fold increase compared to control) than that recently reported in P15 rat sciatic nerves (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</a>). Our preliminary data also showed that YAP/TAZ bind to the same region of the MSE as TEAD1 (data not shown).

The mechanisms by which adult SCs maintain <i>Krox20</i> transcription and thus myelination remain unclear (<a href=\"#bib51\">Salzer, 2015</a>). It has been suggested that, once developmental myelination is completed, the <i>Krox20</i> MSE becomes inactive, and regulation of TFs that maintain myelination, including Krox20, becomes cell-autonomous, presumably via a feedforward cascade that does not depend on extra- and intracellular signals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ghislain et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Glenn and Talbot, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Salzer, 2015</a>). Our findings, however, strongly imply that signals in adult mSCs regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ to maintain activation of <i>Krox20</i> via its MSE. The MSE region to which TEAD1 binds is enriched with binding sites for TFs, including Sox10, Oct6, NFAT3/4 and YY1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ghislain and Charnay, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">He et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Reiprich et al., 2010</a>). Although our assays indicated no direct interaction between YAP/TAZ and these factors, it is possible that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 synergize with them by binding to the Mediator complex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Galli et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vogl et al., 2013</a>). Notably, these TFs are expressed in oligodendrocytes as well as SCs (<a href=\"#bib23\">He et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hornig et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schreiber et al., 1997</a>), whereas YAP/TAZ and Krox20 are exclusively expressed in myelinating SCs, consistent with a critical requirement for YAP/TAZ in <i>Krox20</i> expression. It is also interesting that non-myelinating SCs and <i>Yap/Taz</i> cDKO SCs express TEAD1, despite absence of YAP/TAZ. TEADs can repress transcription in the absence of YAP/TAZ (<a href=\"#bib31\">Koontz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). It is conceivable, therefore, that TEAD1 actively represses <i>Krox20</i> transcription in these SCs, consequently maintaining amyelination."

For example, YAP/TAZ might positively regulate Zeb2 transcription, which was recently shown to promote SC differentiation by inactivating repressors of differentiation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Quintes et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2016</a>). Against this possibility, however, <i>Zeb2</i> is downregulated when SCs initiate myelination and it is absent in adult SCs. Another possibility is that YAP/TAZ may activate the mTORC1 pathway to promote myelination (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Norrm\u00e9n et al., 2014</a>). In light of the reports that YAP/TAZ are required for Dicer expression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chaulk et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mori et al., 2014</a>) and that Dicer ablation blocks SC differentiation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pereira et al., 2010</a>), it is also plausible that YAP/TAZ regulate myelination, at least in part, by regulating miRNA expression."

Respiratory failure was the apparent cause of death, which coincided with progressively more shallow and rapid breathing. One speculative explanation is that YAP/TAZ have other transcriptional targets in iDKO mice and/or a cytoplasmic function in adult SCs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Piccolo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Varelas, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yu et al., 2015</a>), which, when lost, increases the deficits of the iDKO. Alternatively, inducible ablation of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs might have been more successful than that of Krox20 or Sox10 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and, <a href=\"#bib8\">Decker et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">Bremer et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Our findings show that YAP/TAZ regulate not only proliferation but also differentiation of SCs, driving radial sorting, developmental myelination and myelin maintenance. Notably, YAP/TAZ are present in both nucleus and cytoplasm throughout the stages observed, suggesting that nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ is both inhibited and promoted and, therefore, both positive and negative regulators tightly control their transcriptional activity. In other cell types, Hippo-kinase pathway and F-actin cytoskeleton strongly regulate transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ and their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (<a href=\"#bib63\">Varelas, 2014</a>). Cell stretching or stiff ECM promotes F-actin- or actomyosin-mediated nuclear entry of YAP/TAZ (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dupont, 2016</a>). Similarly, in SCs in vitro, high ECM stiffness (to levels seen in adult sciatic nerve in vivo) or cell stretching, in combination with high concentrations of laminin, promotes nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ and SC differentiation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Poitelon et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Urbanski et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, actin polymerization or actomyosin contractility could conceivably promote transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ that leads to SC differentiation and myelination. In contradiction to this idea, inhibition of actomyosin contractility promotes SC differentiation in vitro (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grove and Brophy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Leitman et al., 2011</a>). In addition, our results show that YAP/TAZ are localized to the nucleus during radial sorting, when ECM stiffness and laminin concentration are low (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grove and Brophy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Urbanski et al., 2016</a>). Therefore it is likely that additional pathways are also involved in YAP/TAZ regulation. An intriguing possibility is that YAP/TAZ are downstream of regulators of developmental myelination, including Neuregulin 1-type III, integrin \u03b16\u03b21, G-protein coupled receptor Gpr126 and Wnt (<a href=\"#bib12\">Feltri et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Monk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pereira et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Petersen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Taveggia et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Azzolin et al., 2014</a>). Future efforts to identify the upstream and downstream mediators of YAP/TAZ are likely to generate important basic scientific insights and clinical applications."

The percentage of Schwann cells (Sox10+ nuclei) that were EdU+ was determined by counting of confocal images using ImageJ software. The Promega Deadend TUNEL assay kit was used to investigate Schwann cell apoptosis in longitudinal and transverse 7 \u03bcm cryosections. The recommended protocol was followed, with the following modification: after rehydration in PBS, sections were treated with L.A.B. retrieval solution for 5 min (Polysciences, Inc 24310\u2013500), then washed 3x in PBS, prior to permeabilization in 0.2% Triton-X-100 for 10\u2019, as per the recommended protocol. As a positive control, sections were treated with 7.5 U/ml DNase1 for 10\u2019 prior to the TUNEL assay; as a negative control, TdT enzyme was omitted from the assay. After the TUNEL assay, sections were immunostained with anti-Sox10 to identify Schwann cells, and TUNEL+ Schwann cells in confocal images were counted using ImageJ software."

Sciatic nerves were collected in PBS on ice. The PBS was replaced by PBS/1% formaldehyde containing protease inhibitors, and nerves were rapidly diced using scissors. Nerves were crosslinked for 10\u2019 with rotation at room temperature, washed with PBS/0.15M glycine for 5\u2019 with rotation at room temperature, then washed 3x with ice-cold PBS. Nerves were lysed using ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.1, 100 mM NaCl, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS plus protease inhibitors) for 30\u2019 at 4\u00b0C, then pelleted by microfugation at 14K for 15\u2019. Supernatant was removed, and pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ChIP IP buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.6, 0.3% SDS, 1.7% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA plus protease inhibitors). Chromatin was sheared in an ice water bath by sonication using a Fisher Scientific FB120 sonic dismembrator set at 75% amplitude, with 10 cycles of 10\u2019\u2019 on/50\u201d off. After shearing, chromatin was clarified by microcentrifugation at 14K for 20 min, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. 1 ml aliquots of chromatin were pre-cleared using pre-blocked PAS (Millipore 16\u2013157), then 50 \u03bcl removed and stored as \u2018input\u2019 chromatin. The remaining chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight with 0.4 \u03bcg rabbit anti-TEAD1 (Cell Signaling #12292), 4 \u03bcg rabbit anti-TAZ (Cell Signaling #4883) and 0.5 \u03bcg or 5 \u03bcg of whole rabbit IgG, respectively (Jackson Laboratories 011-000-003).

After the final TE wash, chromatin was eluted from the beads 2x for 20\u2019 with gentle vortexing in 150 \u03bcl Elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M NaHC0<sub>3</sub>) at room temperature. 0.2M NaCl was added, and chromatin de-crosslinked overnight at 65\u00b0C.

Mice were deeply anaesthetized, and hair completely removed from the hindquarters. A 27g percutaneous needle electrode was inserted subcutaneously over the femur to stimulate the sciatic nerve at two locations: one proximal to the spinal cord, at the hip joint, and the other 1 cm distal to this site. The stimulation reference electrode (26G percutaneous needle) was inserted over the back. Bipolar EMG electrodes were inserted subcutaneously in the digital interosseous muscles, to record compound action potentials in response to activation of the sciatic nerve. Stimulation and recording were conducted on both hindlimbs. The muscle response was first tested with single pulses (100 \u03bcs duration) to determine the threshold and level of activation producing a stable compound action potential in the muscle. The level of stimulation which produced stable responses was then used for two series of stimulations with 2\u201320\u00a0s long trains of biphasic square wave pulses (100 \u03bcs duration) delivered at 1\u20135 Hz. The nerve was rested for 2 min between runs. Stimulation was delivered via an isolated pulse stimulator (A-M Systems Model 2100, A-M Systems Inc, Carlsborg, WA). EMG compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responses were recorded with a differential AC amplifier (A-M Systems Model 1700; gain 1 k\u2013\u00a010\u00a0k; pass band 10\u201350 KHz). Data was sampled at 50 KHz using LabVIEW (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX) running on a personal computer. Multiple recordings were taken at each location to ensure a minimum of 10 quality responses for each location and animal. Electrophysiological data was analyzed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc, Lake Oswego, OR)."

The maximum force prior to the release of all of the mouse\u2019s paws from the grid was recorded. This was repeated with forepaws alone, and grip strength of hindpaws was calculated by subtraction of the forepaw measurement from the total grip strength measurement. The apparatus was cleaned using alcohol between trials. <i>Temperature preference/ aversion test:</i> Two-choice temperature preference/ aversion assays were used to determine hot and cold thermal thresholds, using methods essentially, as described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fisher et al., 2015</a>). Briefly, mice were placed in a Plexiglass chamber containing a reference plate fixed at 25\u00b0C plus an adjacent variable temperature test plate (Bio-T2CT, BioSeb, France). Mice were allowed to habituate to the chamber for 3 min with both plates at 25\u00b0C, then the test plate temperature was increased to 49\u00b0C or decreased to 10\u00b0C in 3\u00b0C increments, at 3\u00a0min intervals. Movement of mice between reference and test plates was recorded using a video tracking system, and percentage of time at each temperature calculated. Preference/ aversion to cold vs hot temperatures was assayed on separate days."

Overall, this study is important as it further reveals a key function of the Yap/Taz signaling system in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. The paper extends and partly corrects findings by the Swaren and Feltri labs that reported a block of axonal sorting in essentially the same double mutant mice. The authors identify a strong delay (but not a block) of axonal sorting. Instead the authors make a subsequent failure of Krox20 upregulation in the \"promyelinating\" SC responsible for the myelination defect. They discover TEAD1 as a critical cofactor of Taz to directly regulate Krox20 transcription. The authors also report the requirement of continued Yap/Taz expression in adult Schwann cells to maintain myelin. The overall technical quality of the data is high, and presentation is clear and convincing. Although the concept of Yap/Taz regulation is not entirely novel, they provide additional Yap/Taz functions in Schwann cell development and myelin maintenance."

Therefore, we primarily used immunohistochemistry with a SC specific Sox10 antibody to evaluate SC-selective deletion of Yap/Taz in cDKO mice (see also our response to #4). Nonetheless, as suggested, we have carried out RT-qPCR for Yap/Taz mRNA. Total RNA was extracted from P60 sciatic nerves of 3 WT and 3 cDKO mice and used for RT-qPCR with primers in exons 2 and 3 of Yap or exons 3 and 4 of Taz, because exon 3 is deleted in both Yap and Taz knockout mice (Xin et al., 2011). We detected ~22% of Yap mRNA and ~48% of Taz mRNA in the cDKO, compared to WT. These results are now provided as <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>. These results are comparable to those we obtained with Western blotting of Yap and Taz at P60 (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The reason for the apparently small decrease in Taz mRNA at P60 is not inefficient recombination; Taz recombination is efficient, as evident from the large decrease in Taz protein levels at P4 in cDKO compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Please note that there is residual background Taz protein at P4 in cDKO, which is maintained at similar levels at P60 in cDKO. Please also note that at P60, WT Taz protein levels are much reduced compared to P4, and are only ~2-fold higher than background; hence it is not surprising that at P60, WT Taz mRNA is similarly only ~2-fold over background. We attribute the background levels of Yap mRNA, Taz mRNA and protein to a combination of perineurial cells, fibroblasts, vascular cells and residual partially recombined SCs (i.e., &lt;20% SCs; see our response to #4)."

Hence, Yap/Taz cDKO SCs gradually (abnormally slowly) sort large-caliber axons, but there is a block in progression from promyelination to myelination."

Consistent with this result, we observed only a slight increase in SC number in cDKO after P4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Notably, we found that ~22% of axons were demyelinating or demyelinated on analyses of transverse sections (i.e., at the level of one internode). Although demyelination seems only partial (i.e., ~22%), axons that appear normal at one internode may have multiple demyelinated internodes at other locations along the entire length of sciatic nerve. This notion is strongly supported by our images of <i>longitudinal</i> sections of both lines of iDKO mice, wherein along a single axon, demyelinated internodes are adjacent to myelinated internodes (e.g., demyelinated internodes marked by red \u2018a\u2019 in Figure 6E4, 6E5). Therefore, it is quite possible, in our opinion, that segmental (not uniform) demyelination that is widespread among the axons of iDKO mice can markedly reduce nerve conduction and be fatal."

This is the focus of our ongoing study, which we hope will soon provide additional insights into the robust phenotype and acute death of Yap/Taz iDKO mice. Lastly, as suggested by the reviewer, we have carried out a small number of additional experiments to check SC numbers and proliferation in iDKO: We have found that SCs are not reduced and that proliferation appears only marginally above background. We plan to provide these data when we report the results of our ongoing study."

TEADs bind two families of transcriptional cofactors: Yap/Taz and Vgll proteins; interestingly, Yap/Taz and Vgll compete for binding to TEAD, but regulate different sets of genes (Pobbati et al., 2012); hence, as we found that Yap/Taz are required for Krox20 expression, it suggests that Yap/Taz complex with TEAD1 to regulate Krox20. In support of this, Svaren\u2019s group recently reported that TEAD1 siRNA led to downregulation of Krox20 expression in primary rat SCs (Lopez-Anido et al., 2016). Also, Tricaud\u2019s group reported that co-expressing Yap and TEAD1 constructs induced maximal Krox20 promoter activity in primary rat SCs (Fernando et al., 2016), strongly suggesting that Yap directly regulates Krox20 transcription, through TEAD1. Notably, our ChIP analysis also shows that TEAD1 binds to the Krox20 promoter 10-fold over control levels, and our preliminary ChIP data shows Yap/Taz binding to the same region of the Krox20 MSE as TEAD1. These data therefore provide additional support for the notion that TEAD1 mediates Krox20 upregulation by Yap/Taz."

In addition, we plan in vivo pharmacological and genetic approaches targeting TEAD1 (Liu-Chittenden et al., 2012). We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s valuable comments.
