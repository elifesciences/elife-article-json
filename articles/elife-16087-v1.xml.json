Such a particular interpretation of the basic vertebrate body architecture has often been associated with changes in the function or regulation of <i>Hox</i> genes. Here, we use an interspecies comparative approach to investigate different regulatory aspects at the snake <i>HoxD</i> locus. We report that, unlike in other vertebrates, snake mesoderm-specific enhancers are mostly located within the <i>HoxD</i> cluster itself rather than outside. In addition, despite both the absence of limbs and an altered <i>Hoxd</i> gene regulation in external genitalia, the limb-associated bimodal <i>HoxD</i> chromatin structure is maintained at the snake locus. Finally, we show that snake and mouse orthologous enhancer sequences can display distinct expression specificities. These results show that vertebrate morphological evolution likely involved extensive reorganisation at <i>Hox</i> loci, yet within a generally conserved regulatory framework."

Such a particular interpretation of the basic vertebrate body architecture has often been associated with changes in the function or regulation of <i>Hox</i> genes. Here, we use an interspecies comparative approach to investigate different regulatory aspects at the snake <i>HoxD</i> locus. We report that, unlike in other vertebrates, snake mesoderm-specific enhancers are mostly located within the <i>HoxD</i> cluster itself rather than outside. In addition, despite both the absence of limbs and an altered <i>Hoxd</i> gene regulation in external genitalia, the limb-associated bimodal <i>HoxD</i> chromatin structure is maintained at the snake locus. Finally, we show that snake and mouse orthologous enhancer sequences can display distinct expression specificities. These results show that vertebrate morphological evolution likely involved extensive reorganisation at <i>Hox</i> loci, yet within a generally conserved regulatory framework."

This is particularly the case for tissues that show the most differences when compared with other animals (such as the torso and genitals) or that are absent (such as the limbs).

In particular, genes with critical functions during embryonic development are often largely pleiotropic and highly conserved across species (for references, see <a href=\"#bib45\">Kirschner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Duboule and Wilkins, 1998</a>). This universality of genetic and genomic principles has changed the evolutionary paradigm from the question of the nature of similarities to that of how distinct traits could evolve using such related developmental pathways (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Robertis, 2008</a>). Initially, <i>Hox</i> genes, as well as their structural and functional organization into genomic clusters were found well conserved across bilateria (<a href=\"#bib25\">Duboule and Dolle, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akam, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Garcia-Fernandez and Holland, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Graham et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">McGinnis et al., 1984</a>). In addition, their mis-expression led to changes in the identity of both insect and vertebrate segments, illustrating their crucial role in the patterning of animal structures, even though the structures they specify are of very different nature in various taxa (e.g. (<a href=\"#bib56\">Maeda, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lewis, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Krumlauf, 1994</a>)."

In addition, all vertebrate <i>Hox</i> clusters described thus far implement a particular type of regulatory process referred to as collinearity, whereby <i>Hox</i> genes are expressed sequentially in both time and space following their topological organization within each genomic cluster (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gaunt et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Izpisua-Belmonte et al., 1991</a>). This regulatory property is first observed during axial extension and, subsequently, in some structures such as the limbs (see (<a href=\"#bib21\">Deschamps, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Deschamps and van Nes, 2005</a>). In this latter case, and while the detailed underlying mechanism may be distinct from that at work in the major body axis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kmita and Duboule, 2003</a>), the general principle remains the same and was likely co-opted in the course of tetrapod evolution (<a href=\"#bib74\">Spitz et al., 2001</a>), through the emergence of global enhancers located at remote positions on both sides of the cluster (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lonfat et al., 2014</a>)."

During limb development, for instance, the telomeric TAD initially controls all genes from <i>Hoxd3</i> to <i>Hoxd11</i> in the proximal part of the limb bud, whereas more posterior genes such as <i>Hoxd13</i> or <i>Hoxd12</i> are controlled subsequently in the most distal aspect of the incipient limb by enhancers located within the centromeric TAD (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrey et al., 2013</a>). This latter regulatory landscape also controls transcription of the same posterior genes during the outgrowth of external genitalia (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lonfat et al., 2014</a>). Since snakes are limbless animals and they display highly specialized and divergent external genitals (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tschopp et al., 2014</a>), the existence of such a bimodal type of regulation at the snake <i>HoxD</i> locus was uncertain. Therefore, we set out to investigate <i>Hox</i> gene regulation in snakes. While these animals cannot yet be considered as genuine model systems (<a href=\"#bib39\">Guerreiro and Duboule, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Milinkovitch and Tzika, 2007</a>), recent advances in their genomic analyses make their study increasingly interesting in an Evo-Devo context (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castoe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gilbert et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Ullate-Agote et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Vonk et al., 2013</a>). These analyses revealed that snakes, regardless of their extreme morphologies, have a tetrapod-like complement of <i>Hox</i> genes with only a\u00a0few exceptions (<a href=\"#bib81\">Vonk et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Di-Po\u00ef et al., 2010</a>). Consequently, the serpentiform body plan may have evolved either along with changes in time and space of <i>Hox</i> gene expression or with a different interpretation of Hox protein functions (see [<a href=\"#bib23\">Di-Po\u00ef et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Woltering et al., 2009</a>])."

It was thus concluded that some Hox proteins had likely changed (part of) their functionality. In addition, the fact that the most posterior <i>Hox</i> genes were poorly expressed in the extending tailbud was tentatively associated to the unusually large number of segments (<a href=\"#bib23\">Di-Po\u00ef et al., 2010</a>), together with an increased pace in segmentation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gomez et al., 2008</a>)."

We find that, even though the structural organization of the corn snake <i>HoxD</i> cluster resembles that of tetrapods, the extreme body plan observed in snakes is associated with an extensive regulatory restructuring. In snakes, mesodermal enhancers are mostly located inside the cluster itself, whereas other vertebrates make use of long-range regulations located at remote positions. In addition, we show that despite the loss of limbs, the bimodal chromatin organisation at the <i>Hoxd</i> locus found in tetrapods is conserved in the snake lineage. However, we find that the regulation of snake <i>Hoxd</i> genes during the development of the\u00a0external genitalia is different from that of other tetrapods, even though the general logic is conserved. In this latter case, the change in enhancer activity from a limb to an external genital specificity seems to have occurred. Altogether, we conclude that <i>Hoxd</i> gene regulation in the snake is in many ways distinct from the situation in mammals. We discuss the possible causative nature of these changes in the evolutionary transformation towards a serpentiform body plan."

The expression pattern in the main body axis was in fact reminiscent of the endogenous mouse <i>Hoxd4</i> expression, with equally strong signals in both the neural tube and mesodermal derivatives (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Therefore, in contrast to other vertebrate species, enhancers located within the snake cluster appear sufficient to drive <i>Hoxd</i> gene expression in the ventral mesoderm. In order to assess if this increase in regulatory potential within the cluster was correlated with a reduction of long-range regulatory elements in the surrounding gene deserts we performed a comparative analysis of H3K27ac profiles between snake and mouse trunk tissues dissected from similar body parts. A global assessment of the profiles suggested that there were relatively less enriched sequences outside of the snake <i>HoxD</i> cluster than outside its mouse counterpart (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, bottom). In order to be able to directly compare the ChIP-seq datasets in mouse and snake, we identified 27 DNA regions conserved between the two species and located within the telomeric desert and scored their enrichments with acetylation of H3K27. While 40% of these conserved sequences were acetylated in the mouse sample, only 22% of them were significantly decorated by this chromatin mark in the snake tissue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, right). Overall, these results indicate that the enhancers required to control snake <i>Hoxd</i> gene expression in the trunk mesoderm are, at least for the most part positioned within the cluster rather than in the telomeric gene desert."

In both cases however, substantial contacts were also observed with the opposite, telomeric TAD. These latter interactions increased when the snake <i>Hoxd9</i> and <i>Hoxd4</i> baits were used, whereas at the same time, interactions with the centromeric landscape almost disappeared (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, tracks 3 and 4). Therefore, as previously reported in the case of mouse tissues and ES cells, genes located at different relative positions within the <i>HoxD</i> gene cluster show distinct interaction tropisms. 5\u2019-located genes such as <i>Hoxd13</i> interact primarily with the 5\u2019-located gene desert, whereas genes located in a more 3\u2019 part of the cluster, such as <i>Hoxd4</i>, interact mostly with the 3\u2019-located gene desert (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

In the mouse developing proximal limb for instance, <i>Hoxd11</i> and <i>Hoxd9</i> preferentially interact with the telomeric sub-TAD referred to as region \u2018b\u2019 rather than the sub-TAD \u2018a\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrey et al., 2013</a>).

As snakes lack digits, we investigated whether the conservation of this particular chromatin domain was related to the existence of external genital organs. Male snakes display hemipenes (HP), resulting from symmetrical genital buds during development. As it was proposed that the\u00a0genitals of mammals have a different embryonic origin than those of other amniotes such as squamates (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tschopp et al., 2014</a>), the existence of the same global regulation in snakes was unclear."

This difference was also scored when <i>Hox</i> gene expression was analysed in the various BAC transgenic lines. While the human, mouse, chicken and zebrafish <i>Hoxd</i> genes were expressed mostly along the main body axis and transcribed neither in the limbs, nor in the external genitals, in agreement with previous results (see above and (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lonfat and Duboule, 2015</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, bottom and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the snake BAC expressed the <i>Hoxd11</i> to <i>Hoxd4</i> genes in the developing limbs and genital bud (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This likely reflects a lack of repression of these genes into such structures, rather than the presence of limb and genital enhancers located inside the cluster. We investigated this issue by RT-qPCR in the incipient genitals of both mouse and snake, using as a control a region of the trunk located at the exact same anterior-posterior level. In such conditions, while the mouse <i>Hoxd9</i> to <i>Hoxd3</i> genes were expressed at much higher levels in the trunk when compared to the\u00a0genitals, the steady state levels of snake mRNAs were nearly the same in both tissues (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Therefore, these results suggested that the snake <i>HoxD</i> cluster lacks the sequences necessary to prevent <i>Hox</i> gene expression from the trunk lateral mesoderm, a critical factor to properly develop limbs and genitals in mouse (see discussion)."

We performed 4C-seq analyses using embryonic mouse GT and snake HP tissues at comparable stages, as well as control trunk tissues. As expected, both the mouse <i>Hoxd11</i> and <i>Hoxd13</i> genes showed more interactions with the centromeric gene desert in the\u00a0GT material than in control trunk material (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, the snake <i>Hoxd13</i> and <i>Hoxd11</i> interaction profiles were not significantly different, when either HP or the control samples were used. We searched the snake gene desert for the presence of the GT1 and GT2 sequences, two DNA segments described in the mouse counterpart to specifically interact with <i>Hoxd13</i> in the developing GT (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lonfat et al., 2014</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom left) and could identify them (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom right).

To further evaluate this striking change in enhancer potential, we cloned and investigated the regulatory capacity of both the chicken and the green anole lizard Island I sequences. The chicken construct elicited staining in limbs but not in the GT, i.e. in a pattern reminiscent of the mouse rather than the snake Island I (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, top).

However, our various transgenic mouse lines containing <i>HoxD</i> clusters from different vertebrate species showed that, in most vertebrates, regulatory sequences located in the gene deserts flanking the <i>HoxD</i> cluster are necessary for proper expression in the embryonic trunk mesoderm. Indeed, when using the expression of <i>Hoxd4</i> as a read-out of the regulatory potential contained either in the mouse, the human, the chicken or the zebrafish clusters, ventral mesodermal expression was not detected. This result is at odds with previous reports describing the presence of mesodermal enhancers on a short mouse transgene derived from this locus (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Morrison et al., 1997</a>). Similarly, we found <i>Hoxd3</i> expression to be absent from the ventral mesoderm in mouse embryos that lack the telomeric gene desert while previous work has reported that a small single-copy construct containing the <i>Hoxd3</i> locus was able to drive reporter gene expression in this tissue (<a href=\"#bib76\">Tschopp et al., 2012</a>)."

They may also reflect quantitative differences, for example when comparing (close to) single copy BAC integrations with a large number of head to tail integrations of a shorter transgene, as for <i>Hoxd4</i>. In any case, a different result was obtained when the snake <i>HoxD</i> BAC was used since, unlike the other vertebrate clusters tested, the snake transgene appeared to contain the regulatory elements necessary for expression in the trunk mesoderm. The H3K27 acetylation profiles in mouse and corn snake trunks supported this result for only few acetylation peaks were scored outside of the snake cluster compared to the mouse. In an evolutionary context, it is possible that in snakes, long-range mesodermal enhancers were progressively complemented by local enhancers to regulate <i>Hoxd</i> gene expression in the developing body axis, perhaps to provide an increased fine-tuned control in the expression balance between single <i>Hoxd</i> genes during embryonic development."

It is however worth noting that the snake <i>HoxD</i> cluster BAC was the only transgenic configuration where expression was strong in the limbs and external genitals, whereas BACs derived from animals with limbs did not elicit an expression of <i>Hoxd</i> genes into the transgenic limbs, even though the endogenous genes were strongly expressed there. Also, isolated mouse mesodermal enhancers were often described to activate reporter gene expression in secondary structures such as limbs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Charit\u00e9 et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kwan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sharpe et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Renucci et al., 1992</a>). In tetrapods, this apparent paradox may reflect the necessity for a highly specific type of regulation to control both <i>Hoxa</i> and <i>Hoxd</i> genes in specific domains of the growing limb buds (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berlivet et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Woltering et al., 2014</a>). Implementing such global limb regulations may require previous regulatory inputs to be terminated. Our results using the corn snake BAC suggest that, in the absence of limbs, this negative control may have been lost in the course of evolution, leading to the maintenance of transcription in all mesoderm derivatives. Whether or not this increased \u2018mesoderm potential\u2019 present in the snake <i>HoxD</i> cluster may somehow relate to the presence of ventral mesodermal enhancer remains to be clarified."

In all cases, most <i>Hoxd</i> genes tend to naturally interact within the \u2018telomeric\u2019 (3\u2019-located) TAD, whereas <i>Hoxd13</i> was strongly associated with the \u2018centromeric\u2019 (5\u2019-located) TAD. However, a significant difference was scored in the interaction profiles of <i>Hoxd9</i>, which displayed more contacts further away of region CNS39 in the mouse than in the snake sample. As this regulatory region is particularly active in proximal limbs, the lower frequency of contacts observed in snake embryos was not unexpected. This observation indicates that, while the general bimodal TAD regulatory structure is conserved at the <i>HoxD</i> locus, differences between vertebrate species may exist either in the extent, or in the internal organization of interactions within the TADs."

More strikingly however, Island I, which in the mouse is a limb-only specific enhancer (<a href=\"#bib63\">Montavon et al., 2011</a>), switched its regulatory capacity in the snake to become a genital-only specific enhancer, accompanied by elevated enhancer-promoter interactions as assayed by 4C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> \u2013 asterisk). On the other hand, the chicken Island I revealed enhancer specificities almost identical to those of the mouse sequence despite the fact that birds are more closely related to squamates than to mammals, suggesting that Island I had a limb-only activity at the time of divergence between mammals and reptiles/birds. Interestingly, the lizard sequence displayed a weak activity in the genital bud, in addition to the limb, indicating that the co-option to a genital function likely occurred in the squamate clade and thus preceded limb loss in snakes."

It nevertheless indicates that vertebrates with extreme variations in those systems known to be under the control of <i>Hox</i> genes (vertebral number and identities, limbs, genitals) rely upon the same general regulatory architecture and principles at <i>Hox</i> loci. In this view, vertebrate morphological evolution was accompanied by changes in <i>Hox</i> gene regulation, yet such variations were constrained within the general regulatory framework found at these loci.

The snake BAC, which initially extended 74 kb downstream of <i>Hoxd1</i> was reduced to contain only 300\u00a0bp 3\u2019 of <i>Hoxd1</i>. Successful recombination was confirmed by PCR, restriction digest and BAC end sequencing. Prior to injection, BACs were isolated using the Nucleobond Maxiprep kit, linearized with <i>PISceI</i>, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and dialyzed against microinjection buffer. The linearized BACs were then injected into fertilized mouse oocytes.

Although <i>Hox</i> gene cluster architecture is extremely conserved among different classes of vertebrates, their body plans are surprisingly diverse. This \"disconnect\" between genomic conservation and phenotypic diversity is intriguing and still largely not understood. Snakes are secondarily simplified vertebrates that possess a derived/unusual tetrapod body plan and alterations in <i>Hox</i> gene function and regulation have been suggested to play an important role in bringing about that change. This study relies extensively on the known principles of <i>Hox</i> regulation as previously characterized by the author's group in mouse. Extrapolating from this mouse \"ground state\" the study presents a descriptive molecular genetic comparative analyses of regulatory mechanisms between a model (mouse) and non-model organism (snake), focusing on mesodermic enhancer activity. This work provides interesting advances towards answering that the central question through a detailed analysis of the regulation of the snake <i>Hoxd</i> cluster. It contains large and detailed datasets, including BAC transgenesis, ChIP-seq and 4C-seq."

We agree that even though we can conclude that sequences within the snake cluster are sufficient to drive expression in the ventral mesoderm of the mouse, this experiment does not exclude that other enhancers are located outside of the cluster. However, the H3K27 acetylation ChIP in mouse and snake trunk shows a considerable decrease of peaks in the regulatory gene deserts of the snake. Therefore, although the complete absence of enhancers in the telomeric gene desert cannot be claimed without further experiments, it appears that, at the very least, a significant reduction of mesodermal enhancers outside of the cluster may have occurred. We have changed the text to correct the premature conclusion on the location of the snake mesodermal enhancers (subsection \u201cBimodal regulation in the snake HoxD regulatory locus\u201d)."

In the mouse, mesodermal enhancers have been described to be present within the cluster and snakes seem to have found an evolutionary advantage in increasing the regulatory potential of sequences in close proximity to their target genes. Such a scenario would account for the use of a preexisting regulatory strategy that would simply be reinforced in the case of the snake. In contrast, mouse limb enhancers have only been described outside of the cluster and therefore it is unlikely that a limbless organism such as the snake would select for the re-allocation of limb enhancers within the cluster. It is therefore possible that snake <i>Hoxd</i> genes have suffered distinct regulatory changes perhaps depending on whether such changes were selected after positive or relaxed selection. We have changed the text to more extensively discuss this hypothesis and have toned down our conclusions."

Interestingly, we find that, like in the mouse, the lizard Island I is enriched for H3K27ac in limb samples (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>). Some level of acetylation is also present in lizard genitals. This prompted us to assay the lizard Island I sequence in an enhancer assays, together with the chicken counterpart (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, top). We find that, while the chicken Island I has a limb-only function, thus looking very much like the mouse sequence, the lizard counterpart contains both limb and genital regulatory specificities, even though the genital expression was much weaker than in the limbs. Since the chicken is more closely related to squamates (lizards and snakes) than to mammals, these results suggest that an ancestral Island I enhancer had a limb-only specificity, which was subsequently co-opted to a genital specificity in squamates. Of course all these assays were performed in a mouse background, yet the correspondence between reporter activity experiments in the mouse and the previously published H3K27ac ChIP-seq in other species re-enforces the relevance of this experimental approach."
