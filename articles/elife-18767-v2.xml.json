This view was recently upended by the discovery of F<sup>\u2212</sup>-specific riboswitches in many bacterial genomes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2012</a>), a breakthrough that over the past few years has revealed F<sup>\u2212</sup>-transporting membrane proteins underpinning a widespread microbial physiology of resistance to environmental F<sup>\u2212</sup> toxicity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Stockbridge et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Li S et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ji et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Smith et al., 2015</a>). These F<sup>\u2212</sup> exporters fall into two phylogenetically unrelated classes: energy-consuming anion transporters of the CLC superfamily (<a href=\"#bib18\">Stockbridge et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brammer et al., 2014</a>), and electrodiffusive, F<sup>\u2212</sup>-specific ion channels of the Fluc family (<a href=\"#bib19\">Stockbridge et al., 2013</a>). While CLC proteins have been studied for decades (<a href=\"#bib14\">Miller, 2015</a>), Flucs represent a novel and idiosyncratic class of ion channels. Bacterial Fluc channels assemble as dimers of small subunits (120\u2013130 residues, 4 transmembrane helices) arranged in antiparallel transmembrane topology. This dual-topology architecture, originally inferred from biochemical and electrophysiological behavior (<a href=\"#bib19\">Stockbridge et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Stockbridge et al., 2014</a>), was recently observed in crystal structures of two homodimeric Fluc homologues (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stockbridge et al., 2015</a>), as depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>. The hourglass-shaped channel is complexed with two 'monobody' crystallization chaperones, which plug each of the wide vestibules facing the two aqueous solutions. (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These ~10\u2009kDa engineered monobodies are also high-affinity channel blockers whose long-lived block-times are readily observed in single-channel recordings (<a href=\"#bib20\">Stockbridge et al., 2014</a>)."

In contrast to most ion channels, in which a single ion-permeation pore spans the membrane along a central axis, Flucs were proposed to contain two pores running along the sides of the complex, with each pore built by residues from both subunits (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stockbridge et al., 2015</a>). However, this is a crystallographically 'dry' inference based on structural results alone, unaccompanied by any functional behavior that would add mechanistic vitality to support or refute this otherwise unprecedented picture. An additional crystallographic ambiguity is that the crevices housing the anion densities are too narrow to show themselves at 2.1\u20132.6\u2009\u00c5 resolution as clearly delineated aqueous pores traversing the protein. For these reasons, we consider that the argument for dual-pathway construction is not yet consummated; it calls for tests based on functional properties of the pores manipulated individually. By solving crystal structures of ion-permeation mutants of a bacterial Fluc channel and analyzing the behavior of fused-dimer constructs, we now unambiguously establish the two-pore character of Fluc channels."

The homodimeric channel's symmetric, dual-topology structure demands that the pores adopt antiparallel orientations and that the two chemically distinct F<sup>\u2212</sup> ions in one pore, designated F<sub>1</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> and F<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, are mirrored symmetrically in the other. In each pore, the two ions are coordinated by dipolar H-bond donors situated along a transmembrane 'polar track' (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) that constitutes a possible ion pathway through the channel. Moreover, the F<sup>\u2212</sup> coordination shells are completed by conserved phenylalanine residues interacting edge-on with the bound anions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), Phe80 associated with the F<sub>1</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> pair and Phe83 with the F<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> pair. These four aromatic side chains adopt a striking side-to-face 'Phe-box' arrangement that supports an unusual aromatic-halide coordination motif proposed to be essential for F<sup>\u2212</sup>-specific binding and permeation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stockbridge et al., 2015</a>). Edge-on aromatic-anion coordination geometry makes chemical sense in light of the electropositive hydrogens of the quadrupolar aromatic ring (<a href=\"#bib8\">Jackson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Philip et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Schwans et al., 2013</a>). The two antiparallel polar tracks and their associated bound F<sup>\u2212</sup> ions are well-separated in the crystal structure, with no plausible pathway for ions to transfer between tracks. These structural features led to the proposal, to be tested here, that the two polar tracks represent two separate pores."

This idea is now tested in Ec2, where we here examine occupancy of the F<sup>\u2212</sup>-binding sites by solving crystal structures of Phe-box mutants F80I and F83I (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and assessing their transport function. Substitution of each aromatic side chain by Ile specifically extinguishes the corresponding pair of F<sup>\u2212</sup> densities, one in each pore, while leaving the other pair Phe-coordinated and unperturbed. The mutations cause only local structural disturbances such as alternate rotamers at nearby sidechains Ser84 and Ser110 (C\u03b1 rmsd 0.4\u2009\u00c5, 0.2\u2009\u00c5 for F80I, F83I).

But the homodimeric nature of Ec2 limits our ability to examine individual pores functionally, since any such mutation appears twice in the channel. We therefore constructed a tandem dimer by connecting two copies of the WT Ec2 sequence with a linker containing a foreign transmembrane helix to force an antiparallel arrangement of the two domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This construct, denoted 'WT/WT', mimics eukaryotic Fluc genes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Smith et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Stockbridge et al., 2013</a>), and it reprises an engineered homologue previously used to infer dual-topology assembly of Fluc channels (<a href=\"#bib19\">Stockbridge et al., 2013</a>). The concatemer expresses poorly (~40 \u03bcg/L culture), but well enough for purification and reconstitution in liposomes and planar lipid bilayers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013d</a>). The concatemer is functionally indistinguishable from the homodimeric WT channel with respect to unitary current, high intrinsic open probability, brief, infrequent closings, F<sup>\u2212</sup> selectivity, and submicromolar affinity block by monobody proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s3\">3</a>). Moreover, the F80I / F80I and F83I / F83I double mutants with identical Phe substitutions in both domains - mimics of the mutant homodimers above - are likewise inactive (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Concatemeric Ec2 thus faithfully recapitulates the behavior of the corresponding homodimers."

Since the two Phe residues from the same domain contribute to different pores, and thus each pore harbors Phe80 from one domain and Phe83 from the other, we can distinguish two classes of double mutants: <i>trans</i>, wherein the two mutations reside in different pores, or <i>cis</i>, with both mutations in the same pore. Two <i>trans</i> double mutants, F80I / F80I and F83I / F83I, are completely inactive, as shown above, while both <i>cis</i> double mutants (F80I / F83I, F83I / F80I) retain channel activity. (We were unable to test <i>trans</i> double mutants in which both Phe residues in the same domain were mutated, as these were biochemically intractable.) These results show that channels with both pathways mutated are inactive irrespective of the particular combination of mutations, while those mutated in only one pathway remain active, as expected for two-pore construction."

First, WT Ec2 channels show infrequent, brief excursions to a substate of ~6 pS, approximately one-half the conductance of the open channel (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). It is natural to envision these as full closings of a single pore in a two-pore complex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Stockbridge et al., 2013</a>), a picture demanding that such partial closings be absent in the single-pore mutants. However, this idea is plainly contradicted by the kinetically similar substates of ~3 pS appearing in the single-pore mutants here (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,c</a>). Instead, the substates in both wildtype and mutant channels must reflect a rare conformation that acts simultaneously on both pores to reduce F<sup>\u2212</sup> current in each, perhaps occurring in the wide, water-filled vestibules on the two ends of the channel complex. Second, the striking and aesthetically appealing edge-to-face arrangement of the Phe-box in the WT channel had originally suggested to us that these four sidechains mutually stabilize and orient each other so as to properly coordinate the F<sup>\u2212</sup> ions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stockbridge et al., 2015</a>). However, the Phe-mutant crystal structures here, while validating F<sup>\u2212</sup> coordination by the aromatic rings, refute the idea of a mutually stabilizing quartet, since the two Phe side chains remaining in each Ile substitution, though distant from each other, adopt identical orientations and crystallographic order as in the full Phe-box of WT (side chain rmsd 0.2 \u00c5 upon backbone alignment)."

However, as indicated in the conjectural cartoon of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>,\u00a0it is likely that the pores originate and end in the two aqueous vestibules that give the channel a symmetrical hourglass shape. This suggestion follows from monobody interaction with Fluc channels. In crystal structures of both Fluc homologues, monobodies cap and intrude into the vestibules with long loops bearing their diversified sequences (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stockbridge et al., 2015</a>); in channel recordings here, the S9 monobody inhibits both double- and single-pore channels fully to the zero-current level, as though both pores are occluded simultaneously by the blocker. This proposal thus envisions the vestibules as common regions of low selectivity from which F<sup>\u2212</sup> ions gain access to the separate F<sup>\u2212</sup>-specific pathways."

Single channels were inserted by addition of Ec2-reconstituted liposomes to the '<i>cis</i>' side of the bilayer, and current was recorded at <span class=\"underline\">+</span>200 mV holding potential (<i>cis</i> side defined as zero voltage) in symmetrical solutions containing 300 mM NaF, 10 mM NaCl, 15 mM MOPS-NaOH pH 7.0, with 75\u2013150 nM of monobody S9 added to the <i>cis</i> chamber unless otherwise noted. Recordings were low-pass filtered at 160 Hz, digitized at 1.25 kHz, and analyzed in Clampfit 10 after further digital filtering at 100 Hz. Channel conductance, averaged from 10\u201314 separate single-channel records under each condition, was measured from the difference between open vs blocked current in each recording. All recordings shown in figures are representative of behavior seen on many channels in multiple reconstitutions."

Diffraction images were processed in iMosflm (<a href=\"#bib3\">Battye et al., 2011</a>), and data were merged and scaled using Aimless (<a href=\"#bib7\">Evans, 2011</a>). The complete F80I dataset consisted of three different datasets from different positions along a single long crystal, merged in Aimless. Initial structure solution of both Phe mutants was done via molecular replacement using Phaser (<a href=\"#bib13\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) with PDB #5A43 as search model. Refinement was done with Refmac5 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Winn et al., 2003</a>) and Phenix (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>), using TLS refinement and local NCS averaging. Re-refinement of the previously collated WT Ec2 structure (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stockbridge et al., 2015</a>) additionally used SAD data directly for additional phase information. Real-space refinement was done in COOT (<a href=\"#bib6\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>), and Molprobity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2010</a>) was used to carry out model validation. Unbiased maps shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> are mFo-DFc maps output by Refmac5 using a model that had never had any fluorides introduced at any point in the refinement. Datasets from second crystals for both F80I and F83I that diffracted to similar resolution reproduce all the major structural findings here, particularly with regard to the pattern of bound F<sup>\u2212</sup> and the lack of perturbation of the overall Fluc structure."

In recent years the Fluc family was characterized at the functional and structural level by the Miller lab. These proteins are dual topology dimers whose structure had raised the possibility that they contain two independent pathways for F-. However, electrophysiological recordings of single Fluc channel currents had failed to reveal any of the hallmarks of double barreled channels, such as closures to half conductance states. Actually, the location of the ion permeation pore remained somewhat elusive: four electron density peaks for F- were visible in the structure, but no continuous pore could be discerned. Therefore proof that the Fluc channels form one or two pathways was missing. In the present manuscript Last and colleagues perform a series of brilliantly designed and executed experiments to test the double barreled hypothesis. They show that 2 Phe residues in each Fluc monomer are essential for F- binding and permeation through the channel, mutation of either Phe abolishes one density peak and ion conduction. Then they use a concatameric construct where two Fluc monomers, one mutant and one WT,are tethered together. They show that in these constructs, one pore has WT properties while the other is non-conductive, showing that the Flucs are indeed double-barreled ion channels."

The structure alone implies the two-pore construction and makes obvious predictions for the flux behavior, which are herein borne out by the functional assays. It is the combination of structural data and functional results that tells the complete story and nails down a compelling case in favor of two-pore construction."
