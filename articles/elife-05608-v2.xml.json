Yet the mechanisms that coordinate this simultaneous opening during every heartbeat are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic, reciprocal, allosteric interactions. This \u2018functional coupling\u2019 facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by increasing activation of adjoined channels and occurs through C-terminal-to-C-terminal interactions. These interactions are initiated by binding of incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and proceed through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 pre-IQ domain. Coupling fades as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases, but persists longer than the current that evoked it, providing evidence for \u2018molecular memory\u2019. Our findings suggest a model for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx amplification that unifies diverse observations about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the heart, and challenges the long-held view that voltage-gated channels open and close independently."

Yet the mechanisms that coordinate this simultaneous opening during every heartbeat are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic, reciprocal, allosteric interactions. This \u2018functional coupling\u2019 facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by increasing activation of adjoined channels and occurs through C-terminal-to-C-terminal interactions. These interactions are initiated by binding of incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and proceed through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 pre-IQ domain. Coupling fades as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases, but persists longer than the current that evoked it, providing evidence for \u2018molecular memory\u2019. Our findings suggest a model for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx amplification that unifies diverse observations about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the heart, and challenges the long-held view that voltage-gated channels open and close independently."

The calcium ions that enter through these Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels trigger the release of calcium ions from storage compartments within the cells, which leads to the heart contracting. However, to trigger this release of calcium ions, many Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels have to open at the same time and we do not yet know how this is co-ordinated."

Currents were elicited with a step depolarization to \u221230 mV with Ba<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The mean amplitudes of i<sub>Ca</sub> and i<sub>Ba</sub> were 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 (<i>n</i> = 6) and 1.45 \u00b1 0.01 pA (<i>n</i> = 6), respectively. All-points histograms revealed that multi-channel openings were more likely with Ca<sup>2+</sup> than with Ba<sup>2+</sup>. Accordingly, the activity (<i>n</i>P<sub>o</sub>), defined as the number of channels (<i>n</i>) times the open probability (P<sub>o</sub>), of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within a patch, was significantly higher with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.24 \u00b1 0.10) than Ba<sup>2+</sup> (0.02 \u00b1 0.01; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Closer inspection of the multi-channel openings revealed that, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier, multiple channels frequently opened together instantaneously and subsequently closed together. For example, in the enlarged trace in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, four channels opened simultaneously, followed by the opening of four additional channels. The eight channels remained open for a time (\u223c11.5 ms), then all closed simultaneously. This apparent coordinate gating of multiple Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels was not observed when Ba<sup>2+</sup> was used as the charge carrier. These results challenge the long-held and generally accepted view that individual Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels gate independently, and instead strongly suggest that these channels frequently exhibit \u2018cooperative gating\u2019. An additional implication is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself increases the probability of cooperative Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating."

To test this idea, we co-expressed mCherry-sec61\u03b2 (a general ER marker (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zurek et al., 2011</a>)) in tsA-201 cells together with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Super-resolution imaging revealed that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel cluster distribution was not restricted to regions of the surface membrane where the ER was located (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Instead, these channels were broadly distributed along the PM surface. It is possible that the lack of organization of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels along ER junctions in tsA-201 cells reflects a lack of contact points or excessive distance between the ER and the PM. In ventricular myocytes, the membrane binding protein junctophilin-2 (JPH2) has been suggested to tether the jSR to the t-tubule membrane (<a href=\"#bib45\">Takeshima et al., 2000</a>). Thus, we attempted to anchor the ER to the PM by co-transfecting tsA-201 cells with JPH2. However, even in the presence of JPH2, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel cluster distribution was not limited to PM-ER junctions in the manner that they are in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These data suggest that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel clustering occurs independently of SR/ER microdomains."

Ca<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>2a</sub> is a palmitoylated peripheral membrane protein that binds to the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> pore-forming subunit of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dalton et al., 2005</a>); therefore, photo-activation of this protein with 405-nm light provides a fluorescent marker of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Single Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 were identified and excited using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The number of channels in each cluster was determined by continuous photobleaching and counting of stepwise decreases in fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). A preponderance (47%) of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters displayed 1 to 6 stepwise decreases in fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). A single photobleaching step was observed in only 1% of the spots analyzed. Indeed, the mean number of bleaching steps per cluster was 7.91 \u00b1 0.23 (<i>n</i> = 25). This suggests that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels preferentially cluster in groups of about 8 channels in adult ventricular myocytes. We did not discriminate cluster size based on location; thus, our estimate of 8 channels/cluster combines dyadic and extra-dyadic populations."

In isolation, VN155(I152L) and VC155 are non-fluorescent; however, when brought into close proximity by interacting proteins, they can reconstitute a full, fluorescent Venus protein. Thus, Venus fluorescence can be used to report spontaneous interactions between adjacent Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. In cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VN155(I152L) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VC155 channels, Venus fluorescence at \u221280 mV was very low, suggesting that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel interactions are rare at this hyperpolarized membrane potential.

To do so, we mutated critical residues in each segment and used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to evaluate changes in channel coupling ability. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VC channels with an I1654E mutation in their IQ domains were able to fuse upon membrane depolarization (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This isoleucine residue is crucial for CaM binding to the IQ motif. Previous in vitro studies have reported that the I1654E (or the human homolog I1624E) mutation decreases the affinity of the IQ motif for CaM by \u223c100-fold (<a href=\"#bib54\">Z\u00fchlke et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2000</a>). Thus, our results suggest that CaM binding to the IQ-motif is not required for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling. To investigate the role of the pre-IQ motif in channel interactions, we exchanged a 33-amino-acid segment of the pre-IQ domain for 33 non-identical amino acids (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). A similar segment exchange performed on human Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels expressed in tsA-201 cells was previously shown to impair channel clustering on the PM and reduce P<sub>o</sub> compared to wild-type (WT) channels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kepplinger et al., 2000</a>). Interestingly, the pre-IQ \u2018swap\u2019 mutation rendered Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VC channels incapable of functional coupling (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that pre-IQ domains are required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel oligomerization. Additional credence is given to this finding by the previously published crystal structure of dimeric cardiac L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels showing two pre-IQ helices bridged by two Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaMs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fallon et al., 2009</a>)."

Indeed, under identical imaging conditions (i.e., using the same fixative and TIRF penetration depth), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2(pre-IQ swap) channel cluster areas were not significantly different from those of WT channels. As noted above for WT channels, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2(pre-IQ swap) channel cluster distribution was not limited to PM-ER junctions, even in the presence of JPH2 (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5A,B</a>).

While the model assumes that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-to-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 coupling is initiated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklet, it could also be induced by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark resulting from the opening of a small cluster of closely apposed RyRs.

This is important because Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity remains elevated for as long as the channels remain coupled. Thus, by outlasting the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signal that evoked it, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling acts as a type of \u2018molecular memory\u2019 that might serve to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during repetitive membrane depolarization. As a consequence, an increase in action potential frequency can enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via two mechanisms: first, it can increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, thereby increasing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling; and second, if an AP arrives while a subpopulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels remain coupled, which could occur even if [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> had decreased to basal levels owing to the molecular memory phenomenon, it would encounter a cell with a higher number of coupled\u2014that is, more active\u2014channels (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>).

For example, coupling of a mutant channel with a higher intrinsic open probability to a WT channel could increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. One condition associated with aberrantly high Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating is Timothy syndrome (TS), also known as long-QT syndrome 8. TS is an autosomal-dominant, multi-organ disorder caused by de novo gain-of-function missense mutations in exon 8 or an alternatively spliced exon 8A of Ca<sub><span class=\"small-caps\">v</span></sub>1.2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Splawski et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2005</a>). Forced physical interactions between Ca<sub><span class=\"small-caps\">v</span></sub>1.2 channels have an intriguing effect on adjoined channels: fusion of intrinsically hyperactive Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-TS channels to WT channels induces these latter channels to function like TS channels. These findings have important implications. If TS channels can form stable interactions with neighboring WT channels in TS patients, then these mutant channels, which constitute only \u223c23% of the total cardiac Ca<sub><span class=\"small-caps\">v</span></sub>1.2 population, could have a disproportionally large effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We previously tested this idea in ventricular myocytes expressing our fusible Ca<sub><span class=\"small-caps\">v</span></sub>1.2 channels and found that fusion of TS channels with WT channels led to the development of arrhythmogenic spontaneous SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events in addition to increasing the amplitude of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transients and contractions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>). These findings support the hypothesis that physical interactions between the C-termini of TS and WT channels produce a disproportionally large Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that ultimately induces arrhythmogenic changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Consistent with this, we found that the relationship between the level of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-TS channel expression and the probability of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave is non-linear, suggesting that even low levels of these channels are sufficient to induce maximal changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Drum et al., 2014</a>)."

In the present work, the authors use a combination of super resolution nanoscopy, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, electrophysiology and two methodologically distinct assays of protein-protein interaction to investigate the molecular basis for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels oligomerisation and its functional impact. The goal of this work is to determine the mechanisms allowing the simultaneous opening of calcium channels near the junctional SR in order to explain the high probability of RYR activation during the cardiac AP. The main findings of this study are that: i) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels form clusters containing 5 channels in tsA201 cells and 8 channels in mouse ventricular myocytes; ii) within these clusters, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels interact with each other via their C-termini and this interaction, which can occur in presence of elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type calcium channels; iii) CaM molecules are involved in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2-to-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 interaction via their C-termini by binding to a pre-IQ sequence and this is also required for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels clustering; iv) the functional impact of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel coupling within a cluster consists in the instantaneous opening of channels together (and subsequent closing together) which is associated with multi-quantal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets. Also, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels coupling transiently persists after L-type calcium current has entered the cell and this is associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation in cardiac myocytes. In addition, the possible dynamic clustering and de-clustering of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels provides a mechanism of molecular memory, in which, the temporal limitation of channel disassociation following a first event could facilitation the activation of the subsequent events. These data provide novel insights of intracellular signaling networks of facilitation and are reminiscent of long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks."

                    "text": "The reviewers pose an interesting question about potential co-localization of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel clusters and the ER in tsA-201 cells. Epithelial tsA-201 cells (derived from HEK293 cells) are neither excitable nor contractile and lack a specialized ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism. Accordingly the tsA-201 cells do not possess the same specialized architecture or couplon structures observed in cardiac myocytes. Further, these cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels (Perez-Garcia et al., 1995) or ryanodine receptors (Rossi et al., 2002; Tong et al., 1999). Nonetheless, we concede the possibility that heterologous expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels in these cells might result in their co-localization with ER structures that are present in the cells. To address this question, we used super-resolution imaging to examine Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel-expressing tsA-201 cells double labeled with antibodies directed against: (i) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels and, (ii) mCherry-Sec61\u03b2 (a general ER marker; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zurek et al., 2011</a>). The results of these experiments, presented in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>, revealed that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel clusters are not preferentially co-localized to tsA-201 ER structures. We further explored this idea by co-transfecting tsA-201 cells with the membrane-binding protein Junctophilin-2 (JPH2). This protein is known to stabilize the junctional membrane complex in cardiomyocytes by tethering the junctional SR membrane to the t-tubule membrane (<a href=\"#bib45\">Takeshima et al., 2000</a>). We used JPH2-GFP to increase anchor points between the ER and PM in tsA-201 cells. However, even in the presence of JPH2, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel clusters were not distributed along the PM-ER junctions in the manner that they are in cardiomyocytes. These data, now presented in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel clustering occurs independently of SR/ER microdomains."

In these experiments, we found that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2(pre-IQ swap) channels still formed clusters in tsA-201 cells, despite their inability to interact functionally. Indeed, under identical imaging conditions (i.e., using the same fixative and TIRF penetration depth), Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (pre-IQ swap) channel cluster areas were not significantly different from those of WT channels. These results suggest that while the physical proximity of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels is necessary for channel interactions, it is not sufficient for their functional coupling. These data have now been added to <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 5</a>. The implications of these new data are that the clustered arrangement of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels may be dictated by another unknown protein scaffold. The identity of these proteins will be sought in future studies."

We want to clarify that we are not suggesting that channels dynamically cluster and de-cluster but rather that channels within pre-defined clusters dynamically and functionally interact with one another during calcium influx events. This is how we considered the reviewers question in our response. We now include additional experiments designed to address these questions. Specifically, we measured I<sub>2</sub>/I<sub>1</sub> current amplitude ratios with interpulse intervals ranging from 0.05 to 1.6 s in control ventricular myocytes and in myocytes dialyzed with 100 nM or 1 \u03bcM MLCKp. In control myocytes, peak levels of I<sub>Ca</sub> facilitation were apparent with an interpulse interval of 300 ms and declined thereafter whereas facilitation was absent at all interpulse-interval durations in myocytes superfused with Ba<sup>2+</sup> or dialyzed with 1 \u03bcM MLCKp. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, not Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions, augment Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity, likely by increasing the number of functionally coupled channels. Furthermore, these experiments reveal the \u201cpriming\u201d phenomenon that we had proposed based on our FRET experiments.
