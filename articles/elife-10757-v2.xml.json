In <i>Drosophila</i>, cellular rearrangements drive axis elongation. Cells exchange neighbours by converging into transient multicellular vertices which resolve through the assembly of new cell interfaces parallel to the AP axis. We found that new interfaces elongate in pulses correlated with periodic contractions of the surrounding cells. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility globally, or specifically in the cells around multicellular vertices, disrupted the rate and directionality of new interface assembly. Laser ablation indicated that new interfaces sustained greater tension than non-elongating ones. We developed a method to apply ectopic tension and found that increasing AP tension locally increased the elongation rate of new edges by more than twofold. Increasing dorsal-ventral tension resulted in vertex resolution perpendicular to the AP direction. We propose that local, periodic contractile forces polarize vertex resolution to drive <i>Drosophila</i> axis elongation."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, cellular rearrangements drive axis elongation. Cells exchange neighbours by converging into transient multicellular vertices which resolve through the assembly of new cell interfaces parallel to the AP axis. We found that new interfaces elongate in pulses correlated with periodic contractions of the surrounding cells. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility globally, or specifically in the cells around multicellular vertices, disrupted the rate and directionality of new interface assembly. Laser ablation indicated that new interfaces sustained greater tension than non-elongating ones. We developed a method to apply ectopic tension and found that increasing AP tension locally increased the elongation rate of new edges by more than twofold. Increasing dorsal-ventral tension resulted in vertex resolution perpendicular to the AP direction. We propose that local, periodic contractile forces polarize vertex resolution to drive <i>Drosophila</i> axis elongation."

During this rearrangement, the contacts between neighbouring cells break down before new contacts are formed with other cells.

Following contraction of AP interfaces in the <i>Drosophila</i> germband, multicellular vertices are systematically resolved through the assembly of new contacts separating dorsal and ventral cell neighbours (DV interfaces, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). While vertex resolution and the subsequent assembly of new cell-cell interfaces drive tissue elongation, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate these processes. Myosin turnover between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states is important for the directionality of vertex resolution (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>). Computational modelling suggests that periodic contraction of the apical surface of germband cells, driven by pulsatile actomyosin networks, could promote the oriented assembly of new cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lan et al., 2015</a>). However, the role of actomyosin contractility in vertex resolution remains unclear."

We find that the assembly of new interfaces during vertex resolution occurs in pulses associated with the periodic contraction of the cells anterior and posterior to the multicellular vertex. Pulsed actomyosin contractility in the cells around the vertex is critical for the directionality and rate of assembly of the new cell interface. Local, ectopic AP tension is sufficient to accelerate the assembly of new interfaces, and local DV tension can reorient vertex resolution. Together, our results demonstrate that local, periodic actomyosin contractility directs the resolution of multicellular vertices and promotes the assembly of new cell contacts during polarized cell rearrangements in <i>Drosophila</i> germband extension."

                                "text": "To investigate the mechanisms of vertex resolution during <i>Drosophila</i> axis elongation, we used quantitative image analysis to measure the dynamics of assembly of new DV junctions in embryos expressing Resille:GFP (<a href=\"#bib37\">Morin et al., 2001</a>) to visualize cell outlines. We found that the assembly of new DV edges occurred in cycles of elongation and shortening (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>, blue line), with a period of 126\u00a0\u00b1 5\u00a0s (<i>n</i> = 110 edges). On average, elongation pulses increased edge length by 772 \u00b1 46 nm, while shortening pulses decreased edge length by a significantly smaller amount, 114 \u00b1 19 nm (<i>n</i> = 110 edges, p = 9.0 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221222</sup>), thus resulting in net edge elongation. Germband cells undergo characteristic cycles of apical area contraction and relaxation with a period of 130\u00a0\u00b1 3\u00a0s, and predominantly oriented along the AP axis of the embryo (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fernandez-Gonzalez and Zallen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sawyer et al., 2011</a>). To examine whether the anisotropic oscillations of germband cells were associated with the assembly of new cell junctions during vertex resolution, we compared the changes in length of the nascent DV edge to the changes in apical area of the cells immediately anterior or posterior to that DV edge (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). In a majority of cases (143/220 cell-edge pairs, 65%), we observed a negative correlation between changes in length of the new DV junction and changes in area of the cell anterior or posterior to it (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To calculate the dominant relationship between changes in anterior/posterior cell area and new DV edge length, we quantified the correlations after shifting the edge length backward or forward in time. Reaching the maximum correlation with small time shifts would indicate in-phase oscillations, while maximum anti-correlation with small time shifts would suggest oscillations in anti-phase. We found that short time shifts of the edge length signal maximized the anti-correlation, while longer time shifts were necessary to maximize the correlation (p\u00a0= 1.74 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>), further suggesting that pulses of new DV edge assembly are associated with the contraction of the anterior and posterior cells. Similar analyses demonstrated that changes in length of the new edge were predominantly positively correlated with changes in the apical area of the dorsal and ventral cells, which share the new edge (156/220 cell-edge pairs, 71%, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, our results suggest that pulsed contractions of the cells in the immediate vicinity of a multicellular vertex may promote vertex resolution during <i>Drosophila</i> axis elongation."

To investigate if actomyosin contractility is necessary for vertex resolution, we injected embryos expressing E-cadherin:GFP and myosin:mCherry with the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 at 100 mM. Rho-kinase is one of the main activators of myosin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amano et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kimura et al., 1996</a>), and treatment with Y-27632 abolishes the ability of germband cells to generate mechanical force (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</a>). In Y-27632-injected embryos, germband cells displayed a rapid loss of myosin from their apical surface (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), resulting in a dramatic reduction in the amplitude of apical area oscillation (p = 1.7 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221244</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013H</a>). Inhibiting actomyosin contractility affected the directionality of vertex resolution: 9/25 vertices resolved within 30\u00b0 of the DV axis in Y-27632-injected embryos, in contrast to 0/28 in water-injected controls (p\u00a0= 0.02, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J\u2019,K</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In addition, for vertices that resolved along the AP axis, inhibiting Rho-kinase reduced the rate of new edge elongation with respect to controls (0.001 \u00b1 0.080 \u03bcm/min vs. 0.28 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcm/min, respectively, p\u00a0= 0.01, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J,L</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), suggesting that myosin activity facilitates the assembly of new DV interfaces. Similar results were obtained in embryos expressing Resille:GFP, a different cell outline marker (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013E</a>). However, Rho-kinase activity can regulate the localization of the Par polarity complex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atwood and Prehoda, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib47\">Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>), raising the possibility that abnormal vertex resolution upon Y-27632 injection was a consequence of defects in cell polarity, rather than reduced actomyosin contractility."

Cytochalasin D injection disrupted the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013B</a>) and reduced apical area oscillations (p\u00a0= 0.04, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5C\u2013E</a>), without affecting the localization of Par-6, a member of the Par complex (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Cytochalasin D treatment led to an 83% reduction in the rate of new DV edge assembly with respect to controls (0.07 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcm/min vs. 0.40 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcm/min, respectively, p\u00a0= 0.01, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5F\u2013G,J</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>).

To quantify tension, we used an ultraviolet (UV) laser to locally irradiate and sever DV interfaces in embryos expressing E-cadherin:GFP, and particle-tracking velocimetry to quantify the change in position of the tricellular vertices once connected by the severed interface. The instantaneous retraction velocity of the vertices is proportional to the tension sustained by the interface prior to ablation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hutson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</a>). We compared retraction velocities after ablation of control DV junctions that were not actively elongating (average length of 7.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcm, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and newly forming DV edges (average length of 3.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcm, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The retraction velocity after ablation of new DV junctions was 0.81 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcm/s, 32% greater than the retraction velocity after severing control DV edges (0.61 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcm/s, p <i>=</i> 0.05, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that \u2013\u00a0assuming uniform viscoelastic properties\u00a0\u2013 new DV edges sustain increased mechanical tension with respect to non-elongating edges with similar orientation. New DV interfaces displayed smaller angles between the anterior or posterior cell junctions (<i>\u03b8<sub>avg</sub></i> = 136.6 \u00b1 3.3\u00b0) than control DV interfaces, (<i>\u03b8<sub>avg</sub></i> = 150.3 \u00b1 3.4\u00b0, p\u00a0= 0.02, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B,D</a>), and the retraction velocity after laser ablation was significantly anti-correlated with the angle between the anterior or posterior cell junctions (<i>r</i> = \u22120.6, p = 2.9 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>). Notably, no correlation was found between control or new DV interface length and instantaneous retraction velocity after ablation (<i>r</i> = 0.04 and 0.35, respectively, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that differences in retraction velocity between control and new DV edges are independent from interface length, and determined by whether the edge is being assembled. Vertex retraction after laser ablation could result from actomyosin contractility at the interface or at another structure (for example, another interface or a medial apical surface) connected to the severed interface. New DV edges were myosin-depleted (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blankenship et al., 2006</a>) (p\u00a0= 4.3 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that vertex retraction after ablation of new DV edges was caused by tension generated elsewhere and exerted onto the new edge. Together, our data strongly suggest that mechanical tension parallel to the AP axis of the embryo contributes to vertex resolution."

To this end, we used a UV laser to irradiate and destroy myosin networks in the cells anterior/posterior or dorsal/ventral to four-cell vertices. Cells expressed E-cadherin:GFP to visualize cell outlines, and myosin:mCherry to track the assembly of contractile networks. Cells were re-irradiated upon assembly of medial actomyosin networks to prevent the generation of contractile forces. Irradiated cells were not extruded in the course of these experiments. Controls were four-cell vertices in which the anterior/posterior or dorsal/ventral cell pairs were sham-irradiated with the UV laser fully attenuated using a neutral density filter. When the contractile activity of anterior/posterior cells was disrupted, 4/7 four-cell vertices did not resolve (their length was never greater than 1 \u03bcm for at least 1\u2009min), in contrast to 0/10 vertices in sham-irradiated controls. In controls, the rate of new edge elongation calculated over 180\u2009s was 0.47 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcm/min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). Preventing contraction of the anterior/posterior cells resulted in a significant reduction of the rate of new edge elongation to 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcm/min for the vertices that resolved (p\u00a0= 0.03; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>).

In contrast with the ablation of anterior/posterior cells, ablation of the DV cells did not prevent vertex resolution: 5/7 new DV interfaces reached a length of at least 1 \u03bcm, similar to 10/10 in controls. The initial rates of elongation were similar, with new DV interfaces elongating at a rate of 0.37 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5m/min over 60\u2009s when contraction of the DV cells was disrupted, compared to rates of 0.50 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5m/min in sham-irradiated controls (p = 0.48, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). However, ablation of the dorsal and ventral cells resulted in a significant reduction of the rate of new interface elongation over the subsequent 120\u2009s of elongation, from 0.52 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcm/min in controls to -0.03 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcm/min (p\u00a0= 0.01, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). Notably, in 3/5 vertices that resolved when dorsal/ventral cells were ablated, new DV edges formed but were not sustained beyond 1\u2009min, collapsing back into vertices. Together, our data suggest that dorsal/ventral cells are necessary to sustain the elongation of new DV interfaces, but not the resolution of multicellular vertices."

Upon wounding by irradiation with a UV laser, germband cells undergo apical constriction driven by medial-apical actomyosin networks (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Apical constriction of germband cells generates ectopic tension on the surrounding cell interfaces (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, arrowheads). We used a UV laser to wound the cells anterior and posterior to resolving vertices by irradiating their medial-apical surfaces (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Under sham-irradiation (UV laser fully attenuated using a neutral density filter), the cell area and medial myosin of the anterior and posterior cells remained largely unaffected, and the new DV interface elongated at a rate of 0.79 \u00b1 0.14 \u03bcm/min (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C,E</a>). Conversely, when the cells anterior and posterior were irradiated with UV light, myosin accumulated on the apical surface of the wounded cells and their apical areas decreased rapidly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>), resulting in ectopic, AP-oriented tension on the resolving vertex. Under ectopic tension parallel to the AP axis, new DV junctions elongated at a rate of 1.73 \u00b1 0.30 \u03bcm/min, 2.1-fold faster than the elongation rate in controls (p = 6.2 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22123</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

We used quantitative imaging, and biophysical and pharmacological approaches to show that local mechanical forces can direct the assembly of new junctions during <i>Drosophila</i> germband extension. New junctions elongate in pulses anti-correlated with the periodic contractions of the cells anterior and posterior to the new contact. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility disrupts both the rate and directionality of new junction assembly. Disrupting contractility in the cells anterior and posterior to the new edge disrupts vertex resolution and slows down new edge elongation, while preventing contraction of the dorsal and ventral cells mainly affects the maintenance and lengthening of the new cell interface. Hypercontraction of the cells anterior and posterior to the new edge accelerates the rate of new edge assembly. Finally, applying ectopic tension orthogonal to the characteristic orientation of vertex resolution is sufficient to alter the direction of new edge formation, suggesting that mechanical forces associated with actomyosin contractility direct the assembly of new cell contacts during multicellular vertex resolution in germband extension."

Consistent with this, expression of\u00a0inactive\u00a0or constitutively active forms of myosin in embryos lacking the wild-type motor protein disrupts the directionality of vertex resolution during germband extension (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kasza et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, mechanical tension is necessary for directional resolution of multicellular vertices in the mouse embryonic ectoderm during limb bud elongation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lau et al., 2015</a>). In the <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal thorax, whose architecture is determined by neighbour exchange events, actomyosin contractility in new edges is tightly regulated to facilitate their elongation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bardet et al., 2013</a>). Our data suggest that the increase in tension on the new contact may be caused locally by the pulsatile, anisotropic contraction of the cells around the resolving vertex. Interestingly, cells in the mouse limb bud ectoderm also display pulsed contractions that are disrupted in \u03b2-catenin mutants, and in these mutants the directionality of vertex resolution is lost (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lau et al., 2015</a>). Together, these results are consistent with a\u00a0general role for pulsed contractile activity in orienting and promoting cell intercalation."

Our data suggest that the anterior and posterior cells contribute to both vertex resolution and new edge elongation, while the dorsal and ventral cells are mainly necessary to support the elongation of the edge once the vertex has resolved. Recent mathematical modelling predicts that periodic actomyosin contractility in the medial-apical surface of anterior and posterior cells could drive the assembly of new edges during germband extension (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lan et al., 2015</a>). The pulsed contraction of the anterior and posterior cells could cause rapid membrane reorganization in the dorsal and ventral cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pramanik et al., 2009</a>), facilitating the assembly of an actin scaffold (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pickering et al., 2013</a>) and the formation of junctions. Junctional and cytoskeletal remodelling require intact DV cells, and possibly, the continued stimulus from AP cell pulsing. The implementation of optogenetic approaches (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guglielmi et al., 2015</a>) to locally inhibit membrane remodelling and junctional and cytoskeletal dynamics will reveal how these processes are coordinated across cells to promote directional cell rearrangements during epithelial morphogenesis."

An accumulation of filamentous actin is the first known step of vertex resolution (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blankenship et al., 2006</a>), and in this study, we found that blocking actin polymerization results in multicellular vertices that do not resolve. Thus, actin polymerization may play a central role in vertex resolution. Mechanical forces can control actin dynamics in vitro, possibly by inducing conformational changes in the formin family of actin regulators to favour faster and more frequent polymerization of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Courtemanche et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Higashida et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jegou et al., 2013</a>). In addition, actin filaments are less susceptible to severing in the presence of increased tension (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayakawa et al., 2011</a>), which may accelerate actin assembly at nascent cell interfaces. Understanding how mechanical forces impact the localization and dynamics of different actin regulators will contribute to elucidating the mechanisms by which tension promotes directional cell behaviours during <i>Drosophila</i> axis elongation."

A related question is whether these AP contractions contribute only to junction elongation or also to the initial resolution of the multicellular vertices.</i> To determine the relative contribution of anterior/posterior (A/P) or dorsal/ventral (D/V) cells to the elongation of new junctions parallel to the AP axis of the embryo, we ablated medial myosin networks in the cells A/P or D/V to resolving four-cell vertices. Repeated ablations were necessary to prevent the assembly of contractile actomyosin networks that drive pulsatile cell behaviours. We found that both A/P and D/V cells were necessary for the assembly of new DV interfaces (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Our data suggest that A/P and D/V cells may play different roles in vertex resolution and new interface elongation. When contraction of A/P cells was disrupted, vertex resolution was delayed with respect to controls, and the subsequent rate of new edge elongation decreased. In contrast, for D/V cell ablations, the initial steps of vertex resolution occurred at a similar rate as in controls, but after the new interface reached a length of approximately 1 \u00b5m, the elongation of the new interface stopped. We propose that contraction of A/P cells is necessary for the initial resolution of the multicellular vertex and the subsequent elongation of the new DV interface. D/V cells, on the other hand, may be necessary to sustain the elongation of the new DV interface that they share, by providing actin filaments and junctional molecules that stabilize that interface."

Thus, to determine if the length of DV junctions correlates with the tension they sustain, we quantified the correlation between interface length and velocity of vertex retraction, both for control and new junctions.

To this end, we conducted laser ablation experiments on new edges that were filmed for 2 min before ablation, and we calculated the rate of interface length change prior to ablation. Based on this, we classified interfaces as elongating, if their length was increasing immediately before ablation, or shortening, if their length was decreasing. The velocity of retraction for elongating interfaces (0.77 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b5m/s, <i>n</i> = 10) was not significantly different from the velocity of retraction for shortening interfaces (0.74 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b5m/s, <i>n</i> = 4, <i>P</i> = 0.87, <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1</a>), suggesting that new DV interfaces do not experience significant changes in tension during the elongation and shortening phases of the edge assembly cycle. This result is consistent with the 6.8-fold greater magnitude of elongation pulses with respect to shortening pulses (772 \u00b1 46 nm vs.114 \u00b1 19 nm), which suggests that the increase in tension caused by the elongation phase may not be significantly alleviated by the shortening phase."

This allowed us to investigate the localization of the Par complex using a reporter that does not cause overexpression phenotypes. Upon treatment with Y-27632, Par-6:GFP accumulated in \u201cbars\u201d at the centre of junctions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 2A</a>), similar to previous reports for Par-3, another member of the Par complex (Simoes et al., 2010). Therefore, defects in vertex resolution observed in embryos injected with Y-27632 could be caused by the loss of myosin localization at the apical cell surface (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), by changes in the localization of the Par complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 2A</a>), or by both. To more specifically address the role of actomyosin contractility in the elongation of new DV junctions, we treated embryos with 5 mM of Cytochalasin D, a drug that inhibits actin polymerization (Flanagan and Lin, 1980) and has been used to disrupt actomyosin contractility in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos (Martin et al., 2009). We found that Par-complex localization was not disrupted by treatment with 5 mM Cytochalasin D (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 2B</a>). However, Cytochalasin D treatment disrupted both actin and myosin dynamics in germband cells (new <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A, B, F-H</a>), and the oscillatory behaviours of germband cells were significantly attenuated (new <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C-E</a>), suggesting that actomyosin contractility was disrupted. Similar to the results obtained when we injected embryos with Y-27632, we found that inhibition of actomyosin contractility using Cytochalasin D significantly affected the directionality and rate of new edge elongation during vertex resolution (new <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4F-K</a>), further suggesting that actomyosin contractility is necessary for vertex resolution during <i>Drosophila</i> axis elongation."
