A protein called a helicase is then shepherded onto the unwound DNA regions by other proteins known as loaders. Once loaded, the helicase can unwind long stretches of the chromosome in which the DNA is packaged, producing the template required by the replication machinery to duplicate the DNA. This process must be accurately executed to avoid generating errors that could damage the DNA and potentially cause cells to die."

Using biochemical and structural techniques, Hood and Berger now show that the viral inhibitor protein interacts with the DnaI loader from <i>S. aureus</i> by binding to the loader's ATP-binding region. When the two proteins are bound together, the loader can still bind to its target helicase but it cannot interact with other loader molecules. This defect prevents the loaders from self-assembling into a structure that is required for them to load the replicative helicase."

A second unexpected discovery was that the virus encodes its own helicase loader, which binds to the bacterial helicase but not to the viral inhibitor protein. The next stage of work will be to determine whether the regions on the helicase loader that are targeted by the inhibitor and that are important for regulating self-assembly can be selectively disrupted by small molecules to interfere with DNA replication in bacteria."

DNA synthesis is carried out by large, multi-subunit assemblies, termed replisomes, which are assembled at replication origins in accord with cell cycle cues. Dedicated proteins known as initiators play an essential role in selecting replication start sites, remodeling origin DNA, and providing an appropriate platform for recruiting replicative helicases to origins prior to the onset of strand synthesis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Costa et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dutta and Bell, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kaguni, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leonard and Grimwade, 2011</a>).

In certain Gram-negative bacteria, a protein known as DnaC assists with loading of the helicase (known in these organisms as DnaB); many Gram-positive species retain a homolog of DnaC termed DnaI. Both DnaC and DnaI are composed of an N-terminal helicase binding domain that connects to a C-terminal AAA+ ATPase domain by a variable linker region of unknown function (<a href=\"#bib43\">Loscha et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Although bacterial DNA replication proteins are strikingly distinct from those found in eukaryotes and archaea (<a href=\"#bib39\">Leipe et al., 1999</a>), antibiotics currently on the market do not target replication components directly, suggesting that this system may be a valuable prospective drug target (<a href=\"#bib46\">McHenry, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Robinson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2012</a>). Along these lines, a small, 52 amino acid protein from phage strain 77, encoded by the <i>ORF104</i> gene, has been reported to interact directly with the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> helicase loader, DnaI, and to inhibit host DNA replication in vivo (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2004</a>). The discovery of 77ORF104 marks the first known instance in which the replication initiation machinery of a bacterium can be inhibited by an exogenous factor (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2004</a>); however, where the inhibitor protein associates with the helicase loader and how it represses helicase loader activity has remained unknown."

We show that the phage protein binds directly to DnaI\u2019s AAA+ ATPase domain, where it both remodels a region critical for loader self-assembly and sterically masks a known loader-loader interaction site. Inhibitor binding, which represses the helicase loader\u2019s ATP hydrolysis activity, is found to exploit a surface region normally occupied by a portion of the linker region that connects the N- and C-terminal domains of DnaI. Together, our data not only establish a new means by which viruses can inhibit DNA replication, but also indicate that bacterial helicase loaders possess an unanticipated auto-regulatory element, located within their variable linker region, that serves to help restrict premature loader self-assembly."

We then conducted limited proteolysis studies of <i>Sa</i>DnaI in both the presence and absence of 77ORF104 to determine where the phage protein might bind. Inspection of the reactions using SDS-PAGE showed relatively rapid degradation of <i>Sa</i>DnaI when the phage protein was omitted.

In accord with our pull-down studies, the core AAA+ domain of <i>Sa</i>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> proved sufficient for binding to 77ORF104, while the N-terminal domain of <i>Sa</i>DnaI showed no evidence of binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The calculated apparent K<sub>d</sub> (K<sub>d, app</sub> = 49 nM \u00b1 19 nM) for the inhibitor-loader AAA+ domain interaction proved comparable to that previously reported for the 77ORF104 protein and full-length <i>Sa</i>DnaI (K<sub>d</sub> = ~50 nM as reported by surface plasmon resonance) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2004</a>). Together, these data show that only the core AAA+ domain of the <i>S. aureus</i> helicase loader is required for high affinity association with the phage inhibitor protein, and suggested that the <i>Sa</i>DnaI ATPase fold might serve as a promising candidate for co-crystallization studies. Following screening, the successful acquisition of crystals, and data collection (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), we determined a crystal structure of the AAA+ domain of <i>Sa</i>DnaI bound to both 77ORF104 and an ATP-mimetic, ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion for phasing.

Collectively, these motifs adopt a configuration similar to that seen in structures of other nucleotide-bound AAA+ ATPases (e.g., see [<a href=\"#bib19\">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</a>]), except that the last six C-terminal residues of the structure, which include the Sensor-II amino acid (Arg304), were unresolved (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Inspection of the electron density in the active site revealed clear density for nucleotide binding, permitting modeling of ADP, BeF<sub>3</sub>, and a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and its associated waters. Interestingly, 77ORF104 can be seen to directly engage the bound nucleotide.

This element, termed the <b>I</b>nitiator/loader-<b>S</b>pecific <b>M</b>otif (ISM) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dueber et al., 2007</a>), has been shown to be important for self-assembly and function in replicative helicase loaders and initiators (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mott et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dueber et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Erzberger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Duderstadt et al., 2011</a>). In nucleotide-oligomerized DnaA and DnaC/I structures, the ISM introduces a significant out-of-plane displacement of adjacent ATPase folds, and appears responsible for pushing these assemblies into a helical, as opposed to closed-ring, formation. As anticipated, based on structural alignments with DnaC/I homologs, the ISM of 77ORF104-bound <i>Sa</i>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> forms a V-shaped projection from the central ATPase domain. Inspection of this region, however, revealed that one of the \u03b1-helices of the <i>Sa</i>DnaI ISM is bent compared to the ISM region of other helicase loaders (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Examination of the crystal contacts in our <i>Sa</i>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup><i>\u2022</i>77ORF104 structure indicates that the change in conformation of the ISM is not the result of packing interactions, indicating that binding of\u00a0the 77ORF104 inhibitor is responsible for introducing this conformational change in <i>Sa</i>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup>."

The nucleotide binding cycle of bacterial helicase loaders has been proposed to be coupled to an ability of the loader to self-assemble (<a href=\"#bib6\">Biswas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mott et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tsai et al., 2009a</a>), an activity that can be stimulated in DnaI/DnaC-family loaders by single-stranded (ss) DNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davey et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ioannou et al., 2006</a>). To test whether 77ORF104 might impact such a function, we carried out radioactive ATP hydrolysis assays using [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and M13-ssDNA. Although <i>Sa</i>DnaI was found to exhibit relatively modest ATPase activity on its own, the presence of M13-ssDNA markedly stimulated nucleotide turnover (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By contrast, when incubated with the 77ORF104 inhibitor in the presence of M13-ssDNA, the observed stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by ssDNA was much reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B,C</a>). To establish that the increase in ATPase activity we observed was derived from <i>Sa</i>DnaI and not from a potentially contaminating ATPase, we cloned, expressed and purified several active site mutants of <i>Sa</i>DnaI. Both a Walker A mutant (K170A) and an\u00a0arginine finger mutant (R288A) showed reduced ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of ssDNA, indicating that the ssDNA-stimulated activity seen in our assays was indeed specific to DnaI and did\u00a0not arise from a contaminating ATPase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Interestingly, within the phage 77 genome, the gene next to <i>ORF104</i> (termed <i>ORF013</i>) is annotated as an AAA+ ATPase. The two genes are located in the same operon in the phage chromosome, suggesting that they might be expressed contemporaneously and function synergistically. To determine the protein family to which 77ORF013 belongs, we searched the database for homologous proteins of known function. Surprisingly, this analysis revealed that the <i>77ORF013</i> gene encodes a putative DnaC/DnaI-type helicase loader (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), thereby raising the possibility that the 77ORF013 protein might bind to the host\u2019s replicative helicase directly. To test this hypothesis, we cloned, expressed and purified a tagged version of 77ORF013 and performed amylose pull-down experiments using the untagged <i>Sa</i>DnaC replicative helicase as prey. SDS-PAGE analysis of different pull-down fractions showed that the phage 77 ORF013 protein was indeed capable of binding the <i>Sa</i>DnaC replicative helicase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>); analytical gel filtration chromatography studies corroborate this result (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

These observations suggest that the 77ORF013 and 77ORF104, which appear to both share a common operon, may serve as a two-pronged mechanism by which host replication can be inhibited and a portion of the cell\u2019s replication machinery co-opted for promoting viral DNA duplication. Surveys of other <i>S. aureus</i> phage genomes, such as phages 80 and 80\u03b1, reveal the existence of homologs of both the phage 77 ORF013 protein and the ORF104 inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kwan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tormo-M\u00e1s et al., 2010</a>), indicating that the phage 77 ORF013/ORF104 system may be widespread among <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> phages.

Previous studies of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> DnaI and the related <i>E. coli</i> DnaC protein have shown that bacterial helicase loaders typically require helicase binding and/or ssDNA binding to promote ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ioannou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Learn et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Davey et al., 2002</a>), a function proposed to directly depend on loader self assembly (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mott et al., 2008</a>). Superposition of the 77ORF104-<i>Sa</i>DnaI complex with structures of other DnaI orthologs, particularly those that contain a portion of the helicase loaders\u2019 linker regions, reveal that the C-terminal tail of the inhibitor actually occupies a pocket that corresponds to the observed binding site for a portion of the linker itself (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Moreover, inspection of these overlays shows that in associating with its own AAA+ ATPase domain, the inter-domain linker additionally blocks a portion of the surface where subunit-subunit interactions form during loader self-association (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, see inset). This observation explains why DnaI ATPase domain constructs containing a portion of the linker crystallized as monomers even in the presence of nucleotide, and indicates that the linker likely serves as a switch that reports on relative status of the N- and C-terminal regions, repressing loader-loader interactions until the correct helicase and DNA targets are bound (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In this regard, the 77ORF104 protein exploits this binding locus, taking advantage of the linker-binding pocket to inactivate the host loader, an activity that would allow the cellular replicative helicase to be re-routed by the phage-encoded loader to promote viral replication (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This interaction, which occurs within a small hydrophobic pocket on the loader AAA+ ATPase domain, suggests that the linker-binding region of the DnaI AAA+ domain could serve as an attractive site for the development of chemical inhibitors to target helicase loading and DNA replication in bacteria. Future efforts will help test and establish these concepts further."

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed at 10\u02daC in 70 \u00b5L reaction buffer containing 50\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 500\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1\u2009mM DTT, and 2\u2009mM ATP.

The resultant data show that on its own, <i>Sa</i>DnaI forms a very broad, polydisperse mixture of species with a large average molecular weight (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). By contrast, when measured in the presence of the inhibitor protein, a much smaller, less polydisperse species is formed. Interestingly, the average molecular weight calculated for the dominant species in the DnaI-ORF104 mixture is larger than expected for a 1:1 complex, suggesting that complex formation is incomplete under the conditions tested here and/or that the N-terminal domain of DnaI might self-associate through unsatisfied, exposed surfaces that would normally be used for binding to the helicase. Nonetheless, these findings corroborate the structural and biochemical data indicating that the phage inhibitor disrupts loader-loader interactions."

In <i>B. subtilis</i>, helicase loading has been reported to occur not by a ring opening mechanism (as is thought to happen in <i>E. coli)</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Davey and O\u2019Donnell, 2003</a>), but rather by a DnaI-directed assembly process that additionally requires two co-chaperones not found in Gram-negative organisms, DnaB (which is unrelated to the <i>E. coli</i> DnaB helicase) and DnaD (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rokop et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Smits et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Velten et al., 2003</a>). Stable hexamers have been observed for Gram-positive DnaC helicases, but only when using thermophilic proteins (e.g. <i>B. stearothermophilus</i> and <i>G. kaustophilus</i> [<a href=\"#bib3\">Bailey et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ioannou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Soultanas, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tsai et al., 2009b</a>]), whose room-temperature behavior may differ from their mesophilic counterparts. It should be noted that dimers of DnaB-family helicases have been observed previously, wherein the dimer is stabilized by interactions between the N-terminal 'collar' domains of the protein (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey et al., 2007b</a>). Our findings, which show that <i>S. aureus</i> helicase/loader interactions form but are somewhat unstable, and that the DnaC helicase does not readily assemble a pre-formed hexamer, are in accord with observations reported for the <i>B. subtilis</i> system."

                    "text": "We agree that these are important experiments. We initially considered using cross-linking and SDS-PAGE to examine self-self interactions between <i>Sa</i>DnaI protomers in the presence of both the <i>Sa</i>DnaC helicase and the phage 77 ORF104 protein. However, given the large number of possible interactions (loader-loader, loader-helicase, helicase-helicase), we realized that this experiment would likely be difficult to interpret cleanly (we do not have antibodies to any of the proteins in the study, which would have made such an approach more feasible). Instead, inspired by well-established studies of actin and microtubule self-assembly (1, 2), we have looked at loader interactions using a simple centrifugation assay. Based on studies that were initially not pertinent to the submitted manuscript (and hence not discussed), we have observed that, when chilled at elevated concentrations, <i>Sa</i>DnaI oligomerizes into visible microcrystals that can be sedimented after a brief centrifugation step. Were the phage inhibitor to disrupt DnaI-DnaI contacts, we reasoned that it should keep the loader in solution. As is now shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> of the revised manuscript, this is exactly what happens. In addition, we also looked at the behavior of <i>Sa</i>DnaI by dynamic light scattering. As can be seen and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, the loader forms a very broad, polydisperse mixture of species with a large average molecular weight. By contrast, when measured in the presence of the inhibitor protein, a much smaller, less polydisperse species is formed (N.B. \u2013 the average molecular weight calculated for the dominant species in the DnaI-ORF104 mixture is larger than expected for a 1:1 complex, suggesting that inhibitor/loader complex formation is incomplete under the conditions tested here and/or that the N-terminal domain of DnaI might self-associate through unsatisfied, exposed surfaces that would normally be used for binding to the helicase). Collectively, these findings corroborate our other structural and biochemical data indicating that the phage inhibitor sterically blocks loader-loader interactions, and have been added to the revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Stable hexamers have been observed for Gram-positive DnaC helicases, but only in studies that analyze thermophilic proteins whose room-temperature behavior may differ from their mesophilic counterparts (e.g. <i>B. stearothermophilus</i> and <i>G. kaustophilus</i> (8\u201312)). It should be noted that dimers of DnaB-family helicases have been observed previously, wherein the dimer is stabilized by interactions between the N-terminal \u201ccollar\u201d domains of the protein (13, 14)."
