The phragmoplast forms at the cell center and expands to reach a specified site at the cell periphery, tens or hundreds of microns distant. The mechanism responsible for guiding the phragmoplast remains largely unknown. Here, using both moss and tobacco, we show that myosin VIII associates with the ends of phragmoplast microtubules and together with actin plays a role in guiding phragmoplast expansion to the cortical division site. Our data lead to a model whereby myosin VIII links phragmoplast microtubules to the cortical division site via actin filaments. Myosin VIII's motor activity along actin provides a molecular mechanism for steering phragmoplast expansion."

This is accomplished by a dynamic and complex structure known as the phragmoplast, comprising the cytoskeletal polymers, microtubules and actin filaments. The phragmoplast assembles from the anaphase spindle and directs the traffic of vesicles carrying cell wall components to and from the nascent wall, called the cell plate (<a href=\"#bib23\">Segu\u00ed-Simarro et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Austin et al., 2005</a>). The phragmoplast forms at the center of the cell and expands outward to reach the parental cell wall, tens or even hundreds of microns distant. When the phragmoplast reaches the parental cell wall, the cell plate and parental membranes fuse, completing cytokinesis."

It is clear that microtubules are essential for cell division, since in their absence the cell plate does not form. And while it has been known for decades that the phragmoplast also contains actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib4\">Clayton and Lloyd, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Kakimoto and Shibaoka, 1987</a>), it remains unclear how actin contributes to phragmoplast function. For one, plant cells still divide in the absence of actin (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baluska et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Nishimura et al., 2003</a>). Additionally division still occurs in the presence of mutations in genes encoding actin or various actin-associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib9\">J\u00fcrgens, 2005</a>). However, based on drug treatments and localization studies, actin has been proposed to stabilize the phragmoplast and link the phragmoplast to the cell cortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lloyd and Traas, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Molchan et al., 2002</a>).

As mitosis proceeds, the microtubules in the band disassemble while actin filaments become depleted from the band itself but enriched on either side of it (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cleary, 1995</a>). Although the cytoskeletal polymers are lost from the band, a number of proteins remain at the site of the band throughout mitosis and cytokinesis, thereby marking the site where the new cell plate will fuse to the parental cell wall (<a href=\"#bib28\">Walker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Xu et al., 2008</a>). Interfering with preprophase band development invariably interferes with cell plate positioning (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rasmussen et al., 2011b</a>)<i>.</i> Because actin is present in both the band and the phragmoplast, discovering actin's function specifically in the latter has been challenging."

While depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton halts cell expansion in protonemata, it has little if any effect on cell division. The fact that moss protonemata do not make a preprophase band, but have actin in the phragmoplast provides a unique opportunity to study the role of actin in phragmoplast guidance. Here, we use a combination of genetics and live-cell imaging to probe the role for guiding the phragmoplast of actin and a family of actin-based molecular motors, the class VIII myosins."

Protonemata from this line have multiple, unevenly distributed branches.

Cell plates are aberrantly positioned with respect to the filament axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, arrows). Since branch patterning and cell division plane specification are linked, we reasoned that non-branching cells in the myosin VIII null plants might also have cell division defects. In young wild-type plants, apical cells position their new cell plates perpendicular to the long axis of the cell: more than 84% of apical cell plates are within 15\u00b0 of the perpendicular plane.

Since myosin VIII's are partially redundant (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wu et al., 2011</a>), we reasoned that expression of Myo8A should be sufficient to partially rescue the myosin VIII null phenotype. To test this, we measured cell plate positioning in young plants and found that expression of Myo8A-GFP results in plants with 63% of the apical cell plates within 15\u00b0 of the perpendicular axis. Importantly, cell plates with angles greater than 35\u00b0 are never observed in the Myo8A-GFP expressing plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that Myo8A-GFP partially restores cell plate positioning in the myosin VIII null plants. Additionally, Myo8A-GFP expression partially rescues a number of other defects in myosin VIII null plants, including protonemal branching defects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), apical cell length (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), and timing of gametophore formation (data not shown).

To stage division, we introduced into the Myo8A-GFP line mCherry-PpTUA1 (hereafter referred to as mCherry-tubulin). In branch forming cells, Myo8A-GFP accumulates prominently at the cell cortex at the neck region of the emerging bulge, and this accumulation happens prior to prophase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> arrows; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The tubulin images confirm that these cells lack a preprophase band. During branch cell mitosis, Myo8A-GFP appears on the spindle and phragmoplast, and as the phragmoplast matures, Myo8A-GFP accumulates at the phragmoplast periphery. In the later stages of cytokinesis, there are two populations of Myo8A-GFP: an inner ring on the phragmoplast (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, arrow heads; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and an outer ring at the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, arrows; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As the phragmoplast expands, the inner Myo8A-GFP ring eventually reaches the outer one. Together with an increased frequency of cell plate positioning defects in myosin VIII null plants, these data suggest that myosin VIII plays a role in ensuring that the phragmoplast expands to the pre-determined cortical division site."

BY-2 cells are commonly used to study the localization of plant proteins during mitosis and cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Van Damme et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Rasmussen et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Lipka et al., 2014</a>). Alignment of myosin VIII proteins from tobacco, Arabidopsis and moss, revealed that moss myosin VIII proteins are \u223c50% identical to tobacco and Arabidopsis myosin VIIIs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1, 2</a>). Except for the closely related tobacco and Arabidopsis Myo8B and D, the percent identity between the remaining four tobacco and Arabidopsis myosin VIIIs is 51\u201358% (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1 and 2</a>). With such high sequence identity, we reasoned that Myo8A-GFP might serve as a proxy for the localization of seed plant myosin VIIIs."

In cells about to enter mitosis, cortical Myo8A-GFP accumulates at the presumptive position of the preprophase band (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As cells enter mitosis, cortical Myo8A-GFP tightens into a thin band and remains at the cortical division site. In early cytokinesis, Myo8A-GFP appears also at the phragmoplast midzone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As the phragmoplast expands, the Myo8A-GFP at the phragmoplast midzone expands out eventually reaching the Myo8A-GFP at the cortical division site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Evidently, myo8A-GFP is capable of localizing to the phragmoplast and future site of division in a seed plant as well as in a bryophyte."

Before nuclear envelope break down, we found a population of Myo8A-GFP that localizes to cytoplasmic microtubules surrounding the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Myo8A-GFP remains localized along microtubules as the spindle is assembled (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). During mitosis, Myo8A-GFP continues to associate with the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>), enriched at the midzone and to some extent at the poles. Prior to anaphase, a small population of Myo8A-GFP accumulates at the cortex near the spindle midzone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, arrows; <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). During anaphase, Myo8A-GFP concentrates at the midzone. Initially Myo8A-GFP is found throughout the phragmoplast midzone (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5C\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As the phragmoplast matures, Myo8A-GFP accumulates on the leading edge of the phragmoplast, ultimately forming a ring (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5C\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Interestingly in apical cells, Myo8A-GFP does accumulate at the cell cortex, but in contrast to branching cells, this accumulation occurs later and is significantly more dynamic."

When Myo8A-GFP appears on the spindle, there is little to no accumulation of lifeact-mCherry. During the transition from spindle to phragmoplast, Myo8A-GFP concentrates at the midzone and lifeact-mCherry fluorescence rises above background levels in the vicinity of the phragmoplast. However, when Myo8A-GFP fluorescence tightens into a thin band on the phragmoplast leading edge, the lifeact-mCherry fluorescence accumulates significantly around the phragmoplast (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, top). The timing of the appearance of actin suggests that early localization of Myo8A-GFP to the mitotic spindle is independent of actin. To test this, we imaged cells entering mitosis in the presence of 25 \u00b5M Latrunculin B, which depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Strikingly, Myo8A-GFP still accumulates on the mitotic spindle. Similar to control cells, Myo8A-GFP in drug-treated cells accumulates in the spindle midzone at anaphase and tightens into a thin band at the leading edge of the phragmoplast during cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, bottom). Thus, Myo8A-GFP recruitment to the mitotic spindle and behavior during mitosis is apparently independent of actin."

To test this, we imaged phragmoplasts labeled with GFP-tubulin and FM4-64. Since actin is essential for polarized expansion, it was not possible to perform long-term Latrunculin B treatments. Instead, plants were treated for 2 hr before imaging, ensuring that essentially all observed phragmoplasts had been formed in the absence of actin. The majority of untreated, wild-type phragmoplasts deposit membrane uniformly, appearing as smooth FM4-64 staining in the midzone (80% of wild type cells, n = 55; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>,). In contrast, most myosin VIII null dividing cells have non-uniform FM4-64 staining (70% of \u0394myo8ABCDE cells, n = 79; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). Interestingly, treatment of wild type dividing cells with Latrunculin B results in cells with similar defects in cell plate assembly as those observed in the myosin VIII null cells (70% of wild type cells treated with LatB, n = 50; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>; <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>), indicating that the observed changes in the assembling cell plate result from compromising actin and myosin."

However, we also observed that Myo8A-GFP localizes to the ends of peripheral phragmoplast microtubules (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, arrows; <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>) that initiate from the edge of the phragmoplast and are initially unattached to the phragmoplast midzone. We investigated the behavior of these peripheral microtubules in control and latrunculin B treated cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). Before the phragmoplast reaches the cell cortex, we found that there were three times fewer peripheral microtubules in control cells as compared to cells treated with latrunculin B. We suspected that this difference likely results from the fact that peripheral microtubules more rapidly focus at the phragmoplast midzone in control cells. To test this, we identified peripheral microtubules in control and latrunculin B treated cells and followed them for 20 s. We found in control cells that only 20% of the peripheral microtubules were still present after 20 s (n = 4 cells). In contrast, 89% of peripheral microtubules were still present after 20 s in latrunculin B treated cells (n = 4 cells). In some cases (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, yellow arrow) peripheral microtubules were observed to remain unattached for more than a minute. Taken together these data indicate that in the presence of actin peripheral microtubules are swiftly integrated into the expanding phragmoplast, suggesting that actin filaments exist between the edge of the expanding phragmoplast, peripheral microtubules, and the cell cortex."

For2A-GFP remains on the edge of the phragmoplast throughout cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>; <a href=\"#media14\">Video 14</a>), suggesting that actin is actively polymerized on the phragmoplast edge. To test this, we simultaneously imaged lifeact-mEGFP and mCherry-tubulin using a laser scanning confocal microscope. We confirmed that actin accumulates at the midzone once the phragmoplast forms. As the phragmoplast expands out from the center of the cell towards the cell cortex, we discovered that actin filaments are present at the midzone and between the leading edge of the phragmoplast and the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>; <a href=\"#media15\">Video 15</a>). Moreover, peripheral phragmoplast microtubules intersect the actin filaments that span the distance between the phragmoplast leading edge and the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, arrowhead). Our data suggest that microtubules may interact with actin filaments bridging the cell cortex and the phragmoplast during the time that myosin VIII-mediated motility guides the phragmoplast."

A population of myosin VIII localizes to microtubules and this population incorporates into the mitotic spindle upon spindle formation. In early mitosis, as microtubules are dynamically searching to make chromosomal attachments, Myo8A-GFP decorates the entire spindle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). At metaphase, Myo8A-GFP concentrates in the spindle midzone and at anaphase an additional population of Myo8A-GFP dynamically concentrates at the cell cortex where the cell plate ultimately fuses with the parental cell wall. Once the phragmoplast assembles, Myo8A-GFP forms a tight ring at the edge of the expanding phragmoplast (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). At this point, the class II formin, For2A, localizes to the phragmoplast (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">van Gisbergen et al., 2012</a>) and polymerizes actin filaments between the leading edge of the phragmoplast and the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Since For2A remains associated with the phragmoplast, it suggests that the barbed ends of the actin filaments are anchored at the phragmoplast midzone and the pointed ends are in the cytoplasm. Myosin VIII at the cortex can hold onto these actin filaments and walk towards the barbed end thereby aligning the actin filaments to the cortical division site. We propose that myosin VIII at the ends of peripheral phragmoplast microtubules moves along these actin filaments from the cortical division site towards the expanding phragmoplast, thereby translocating microtubules and ensuring that phragmoplast expansion occurs along a plane defined by the cortical division site (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

These cytoplasmic microtubules emanate from the spindle pole body embedded in the nuclear envelope and Myo2p mediates their motility along actin cables directed into the bud, moving the nucleus toward the bud neck (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beach et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Yin et al., 2000</a>). We imagine a similar mechanism could be at work in plant cells, whereby myosin VIII associates with microtubule ends, and subsequently translocates microtubules on actin filaments to guide phragmoplast expansion."

These cells are narrow, with diameters not much greater than the sizes of the nucleus and spindle, leaving little room for those two structures to be misplaced. Due to these geometric constraints, the mitotic spindle always forms along the long axis of the cell. Thus, any cell plate positioning defects that occur are mild because the spindle midzone is always roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the cell."

Arguably, in comparison to apical cell division, side-branch formation needs to specify the cell division plane more accurately. Branching involves an asymmetric cell division in an L-shaped cell. The nucleus migrates toward the junction of the parental cell and the branch and the spindle is oriented along the longitudinal axis of the new emerging cell. The phragmoplast builds the new cell plate at the junction of the two cells. We found that in branching cells, a relatively static population of Myo8A-GFP accumulates at the cell cortex at the future site of cell division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Myo8A-GFP accumulates at this site early, prior to mitosis, and remains throughout cytokinesis. As in apical cells, Myo8A-GFP also accumulates on the mitotic spindle, ultimately forming a tight band on the leading edge of the phragmoplast. The new cell plate fuses with the parental cell membranes at the cortical site defined by the presence of Myo8A-GFP. Since there are many ways to orient the spindle in a branching cell, in the absence of myosin VIII defects in cell plate positioning are frequent, suggesting that myosin VIII functions to guide phragmoplast expansion."

Our result is consistent with a previous report in which a GFP fusion of one of the Arabidopsis class VIII myosins, ATM1-GFP, was shown to localize to the phragmoplast in BY-2 cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Van Damme et al., 2004</a>). The discovery that Myo8A-GFP localizes to the cortical division site gives us a portal to connect our observations in moss to the current model of cell division in seed plants (<a href=\"#bib24\">Van Damme, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Rasmussen et al., 2011b</a>). In that model, cells with preprophase bands use a microtubule-dependent mechanism to position the nucleus such that it is bisected by the future plane of division and to form the spindle perpendicularly (<a href=\"#bib15\">Mineyuki and Furuya, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Venverloo and Libbenga, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Katsuta et al., 1990</a>). Once the spindle is aligned, defects in phragmoplast guidance would little alter cell plate positioning and subsequent tissue morphogenesis, obscuring the role of myosin VIII. Nevertheless, when BY-2 cells are treated with actin inhibitors, phragmoplasts are disorganized, generating wrinkled cell plates that are often skewed with respect to the cortical division site (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hoshino et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Yoneda et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Sano et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Higaki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Kojo et al., 2013</a>).

We propose that myosin VIII's motor activity along actin provides a molecular mechanism for steering phragmoplast expansion."

For imaging, 1-week-old protonemal tissues were protoplasted, plated in plating medium at a density of \u223c20,000 cells/9 cm<sup>2</sup> plate, regenerated on protoplast regeneration medium (PRM) for 4 days and transferred to PpNH4 plates. For moss transformation, protoplasts were isolated from 7-day-old moss protonemal tissue, and transformed with linearized DNA via PEG-mediated transformation (<i>15</i>). At least 30 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA was linearized, ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in sterile TE buffer. pTKUbi constructs were linearized with Pme I and pTZUbi constructs were linearized with Swa I. Protoplasts were transformed with linearized DNA via PEG-mediated transformation (<i>15</i>). Protoplasts were plated in top agar, regenerated on PRM (PpNH<sub>4</sub> medium supplemented with 8.5% mannitol and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.) for 4 days and transferred to PpNH<sub>4</sub> medium containing the appropriate antibiotics (G418, 20 \u00b5g/ml; zeocin, 50 \u00b5g/ml; hygromycin, 15 \u00b5g/ml). To select for stable transformants, transformations were cycled on and off antibiotic selection for three 1-week intervals. Stable transgenic lines were visually screened on a confocal microscope for expression of the transgene."

The only result that directly supports this claim is the increase in frequency of oblique cell walls in the quintuple mutant in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. The localization of Myo8A-GFP at the cortical division site only indirectly supports the guidance model. The authors' interpretation that these cortical Myo8A motors can exert a pulling force on the actin filaments emanating from the phragmoplast is plausible, but not supported by any data. It is also important to emphasize that this mechanism is very different from that found in budding yeast where the myosin uses actin filaments of opposite orientation to pull the nucleus toward the bud neck."

A kymograph approach might work, where analysis lines are drawn along actin bundles and then applied to the Myo8A channel. This could work for Movie 1/image sequences of LF and Myo8A as it is possible then to show many motility events and to measure velocities.

Thus, in our proposed model myosin VIII guides the peripheral phragmoplast microtubules along actin filaments towards the phragmoplast edge, the location of the actin filament barbed ends.

We also do not currently have fluorescent tubulin in the other myosin mutants. With respect to formin, we primarily used formin localization as a proxy for where actin polymerization was being initiated on the phragmoplast. While formins may be integral to the process, it is difficult to assess this, since there are nine formins in moss, two of which are absolutely essential for polarized growth."
