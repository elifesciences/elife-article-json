It is much more complicated than a consensus on the part of university provosts to expand the set of works and measures that constitute solid evidence of academic distinction. That said, there is growing awareness that the search and review committees that appoint and promote academic staff have traditionally relied on information sources that may fail to portray the full picture. This is especially true when the candidate's key contributions are not published in book or journal form, or when he/she publishes mainly or exclusively co-authored works."

And as Richard Zare, former chair of the chemistry department at Stanford University, described in a recent article (<a href=\"#bib6\">Zare, 2012</a>), elite research institutions in the United States, seemingly unlike most of the world's universities, are not overly dependent on citation-based measures of impact such as impact factors for journals or h-indices for individuals. Rather, their appointment processes are time-intensive, more qualitative than quantitative or formulaic, and rely most heavily on peer review (both internal and external) to identify excellence. This type of peer review involves collecting confidential letters from a well-chosen set of peers: the purpose of these letters is to help academic review committees assemble a robust qualitative picture of a scholar's originality, independence, intellectual leadership and potential for future productivity and impact."

However, provosts and other administrators contacted by <i>Nature</i> painted a different picture: \u2018Metrics are not used a great deal,\u2019 said Alex Halliday, head of the mathematical, physical and life sciences division at Oxford University. \u2018The most important things are the letters, the interview and the CV, and our opinions of the papers published.\u2019 Claude Canizares, vice president for research and associate provost at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had a similar message: \u2018We pay very little attention, almost zero, to citation indices and counting numbers of publications\u2019."

This is because author lists don't provide clear information about who contributed what in large-scale research and writing collaborations, which are increasingly common in the physical and life sciences. Author lists take a complex network of collaboration and effectively reduce it to a one-dimensional information source, where all we have to go by is order of names to convey author role and rank. Different fields of scholarship have adopted different practices around author order, but middle authors are always at the greatest risk of losing out on attribution and credit because their <i>perceived</i> contribution is diminished relative to first and last authors in collaborative works. In fields that list author names in journal articles alphabetically, such as economics, it has even been observed that you are more likely to get tenured in a top department if your surname begins with a letter earlier in the alphabet (<a href=\"#bib3\">Einav and Yariv, 2006</a>). The unintended consequences of our authorship practices are far from benign for researchers and for science."

Many publishers now require contribution disclosures upon article submission\u2014some in structured form, some in free-text form. There is now a clear need for a standard vocabulary of contributor roles that captures what each named author contributed to a particular publication\u2014for example, conceptual framework, methodological design, data collection, data curation, experimental procedures, programming, software, statistical analysis, investigation, instrumentation, writing, illustration, project management, funding, laboratory head and so on. With the development of contributor role vocabularies and tagging mechanisms, the review committee of the future reading a tenure application from, say, a biostatistician who is usually a middle author in multi-authored works, will more readily be able to detect that the individual consistently contributes innovative methodologies to his or her research collaborations (<a href=\"#bib4\">IWCSA, 2012</a>)."

While a future scheme of standardized contributor roles integrated with the ORCID identifier system may lead to the development of new quantitative metrics, I am much more interested in having more precise information about researcher contribution made transparent in our information resources.
