Numerous studies have measured how low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations from the brain are correlated between voxels in a resting state, and have exploited these signals to infer functional connectivity within specific neural circuits. However, to date there have been no previous substantiated reports of resting state correlations in the spinal cord. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, we observed robust functional connectivity between left and right ventral (motor) horns, and between left and right dorsal (sensory) horns. Our results demonstrate that low-frequency BOLD fluctuations are inherent in the spinal cord as well as the brain, and by analogy to cortical circuits, we hypothesize that these correlations may offer insight into the execution and maintenance of sensory and motor functions both locally and within the cerebrum."

Numerous studies have measured how low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations from the brain are correlated between voxels in a resting state, and have exploited these signals to infer functional connectivity within specific neural circuits. However, to date there have been no previous substantiated reports of resting state correlations in the spinal cord. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, we observed robust functional connectivity between left and right ventral (motor) horns, and between left and right dorsal (sensory) horns. Our results demonstrate that low-frequency BOLD fluctuations are inherent in the spinal cord as well as the brain, and by analogy to cortical circuits, we hypothesize that these correlations may offer insight into the execution and maintenance of sensory and motor functions both locally and within the cerebrum."

For example, an fMRI scan recorded whilst someone is reading is likely to show activity in regions in the left hemisphere of the brain that are known to be involved in language comprehension. fMRI can also be used to measure patterns of neuronal activity when someone is awake but not engaged in a specific task. This approach, known as resting state fMRI, can be used to examine which regions of the resting brain are active at the same time. Researchers are interested in these patterns of brain activity because they reflect neural circuits that work together to produce different functions and behaviors."

The earliest papers investigated task-based fMRI, where evoked BOLD signal changes were interpreted as hemodynamic responses subsequent to neural activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ogawa et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bandettini et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kwong et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ogawa et al., 1992</a>) and were used to infer which brain regions were activated for a specific task. The range and impact of fMRI methods were expanded in 1995 when Biswal et al. established the existence of correlations between low-frequency (&lt; 0.08 Hz) BOLD signals from spatially distinct locations when no task was performed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Biswal et al., 1995</a>), and over 4000 subsequent papers have documented different aspects of resting state fMRI. Importantly, these correlations have been widely adopted to infer functional connectivity between cortical regions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Greicius et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fox et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Smith, 2012</a>). The identification of patterns of highly correlated low-frequency signals in the resting brain provides a powerful approach to delineate and describe neural circuits, and an unprecedented insight into the manner in which distributed regions work together to achieve specific functions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pizoli et al., 2011</a>). In this study, we present the first robust demonstrations that similar phenomena can be detected within the gray matter of the human spinal cord, and we report our preliminary attempts to perform resting state connectivity studies within the cords of normal volunteers."

Partly, the lack of positive reports may reflect the relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio of spinal cord images achievable at conventional field strengths (1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla) and the inherent limitations of low spatial resolution in studying small structures. The advent of ultra-high magnetic fields (7 Tesla and above) and implementation of appropriate multichannel spinal cord coils, along with improved image acquisition and correction protocols, provides new opportunities for high-resolution fMRI of the spinal cord with increased sensitivity to BOLD fluctuations in the small gray matter structures that are typically not well visualized at lower fields."

However, the formulation of such hypotheses may, in part, be guided by known anatomical connections or spinal cord function. For example, the likely existence of central pattern generators in the human spinal cord that subserve basic locomotion (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kandel et al., 2000</a>, p. 753) suggest that functional connectivity may exist between ventral (motor) horns. Similarly, reflexes suggest connections between a dorsal (sensory) horn and both ipsilateral and contralateral ventral horns (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kandel et al., 2000</a>, Figure 36-2), and are primarily apparent in the presence of noxious stimuli. The ascending sensory pathways and descending motor pathways also suggest that there may be connectivity along the length of the cord, at least within individual dermatomes for dorsal horns (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kandel et al., 2000</a>, p. 445). However, it must be emphasized that the lack of a direct anatomical connection between two sub-regions of spinal gray matter does not preclude the possibility of finding connectivity between these regions because they may be indirectly connected via other pathways. In practice, even if significant low-frequency signal variations related to function are manifest, they may be obscured by cord motion and various other sources of physiological noise. Here we adapt the paradigm used for earlier investigations of connectivity in the brain whereby we define very small regions of interest in anatomically distinct parts of spinal gray matter which in general subserve defined functions, and examine interregional steady-state correlations between them. In addition, we derive the patterns of voxels that show significant temporal correlation with selected single voxels within regions. These approaches have been successfully used, for example, in the cortex to delineate motor circuits. The use of high resolution images at 7 Tesla permit the reliable separation of ventral, dorsal, and bilateral segments of the cord so we can examine functional connectivity between sub-regions guided by known anatomical features. Functional connectivity along the cord may also be examined by considering any subregion in one slice and the same or another subregion in adjacent (or other) slices, but here we limit the group analysis of our first report to functional connectivity assessed within axial slices."

A 14-step standardized analysis protocol (described in 'Materials and methods') was used for each of the 22 subjects studied. In each subject, temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) was measured in spinal gray matter upon completion of the functional-to-anatomical affine registration (step #9) as well as after the application of CSF and white matter \u2018regressors of no interest\u2019 (steps #11 and #12). Across all 22 subjects, we observed a 30% increase in median TSNR (from 29.3 to 38.1) after the application of these few regressors, demonstrating the importance of characterizing and removing structured noise sources (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xie et al., 2012</a>). After band-pass filtering to isolate the frequency range of interest (0.01\u20130.08 Hz), single-subject analyses show that statistically significant correlations are measurable between selected regions and are reproducible across subjects. As an illustrative example with the corresponding time series, an analysis performed on one subject (female, 23 years old) demonstrates connectivity with the contralateral ventral horns in the same slice and with adjacent slices when a seed region is selected in the center of the right ventral horn (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). A stringent threshold of |<i>z</i>| &gt; 3.29 (a two-tailed 99.9% confidence interval) was selected to show that connectivity is focused in the gray matter horns and not in central gray matter (connecting left and right sides and largely dominated by the central canal) nor adjacent white matter, which provides evidence that such gray matter correlations cannot be simply attributed to spatially correlated physiological noise and more likely represent genuine functional connectivity. Further examples of within-slice connectivity analyses in single subjects confirm that reproducible focal connectivity is found between ventral horns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>) and between dorsal horns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013J</a>). There is also evidence of plausible connectivity with central gray matter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>) and between ventral and dorsal horns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>), but these correlations are less consistent across all slices and not statistically significant at the group level. To quantify the occurrence of within-slice correlations between gray matter sub-regions across slices, we averaged time courses within each respective gray matter sub-region (defined in step #14) and considered only positive correlations at a more conventional 95% confidence interval (<i>z</i> &gt; 1.65; one-tailed). Across all 264 slices (12 slices/subject \u00d7 22 subjects), we observed that 67% of slices (177 of 264) exhibit significant correlations between ventral horns and 37% of slices (97 of 264) exhibit significant correlations between dorsal horns. In comparison, a markedly fewer number of slices (only 1 in 5) exhibited significant correlations between the remaining four pairs: 21% between left ventral and left dorsal horns (55 of 264), 21% between left ventral and right dorsal horns (55 of 264), 20% between right ventral and left dorsal horns (54 of 264), and 23% between right ventral and right dorsal horns (62 of 264)."

For clarity the labels are not shown for each column/row but are the same as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. (<b>A</b>) Preprocessing was performed as described in the Methods except CSF and WM regressors (steps #11 and #12) were not applied. Each GM sub-region is highly correlated with all other GM sub-regions and similarly each WM sub-region is highly correlated with all other WM sub-regions. Interestingly, there are no significant group-level correlations between GM and WM sub-regions, suggesting that \u2018global\u2019 GM fluctuations tend to be constrained to GM and \u2018global\u2019 WM fluctuations tend to be constrained to WM. (<b>B</b>) Preprocessing was performed as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 except a WM regressor (step #12) was not applied. The application of only CSF regressors reduced correlations within both GM and WM, but all inter-region correlations remained and were statistically significant. (<b>C</b>) Preprocessing was performed exactly as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 (i.e., this panel is the same as <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> except for a larger dynamic range for <i>z</i>-scores). Regression of the principal eigenvector of all time series in the WM mask significantly altered correlations within both GM and WM. This unintuitive result may be explained if WM masks contain signal contributions from adjacent GM voxels, which is certainly possible given the small size of the GM butterfly and unavoidable partial volume effects, and sub-millimeter functional-to-anatomical warping inaccuracies caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities. (<b>D</b>) To investigate the possibility that WM masks contain fractions of GM voxels, and the impact of different regression masks on correlations between sub-regions, preprocessing was performed as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 except step #12 extracted the principal eigenvector of all time series within a combined WM and GM mask. Given the small size of each GM mask relative to its neighboring WM mask, the principal eigenvector from the combined mask (WM&amp;GM;) should be similar to only using WM. Indeed, regression with these modified eigenvectors produces similar group-level correlations between WM sub-regions and introduce weak negative correlations between GM sub-regions. In GM, positive correlations between ventral horns and between dorsal horns still persist after this more invasive regressor, providing further evidence that these strong temporally correlated fluctuations are unlikely to be caused by physiological motion or spatially-correlated noise. To further investigate the spatial extent of global fluctuations within GM, we repeated the preprocessing as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 but eroded the WM mask slightly before extracting the principal eigenvector. The results of this tertiary analysis (not shown) were slightly different but statistically similar to <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, demonstrating that voxels on and near the GM-WM boundary in fact characterize physiological fluctuations from both tissue types due to unavoidable partial volume effects and sub-millimeter warping inaccuracies. Overall, these supplementary analyses suggest that the preprocessing performed in the main manuscript (regression of the principal eigenvector from WM masks without erosion) is an appropriate strategy for suppressing extraneous fluctuations within both WM and GM without introducing substantial negative correlations between GM sub-regions.\u00a0Finally, power spectra for WM and GM sub-regions in (<b>C</b>) are presented in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>."

For each frequency the plotted power represents median power across slices and subjects. Within a range from 0.015 Hz to 0.075 Hz, ventral GM exhibits 32% more power than WM whereas dorsal GM exhibits only 5% more power. This difference in power between GM sub-regions may be explained through the preprocessing pipeline permutations presented in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> show comparable <i>z</i>-scores between ventral and dorsal GM horns, and this difference does not appear until after WM regression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) or WM&amp;GM; regression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Therefore, regression with this final eigenvector suppresses a larger contribution of signal fluctuations (and thus power) from dorsal GM than ventral GM, which may be attributed to the small size of the dorsal horns and partial volume averaging effects (because the WM mask is not eroded before PCA), as well as to unavoidable sub-millimeter registration inaccuracies. The large peak at \u223c0.75 Hz is likely due to physiological noise, so it could be argued that this noise power significantly affects the measurements of functional connectivity. To investigate this further and discount the possibility that our results are driven by physiological noise around 0.75 Hz, the analyses in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> are repeated after data are filtered with a narrower band-pass filter between 0.01 Hz and 0.07 Hz.

Low-frequency temporal correlations were observed between gray matter horns in all subjects, and examples of these correlations are presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Within a given axial slice, the strongest and most robust correlations were between left and right ventral horns. Correlations were also observed between left and right dorsal horns, and the reproducibility of correlations between ventral horns and between dorsal horns was demonstrated within a cohort of 22 healthy volunteers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Although correlations between ventral and dorsal gray matter were also observed at the single-subject level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>), such findings were less frequent and not statistically significant at the group level. The absence of group-level correlations between spinal gray matter and adjacent white matter showed that these positive gray matter correlations are unlikely to be driven by spatially-correlated physiological noise. In fact, supplementary analyses without CSF or white matter regressors (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>) revealed strong correlations within gray matter and within white matter but not between gray and white matter, suggesting that gray and white matter in the spinal cord may exhibit different degrees of physiological fluctuations. The main analyses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) also showed anticorrelations between white matter sub-regions. These observations were not unexpected because negative correlations are commonly seen in the brain (<a href=\"#bib18\">Chang and Glover, 2010</a>), but additional analyses (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) revealed that correlations within white matter were heavily influenced by preprocessing methodology. As a result, the nature of negative white matter correlations remains unclear and requires further investigation. However, predominantly positive correlations between dorsal white matter sub-regions persisted across preprocessing permutations. Although the origins of these positive white matter correlations remain to be determined, and whereas in general BOLD signals from activation have been difficult to detect in brain white matter, we note that Ding et al. recently reported the reliable detection of anisotropic correlations of resting state BOLD signals in brain white matter that appear to mimic white matter tracts identified by diffusion imaging methods (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ding et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the white matter sub-regions within the cord also tend to be close to draining veins."

There are several possible reasons for this finding. Firstly, the dorsal horns tend to be slightly narrower than the ventral horns, and thus may be more susceptible to registration inaccuracies, residual physiological noise, and partial volume averaging with adjacent white matter. Secondly, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, signal dropout and unavoidable artifacts affect the dorsal horns but not ventral horns in a few slices, which would bias the results in favor of ventral horn connectivity. Finally, even if spatial artifacts, registration inaccuracies, signal dropout, physiological noise, and partial volume averaging effects were minimized, it may be that functional connectivity between dorsal horns is more variable if the automated selection of gray matter sub-regions (step #14) isolate signals from different laminae within dorsal horns (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ruscheweyh and Sandk\u00fchler, 2002</a>)."

                        "text": "To date, clinical applications of task-based spinal fMRI studies have primarily been targeted to subjects with multiple sclerosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agosta et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2008b</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Valsasina et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2012</a>) and spinal cord injury (SCI) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stroman et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kornelsen and Stroman, 2007</a>). We propose that the non-invasive methods of resting state spinal cord functional connectivity developed in this paper may be most readily translatable to clinical investigations characterizing damage due to acute or chronic SCI and monitoring the efficacy of surgical or pharmacological interventions. Functional connectivity and the assessment of plasticity in the human spinal cord and animal models of SCI have been topics of intense research for many years (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bregman et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Raineteau and Schwab, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Freund et al., 2011</a>) because SCI affects 260,000 people in the United States (a prevalence of \u223c1 in 1200) with 11,000 new injuries reported each year (<a href=\"#bib6\">National Spinal Cord Injury Statistics Center, 2010</a>). Studies have investigated the role of propriospinal neurons in partial recovery from incomplete SCI (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bareyre, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Flynn et al., 2011a</a>) while in vitro analyses of functional connectivity in mouse spinal cord have relied on electrophysiological methods (<a href=\"#bib25\">Flynn et al., 2011b</a>). A new intervention strategy using epidural stimulation and stand training was recently developed that has to date restored voluntary movement in four patients with complete paralysis, demonstrating that functional connectivity across a lesion may be restored with epidural stimulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Angeli et al., 2014</a>). Such studies would likely benefit from an ability to assess the functional architecture of the spinal cord throughout therapy. The majority of spinal injuries are, however, incomplete, and lost function may eventually return to near-normal levels; however, the progression of functional recovery after incomplete SCI remains poorly understood due to the absence of a non-invasive method to reliably assess spinal cord connectivity in vivo. We propose that resting state acquisitions of the cervical spinal cord will become a valuable tool for characterizing changes in functional connectivity in SCI, and for the prognosis and monitoring of progression of recovery via spontaneous repair and/or surgical intervention. For example, the imaging volume (shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) may be centered on a focal injury to the cord, and functional connectivity above and below the injury may be assessed. This process with identical slice placement could then be repeated serially over time to investigate phenomena of neural plasticity and adaptation of spinal pathways. Moreover, even in normal subjects, the functional organization of the spinal cord is relatively under-explored and remains poorly understood. Observations of altered resting state connectivity in the brain in numerous disorders (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fox and Greicius, 2010</a>) and as a function of behavior or cognitive skills suggest that such correlations reflect an important level of organization and may play a fundamental role in the execution and maintenance of various functions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pizoli et al., 2011</a>). Thus, investigation of resting state spinal cord networks could similarly have widespread applicability in studying central nervous system diseases that affect motor and/or sensory pathways such as cervical spondylotic myelopathy, neuromyelitis optica, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, arachnoiditis, transverse myelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis."

                        "text": "Our study has three main limitations. Firstly, although we observed statistically significant correlations along the cord in single-subject analyses (for example, in left ventral gray matter in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we chose to constrain the group analysis to investigating connectivity within each axial slice. This was done because incorporating correlations along the cord would have made the analysis significantly more complicated by increasing the number of potential correlations by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, some slices exhibited regions of signal dropout at the dorsal edge caused by fat shift of the nerve root sleeve in the phase-encode (anterior-posterior) direction. The absence of a statistically significant correlation with a slice impacted by main field (B<sub>0</sub>) inhomogeneities or an artifact cannot in and of itself be interpreted as proof that connectivity does not exist between particular sub-regions of interest, and ultimately very careful single-subject analyses will need to be performed to reliably characterize functional connectivity along the cord. Secondly, although we have investigated one aspect of reproducibility (via a group analysis of 22 healthy volunteers) and established the existence of spinal cord functional connectivity, further investigations of within-subject reproducibility still need to be performed. This could be done by acquiring multiple resting state runs from a single scanning session and/or by scanning the same volunteer on multiple days while ensuring that the imaging volume is consistently placed in the same location (e.g., centered on the C3/C4 junction, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The reproducibility of these connectivity measures over months and years will need to be quantified before such techniques can be reliably used to study disease progression or gerontology. Thirdly, this study reports empirical findings of functional connectivity in the spinal cord but does not directly address the physiological origins of these low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations. However, as a point of reference, observations of functional connectivity were first reported in the brain nearly two decades ago (<a href=\"#bib13\">Biswal et al., 1995</a>) and yet the origin of these fluctuations is still a topic of intense discussion. Although the nature of resting state correlations is not fully understood, recent studies have combined tractography and functional imaging with techniques such as network analysis and graph theory to explore how these networks may have emerged (<a href=\"#bib21\">Deco et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mi\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Go\u00f1i et al., 2014</a>). The origin of resting state networks has also been explored within the context of evolution and the expansion of the cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Buckner and Krienen, 2013</a>). We therefore propose that because the spinal cord is an integral part of the central nervous system, one simple explanation is that low-frequency BOLD fluctuations in the brain and spinal cord share the same origin. This theory would then suggest that there may be long-range connections between networks in the spinal cord and cerebrum (and cerebellum), and future research should consider the nature of resting state networks not only within the brain but within the entire central nervous system."

At conventional field strengths (1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla), the lower signal-to-noise ratio and BOLD contrast limit the spatial resolution and sensitivity for detecting BOLD signals, so large voxels are typically used and multiple acquisitions are averaged. At 7 Tesla, high resolution BOLD acquisitions of the spinal cord have not evolved as rapidly as for the brain in part due to the widespread dependence on single-shot echo-planar acquisitions at lower fields and the lack of specialized coils to image the spinal cord. We addressed these challenges and limitations by using a 7 Tesla scanner, novel fMRI image acquisition and data correction protocols, and a dedicated 16-channel radiofrequency coil array designed for cord imaging. Our results are the first demonstrations of functional imaging of the human spinal cord at 7 Tesla (<a href=\"#bib11\">Barry et al., 2013a</a>) and high-resolution resting state functional connectivity in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib12\">Barry et al., 2013b</a>), and are likely to be of significant relevance in understanding basic aspects of spinal cord function both in normal development and in clinical disorders of the central nervous system."

The authors state in their response that they just wanted to show significant correlations (and they thus set all the non-significant ones to zero), but in my opinion this is obscuring part of the results. In the hypothetical worst case, all of these 16 correlations might be just below significance, which would call into question the specificity of their results. I'm not at all trying to suggest that this is the case but I would guess that the readers would like to judge for themselves how convincing the data are and it is thus essential to show these correlations as well, especially since spinal fMRI is still regarded with some scepticism. I am aware that the authors supplied the data that underlie <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, but I couldn't analyse them, as none of my browsers allowed a correct download of the .mat file.\u201d"

The correct analysis averages across slices within subject, and then performs the statistical test across subjects like any normal ROI-based analysis. There are several reasons why this analysis is not reasonable, but the most obvious is that the slices are not independent. Others include the fact that even if the slices were independent and heteroschedastically distributed, the nature of the random effect that would be inferred is not the population of individuals, but rather the population of slices.\u201d"

We processed these additional 12 data sets and combined the results with the previous 7 data sets, for an updated cohort of 19 healthy volunteers. If a sample size of approximately 20 should result in asymptotically reproducible results, then we believe that our new cohort of 19 subjects should provide robust results of functional connectivity."

Additional analyses were performed to measure temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) at two points along the processing pipeline: before and after the application of white matter and CSF \u201cregressors of no interest\u201d. We observed a 32% increase in mean TSNR between these two steps, demonstrating the importance of such regressors to characterize and remove structured noise sources."

The threshold for statistical significance in the group analysis was decreased significantly (from p &lt; 0.01 to p &lt; 10<sup>-6</sup>), and with this threshold our findings of gray matter connectivity between ventral horns and between dorsal horns are essentially unchanged. Furthermore, the observation that we obtain nearly identical results with a subset of 7 subjects (from the original group analysis) as with all 19 subjects (from the revised group analysis) adds an additional degree of confidence because this shows that our findings are relatively consistent across subjects and not driven by only one or a few subjects."
