Lunar cycles have dominated human culture for thousands of years, with the first lunar calendars generated by early civilizations. Although folklore and myths have long linked some aspects of human behavior to the lunar cycle (as seen in the many tales featuring werewolves), the actual effect of the moon on human physiology is still debated (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib2\">Foster and Roenneberg, 2008</a>). There is, however, clear evidence that the behavior of many animals is influenced by the moon. This is especially true for reef-building corals, where the process of spawning depends on lunar cycles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Harrison, 2011</a>)."

Most corals spawn by releasing gametes \u2013 egg and sperm cells \u2013 into the sea, where they combine and develop into larvae. To improve their chances of successfully reproducing, different corals often spawn simultaneously: a process known as mass spawning. On some parts of the Great Barrier Reef, for example, 20\u201330 coral species have been recorded spawning at the same time in the late spring and early summer, immediately after the full moon (<a href=\"#bib4\">Harrison et al., 1984</a>). However, we do not fully understand how external factors, such as moonlight, affect the molecular mechanisms inside the coral cells so that spawning can be harmonized."

A combination of field and outdoor aquaria observations revealed that the pattern of light exposure experienced by corals is fundamental for the synchronization of spawning. Indeed, of the colonies maintained in aquaria, only those exposed to natural conditions of daylight and moonlight spawned in a similar manner to those in the reef. Furthermore, the expression of genes linked to rhythmic processes and light sensing such as cryptochromes varied relative to the level of moonlight the corals were exposed to."

Now, Kaniewska\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0\u2013 who are based at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the University of Queensland, Tel Aviv University and Bar-Ilan University \u2013 suggest that gamete release in corals is triggered by a protein similar to a photosensitive molecule called melanopsin."

In mammals it has been shown that melanopsin plays a critical role in synchronizing circadian rhythms with the daily light-dark cycle. Moreover, melanopsin is capable of catalyzing the activation of G-proteins \u2013 proteins that help\u00a0transmit signals from outside a cell to the appropriate destination inside it \u2013 in response to changes in light conditions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brown and Robinson, 2004</a>). During moonlight, Kaniewska\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0observed the up-regulation of processes linked to a G-protein activation cascade in corals. This suggests that this pathway could be responsible for moonlight sensing. However, further research is needed to find out if the melanopsin-like proteins in corals are true photopigments."

Activating\u00a0G-protein coupled receptors induces an increase in the amount of calcium inside cells. However, Kaniewska\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0show that ion channels belonging to the transient receptor potential superfamily are also upregulated during spawning, providing another route by which calcium ions can enter cells."

However, molecular approaches must be complemented by investigations at the protein, cell and organism level to confirm the molecular data. Opportunities for future research into spawning include comparing how different coral species respond to moonlight and studying the effect of the light spectrum on gamete release."

Furthermore, we can also learn more about coral species that release larvae called planulae and for which spawning is less synchronized."
