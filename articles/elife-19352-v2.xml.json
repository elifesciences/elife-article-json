Here we show that seizures result in a severe hypoxic attack confined to the postictal period. We measured brain oxygenation in localized areas from freely-moving rodents and discovered a severe hypoxic event (pO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 10 mmHg) after the termination of seizures. This event lasted over an hour, is mediated by hypoperfusion, generalizes to people with epilepsy, and is attenuated by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channels. Using inhibitors of these targets we separated the seizure from the resulting severe hypoxia and show that structure specific postictal memory and behavioral impairments are the consequence of this severe hypoperfusion/hypoxic event. Thus, epilepsy is much more than a disease hallmarked by seizures, since the occurrence of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia results in a separate set of neurological consequences that are currently not being treated and are preventable."

Here we show that seizures result in a severe hypoxic attack confined to the postictal period. We measured brain oxygenation in localized areas from freely-moving rodents and discovered a severe hypoxic event (pO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 10 mmHg) after the termination of seizures. This event lasted over an hour, is mediated by hypoperfusion, generalizes to people with epilepsy, and is attenuated by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channels. Using inhibitors of these targets we separated the seizure from the resulting severe hypoxia and show that structure specific postictal memory and behavioral impairments are the consequence of this severe hypoperfusion/hypoxic event. Thus, epilepsy is much more than a disease hallmarked by seizures, since the occurrence of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia results in a separate set of neurological consequences that are currently not being treated and are preventable."

Because the brain is organized so that specific tasks happen in particular areas, seizures that affect areas of the brain that control movement are often followed by muscle weakness. Likewise, amnesia may follow a seizure that affects brain areas involved in memory. While these events reduce quality of life in people with epilepsy, they have gone untreated because we did not understand what occurs in the brain after seizures."

The experiments show that after an epileptic seizure, blood vessels become narrower, which reduces blood supply to the areas of the brain involved in the seizure and dramatically reduces oxygen levels in those same areas. Using drugs to block the activity of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2 or other proteins called L-type calcium channels prevented both the oxygen shortage and the behavioural impairments that follow seizures. Thus, people with epilepsy are experiencing stroke-like events after seizures that they should be able to avoid with simple medical treatments."

However, during neurological events when brain tissue oxygen levels fall below the severe hypoxic threshold (pO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a010 mmHg), neuronal dysfunction and behavioural disturbances are observed (<a href=\"#bib7\">Farrar, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">van den Brink et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</a>). Following termination of a seizure, behavioral impairments related to the specific brain structures that participated in the seizure are expressed (<a href=\"#bib29\">Leung et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gallmetzer et al., 2004</a>). Todd\u2019s Paresis, for example, specifically refers to moderate to severe motor weakness following seizures and typically subsides within a few hours (<a href=\"#bib54\">Todd, 1849</a>). The symptoms are so similar to ischemic stroke that Todd\u2019s paresis is often misdiagnosed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mathews et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Masterson et al., 2009</a>). The occurrence of these behavioral impairments have been attributed to the affected cortex being \u2018exhausted\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Franck and Pitres, 1878</a>) or silenced due to increased inhibition (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gowers, 1901</a>), but these conjectures are not supported. Despite being first described over 160 years ago, the cause of postictal behavioral disturbances has not been determined. A few case studies of persons experiencing Todd\u2019s paresis demonstrated that the affected cortex was inadequately perfused during this period (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mathews et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yarnell and Paralysis, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rupprecht et al., 2010</a>). Thus, we hypothesized that following termination of a seizure, a long-lasting and severe hypoxic episode would occur and manifest as behavioral dysfunction. This simple idea is intriguing, testable and provides a critical new insight into this broad reaching neurological disease by explaining some of the detrimental consequences associated with epilepsy. But to date, a continuous and detailed examination of local tissue oxygenation and blood flow following seizures has not been carried out."

It is well established that there is a dramatic, transient increase in blood flow during seizures (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gibbs et al., 1934</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Penfield et al., 1939</a>) with a corresponding decrease in oxygenation that quickly recovers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bahar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Suh et al., 2006</a>). The few studies that investigated changes in blood flow during the postictal period have not yielded consistent observations with reports of local hypoperfusion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rowe et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Newton et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Leonhardt et al., 2005</a>) and hyperperfusion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fong et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tatlidil, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hassan et al., 2012</a>). These inconsistencies were likely due to the variable time-points after the seizure when blood flow was measured. To circumvent this problem we systematically investigated local oxygen levels and blood flow following evoked and spontaneous seizures in rats and mice. We then relied on those results to guide our clinical study and used arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to measure postictal hypoperfusion following spontaneous seizures in people with epilepsy."

We reasoned that electrographic seizures would engage this system and lead to a pronounced vasoconstriction and subsequent severe hypoxia. Downstream of this, we anticipated that elevated free calcium in vascular smooth muscle, particularly calcium conducted by L-type channels (<a href=\"#bib41\">Putney and McKay, 1999</a>), would sustain this vasoconstriction. Here we demonstrate that blocking these pathways prevents postictal severe hypoperfusion/hypoxia and spotlights its contribution to postictal behavioral impairments."

The optode continuously recorded the partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub> in mmHg) in awake, freely-moving rats before, during and, most importantly, after brief electrographic seizures over several weeks. During typical behavioral states, hippocampal pO<sub>2</sub> levels vary within the normoxia range between 18 and 30 mmHg (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ereci\u0144ska and Silver, 2001</a>). 10\u00a0mmHg oxygen was chosen as the threshold for defining severe hypoxia since several independent studies have demonstrated that pO<sub>2</sub> levels at or below 10\u00a0mmHg cause significant changes to cellular physiology and brain injury. Hypoxia-dependent gene expression via Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 transcriptional activation occurs as an exponential function with respect to decreasing pO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jiang et al., 1996</a>). In a HeLa cell culture system, 10\u201315 mmHg was determined to be the half-maximal response and since the steep portion of the exponential curve is at lower pO<sub>2</sub> levels, most gene expression occurs below this threshold. Restricting middle cerebral artery blood flow in the cat led to cell death at a threshold of 7\u20138\u00a0mmHg (<a href=\"#bib7\">Farrar, 1991</a>). Furthermore, both the depth and duration of severe hypoxia following traumatic brain injury are good predictors for clinical outcome (<a href=\"#bib56\">van den Brink et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</a>). 10 min of pO<sub>2</sub> below 10\u00a0mmHg was associated with increased risk of death, and further increases with lower pO<sub>2</sub> and longer duration of severe hypoxia (<a href=\"#bib56\">van den Brink et al., 2000</a>). A systematic review of clinical traumatic brain injury found that 10\u00a0mmHg was a suitable threshold for defining severe hypoxia associated with worse outcomes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</a>). In defining tumor hypoxia, which is thought to exacerbate cancer pathophysiology, 8\u201310\u00a0mmHg is the suggested threshold (<a href=\"#bib18\">H\u00f6ckel and Vaupel, 2001</a>). Thus, 10\u00a0mmHg is a reasonable threshold for defining severe hypoxia and integrating the entire area below 10mmHg combines the depth and duration to reveal the total hypoxic burden."

Importantly, the postictal severe hypoxia is accompanied by reduced blood flow to 53.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3% relative to baseline between 40 and 60 min post-seizure. Furthermore, blood flow recovered on a similar time-scale to tissue oxygenation indicating that the postictal severe hypoxia is, in part, related to hypoperfusion."

Pre-treatment with the L-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine 30 min prior to seizure elicitation did not alter the afterdischarge duration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) indicating that nifedipine effects can be attributed to a neurovascular mechanism. We observed higher pO<sub>2</sub> levels at baseline (+9.0 mmHg, p&lt;0.01, paired ANOVA), throughout the postictal period, and an earlier return to baseline relative to vehicle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, nifedipine pre-treatment significantly attenuated the area below the severe hypoxic threshold (pO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a010 mmHg) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We also observed that nifedipine was effective at reducing postictal severe hypoxia when administered immediately following termination of the afterdischarge (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This is not surprising since L-type calcium channels play a key role in the tonic phase of vascular smooth muscle contraction (<a href=\"#bib41\">Putney and McKay, 1999</a>). These results provide key evidence that hypoxia is largely mediated by hypoperfusion and that L-type calcium channel activity plays a role in sustaining this response."

We then moved the 3 Hz stimulation protocol to an acute hippocampal slice preparation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) and imaged hippocampal arterioles in the synaptic layer of CA1 (stratum radiatum) before, during, and after Schaffer collateral stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>).

Poiseuille\u2019s law dictates that a 13.8% reduction in diameter would lead to blood flow that is 55.2% of baseline, which correlates well with our laser Doppler flowmetry measurements (53.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3% at 40\u201360 min, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Likewise, we also co-administered celecoxib and SC-560 to specifically and concurrently inhibit both enzymes. With both methods, inhibiting COX-1 and-2 achieved greater than 95% inhibition of severe hypoxia, similar to acetaminophen. This is of interest since COX-2 inhibition alone achieved a 67.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027.42% reduction in the severity of hypoxia and SC-560 had no significant effect. These results support a role for an interaction between COX-1 and COX-2, which has been demonstrated through COX-1/COX-2 heterodimer signaling (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yu et al., 2006</a>)."

Specific inhibitors for each of these pathways are not available, but we were able to target two of them: PGE2 and TXA2. We inhibited PGE2 synthesis with CAY-10526, which resulted in a\u00a0+\u00a041.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.94% reduction in the area below 10\u00a0mmHg. Disruption of TXA2 signaling by inhibiting its synthesis (ozagrel) or receptor (seratrodast) resulted in no significant change from vehicle. Thus, part of the COX-2 signaling pathway can be explained by PGE2 production."

Indeed, we observed a 45.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.44% decrease in the area below 10\u00a0mmHg with 2-APB pre-treatment. We then hypothesized that the rise in free calcium could activate protein kinase C (PKC), which can sustain vasoconstriction by inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase through CPI-17 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kitazawa et al., 2003</a>). However, PKC inhibition was unable to prevent severe postictal hypoxia. Furthermore, activating vasodilatory pathways by increasing cAMP (milrinone), (<a href=\"#bib7\">Farrar, 1991</a>) increasing cGMP (sildenafil), (<a href=\"#bib56\">van den Brink et al., 2000</a>) hyperpolarizing smooth muscle with IK<sub>Ca</sub> activator (SKA-31), (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</a>) preventing astrocytic release of potassium onto smooth muscle via BK<sub>Ca</sub> (paxilline), or (<a href=\"#bib29\">Leung et al., 2000</a>) increasing production of nitric oxide (L-arginine) provided no inhibition of postictal hypoxia. In fact, Rho Kinase inhibition with fasudil achieved the opposite effect and augmented postictal severe hypoxia perhaps by distributing blood flow to areas outside of the afterdischarge zone. Together, these data provide support for the inflexible nature of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia, which is not amenable to several vasodilatory treatments, and highlights the central roles COX-2 activation and the sustained calcium elevation in vascular smooth muscle."

Given the potential negative consequences of prolonged periods of severe local tissue hypoxia, an important question for us was whether the commonly prescribed ASDs modulate this phenomenon. Fortunately, using electrical kindling stimulation well above seizure threshold did not affect seizure duration following ASD treatment and allowed us to observe the effect of ASDs on postictal severe hypoxia without that confound. Acute dosing with commonly prescribed ASDs had no significant effect on postictal severe hypoxia when compared to vehicle treatment (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Interestingly, ethosuximide reduced the severity of hypoxia by 47.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.01%. Ethosuximide is used to treat absence seizures by inhibiting T-type calcium channels, but partial inhibition of L-type calcium channels has been reported (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kostyuk et al., 1992</a>)."

We hypothesized that the postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxic period would be responsible for motor impairment and that this impairment would also be confined to the hypoperfusion/hypoxic period. To test this, we used nifedipine as a tool to prevent postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia, allowing us to dissociate the effects of an afterdischarge from the combined effects of an afterdischarge with hypoperfusion/hypoxia on behavior. We targeted the corpus callosum at the level of the forelimb area of motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Teskey et al., 2002</a>) as the site to elicit bilateral afterdischarges. The hanging bar test was used to assess motor weakness. We first measured baseline hang time (standardized to 100%) and then elicited an afterdischarge. Hang time was repeatedly measured at 20, 40 and 80 min postictal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) whilst neocortical pO<sub>2</sub> was continuously recorded throughout. As expected, pretreatment with nifedipine prevented the expression of postictal severe hypoxia without affecting seizure duration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Although severely hypoxic at both the 20- and 40 min time-point, the vehicle-treated seizure group displayed a significantly shorter hang time at 40 min postictal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that the duration of severe hypoxia is important for the generation of behavioral deficits. At 80 min post-afterdischarge, the non-treated group's pO<sub>2</sub> levels returned to normoxia and the behavioral performance was equivalent to nifedipine treated and non-seizure groups. These results indicate that it is the postictal severe hypoxic period that is responsible for the motor weakness, not the seizure per se."

Since rats prefer to explore the novel object more frequently, a preference for the novel object indicates a memory was formed for the familiar object. Rats that were severely hypoxic at the time of memory encoding (seizure+vehicle, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) explored the novel and familiar objects with no significant preference 24 hr later, which indicates that they were unable to form the memory during the postictal severe hypoxia (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Moreover, the rats that had seizures without severe hypoxia (acetaminophen pre-treatment) performed at the same level as controls (acetaminophen or vehicle without seizures). These results, along with the ability of nifedipine to prevent Todd\u2019s paresis, support the hypothesis that severe hypoxia following seizures, and not the seizures themselves, are the underlying cause of these specific postictal impairments."

We also demonstrated significant post-ictal hypoperfusion in 8 of 10 patients. The reasons why two subjects did not exhibit significant post-ictal hypoperfusion are unclear, but could relate to the brief duration of their seizures and/or patient heterogeneity. In rodents we identified COX-2 activity during afterdischarges as a central player in mediating this pathophysiological response. Inhibiting COX-2 or restoring perfusion with the potent vasodilator, nifedipine, prevented ensuing severe hypoxia and averted postictal behavioral impairments. Thus, brief seizures initiate a local and long-lasting hypoperfusion/hypoxic insult, which is responsible for behavioral dysfunction in the postictal period rather than the seizure itself."

This discordance is most likely explained by the variable timing of the single postictal scans. In our rat models we observed the most severe hypoxia occurred between 20\u201360 min post-seizure thus we performed clinical postictal scans in this time window and observed dramatic local hypoperfusion. Importantly, only those previous studies that imaged during this period observed hypoperfusion, which highlights the importance of timing with this phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rowe et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Newton et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Leonhardt et al., 2005</a>).

Laser Doppler flowmetry was used for in vivo recordings, which is an indirect measure of blood perfusion. However, we used this system in conjunction with our highly accurate pO<sub>2</sub> recordings in the same region of the hippocampus and observed hypoperfusion and hypoxia that display similar kinetics. For a more direct measure of vasoconstriction, we used acute hippocampal slices and observed the diameter of local arterioles. The conditions in slice differ substantially from in vivo conditions and this could potentially alter the results. However, the degree of constriction observed in slice predicts a similar change in blood perfusion to what we observed with laser Doppler flowmetry. Furthermore, the vasoconstriction following seizure stimulation in slice was sensitive to acetaminophen and nifedipine, which supports the notion that this constriction follows the same set of mechanisms that occur in vivo. In conjunction with the clinical observations of hypoperfusion, these data support the central role of hypoperfusion in the generation of severe hypoxia in the postictal period."

The longest of these recordings included 30 s of postictal oxygen sampling and took place under ketamine anesthesia, which dramatically reduces neurovascular coupling by inhibiting NMDA-dependent COX-2 activation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tran and Gordon, 2015</a>). It is therefore unsurprising that postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia was not identified in these studies. One group discovered hypoxyprobe-positive neurons following pilocarpine-induced SE and during the period of recurrent spontaneous seizures (three weeks post SE), which they attributed to the hypoxic dip that occurs during seizures (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gualtieri et al., 2013</a>). We also observed a transient dip in oxygenation at seizure onset, but the duration of this dip is dwarfed by the prolonged period of severe hypoxia during the postictal period and likely accounts for hypoxyprobe labeling."

We also tested commonly prescribed anti-seizure medications since it would be informative to know which of these medications potentially inhibit, or more importantly, exacerbate postictal severe hypoxia in patient populations. Most drugs, including anti-seizure medications, failed to modulate this postictal severe hypoxia, which we believe emphasizes that this is a pathological phenomenon and that breakthrough seizures while on antiseizure medications do not directly protect against this insult."

Indeed, with genetic or pharmacological COX-2 inhibition, seizure-induced brain damage can be dramatically reduced (<a href=\"#bib48\">Serrano et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kunz and Oliw, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hewett et al., 2006</a>).

The technology (Oxylite, Oxford Optronics,\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom) does not consume oxygen while measuring absolute pO<sub>2</sub> values. The manufacturer individually calibrates each biologically inert probe, called an optode. The implantable system was designed by JFD in collaboration with Oxford Optronics. The implant is inserted under isoflurane anesthesia. We allow at least seven days between implantation and initiation of measurements to ensure that the effects of acute trauma were minimized. pO<sub>2</sub> measurements at 1 Hz can then be made at any time by connecting the implant to the Oxylite using an extension fiber optic lead. The probe provides accurate and continuous measurements of local pO<sub>2</sub> levels in brain tissue in <i>awake, freely moving animals</i> over several weeks. We used this innovative technology to precisely measure oxygen levels before, during and, most importantly, after seizures. Unlike most animal studies, we were able to perform these measurements without the confounding effect of anesthesia."

Acetaminophen, nifedipine, bumetanide, ethosuximide, phenytoin, and valproic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Lamotrigine was obtained from SelleckChem\u00a0(Houston,\u00a0TX). Fasudil was obtained from LC laboratories\u00a0(Woburn,\u00a0MA) and phenobarbital was obtained from Strathcona Prescription Center\u00a0(Canada). Lipophilic drugs were dissolved in 100% DMSO, while hydrophilic drugs were dissolved in saline and injected 30 min prior to seizure induction. The seizure duration and severity of hypoxia (area below 10\u00a0mmHg) were compared across kindle (seizure without injection), vehicle-, and drug-treated groups using a within-subject ANOVA and follow-up t-test between vehicle- and drug-treated groups."

Hippocampal slices were prepared as previously described (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). In brief, rats were initially anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation in air prior to decapitation. Brains were rapidly dissected from the skull and placed in ice-cooled cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 210 sucrose, 10 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.02 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26.19 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 4\u00b0C. Transverse hippocampal slices (370 \u00b5m) were sectioned with a vibratome (Leica VT1200,\u00a0Germany) in cutting solution as described above. Slices were transferred and incubated in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 5KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 glucose for 1 hr at 33\u00b0 to 35\u00b0C incubator. Slices were then kept at room temperature prior to visualization of hippocampal blood vessels. Visualization of hippocampal blood vessels were performed using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope. Vascular lumen diameter was measured using transverse hippocampal slices following 2 min of 3 Hz stimulation applied to Schaffer collaterals in rat hippocampus continuously perfused with ACSF. Hippocampal blood vessels were observed for 2 to 2.5 hr to determine changes in lumen diameter. For experiments involving acetaminophen and nifedipine, 100 \u03bcM acetaminophen or 50 \u03bcM nifedipine was added to the ACSF, respectively. Slices were pre-incubated with acetaminophen or nifedipine via continuous perfusion for 30 min prior to stimulation. Lumen diameter was measured before and after stimulation and percentage changes in diameter were calculated to determine vascular constriction. Sham stimulation and vehicle (0.1% DMSO) were utilized as control experiments."

Rats recovered for at least a week before experimental procedures were initiated. Rats were introduced to and allowed to explore the testing apparatus before data were obtained. They were permitted to escape to the ends of the rod during this period but the escape routes were blocked off during testing. This served to increase motivation since rats will acclimatize to the task. The test was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hunter et al., 2000</a>), but with modifications. The two forepaws were placed on steel bar with a diameter of 5.0 mm that was suspended from a height of 45 cm. Rats were allowed to hang for a maximum of 45 s and then gently removed to reduce their fatigue for subsequent trials. Each test consisted of the mean of three trials. Nifedipine (15 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected into rats on the first day and the other treatment on the following day. Rats were tested immediately before a seizure (or sham) to establish a baseline and then connected to the EEG and oxygen recording system to elicit and record a seizure, using standard kindling stimulation. In the sham condition, rats did not previously undergo surgery. We then tested at 20, 40, and 80 min after a seizure (or sham). Each group was compared to its own baseline using a one-way ANOVA and Dunnett\u2019s Multiple Comparison Test to identify a deficit."

Rats then went through the novel object recognition task paradigm (<a href=\"#bib4\">Clark et al., 2000</a>), with modifications. Following recovery from surgery, rats were habituated to the environment on the morning of day 1. In the afternoon, rats were injected with vehicle or acetaminophen (250 mg/kg i.p.) to permit or prevent hypoxia following a seizure, respectively. After 30 min rats were stimulated with kindling stimulation and both EEG and local tissue oxygenation were sampled. We confirmed that acetaminophen prevented hypoxia in the rats that received it and did not affect seizure duration, suggesting we have a clear dissociation. Rats were disconnected from the data acquisition system at 45 min postictal and transferred to the testing chamber where they were introduced to two identical objects and allowed to explore them for 5 min. Rats were returned to their home cage and brought back to the testing chamber 24 hr later. This time, a familiar object and a novel object (which differed in color, size, and texture) were introduced and the rats were allowed to explore the objects for 5 min. The position of the objects and type of objects were counter-balanced to account for rat\u2019s preference not related to memory. If rats adequately form the memory for the two identical objects on day 1, they should spend more time exploring the novel object on day 2. Each session was videotaped and the duration spent investigating each object was measured. Investigation includes orienting the snout within 2 cm of the object, but not sitting on the object."

Using EEG, focal oxygen recordings, and laser Doppler flowmetry, the authors demonstrate that the evoked and spontaneous seizures caused a dramatic reduction in local tissue oxygenation and blood perfusion in three different models of seizures: rat model kindling, maximum electroshock, and 3Hz electrical stimulation seizures. The study is significant since it seems to resolve a significant uncertainty in the field. Previous data have implicated hypoxia in seizure mechanisms, but the findings were in human and thus do not benefit from the better physiological control and mechanistic studies as presented here in the animal model. Moreover, there are also previous human studies that do not observe post-seizure hypoxia, perhaps due to the variable nature of the seizure phenomenon. The study is technically elegant since the authors use sensitive and complementary measures of brain blood flow, which indicate severe ischemia following seizure. The authors compare the animal studies with studies of human patients and demonstrate similar hypoxic and hypoperfusion events in a clinical study of patients with epilepsy. Moreover, employing pharmacological experiments, the investigators demonstrate that the blockade of cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channels alleviates the seizure-induced hypoxia, hypoperfusion, as well as the resulting post-ictal behavioral impairments. The study suggests that it is possible to separately treat the seizure event and the hypoxic event. This is a clinically significant discovery and the fact that animal studies were combined with the human studies makes this an interesting paper for a general readership."

This measure results in a threshold change for defining hypoxia. This measurement is potentially misleading because many of the treatments are only partially protective and seizures still produce a reduction in PO2, but not all the way to 10mm Hg partial pressure of O2. To make the manuscript more balanced, the authors should remove this thresholding of hypoxia at 10mm of mercury. In cases where area under the curve is presented, the entire area under the curve should be considered not just whether there is a component, which is below 10mm of mercury.

We suggest to add more n's and ideally the effect of the various pharmacological manipulations should be extended to blood flow to confirm that these treatments are not just affecting the utilization of O2 by tissue.

Note, that in this case the slices are well-stimulated, but not necessarily ischemic. Moreover, the authors are also unable to determine the identity of the vessels within the slice they are examining. Are these arterioles or veins? Thus, the reviewers are not convinced that the authors can conclude a vasoconstriction mechanism without also adding an in vivo measure (2-photon). The authors should discuss this issue as a caveat of the in vitro experiments."

While relative oxygen recordings can show the magnitude of changes, the importance of absolute pO2 is not properly captured in those measurements. Moreover, the physiological relevance of absolute pO2, particularly below 10mmHg, dramatically outweighs what is learned by measuring relative changes from baseline. For example, if Rat A has a seizure and local brain oxygen decreases from a baseline of 30mmHg to 10mmHg in the postictal period, then Rat A has a net change of 20mmHg. If Rat B has a baseline of 20mmHg and also decreases by 20mmHg, then Rat B is completely anoxic. The total area below baseline pO2 would be identical in Rat A and B (assuming kinetics are the same), but we know from the absolute pO2 values that Rat B is subjected to a much more extreme physiological stressor with molecular and behavioural consequences."

We have noted much greater variability in baseline oxygenation (within and between animals) than postictal hypoxia. This variability is seen in our mean oxygen profiles where the error bars at baseline or recovery of oxygenation are 2-3 times greater than during severe hypoxia. This problem introduces a large degree of variability in the area below baseline analysis since baseline oxygen can vary by a wide margin. This becomes especially critical for between subject comparisons where baseline pO2 can vary by more than 15mmHg across animals. For example, the strong positive correlation between seizure duration and area below 10mmHg (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) is lost when we convert to area below baseline (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1A</a>, p=0.99). Instead, area below baseline is substantially dependent on baseline pO2 (p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, a change small change (3-5mmHg) in the level oxygenation during severe hypoxia has greater physiological significance than at baseline (see additions to manuscript)."

As a thought experiment, if we were to change the threshold to 15mmHg, nifedipine has the ability to inhibit postictal hypoxia (78.82 \u00b1 7.632% reduction of AB10 vs. 69.16 \u00b1 8.577% reduction of AB15 relative to vehicle). However, when we take the entire area below baseline (acknowledging the caveats described above), nifedipine has no effect (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2A</a>). This is troubling since administering nifedipine after the seizure dramatically inhibits the area below baseline (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2B</a>). Since the area below 10mmHg does not differ between pre- and post-treatment with nifedipine (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), but the area below baseline does, this highlights the susceptibility of area below baseline analysis to changes in baseline pO2."
