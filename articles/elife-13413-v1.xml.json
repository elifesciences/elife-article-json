Here we investigate the mechanism for the channel's unusual regulation by external calcium, and rationalize this behavior to its specialized function. We report that the human PKD2-L1 selectivity filter is partially selective to calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) moving into the cell, but blocked by high internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations, a unique feature of this transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family member. Surprisingly, we find that the C-terminal EF-hands and coiled-coil domains do not contribute to PKD2-L1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced potentiation and inactivation. We propose a model in which prolonged channel activity results in calcium accumulation, triggering outward-moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to block PKD2-L1 in a high-affinity interaction with the innermost acidic residue (D523) of the selectivity filter and subsequent long-term channel inactivation. This response rectifies Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow, enabling Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter but not leave small compartments such as the cilium."

Here we investigate the mechanism for the channel's unusual regulation by external calcium, and rationalize this behavior to its specialized function. We report that the human PKD2-L1 selectivity filter is partially selective to calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) moving into the cell, but blocked by high internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations, a unique feature of this transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family member. Surprisingly, we find that the C-terminal EF-hands and coiled-coil domains do not contribute to PKD2-L1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced potentiation and inactivation. We propose a model in which prolonged channel activity results in calcium accumulation, triggering outward-moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to block PKD2-L1 in a high-affinity interaction with the innermost acidic residue (D523) of the selectivity filter and subsequent long-term channel inactivation. This response rectifies Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow, enabling Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter but not leave small compartments such as the cilium."

                        "text": "Polycystic kidney disease proteins (PKDs), or polycystins (PC), are divided into two distinct gene families. The four PKD1 members (PKD1, PKD1-L1, PKD1-L2, PKD1-L3) are large proteins (~1700\u20134300 amino acids) with 11 putative transmembrane segments (TM) and a large autocleaved N-terminal extracellular domain. In contrast, the three PKD2 members are often included in the TRP ion channel family because they have 6 TM domains and a putative selectivity filter loop between TM5 and TM6 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ramsey et al., 2006</a>). These include PKD2, (PC2, TRPP1; formerly TRPP2), PKD2-L1 (PC2-L1, TRPP2; formerly TRPP3) and PKD2-L2 (PC2-L2, TRPP3, formerly TRPP5) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). Members of the PKD1 and PKD2-subfamilies are often reported to associate in the plasma membrane, although the nature of these complexes is not understood. PKD1 + PKD2 were purported to form mechanosensitive ion channels in the primary cilia of kidney collecting duct epithelia (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nauli and Zhou, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nauli et al., 2003</a>), a hypothesis that has recently been challenged (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Delling et al., 2016</a>). In humans, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with loss-of-function mutations in genes that encode for either PKD1 or PKD2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wu and Somlo, 2000</a>). Complete loss of either <i>Pkd1</i> or <i>Pkd2</i> in mice results in embryonic lethality with defects in formation of the kidney, pancreas and heart (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boulter et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wu et al., 2000</a>). As in human ADPKD, adult <i>Pkd2<sup>WS25/\u2013</sup></i> mice have kidney cysts, renal failure, and die early (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wu et al., 2000</a>). PKD1-L1 + PKD2-L1 heteromers form a calcium channel complex in the primary cilia from embryonic fibroblasts and retinal pigmented epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>). Mice lacking <i>Pkd2-L1</i> exhibit a form of heterotaxy (intestinal malrotation) in ~50% of offspring, suggesting that the channel modulates the ciliary Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) pathway during early development (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delling et al., 2013</a>). A putative PKD1-L3 + PKD2-L1 channel was reported in mouse taste buds and proposed to be the acid receptor required for sour taste (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kawaguchi et al., 2010</a>), but <i>Pkd2-L1</i> knockout mice do not appear to have a deficit in sour taste perception (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nelson et al., 2010</a>)."

Information about the physiological function of the endogenous homomeric PKD2-L1 is sparse. Emerging evidence suggests that single channel openings of homomeric PKD2-L1 channels are sufficiently large (&gt;100 pS) to generate action potentials in the medullo-spinal cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) located in the ependymal layer of the brainstem (<a href=\"#bib30\">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Orts-Del'immagine et al., 2012</a>). Since channels containing PKD2-L1 subunits are constitutively-active and calcium-permeant, dysregulation of their activity could lead to aberrant cytoplasmic calcium regulation, especially in smaller compartments such as the primary cilia of epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>), the dendritic bulb of cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2014</a>) and the apical processes of the type III taste receptors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ishimaru et al., 2010</a>). Based on results using GCaMP3-targeted calcium sensors and current clamp recordings, primary cilia membranes were depolarized and had higher resting calcium concentrations (~ \u221220 mV, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> ~700 nM) compared to the cell body (-50 mV, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> &lt; 100 nM) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delling et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, the endogenous PKD1-L1 + PKD2-L1 channel complex inactivates in response to high cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] when measured directly from the primary cilium (IC<sub>50</sub> =540 nM) (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>). When measured through heterologous co-expression, the PKD1-L3 + PKD2-L1 channel was initially activated, then inactivated by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (5\u201310\u2009mM) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2015</a>), which was also observed when homomeric PKD2-L1 channels were expressed in in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1999</a>). It is unclear if calcium regulates the channels composed of PKD2-L1 directly or indirectly through an internal or external binding site."

We first confirm previous studies that PKD2-L1 is modestly voltage-dependent (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shimizu et al., 2009</a>) and show that this voltage dependence is independent of any divalent ion blocking mechanism. We then demonstrate that PKD2-L1 inactivation is initiated by the accumulation of internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Surprisingly, we find that removal of the cytoplasmic EF-hands and coiled-coil motifs do not alter PKD2-L1 inactivation. We observe that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions conduct inwardly through the selectivity filter of PKD2-L1, whereas outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance blocks the channel, followed by long-term inactivation. This type of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence appears to be unique to PKD2-L1 among TRP channels tested to date and is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination with D523 in the selectivity filter, which is also the site responsible for divalent metal and trivalent lanthanide metal block."

To separate rectification due to divalent ion block (<a href=\"#bib41\">Voets et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Nadler et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lucas et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Topala et al., 2007</a>) from intrinsic voltage dependence, we first examined human PKD2-L1 in symmetrical 144\u2009mM [Na<sup>+</sup>] in the absence of divalent ions (free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> &lt;1 nM, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

However, the steady-state current (I<sub>ss</sub>) measured after the tail current decay outwardly rectified at potentials above +50 mV.

However, single channel amplitudes appear to remain constant over the time course of the pulse, indicating a lack of fast (flicker) block (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Also, replacing Na<sup>+</sup> by K<sup>+</sup> did not change the current amplitude or rate of decay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Although we cannot rule out a site that binds and blocks all inward monovalent cations, we argue that the most likely interpretation is that the channel simply deactivates after hyperpolarization (see Discussion). It is important to note that the onset of the PKD2-L1 tail current is very fast (&lt;120 \u03bcs, data not shown), without an obvious \u2018hook\u2019 to indicate overlapping activation and inactivation time courses as observed in delayed rectifying potassium channels (hERG and Kv3.1b) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Labro et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Vandenberg et al., 2012</a>). The tail currents of PKD2-L1 are unusual compared to other cation-nonselective TRP channels. For example, currents conducted by TRPM7 are ohmic and do not decay upon membrane hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, TRPM7 becomes outwardly rectifying when calcium is added to the external sodium solution (and, as is well-known for TRPM6/7, blocked by internal Mg<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Topala et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2007</a>), indicating that TRPM7 rectifies in the presence of a physiological level of extracellular calcium, and possibly other divalent ions."

To examine calcium\u2019s modulation of the current under physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, we expressed human PKD2-L1 and measured PKD2-L1 currents under voltage clamp in 2\u2009mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>. As with high external calcium, PKD2-L1 current was initially potentiated but, interestingly, was then completely and apparently irreversibly inactivated over 8\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). During the voltage ramp, we observed a negative shift of E<sub>rev</sub> from 8 to 0 mV, reflecting a loss in the available calcium-permeable PKD2-L1 channels and/or a shift in the ion composition of the patched cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Similar shifts in equilibrium potentials due to accumulation of internal cations have been reported for cells overexpressing P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2015</a>). Since potentiation (4\u2009min) and inactivation (8\u2009min) were slow, we hypothesized that internal accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> could account for the delayed onset of both. We integrated the tail currents triggered by \u221260 mV repolarizations to estimate the number of calcium ions accumulating within the cell (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>). We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> moving through PKD2-L1 saturates the internal calcium buffers (5\u2009mM BAPTA and intrinsic) and accumulates to concentrations &gt;10\u2009\u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The time course of BAPTA saturation by PKD2-L1-mediated increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs after 4\u2009min, suggesting that internal calcium accumulation is responsible for channel inactivation. Consistent with these observations, we varied internal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and observed that cells patched with high initial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (\u2265 450 nM) inactivates 1\u20134 min sooner than cells patched with lower internal free-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (\u2264 100 nM; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Finally, when the buffering strength is increased (15\u2009mM BAPTA, 5\u2009mM EGTA), PKD2-L1 currents potentiate, but do not inactivate, over a 10\u2009min time course (black trace, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

The C-terminus of PKD2-L1 contains an oligomerization domain (OD, 588\u2013608) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2015</a>), putative EF-hands (633\u2013665) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2002</a>) and a coiled-coil domain (CC, 690\u2013737) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yu et al., 2012</a>). We generated truncations above and below each of the C-terminal motifs to determine their effect on channel function (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We found that the most drastic truncation, located before the first coiled-coil domain (Stop-588), abolished PKD2-L1 channel function (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Surface expression of the 588-Stop C-terminal cleavage mutant was unaltered in comparison to Wt PKD2-L1, as assayed by membrane biotinylation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The intact OD might be critical for channel function or be a subunit oligomerization site, as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zheng et al., 2015</a>). However, truncating the PKD2-L1 channel just after the OD domain (Stop-608), or before and after the EF-hands and coiled-coil domain, did not alter normal current density or voltage dependence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013E</a>). With the exception of the 508-stop truncation, all truncations were potentiated, then inactivated in normal intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

When measuring the voltage dependence of the PKD2-L1 channel under physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, we observed that PKD2-L1 channels exhibit a biphasic current-voltage relationship, in which the outward current decreases at potentials beyond the reversal potential for calcium (E<sub>Ca</sub>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By altering extracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>), we noted that net nonselective outward current always declined positive to E<sub>Ca\u00a0</sub>(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Repetition of the protocol demonstrated that PKD2-L1 channels had completely inactivated; that is, PKD2-L1 currents could no longer be elicited during the recording period (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This data suggests that outward PKD2-L1 currents were stably blocked and/or inactivated by outward moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. We tested TRPM7, TRPV1, and TRPV3 for similar behavior and found that none of their outward currents exhibited this biphasic dependence (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, TRPV1 data not shown). Comparing the PKD2-L1 outward current to the inward tail current elicited by repolarization to \u221260 mV (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we observed that the outward current was blocked, whereas the inward tail current remained relatively constant. These observations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced block and subsequent inactivation of all outward current, while inward flux was unimpeded. To examine this phenomenon, we used a voltage protocol designed to capture the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- dependent block and inactivation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). A series of voltage clamp steps 10\u201330 mV negative to E<sub>Ca</sub> were applied so that inward tail currents and outward currents were stable over time. Thus, inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> could permeate PKD2-L1 without blocking or inactivating the channel. Then, the depolarization step was increased to 28\u201342 mV more positive than E<sub>Ca</sub>, where the outward currents were immediately blocked by outwardly moving calcium ions. In contrast, tail currents triggered by repolarization to -60 mV were not immediately blocked, but progressively decreased after each depolarization positive to E<sub>Ca</sub>, indicating that the inward PKD2-L1 currents were not long-term- inactivated until after the outward current was blocked by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. By plotting the sum of the durations of the depolarization steps positive to E<sub>Ca</sub> against the tail current magnitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), we estimated the rate of inactivation, \u03c4<sub>inact</sub> \u2248 2\u2009s (1.8 \u00b1 0.2\u2009s; 2.1 \u00b1 0.2\u2009s; 1.7 \u00b1 0.2\u2009s for the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> conditions 10\u2009\u03bcM, 1\u00a0mM and 20\u2009mM respectively)."

Thus, we sought to reduce the affinity for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination sites within the selectivity filter to relieve the outward current block by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and thus reduce inactivation. We previously reported that the PKD2-L1 conductance could be abolished by double serine or alanine mutations, to Asp523 and Asp525 (D523S:D525S or D523A:D525A), whereas mutation of Asp530 (D530N)\u00a0did not alter the conductance (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>). We also tested individual alanine substitutions to either position (data not shown), which also abolished the PKD2-L1 conductance. These data suggest that residues D523 and D525 are critical positions within the PKD2-L1 selectivity filter. Since D523 is the most conserved residue among the PKD2 family members, we propose that it is essential for block, inactivation, and its modest Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Since asparagine (Asn, N) has a similar volume (\u2248 11 nM (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nauli and Zhou, 2004</a>)) but its carboxamide side chain is not as electronegative as the carboxylate found in the native aspartate (Asp, D), we generated individual substitutions of Asn for D523 and D525. We found that at similar current densities, D523N mutant-associated currents did not inactivate over an 8\u2009min time course, whereas D525N currents first potentiated and then inactivated similar to the Wt channel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To determine if the D523N mutations altered outward Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation, we used the same depolarization protocol as used in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and observed that the outward peak and inward tail currents were stable over time and potential, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not block or inactivate the D523N current (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Furthermore, the voltage dependence of the D523N outward current is not biphasic at potentials more positive to E<sub>Ca</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Calcium binding proteins like calmodulin often bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant ion channels and alter their function (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Johny et al., 2015</a>). Calcium coordinating motifs within channel proteins, such as cytoplasmic EF-hands found in voltage gated Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, alter channel inactivation based on localized calcium accumulation. Here, we have shown a direct mechanism of calcium regulation of the PKD2-L1 channel, in which outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds in the selectivity filter and initiates inactivation of the channel. Calcium and other ions pass inwardly through the PKD2-L1 channel as long as the electrochemical gradient permits; when channel densities are high, this is sufficient to significantly shift internal ion concentrations as seen by the slowly shifting E<sub>rev</sub>. However, depolarizations above E<sub>Ca</sub> lead to channel block and inactivation (as proposed in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). To our knowledge, this is the only reported ion channel with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent rectification due to pore block-inactivation, and so far is unique to PKD2-L1."

Thus far, the proposed mechanism(s) by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits TRP channels are indirect, such as with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-depletion, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated kinases, phosphatases, and phospholipases, via both calmodulin-dependent and independent processes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gordon-Shaag et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhu, 2005</a>). We showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy in the filter blocks the outward PKD2-L1 current and triggers its long-term inactivation. Although mutating the selectivity filter of TRPA1 (D918) can abolish extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potentiation and inactivation, the effect of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on these processes follows elevation of intracellular calcium and is proposed to operate through an indirect, unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). For PKD2-L1, outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inactivates the channel after binding within the selectivity pore. Although we cannot rule out allosteric modulation by calmodulin or kinases during inactivation, involvement of the C-terminal EF-hand and coiled-coil are unlikely since no effect was observed on inactivation when these motifs were removed. Likewise, for the TRPA1 channel, removing the EF-hands did little to alter the onset of potentiation and inactivation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). Our observations from our PKD2-L1 EF-hands truncation are in agreement with results from the PKD2-L1 splice variants expressed in the liver, where a naturally occurring C-terminal EF-hand truncation is found to have no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2002</a>). Thus if C-terminal modulation is involved, the location for binding of a modulator would have to be located above the oligomerization domain, which appears to be critical for PKD2-L1 function, as the trafficking of the Stop-588 mutant was the same as the full length channel."

Once occupied by outwardly moving calcium ions, the PKD2-L1 channels irreversibly inactivates in seconds (\u03c4 = 2.1\u2009s). Thus our results explain the inactivation phenomenon observed in Chen et al. (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1999</a>) and describe a direct level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback inhibition of the PKD2-L1 channel. Given that cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ranges from 50 nM to as high as 10 \u00b5M (near mouths of channels), what is the physiological relevance of outward calcium current regulation in PKD2-L1 channels? Because of the cell\u2019s large volume (typically 1\u20133 pL), it is unlikely that the concentration of calcium in the cytosol would ever reach sufficient concentrations to move outwardly through PKD2-L1 channel and trigger inactivation. However, because PKD2-L1 channels have large inward conductances (PKD2-L1: 120\u2013150 pS and PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1 = 86 pS) (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shimizu et al., 2009</a>) with modest selectivity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> PKD2-L1 and PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1 = 6\u201315) (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shimizu et al., 2009</a>), the expression of just a few channels (1\u201310) in small cellular compartments could result in large changes in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. For example, the homomeric PKD2-L1 is enriched in the membrane of the dendritic nob of CSF contacting neurons, which have small volumes (113 fL) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2016</a>). Here, PKD2-L1\u2019s alkaline-pH-stimulated channel activity (P<sub>o</sub> = 0.02) would increase the dendritic nob cytoplasmic calcium by \u2248 22\u2009\u03bcM per channel opening. In smaller compartments, like the primary cilium (0.5 fL), where roughly 30 heteromeric PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1 channels are expressed, ATP stimulation (P<sub>o</sub> = 0.01) would increase the cilioplasmic calcium by \u2248 31\u2009\u03bcM per channel opening. Thus, prolonged PKD2-L1 (or PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1) channel openings could result in increases in cellular compartment [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] up to the external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Most important, we hypothesize that PKD2-L1 maintains Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the 500 -700 nM range observed in primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nelson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wu et al., 2000</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, entering Ca<sup>2+</sup> transiently potentiates PKD2-L1 up to ~750 nM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>In</sub> - above this level, inhibition dominates. This behavior would serve as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] clamp, a feedback mechanism that counteracts Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss via diffusion into the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This mechanism would ensure that the primary cilium is a specialized calcium compartment, even though no calcium diffusion barrier exists between cilium and cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nelson et al., 2010</a>). However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers and intrinsic buffers present in each compartment are not known, limiting a more detailed interpretation of this mechanism."

Independent substitutions of the aspartate filter residues 523 and 525 with asparagine resulted in a significant reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selectivity, while independent alanine substitutions for either residue resulted in a non-conducting channel. Based on these observations we propose that this unique calcium conductance is achieved with two ion coordinating sites involving filter residues D523 and D525. We speculate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> unidirectional conductance is achieved by a \u2018knock-on\u2019 ionic interaction, where the outer residue (D525) coordinates Ca<sup>2+</sup> with weaker affinity than the inner residue (D523). In this model, the interaction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with D523 is broken by repulsion by a second Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupying the outer D525. When the membrane potential is more depolarized than E<sub>Ca</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupies the high-affinity binding site (D523). Since there is no inner Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinating site to electrostatically \u2018knock-off\u2019 Ca<sup>2+</sup> from D523, it is not displaced from this site and outward current is blocked. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not block the D523N channel, we propose that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is able to move in both directions in the mutant channel\u2019s selectivity filter (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This effect can be explained by the loss of the high-affinity binding site within the innermost portion of the selectivity filter. Since D523 is conserved within the PKD2 family, it is possible that other members of PKD2 family may share this same unidirectional calcium conductance, although the selectivities of homomeric PKD2 and PKD2-L2 channels have yet to be defined."

The potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) of PKD2-L1 block by Gd<sup>3+</sup> was shifted from 9\u2009\u03bcM to greater than 1\u2009mM in the D523N channel, which reflects a loss of affinity &gt;6.7 kcal/mol. Conversely, the D523N mutant conducts the smaller trivalent La<sup>3+</sup> at \u00b5M concentrations, whereas the Wt and D525N channels are blocked within this concentration range. These seeming incompatible observations are reminiscent of La<sup>3+</sup> anomalous mole fraction effects reported in Wt members of the TRPC family (C3, C4, C5 and C6) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jung et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Str\u00fcbing et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hofmann et al., 1999</a>). Thus, whether trivalent and divalent metals permeate or block TRP channels is likely determined by the strength of their electrostatic interactions with acidic residues that line the selectivity filter."

                        "text": "A simple preliminary four state model of PKD2-L1 is shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>. We have defined the resting state found at negative potentials prior to depolarization as the closed state (C), although PKD2-L1 has some of constitutive activity even at \u2212100 mV (P<sub>O</sub> = 0.007). After depolarization, our analysis of macroscopic and single channel currents demonstrates that channel openings are transiently increased upon hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We proposed that these large, slowly decaying tail currents represent the population of channels transitioning from the open (O) to closed (C) state. The closed to open transition (K<sub>1</sub>) can be measured by the kinetics of the peak currents during membrane depolarization (&lt;10 mV). While it is possible that PKD2-L1 gating may have voltage dependent inactivation properties akin to some delayed rectifying potassium channels (I<sub>Kr</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Warmke and Ganetzky, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Trudeau et al., 1995</a>), our experiments did not capture this kinetic property. Further biophysical characterization will be necessary to test this possibility. The PKD2-L1 channel opening (K<sub>1</sub>) and closure (K<sub>-1</sub>) are reversible and modestly voltage dependent, increasing 1.5x and 2.2x with 100 mV membrane potential shifts, respectively. Outwardly moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly block the open channel state (O<sub>block</sub>) and trigger a slower long-term inactivation process (K<sub>2</sub>). The rate of inactivation (K<sub>2</sub>) is dependent on outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and is irreversible on the time scale of the experiments. Interestingly, the enhanced onset of channel opening and closing found in the D523N mutant may be related to the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation. These observations demonstrate that the rates of PKD2-L1 gating can be altered by mutating positions within the selectivity filter, suggesting that permeant ion coordinating sites are partly involved. This feature has precedence in BK channels, where permeant ions alter the opening and closing transitions but do not alter the calcium- or voltage-dependent activation pathways (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thompson and Begenisich, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Piskorowski and Aldrich, 2006</a>). It is possible that PKD2-L1 pore blockade by outwardly moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion(s) are displaced by inwardly Na<sup>+</sup> current and a slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> unbinding process prolongs the time course of channel closure. That is, hyperpolarization helps clear Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the PKD2-L1 selectivity filter. This effect may be analogous to displacement of quaternary ammonium ion(s) by inward K<sup>+</sup> current conducted by K<sub>V</sub> channels found in the squid giant axon (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armstrong, 1971</a>)."

This channel, which is part of the TRP family, and is expressed in the cilia of kidney epithelial cells; its knockout in mice is embryonic lethal, and its dysfunction is associated with kidney disorders. When expressed in HEK cells, it produces ionic currents that are constitutively active but show a non-instantaneous outward rectification. With step depolarizations, the conductance increases over ~100 ms, and repolarization elicits large tail currents. Repeated ramps demonstrate that the channel is sequentially facilitated and then desensitized by Ca. Through a series of electrophysiological and molecular manipulations, the present experiments demonstrate that the desensitization but not facilitation phenomenon results from pore block by internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> trying to exit through the channel and interacting with D523 in the selectivity filter to block the channel."

These observations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced block and subsequent desensitization of all outward current, while inward flux was unimpeded.\" It is not clear to me how the block can be cumulative over repeated trials (steps here or ramps elsewhere) if inward current is unimpeded. This seems self-contradictory. The authors provide ample evidence that outwardly flowing Ca blocks the channel, but they do not state explicitly what happens to the bound Ca over time (upon repolarization). The data with the D523N mutant in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows that the lack of Ca block correlates with an extreme shortening of the long, broad tail current that characterizes the wild type. It therefore seems possible that the blocking Ca (in the wild type) is displaced by inwardly flowing ions, at least in a subset of channels, and a slow unbinding process prolongs the time course of the tail (as in displacement of quaternary ammonium ions by inward K tails in Armstrong 1971). It is hard to tell whether this idea is considered or favored or ruled out by the authors. In the Discussion there is a consideration of knock-on and knock-off, but I cannot tell whether it addresses this particular question. It would be helpful if the authors could more directly discuss (1) whether and how the bound Ca ever unbinds and (2) what might underlie the dramatic change in tail currents in the D523 mutant. Addressing these points could be done by rewriting and would not require any new experiments, (unless the authors thought of something worth testing)."

If Ca is blocking the pore, where is the current coming from? The previous review asked about the unbinding of Ca, given the initial claim that inward current was unimpeded, and about whether the slow deactivation came from hooked tail currents with a slow rise. However, the rise times on tail currents were not addressed and neither is the profound difference in tail current deactivation times (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is described as irreversible (Results, second paragraph, Discussion, third and last paragraphs), but the model of <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> has a Ca-bound open-blocked state as well as a Ca-bound inactivated state, which obliquely suggests that the tails do indeed come from knock-off and that inactivation is a separate transition, although no supporting analyses were included (although they may be present in the data).

Biophysical Journal, 1990; Frankenhaeuser &amp; Hodgkin, Journal of Physiology, 1956). When a non-selective channel with a large conductance (such as PKD2-L1) is overexpressed in a HEK cell, the internal cationic concentration is altered by accumulation of external cations during sustained activation. This effect was highlighted in a recent study examining the contribution of the pipette cationic reservoir during voltage clamp of HEK cells overexpressing P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> channels using a rigorous mathematical model (Li, Swartz, Nature Neuroscience 2015). The authors find that internal cation conditions are controlled initially by pipette reservoir, but after repetitive or continuous stimulation of the P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> channel the pipette had very little influence. The accumulation of bath internal cations (up to 100 mM) explains the observed collapse of the reversal potential, a phenomena which has also been reported in TRPV1, TRPA1, ASICs and TMEM16A channels."

Although murine PKD2-L1\u2019s (previously called TRPP3, now designated TRPP2 by IUPHAR) voltage dependence had been partially characterized, human PKD2-L1 had not. We have clarified the nomenclature, added references and discuss the murine PKD2-L1 findings to the first paragraph for greater context. We presented these results first in order to rule out divalent-dependent effects on voltage dependent gating so that outward Ca-dependent block and subsequent inactivation could be examined in the remainder of the manuscript.

For PKD-L1, we do not see hooked tail currents. We expand the tail currents from Wt and mutant channels in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (Previously <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to examine the rise time. From the expanding time scale, we can see that the rise time (time to peak) is within 120 \u03bcs and does not vary with membrane potential. Thus if PKD2-L1 has a fast inactivation kinetic, it is faster than we can voltage clamp the membrane. We have included a statement discussing the rise time of the tail in the second paragraph of the Results section. Note that speed of the maximum tail current is approaching the upper limit of the speed of the voltage clamp (on average 57 \u03bcs; with R<sub>s</sub> = 7.1 m\u03a9 compensated at 60% and Cm = 13.4 pF)."

We propose that the increased deactivation might be due to the differences in the affinity of D523 for inwardly passing ions. Asparagine is less electronegative than glutamate, and we proposed that this substitution allows cations to move more rapidly though the filter than in Wt channels \u2013 thus the channel closes faster. This implies that channel deactivation can be influenced by ion occupancy. This hypothesis is discussed in the last paragraph of the Discussion section."
