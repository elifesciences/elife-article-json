                    "text": "Virus-host interactions drive a remarkable diversity of immune responses and countermeasures. We found that two RNA viruses with broad host ranges, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SINV), are completely restricted in their replication after entry into Lepidopteran cells. This restriction is overcome when cells are co-infected with vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate DNA virus. Using RNAi screening, we show that Lepidopteran RNAi, Nuclear Factor-\u03baB, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways restrict RNA virus infection. Surprisingly, a highly conserved, uncharacterized VACV protein, A51R, can partially overcome this virus restriction. We show that A51R is also critical for VACV replication in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice. Interestingly, A51R colocalizes with, and stabilizes, host microtubules and also associates with ubiquitin. We show that A51R promotes viral protein stability, possibly by preventing ubiquitin-dependent targeting of viral proteins for destruction. Importantly, our studies reveal exciting new opportunities to study virus-host interactions in experimentally-tractable Lepidopteran systems."

We found that two RNA viruses with broad host ranges, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SINV), are completely restricted in their replication after entry into Lepidopteran cells. This restriction is overcome when cells are co-infected with vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate DNA virus. Using RNAi screening, we show that Lepidopteran RNAi, Nuclear Factor-\u03baB, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways restrict RNA virus infection. Surprisingly, a highly conserved, uncharacterized VACV protein, A51R, can partially overcome this virus restriction. We show that A51R is also critical for VACV replication in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice. Interestingly, A51R colocalizes with, and stabilizes, host microtubules and also associates with ubiquitin. We show that A51R promotes viral protein stability, possibly by preventing ubiquitin-dependent targeting of viral proteins for destruction. Importantly, our studies reveal exciting new opportunities to study virus-host interactions in experimentally-tractable Lepidopteran systems."

Exploring the susceptibility and responses of <i>L. dispar</i> and other Lepidopterans to virus infection is of particular importance in designing new and effective virus-based biocontrol strategies to minimize the devastating economic impact these species continue to have on the forest industry (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sparks et al., 2013</a>). <i>L. dispar</i>-derived cell lines are susceptible to a wide variety of invertebrate DNA viruses, and as such, they are often used in virus-host studies (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sparks and Gundersen-Rindal, 2011</a>). Interestingly, <i>L. dispar</i>-derived LD652 cells can also support a limited infection by vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate poxvirus encoding a large dsDNA genome (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 1998</a>). During infection of LD652 cells, VACV undergoes early gene expression, DNA replication and late gene expression, but the infection is abortive due to a defect in one or more steps of virion morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 1998</a>). VACV entry and early gene expression have also been documented in <i>Drosophila</i> cells, however viral DNA replication and subsequent late gene expression were not detected, indicating that VACV replication is blocked earlier in its life cycle in <i>Drosophila</i> cells than in LD652 cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Moser et al., 2010</a>). Despite these limitations, RNAi screening of VACV-infected <i>Drosophila</i> cells has identified multiple host factors required for VACV entry in eukaryotic hosts (<a href=\"#bib51\">Moser et al., 2010</a>). Thus, the LD652 cell culture system provides a unique model in which to explore multiple aspects of vertebrate DNA virus biology, including basic replication strategies and suppression of host immune pathways by viral proteins."

We unexpectedly found that LD652 cells restrict both VSV and SINV replication after virus entry. Using RNAi to knock down the expression of candidate <i>L. dispar</i> antiviral immunity factors, we show that specific RNAi and innate immune pathway components restrict RNA virus replication. We also uncover a role for the Lepidopteran ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in restricting RNA virus replication. Surprisingly, co-infection with VACV strongly suppressed this restriction, suggesting that VACV encodes one or more factors that promote RNA virus replication. Using RNAi and genetic techniques, we found that the highly conserved, and previously uncharacterized, VACV <i>A51R</i> gene product is sufficient to alleviate the LD652 cell restriction to VSV and SINV replication. Interestingly, A51R formed aggregate- and filament-like structures that colocalize with microtubules (MTs) and protected MTs from depolymerization. Using alanine mutagenesis, we further show that an A51R point mutant with reduced RNA virus rescue ability still forms filamentous structures and stabilizes MTs, suggesting that A51R functions, in addition to MT stabilization, are required for disarming Lepidopteran antiviral immunity. Using mass spectrometry-based techniques, we found that A51R co-immunoprecipitates with several host proteins, including ubiquitin (Ub). Using radiolabeling and immunoblotting, we show that A51R does not affect viral mRNA translation rates but does promote virus protein stability, possibly by inhibiting Ub-dependent host targeting of viral proteins for degradation. Importantly, we show that A51R is also required for efficient replication of VACV in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice, indicating that A51R is a VACV virulence factor. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the utility of Lepidopteran systems for the study of RNA- and DNA virus host interactions and shed light on how this economically-important order of insects restricts virus replication."

A previous report indicated that VACV enters LD652 cells and reaches the stage of late gene expression but ultimately fails to complete virion morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 1998</a>). VACV, like other poxviruses, encodes numerous immunomodulatory proteins that inhibit a wide variety of host antiviral pathways (<a href=\"#bib66\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). We therefore wondered if VACV co-infection (although abortive) might nevertheless overcome an immune response in LD652 cells that restricts RNA virus replication. Consistent with this idea, when LD652 cells were co-infected with VSV-GFP or SINV-GFP and the Western Reserve (WR) strain of VACV (VACV-WR), the number of GFP-positive cells increased to \u223c77% (VSV-GFP) and \u223c45% (SINV-GFP) by 96 hpi (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>)."

Consistent with this, we detected VSV and SINV capsids inside singly-infected LD652 cells using confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Furthermore, at 8 hpi RT-PCR analysis of VSV- and SINV-infected cells detected a similar level of viral transcripts with or without VACV-WR co-infection (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Remarkably, we could also rescue VSV and SINV gene expression (albeit to reduced levels) by the addition of VACV-WR as late as 24 hpi with RNA virus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>).

We chose an ActD dose range such that the highest dose (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) reduced cell viability by \u223c50% after 48 hr of treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We found that the higher ActD doses enhanced viral gene expression by as much as \u223c100-fold compared to control treatments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These results suggest that host cell transcription is required for LD652 resistance to RNA virus infection and that LD652 cells express antiviral immunity factors. It should be noted that ActD treatment can induce apoptosis in invertebrate cells (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2008</a>) and previous studies have found apoptosis induction to enhance SINV replication in mosquitoes (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), thus it is possible that the enhanced viral replication observed in the presence of ActD may be in part due to apoptosis induction in LD652 cells."

Importantly, we found that co-infection with \u0394A51R resulted in a 100-fold reduction in VSV gene expression relative to co-infection with VACV-WR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). VSV was rescued by co-infecting with revertant VACV strains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), expressing a Flag-tagged <i>A51R</i> gene (<i>Flag-A51R</i>) reintroduced into either the <i>A51R</i> locus (\u0394A51R<sup>FA51R</sup>) or the VACV thymidine kinase (<i>J2R</i>) locus (\u0394J2R/\u0394A51R<sup>FA51R</sup>). In addition, we reverted the \u0394A51R strain with a Flag-tagged form of the VACV-MVA <i>A51R</i> gene (<i>Flag-MVAA51R)</i> introduced into the <i>J2R</i> locus (\u0394J2R/\u0394A51R<sup>FMVAA51R</sup>). Flag-A51R and Flag-MVAA51R proteins migrated as single bands of \u223c38 and 35 kDa, respectively, on immunoblots (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). The lower molecular weight of the VACV-MVA protein is likely due to a C-terminal truncation of \u223c20 amino acids that results from a genomic deletion that occurred during VACV-MVA passage in culture (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antoine et al., 1998</a>). Furthermore, consistent with the idea that the VACV-MVA A51R protein is not functional, we found that the \u0394J2R/\u0394A51R<sup>FMVAA51R</sup> strain failed to fully rescue VSV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Importantly, immunoblot of lysates from a time course of A51R<sup>FA51R</sup> infection confirmed that Flag-A51R is expressed early in VACV infection, as it was detected by 2 hpi in the absence or presence of AraC (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Together these results indicate that A51R is an early VACV protein necessary to relieve the restriction of VSV in LD652 cells."

Although only \u223c40\u201360% of cells expressed detectable Flag-A51R protein (data not shown), we observed an \u223c60-fold increase in VSV and 12-fold increase in SINV gene expression relative to control transfections with empty p166 vector or vector encoding Flag-tagged GFP (Flag-GFP) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Immunoblots confirmed similar levels of Flag-GFP and Flag-A51R expression in these lysates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). VSV and SINV titers were similarly enhanced by Flag-A51R transfection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013H</a>). These results indicate that Flag-A51R expression is sufficient to overcome the host restriction to RNA virus replication in the absence of other VACV proteins. The stronger A51R-dependent rescue of VSV compared to SINV led us to focus on VSV infection assays in our further studies of A51R-mediated rescue."

Therefore we performed systematic alanine mutagenesis of A51R residues that were directly conserved or conserved based on charge. After screening over 30 point mutations throughout the VACV A51R protein, we found that almost all of the mutants displayed significantly reduced protein stability, rendering virus rescue and MT-related functions difficult to assess (data not shown). However, alanine substitution of residue R321, which lies within the C-terminal region of A51R that is missing in VACV-MVA A51R (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), produced a suitable mutant for analysis. Flag-A51R<sup>R321A</sup> proteins displayed a reduced VSV rescue phenotype when compared to Flag-A51R proteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) despite similar levels of expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Importantly, when expressed in LD652 cells in the presence of vincristine, both Flag-A51R (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) and Flag-A51R<sup>R321A</sup> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) formed filamentous structures that overlapped with tubulin staining (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). These results suggest that MT stabilization alone is insufficient to promote full RNA virus rescue."

We transfected LD652 cells with either empty vector or with Flag-A51R expression vector and then analyzed Flag antibody immunoprecipitates 48 hr post-transfection. We matched peptides identified in these LD652 cell immunoprecipitates to Flag-A51R sequence as well as to the available <i>Bombyx mori</i> proteome. Filtering differential normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zybailov et al., 2006</a>) values from both control and Flag-A51R immunoprecipitates identified the four most-enriched proteins in Flag-A51R treatments. These proteins are the target Flag-A51R, myosin II essential light chain (a constituent of the actomyosin cytoskeleton [<a href=\"#bib13\">Clark et al., 2007</a>]), Ub, and ribosomal protein S15 (a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome that has also been shown to modulate the activity of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases [<a href=\"#bib18\">Daftuar et al., 2013</a>]) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

To first investigate if there were differences in viral protein translation rates in the presence of A51R, we used a two hour pulse of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine to label newly-synthesized proteins in virus-infected LD652 cells. We then analyzed the abundance of newly synthesized, radiolabeled VSV N protein after immunoprecipitation from these lysates. We found that radiolabeled VSV N protein was undetectable in cells infected only with either VACV-WR (control) or VSV-LUC. In contrast, we found significant quantities of radiolabeled VSV N protein in VSV-LUC-infected cells that were also infected with either VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, top panel). These results suggest that viral protein translation rates are too low to be detected by this method in VSV-LUC single infections but are detectable (and surprisingly similar) in co-infections with VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains. When whole cell extracts from these experiments were immunoblotted for total VSV N protein levels, again we found that VSV N was not detected in either VACV-WR or VSV-LUC single infection lysates. However, total VSV N protein levels were dramatically reduced in \u0394A51R co-infections compared to co-infections with VACV-WR (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, middle panel). To determine if the reduced VSV N protein levels in \u0394A51R co-infections might be due to altered VSV N protein stability, we calculated the half-life of newly-synthesized VSV N protein using pulse-chase analyses. Although newly synthesized VSV N protein could be detected during co-infection with either VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), the levels of radiolabeled protein appeared to diminish more rapidly during \u0394A51R co-infection (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Regression analyses of pulse-chase experiments estimated the half-life of VSV N to be \u223c5.3 hr during co-infection with VACV-WR while only \u223c1.8 hr during co-infection with the \u0394A51R strain. Collectively, these data suggest that A51R associates with Ub and promotes viral protein stability."

A51R stabilizes a subset of host MTs and promotes RNA virus protein stability, which might be explained by its association with Ub.

Thus, Lepidopteran cells provide a new system to investigate the mechanism of antiviral RNAi. These studies will likely complement other RNA virus-invertebrate host models such as the Orsay virus-<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> system, in which RNAi has been shown to restrict RNA virus replication (<a href=\"#bib25\">Felix et al., 2011</a>).

Pathway stimulation results in phosphorylation and cleavage of Relish, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of antimicrobial factors (<a href=\"#bib65\">Silverman et al., 2000</a>). Activation of Relish requires a series of ubiquitination reactions that are dependent on a complex of Ub-conjugating enzymes that includes Effete (<a href=\"#bib57\">Paquette et al., 2010</a>).

Interestingly, several natural viral pathogens of <i>Lepidoptera</i> encode Ub-like molecules, suggesting that Ub may be required for their life cycle (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barry et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, viruses may also benefit from inhibiting or reversing ubiquitination.

To our knowledge, this is the first example of heterologous virus rescue by a vertebrate virus in an invertebrate host. In mammalian cell culture, VACV also enhances VSV replication, but the VACV-encoded IFN response antagonists E3L and B18R are the major determinants of this rescue (<a href=\"#bib37\">Le Boeuf et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shors et al., 1998</a>). Since the IFN response appears to be vertebrate-specific (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mukherjee et al., 2014</a>), it was perhaps not surprising that we failed to observe any effect of <i>E3L</i> or <i>B18R</i> deletion on VACV-dependent VSV rescue in <i>L. dispar</i> cells (data not shown). Instead, we identified the previously uncharacterized VACV gene product A51R as a major determinant of VACV-mediated RNA virus rescue. Additional VACV proteins are likely to contribute to suppression of antiviral activity in <i>L. dispar</i> cells, since both VSV and SINV replication were partially rescued by co-infection with the \u0394A51R strain. This might explain why newly synthesized, radiolableled VSV N proteins were undetectable in single infections yet at relatively abundant (and similar) levels during co-infection with either VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains, despite the lack of N protein accumulation in the latter co-infection. Thus, the highly restrictive nature of VSV and SINV infections in <i>L. dispar</i> cells, in combination with our sensitive LUC-based detection methods, may prove useful in identifying additional novel immunomodulators encoded by VACV and other viruses."

First, our analysis indicates that A51R-mediated rescue occurs at a step after RNA virus entry. Second, the findings that A51R promotes RNA virus infection in multiple Lepidopteran (but not Dipteran) cells and promotes VACV infection in vertebrate hosts, suggests that A51R overcomes immunity mechanisms that are shared between Lepidopterans and mammals but absent or easily antagonized in Dipteran insects. Third, the suppression of host restriction to RNA virus replication and the association with MTs are both conserved features of A51R homologs from disparate vertebrate poxviruses, suggesting that both immunomodulatory and MT-stabilization functions may be important for poxvirus replication. This idea is supported by the reduced replication of the \u0394A51R strain in vertebrate cell culture and in mice. Finally, the association of A51R with Ub and the A51R-dependent VSV protein stabilization we observed, along with the aforementioned roles of the UPS in restricting RNA virus replication, point to a role for A51R in usurping or inhibiting host Ub machinery."

These findings suggest a close interaction of A51R with MT structures, and consistent with this, A51R co-sedimented with MTs in MT-pelleting assays (DBG and CCM unpublished data) which may explain our difficulty in recovering soluble A51R in immunoprecipitation studies. Importantly, these nocodazole-resistant MT structures are absent in \u0394A51R infections and can be formed by expression of A51R in the absence of other poxvirus proteins. Furthermore, the truncated VACV-MVA A51R protein fails to form filamentous, nocodazole-resistant MTs. Thus, the presence or absence of functional A51R could explain why the nocodazole-resistant \u2018MT pieces\u2019 previously observed in VACV-infected cells were not observed in uninfected or VACV-MVA-infected cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ploubidou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schepis et al., 2006</a>).

Previous studies implicate MTs in promoting VSV and SINV gene expression (<a href=\"#bib61\">Qiu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Heinrich et al., 2010</a>), and tubulin has been shown to promote VSV RNA polymerase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib53\">Moyer et al., 1986</a>). Furthermore, VSV transport to the cell surface is reported to be MT-dependent (<a href=\"#bib20\">Das et al., 2006</a>). However, a recent study found no effect of MT depolymerization on VSV and SINV replication (<a href=\"#bib46\">Matthews et al., 2013</a>). Thus the role of MTs in VSV and SINV replication remains unresolved. Considering the very early restriction of RNA virus gene expression in LD652 cells, it seems unlikely that A51R overcomes host restriction by promoting RNA virus transport on stabilized MTs. Furthermore, our studies with the A51R<sup>R321A</sup> mutant indicate that RNA virus rescue is not fully mediated by MT association or stabilization and therefore must require an additional function encoded by A51R. This finding however, does not rule out the possibility that MT-association is required for A51R immunosuppressive function or stability."

Previously it has been shown that VACV-WR infection causes redistribution of endosomes from dispersed cytosolic locations to large perinuclear clusters, suggesting that outward, MT-dependent endosomal trafficking might be impaired during VACV infection (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schepis et al., 2006</a>). This endosome clustering phenomenon requires early gene expression and one or more activities lacking in VACV-MVA (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schepis et al., 2006</a>). A51R fits these criteria, and thus could be the VACV factor that induces endosome clustering, perhaps to overcome a host mechanism that could otherwise trap viruses in endosomes. It is interesting to note that even at relatively late times post-infection (e.g., 24 hr) we detected punctate immunofluorescence staining patterns for VSV N and SINV E1 virion-associated proteins inside LD652 cells. It is possible that these punctate structures represent virions trapped inside endosomes as both VSV (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mire et al., 2010</a>) and SINV (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeTulleo and Kirchhausen, 1998</a>) can utilize endocytic modes of entry. It will be interesting in the future to determine if the expression of wild-type or mutant forms of A51R alter endosomal distribution in <i>L. dispar</i> cells and whether endosomal redistribution correlates with virus replication. Unfortunately, we have not yet found suitable reagents for monitoring endosome distributions in <i>L. dispar</i>."

This phenomenon is particularly striking given the overall 10-fold lower total (intracellular + extracellular) virus titers of the \u0394A51R strain. The release of EEV is MT-dependent (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ploubidou et al., 2000</a>), and EEV is known to elicit neutralizing antibodies (<a href=\"#bib67\">Smith et al., 2002</a>). Thus it is possible that A51R attenuates virion transport along MTs, and subsequent EEV release, in order to allow the virus to escape activation of host immune responses (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schepis et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, the Dryvax strain of VACV, which is used for smallpox vaccination, encodes a fragmented <i>A51R</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib60\">Qin et al., 2011</a>). These observations, along with the attenuated virulence of \u0394A51R strain in vivo, raise the intriguing possibility that loss of A51R function contributes to the induction of poxvirus immunity."

Although we do not yet know specifically how A51R promotes virus protein stability, it is possible that A51R-dependent sequestration of Ub (or removal of Ub from viral proteins) acts to overcome a Ub-dependent mechanism that either activates host antiviral protein effectors or directly targets nascent viral proteins for destruction. This latter hypothesis predicts that Lepidopterans cells might have a mechanism to target protein synthesis that is coupled to cytoplasmic transcription. Importantly, inhibition of the UPS in <i>L. dispar</i> cells only enhanced LUC activity when cells were infected with LUC-encoding viruses and not when cells were simply transfected with a LUC expression plasmid. Given that VACV, VSV and SINV are all cytoplasmically-replicating viruses and that plasmid-based transcription of <i>luc</i> mRNA would occur in the nucleus, this hypothesis is not unreasonable. Whether other potential A51R interactors identified here such as myosin II essential light chain or RPS15 play a role in A51R rescue function is currently unknown."

This sample yielded 238,502,918 raw reads, which were subjected to quality control procedures implemented using the FASTX-toolkit (Provided by Dr G Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, NY). Specifically, artifact reads were eliminated, and end sequences whose Phred scores corresponded to an error rate exceeding 1% were clipped. Only end-trimmed reads of 36 bases or longer were retained, and these were also required to have not less than 90% of their bases possessing a Phred score of 21 or higher.

The authors identify a previously uncharacterized VACV gene product A51R as being responsible for the rescue of RNA viral infection. The mechanism of A51R effect is complex, as it associates with such polyfunctional targets as microtubules and ubiquitin. A51R is shown to promote viral protein stability, possibly by interfering with Ub-mediated degradation. VACV lacking functional A51R is attenuated and this may be an important feature of the vaccine starin of the virus, which has a truncation of A51R."

Because VACV is unlikely to benefit from a concomitant RNA virus infection, one possibility is that A51R evolved to perform function(s) that have nothing to do with RNA viruses, but rather RNA viruses evolved to exploit the altered host cells (due to VACV infection) to establish a productive infection. From this perspective, it would be very informative to examine the consequence of VACV\u2013VSV co-infection in mice, a prediction being that this co-infection will have a strong synergy (increased virulence or viral load)."

It is indeed possible that part of the restriction to both VSV and SINV may be due to a poor ability of these viruses to escape from endosomes upon entry. While this is an excellent point that may highlight another layer of Lepidopteran cell restriction to infection, we feel that clearly defining a role for endosome trapping in RNA virus restriction in this new system is beyond the scope of this initial report. Furthermore, it is clear that at least some virus particles escape the endosome in the absence of A51R because 1) some RNA transcription and LUC reporter gene expression can be detected during single VSV-LUC/SINV-LUC infections (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), and 2) knockdown of <i>L. dispar</i> RNAi factors such as AGO2/Dicer-2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which would target intracellular viral transcripts during replication, partially relieve the restriction of VSV/SINV in LD652 cells."

Unfortunately we were unable to observe a clear, punctate staining pattern with any of these antibodies indicative of endosome staining. We also tried labeling all membranous vesicles in LD652 cells with a fluorescent lipohilic dye (FM<sup>\u2122</sup> 4-64FX). However, in our hands, we found that this fluorescent dye was lost during our fixation/immunostaining procedure for viral antigens, despite trying various fixatives and permeabilization techniques. Thus, the inability of our antibodies and FM<sup>\u2122</sup> 4-64FX dye to mark <i>L. dispar</i> endosomes has made it clear to us that we will be unable to address the endosome question until we find suitable reagents for <i>L. dispar</i>."

We made further attempts to conduct pulse-chase experiments of VSV-N in LD652 cells transfected with either Flag-GFP (as a control) or Flag-A51R vectors but found (as in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) that radiolabeled VSV N signals were too low in the control treatments to calculate half-lives to compare to the Flag-A51R treatments. Thus, using this approach we were unable to distinguish defects in VSV protein translation rates vs protein stability. Therefore, we opted to only include the pulse-chase data obtained from co-infection experiments. The \u201cresidual\u201d VSV rescue afforded by the \u0394A51R co-infection (presumably due to other factors encoded by VACV) allows one to actually detect radiolabeled VSV N protein in the absence of A51R and thus one can directly compare half-lives in these conditions to the VACV-WR co-infections."
