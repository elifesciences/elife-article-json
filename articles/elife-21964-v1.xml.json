Two MBD proteins, Mbd2 and Mbd3, were previously shown to bind methylated or hydroxymethylated DNA, respectively; however, both of these findings have been disputed. Here, we investigated this controversy using experimental approaches and re-analysis of published data and find no evidence for methylation-independent functions of Mbd2 or Mbd3. We show that chromatin localization of Mbd2 and Mbd3 is highly overlapping and, unexpectedly, we find Mbd2 and Mbd3 are interdependent for chromatin association. Further investigation reveals that both proteins are required for normal levels of cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation in murine embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, Mbd2 and Mbd3 regulate overlapping sets of genes that are also regulated by DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation factors. These findings reveal an interdependent regulatory mechanism mediated by the DNA methylation machinery and its readers."

Two MBD proteins, Mbd2 and Mbd3, were previously shown to bind methylated or hydroxymethylated DNA, respectively; however, both of these findings have been disputed. Here, we investigated this controversy using experimental approaches and re-analysis of published data and find no evidence for methylation-independent functions of Mbd2 or Mbd3. We show that chromatin localization of Mbd2 and Mbd3 is highly overlapping and, unexpectedly, we find Mbd2 and Mbd3 are interdependent for chromatin association. Further investigation reveals that both proteins are required for normal levels of cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation in murine embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, Mbd2 and Mbd3 regulate overlapping sets of genes that are also regulated by DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation factors. These findings reveal an interdependent regulatory mechanism mediated by the DNA methylation machinery and its readers."

The members of the DNMT family that modify cytosine on DNA include Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b (<a href=\"#bib48\">Okano et al., 1998</a>). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are de novo DNA methyltransferases, which establish methylation during development. On the other hand, the more abundant Dnmt1 predominantly methylates hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides to restore methylation patterns following genomic replication (although it also has some de novo methylation activity) and therefore, is considered to be the 'maintenance methyltransferase' (<a href=\"#bib14\">Egger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kho et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pradhan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Probst et al., 2009</a>). Dnmt1 is responsible for the majority of methylation in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, as <i>Dnmt1</i> knockout (KO) ES cells carry only about 20% of normal methylation levels (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lei et al., 1996</a>)."

Further oxidation can occur through conversion of 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (<a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ito et al., 2011</a>). The level of 5hmC is approximately 10% the level of 5mC in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tahiliani et al., 2009</a>), whereas 5fC and 5caC are much less abundant (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ito et al., 2011</a>). Together, Tet1 and Tet2 are responsible for essentially all the 5hmC present in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koh et al., 2011</a>). However, Tet1 is responsible for 5hmC production at promoter-proximal regions, whereas Tet2 is poorly chromatin-associated and primarily acts within gene bodies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vella et al., 2013</a>). In addition, knockdown (KD) or KO of <i>Tet1</i> or <i>Tet2</i> skews the profile of ES cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dawlaty et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ficz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Koh et al., 2011</a>), and some reports suggest <i>Tet1</i> KD also leads to a defect in self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib19\">Freudenberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ito et al., 2010</a>). However, the functions of Tet proteins during development remain incompletely resolved as <i>Tet1<sup>-/-</sup> Tet2<sup>-/-</sup></i>double KO mice have been shown to be viable with only modest phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dawlaty et al., 2013</a>)."

One of the best-studied families of cytosine methylation effectors consists of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins, most of which specifically bind methylated CpG dinucleotides and play important roles in determining the transcriptional state of the mammalian epigenome (<a href=\"#bib18\">Filion et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Prokhortchouk\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Unoki et al., 2004</a>). MBD proteins are transcriptional regulators, primarily thought to act as repressors, which play a major role in coordinating crosstalk between cytosine methylation and chromatin structure to regulate transcription (<a href=\"#bib13\">Denslow and Wade, 2007</a>). The MBD has the ability to bind single symmetrically\u00a0methylated CpG dinucleotides (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nan et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ohki et al., 2001</a>), and the functions of MeCP2 and the Mbd1-4 family members have been well-studied. With the exception of Mbd3, these proteins preferentially bind 5mC over unmethylated cytosine (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>). Consistent with this binding activity, Mbd2 occupies methylated CpG island\u2013containing promoters of inactive genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chatagnon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Menafra et al., 2014</a>). Although Mbd3 does not bind 5mC, MeCP2 and Mbd3 can bind 5hmC in vitro and Mbd3 is enriched in regions of elevated 5hmC in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mell\u00e9n et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this reported localization, knockdown (KD) of <i>Mbd3</i> leads to misregulation of 5hmC-marked genes (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, Mbd3 binding in ESCs was strongly reduced upon RNAi-mediated KD of <i>Tet1</i> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>) However, arguing against the above studies, other in vitro studies using short DNA probes containing a single symmetric 5hmCpG find poor binding of 5hmC by MBD family members (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cramer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Spruijt et al., 2013</a>)."

However, these highly similar complexes play distinct biological roles in vivo. Mbd3/NuRD is necessary for ES cell pluripotency and differentiation, as well as embryonic development, whereas <i>Mbd2</i> KO mice are viable and fertile (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hendrich\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kaji et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>).

The authors of this study reported that the enrichments of Mbd2 and Mbd3 at LMRs (low-methylated regions that are enriched for transcription factor-binding sites and exhibit approximately 30% methylation on average) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>) were minimally altered in <i>Dnmt1<sup>-/-</sup> Dnmt3a<sup>-/-</sup> Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></i> triple knockout (TKO) ES cells. Here, we sought to resolve the conflicting data addressing the dependence of Mbd2 and Mbd3 localization on 5mC and 5hmC. Analyses of ChIP-seq data from Baubec et al. as well as multiple new ChIP-seq datasets reported here demonstrate methylation-dependence of Mbd2 and Mbd3 binding throughout the genome. Interestingly, we show that Mbd2 and Mbd3 exhibit significantly overlapping localization in vivo and find that Tet1 activity is required for normal chromatin association by both Mbd3 and Mbd2. Furthermore, we show that Mbd3 and Mbd2 are each required for the binding of the other, as well as for normal levels of 5mC and 5hmC. Finally, we find that individual KD of <i>Mbd2</i>, <i>Mbd3, Dnmt1,</i> or <i>Tet1</i> results in highly concordant changes in gene expression. Together these data reveal interdependence among Mbd2/NuRD, Mbd3/NuRD, 5mC, and 5hmC to maintain normal chromatin structure and gene regulation in ESCs."

These findings also lead to a straightforward prediction that cytosine methylation would be required for Mbd3 binding, since 5hmC is generated by oxidation of 5mC.

There were two ChIP-seq replicates for the biotin-tagged <i>Mbd3a</i> isoform (bio-Mbd3a) in wild-type (WT) cells and a single replicate reported for bio-Mbd3a ChIP-seq in TKO cells (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We initially focused on genomic binding at the subset of LMRs that are larger than 150 bp and at least 3 kb away from another LMR or an unmethylated region (hereafter denoted as 'LMR subset') that was utilized in the prior study. We observed only a modest reduction (~28%) in bio-Mbd3a occupancy at the LMR subset upon loss of DNA methylation in TKO cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), similar to the original observation (see Figure 7A of <a href=\"#bib2\">Baubec et al. (2013)</a>). However, when we assessed the change in overall bio-Mbd3a enrichment by examining all bio-Mbd3a peaks (called from pooled WT bio-Mbd3a ChIP-seq reads), we observed a\u00a0~75% reduction in bio-Mbd3a binding in TKO cells relative to WT cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>).

We observed high variation among the three replicates for bio-Mbd2 in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013I</a>). For example, while two WT replicates are modestly enriched for bio-Mbd2 binding relative to the two TKO replicates (~10% reduction) at the LMR subset, the third bio-Mbd2 ChIP-seq experiment in WT cells has a much higher peak, implying a much larger (~50%) reduction in occupancy in TKO cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Similar disparities were observed at other regions of the genome (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F</a>). Importantly, when we examined the effect of 5mC loss over all peaks of bio-Mbd2 binding, bio-Mbd2 enrichment was reduced to near background levels in TKO cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Furthermore, we observed considerable gene-by-gene differences in the binding profiles among WT bio-Mbd2 replicates, where individual locations that are lowly bound in one replicate are highly bound in another replicate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I</a>). Taken together, these analyses demonstrate bio-Mbd3 and bio-Mbd2 strongly depend on cytosine methylation for normal chromatin association. Furthermore, poor concordance between biological replicates was also found for several other MBD proteins profiled in Baubec et al. (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), preventing straightforward interpretation of the role of cytosine methylation in localization of these factors."

Upon efficient KD of these factors (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>), we observed a significant reduction in promoter-proximal Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding relative to the binding observed in control (<i>EGFP</i> KD) cells (examples shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>).

We observed a similar pattern over each genomic feature: <i>Dnmt1</i> KD and <i>Tet1</i> KD each resulted in a dramatic reduction in Mbd3 and Mbd2 occupancies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>).

First, we performed ChIP-qPCR for Mbd3 in <i>Mbd3</i> KD cells and for Mbd2 in <i>Mbd2</i> KD cells, confirming the reduced ChIP signals expected in both cases (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). To validate our findings in a manner independent of the antibodies targeting the endogenous proteins, we genetically FLAG-tagged endogenous Mbd2 (hereafter <i>Mbd2-3XFLAG</i>) or Mbd3 ([<a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>]; hereafter <i>Mbd3abc-3XFLAG</i>) and performed ChIP-qPCR or ChIP-seq, respectively, in <i>EGFP</i> KD, <i>Dnmt1</i> KD, and <i>Tet1</i> KD cells (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>). We again observed a reduction in Mbd2-3XFLAG and Mbd3abc-3XFLAG enrichment following knockdown of <i>Dnmt1</i> or <i>Tet1</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013D</a>), despite lower overall enrichment than we observed with antibodies against the endogenous proteins. FLAG ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR for Mbd3abc-3XFLAG in <i>Mbd3</i> KD cells and for Mbd2-3XFLAG in <i>Mbd2</i> KD cells confirmed the reduced ChIP signals expected in both cases (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013B</a>). Finally, to test whether overexpression of <i>Mbd3a</i> (analogous to the bio-Mbd3a ChIP-seq studies in [<a href=\"#bib2\">Baubec et al., 2013</a>]) resulted in altered genomic binding relative to endogenously expressed <i>Mbd3</i>, and whether chromatin binding by overexpressed Mbd3a was altered upon <i>Dnmt1</i> KD or <i>Tet1</i> KD, we overexpressed <i>Mbd3a</i>-<i>3XFLAG</i> in ES cells and performed ChIP-qPCR experiments upon KD of <i>Dnmt1</i>, <i>Tet1</i>, or <i>EGFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Although Mbd3a-3XFLAG enrichment was reduced relative to endogenously expressed Mbd3abc-3XFLAG, there was a decrease in Mbd3a-3XFLAG binding upon <i>Dnmt1</i> or <i>Tet1</i> depletion at all eight promoter-proximal regions examined (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Together, these data demonstrate a requirement for <i>Dnmt1</i> and <i>Tet1</i> for Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding throughout the genome of ES cells. Although the dependence of Mbd3 and Mbd2 on DNA methylation (or <i>Dnmt1</i>) and the requirement of Mbd3 for hydroxymethylation (or <i>Tet1</i>) were consistent with our previous findings and those of others (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chatagnon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Menafra et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>), the requirement of Mbd2 for <i>Tet1</i> has not been previously observed.

We therefore re-analyzed the Yildirim data at gene-distal DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs), which represent active enhancers and some additional regulatory features, and observed a peak of Mbd3 binding that was strongly reduced upon <i>Tet1</i> depletion (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Similarly, our new Mbd3 and Mbd2 ChIP-seq datasets exhibit robust enrichment at gene-distal DHSs that is reduced upon <i>Dnmt1</i> KD or <i>Tet1</i> KD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>), confirming Mbd3 binds to these regions in a manner dependent on the cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation machinery."

These findings leave open the possibility that Tet1 functions in Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding independently of its roles in DNA hydroxymethylation and demethylation. To test whether the catalytic activity of Tet1 is necessary for Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding in ES cells, we generated homozygous catalytically inactive <i>Tet1</i> mutant (<i>Tet1c.i.</i>) ES cells. We knocked-in two amino acid substitutions, H1652Y and D1654A (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which were previously demonstrated to eliminate DNA demethylation activity by Tet1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ito et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tahiliani et al., 2009</a>). We performed ChIP-seq for Mbd3 and Mbd2 in two independent <i>Tet1c.i.</i> lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We found that relative to WT ES cells, ChIP-seq of Mbd3 and Mbd2 in <i>Tet1c.i.</i> cells shows decreased occupancies of both Mbd3 and Mbd2 at ICPs, TSSs, the LMR subset, gene-distal DHSs, Mbd2 peaks, and Mbd3 peaks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

We examined the effects of depletion of these factors on methylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and hydroxymethylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) at ICPs, TSSs, the LMR subset, gene-distal DHSs, Mbd2 peaks, and Mbd3 peaks. As expected, <i>Dnmt1</i> KD resulted in decreased 5mC and 5hmC. Furthermore, both <i>Mbd3</i> KD and <i>Mbd2</i> KD also resulted in decreased 5mC and 5hmC levels. These data are consistent with previous findings showing that <i>Mbd3</i> KO cells have decreased 5mC levels at some locations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Latos et al., 2012</a>), and reduced 5hmC levels overall (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>) in ES cells. Interestingly, when we examined the methylation and hydroxymethylation profiles over total LMRs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>), we observed a much stronger peak of enrichment in control (<i>EGFP</i> KD) ES cells than found at the LMR subset. Further investigation revealed that the LMRs excluded from the LMR subset were overrepresented at promoter proximal regions of genes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), and exhibited higher average methylation and hydroxymethylation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>)."

To address this possibility, we investigated the effect of <i>Mbd3</i> KD or <i>Mbd2</i> KD on chromatin association by Mbd2 or Mbd3, respectively. Relative to control (<i>EGFP</i> KD) cells, we found that when <i>Mbd3</i> was depleted there was a decrease in Mbd2 occupancy, and, conversely, when Mbd2 was depleted there was a decrease in Mbd3 occupancy (example loci shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). We extended this analysis to the whole genome, confirming a significant reduction in binding of both Mbd3 and Mbd2 upon KD of the other MBD protein at ICPs, TSSs, the LMR subset, gene-distal DHSs, Mbd2 peaks, and Mbd3 peaks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a>). Depletion of <i>Mbd3</i> does not alter Mbd2 levels, nor does depletion of <i>Mbd2</i> alter levels of Mbd3 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). We validated our observations by performing three biological replicate ChIP-qPCRs for Mbd3 and Mbd2 in <i>Mbd3</i> KD and <i>Mbd2</i> KD ES cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>) and by ChIP-seq for Mbd3abc-3XFLAG and Mbd2-3XFLAG in <i>Mbd3</i> KD and <i>Mbd2</i> KD ES cells (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013B</a>).

Several differences in study design may help explain some of the discrepancies between our previous studies and those reported by Baubec et al. First, whereas endogenous Mbd3 was examined in ChIP studies performed in Yildirim et al., the bio-tagged Mbd3 in Baubec et al. was overexpressed [see Figure S1F from <a href=\"#bib2\">Baubec et al. (2013)</a>]. Since overexpression of proteins can promote promiscuous binding as assayed by ChIP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baresic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003</a>), it is possible some of the peaks of Mbd3 binding identified by this method are non-physiological. Second, all Mbd3 isoforms were immunoprecipitated in the Yildirim study, rather than the single largest isoform examined in Baubec et al. Third, whereas Yildirim et al. examined Mbd3 binding to promoter-proximal regions of genes, Baubec et al. focused mainly on a subset of LMRs and ICPs. Regardless of these differences, comprehensive analysis of the data available from Baubec et al. revealed a strong reduction in Mbd3 binding in TKO cells at the majority of bio-Mbd3 binding sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). Similarly, our re-analysis of the bio-Mbd2 ChIP-seq data also revealed a strong reliance on DNA methylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>)."

Duplicate ChIP-seq experiments performed with polyclonal antibodies targeting the endogenous MBD proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), independent triplicate ChIP-qPCR experiments performed with the same polyclonal antibodies in <i>Dnmt1</i> KD, <i>Tet1</i> KD, or <i>Dnmt1</i> KO cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and ChIP experiments performed on endogenously C-terminal FLAG-tagged versions of Mbd2 or Mbd3 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) all yielded the same result: depletion of <i>Dnmt1</i> or <i>Tet1</i> results in reduced binding of Mbd3 and Mbd2 throughout the genome. Furthermore, experiments utilizing point mutations that eliminate the catalytic activity of Tet1 demonstrated the DNA demethylase activity of Tet1 is necessary for Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and (along with data from <i>Dnmt1</i> KO cells) show that our findings are not an artifact of potential off-target effects from RNAi. These data, together with a re-evaluation of published data, conclusively demonstrates the requirement for DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation for normal chromatin binding by Mbd3 and Mbd2 in ES cells."

Previous studies revealed that Mbd3 is required for 5mC at some locations in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Latos et al., 2012</a>), but may prevent methylation at other sites (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cui and Irudayaraj, 2015</a>). Our data examining 5mC and 5hmC enrichment genome-wide reveals a decrease in global 5mC and 5hmC levels in ES cells depleted of Mbd3 or Mbd2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This decrease is likely due to the reduction in Dnmt1 binding throughout the genome we observed in <i>Mbd3</i> KO cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with findings in cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Choi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Morey et al., 2008</a>), although other mechanisms may also contribute to this phenomenon."

This observation, along with the fact that <i>Mbd3</i> is necessary for normal DNA methylation, suggested <i>Mbd3</i> might be indirectly necessary for chromatin binding by Mbd2. We therefore investigated the potential interplay between these factors and found that Mbd2 requires <i>Mbd3</i> for binding, and vice versa, throughout the genome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Together these data support a model in which Mbd3 and Mbd2 rely on DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation for binding, while these factors are also required for DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. Such a model must be consistent with the following observations: (1) DNA methylation is necessary for proper Mbd2 and Mbd3 localization (as shown by <i>Dnmt1</i> KD and KO experiments described in this study). (2) DNA demethylation is required for proper Mbd2 and Mbd3 localization (<i>Tet1</i> KD and <i>Tet1c.i.</i> studies here, and data from <a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al. (2011)</a>). (3) Mbd2 binds DNA harboring 5mC (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>) and Mbd3 binds DNA binding 5hmC much more strongly than DNA containing 5mC (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>). (4) <i>Mbd2</i> and <i>Mbd3</i> are required for normal levels of both 5mC and 5hmC (MeDIP/hMeDIP, TLC, and other experiments described in this study). (5) Dnmt1 localization depends on <i>Mbd3</i> (ChIP studies described in this study). (6) RNAi-mediated depletion of <i>Mbd2</i>, <i>Mbd3</i>, <i>Dnmt1</i>, <i>Tet1</i>, or <i>Chd4</i> results in misregulation of many of the same genes (expression profiling described in this study). Therefore, we propose that these two MBD proteins and DNA modifications all contribute to a regulatory loop that modulates gene expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Consequently, upon disruption of any component of this regulatory loop (through depletion, KO, or mutation of the catalytic domain), the gene regulatory outcome is similar in ES cells: binding of both NuRD complexes is reduced, altering gene expression. While the molecular mechanisms underlying these interdependencies are unclear, physical interactions between Mbd3 and DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation proteins have previously been observed (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, predictive studies utilizing published ChIP-seq datasets suggest interdependency between the Mbd2 and Tet1 proteins in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Juan et al., 2016</a>)."

Consistent with this possibility, <i>Mbd3</i> KD had a stronger effect on some shared Mbd2/Mbd3 target genes than <i>Mbd2</i> KD in ES cells. Alternatively, Mbd2/Mbd3 interdependence may be lost during differentiation, or within specific lineages, which may partially account for the different phenotypes of <i>Mbd2</i> and <i>Mbd3</i> KO mice. Further studies will be required to distinguish between these possibilities."

Experiments were aligned over the same genomic features described above and bio-Mbd3 peaks (called from bio-Mbd3 ChIP-seq in WT cells using \u2018findPeaks\u2019 command in HOMER with pooled input as a control), bio-Mbd2 peaks (called from bio-Mbd2 ChIP-seq in WT cells using \u2018findPeaks\u2019 command in HOMER with pooled input as a control), bio-Mbd1a peaks (called from bio-Mbd1a ChIP-seq in WT cells using \u2018findPeaks\u2019 command in HOMER with pooled input as a control), bio-Mbd1b peaks (called from bio-Mbd1b ChIP-seq in WT cells using \u2018findPeaks\u2019 command in HOMER with pooled input as a control), bio-Mbd4 peaks (called from bio-Mbd4 ChIP-seq in WT cells using \u2018findPeaks\u2019 command in HOMER with pooled input as a control), or bio-MeCP2 peaks (called from bio-MeCP2 ChIP-seq in WT cells using \u2018findPeaks\u2019 command in HOMER with pooled input as a control). To confirm this analysis, bio-Mbd2 and bio-Mbd3 data were downloaded and mapped independently and mapped reads were annotated and summarized using the Bioconductor package ChIPpeakAnno (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhu, 2013</a>, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012828\">SCR_012828</a>). Furthermore, bio-Mbd2 and bio-Mbd3 peaks were confirmed independently by calling peaks from WT bio-Mbd2 or WT bio-Mbd3 ChIP-seq experiments, respectively, using Macs2. Finally, we re-analyzed a subset of these data after re-aligning reads (using bowtie, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005476\">SCR_005476</a>) while allowing only two mismatches instead of three. The use of two or three mismatches during alignment had no effect on the results."

A more objective and quantitative analysis of the microarray expression profile is necessary to make the strong statements about high correlation. Additionally, we agreed that antibody specificity could be an issue and that this study would add positively to the debate if the authors could confirm their IP data in two ways. First, with FLAG ChIP of tagged MBDs to validate their MBD ChIPseq data. Second, with a parallel approach such as TLC to validate their MeDIP and hMeDIP analysis.

The strong assertion is made that gene expression profiles upon knockdown of Dnmt1, Tet1, Mbd3, Mbd2 and Chd4 are all \"well-correlated.\" This seems to be based on visual inspection of the heat maps of microarray results, i.e., the top rows across the different treatments are mostly unregulated genes, and the bottom rows are mostly down regulated. But it seems there should be a more quantitative way to assess patterns of gene regulation. I'd like to see how the expression profiles of Mbd/Tet knockdowns would compare to perturbing a different repressive mechanism, such as knockdown of PRC1 or PRC2 components. Cluster analysis could be done of the columns (different treatments) of the heat map rather than just the rows (genes). You'd expect that, say, profiles of Eed1 and Ezh1 knockdowns would sort together as an \"outgroup\" compared to the Mbd-Tet-etc treatments."

To clarify, phenotypic alterations upon KD or KO of <i>Tet</i> genes have been described in several studies. In two studies, KD of <i>Tet1</i> impaired ES cell self-renewal, in part because of <i>Nanog</i> down-regulation (Ito et al., 2010, Freudenberg et al., 2012). However, separate studies showed no effect of <i>Tet1</i> KO on self-renewal (Dawlaty et al., 2011; Koh et al., 2011; Ficz et al., 2011).
