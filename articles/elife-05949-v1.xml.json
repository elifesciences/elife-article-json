How the ability of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment to bind self- and foreign-pMHC changes over the lifespan remains a fundamental aspect of T-cell biology that is largely unexplored. We report that, while old mice (18\u201322 months) contain fewer CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells compared with adults (8\u201312 weeks), those that remain have a higher intrinsic affinity for self-pMHC, as measured by CD5 expression. Old mice also have more cells that bind individual or multiple distinct foreign-pMHCs, and the fold increase in pMHC-binding populations is directly related to their CD5 levels. These data demonstrate that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment preferentially accumulates promiscuous constituents with age as a consequence of higher affinity T-cell receptor interactions with self-pMHC."

Now, Deshpande et al. show that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo a remarkable set of changes in aging mice. Mice that are nearing the end of their natural lifespan have fewer CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than younger mice. However, those CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that remain are more likely than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from younger mice to be able to recognize multiple antigens. This increase in the proportion of multitasking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells corresponds with an increased tendency of these cells to bind to the body's own cells. If similar changes occur in older people, this may help explain some age-related autoimmune diseases. Yet, the relationship between the increase in multitasking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the decrease in immune function with aging remains to be fully explored."

One implication of this work is that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses may be too robust and out of balance with other arms of the immune system. This could even lead to conditions such as autoimmunity. Alternatively, while there may be more CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that can multitask by recognizing multiple antigens, their ability to respond appropriately to infections or vaccinations may be diminished. What is clear from the work of Deshpande et al. is that the rules that have been defined for immunity in adults change with aging. The rules that govern immunity in the elderly must be more clearly defined to realize the goal of designing immunotherapies, such as vaccines, that provide protection throughout the lifespan."

Yet, this potential cannot be realized. Thymic development limits clonal representation to T-cells bearing TCRs within an affinity window for self-pMHC (<a href=\"#bib41\">Savage and Davis, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Klein et al., 2014</a>), while peripheral space physically constrains the number of T-cells present to recognize foreign-pMHC (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mason, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vrisekoop et al., 2014</a>). Finally, time\u2014with its age-associated changes in thymic expression of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), thymic architecture, antigen experience, and homeostasis\u2014imposes an overarching pressure that limits the binding capacity of a repertoire for self- and foreign-pMHC to each constituent's prior history of TCR\u2013pMHC interactions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nikolich-Zugich, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Surh and Sprent, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chinn et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Griffith et al., 2012</a>).

An inverse relationship was observed between CD5 and CD3 levels, consistent with CD5 reflecting tonic TCR engagement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Finally, cells with high CD5 expression incorporated the most BrdU in adult and old mice, consistent with tonic TCR interactions driving homeostatic proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). A higher frequency of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in old mice compared with adults. However, since the total number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell drops in old mice this did not result in significantly more BrdU<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>).

I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers presenting an immunodominant peptide (aa 641\u2013655) from West Nile Virus (WNV) envelope protein (E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>) were used because WNV lethality increases over the lifespan of mice and humans, making it a useful model for investigating age-related defects in susceptibility to viral infection and vaccine efficacy (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brien et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Uhrlaub et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Suthar et al., 2013</a>).

OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup> monomer is also less SDS-stable than E641:I-A<sup>b</sup> at room temperature (not shown), and pMHC stability is directly related to immunodominance (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lazarski et al., 2005</a>). Alloreactive cells were enumerated because they are likely to be selected on a broader range of self-pMHC and represent a broader subset of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment (<a href=\"#bib15\">Felix and Allen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chu et al., 2009</a>)."

Since tetramers cannot detect all CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells that respond to a given class II pMHC via weak TCR\u2013pMHC interactions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sabatino et al., 2011</a>), the more avid His-tag enrichment is likely to detect T-cells that bind tetramers with lower avidity."

This indicates that the increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells binding E641:I-A<sup>b</sup> is not unique. Rather, since CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells decline with aging, those that are left appear to bind foreign pMHC more promiscuously. Consistent with this interpretation, the number of naive cells binding OVA+MCC was higher in old mice compared with adults, as were the number of memory cells binding E641+OVA or OVA+MCC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J\u2013L</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s7 fig2s8 fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 7\u20139</a>).

To evaluate the former, we enriched thymocytes from adult and old mice with E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>, OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup>, and MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup> tetramers. The frequency of E641-bound CD4 single positive (SP) cells was higher for old thymocytes compared with the adults, while the frequency of OVA and MCC-bound CD4SPs did not differ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). CD4SPs binding two distinct tetramers were not detected amongst the small number of tetramer-enriched samples. This is not surprising given that dual binders average &lt;10% of a peripheral population (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Since thymic output remains constant as a function of size over time (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hale et al., 2006</a>), the higher frequency of E641-bound CD4SP thymocytes in old mice suggests that more E641-binders leave the thymus of old mice than adults on a daily basis. However, mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells re-entering the thymus increase from \u223c10% in adult mice to \u223c20% in old mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hale et al., 2006</a>). Our analysis cannot resolve CD4SPs from mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, so the impact of recirculation on our analysis is unclear. Nevertheless, the data suggest that age-related changes in thymic selection impact the clonal representation and binding capacity of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment."

While most studies focus on adult mouse or human T-cells, when immunity is at its peak, there is a growing appreciation that the pressures imposed by time on thymic selection and peripheral space result in a repertoire that continuously evolves in each individual. Here, we contribute to our basic understanding of T-cell biology by reporting that the size of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment contracts with aging but, unlike CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, the capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells to bind foreign-pMHC increases over the lifespan."

A decrease in cortical thymic epithelial cells and changes in antigen processing could increase competition for positively selecting pMHC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chinn et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Klein et al., 2014</a>), favoring higher TCR affinity for self-pMHC. In addition, decreased expression of TRAs on fewer medullary TECs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chinn et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Griffith et al., 2012</a>) could lead to competition for negatively selecting pMHC with aging. Experimentally limiting thymic selection differentially impacts the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartments, with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells becoming more polyspecific and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells becoming more pMHC focused (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huseby et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chu et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yin et al., 2012</a>). Thus, age-related changes in the thymus would be expected to restrict negative selection and result in a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment with a broader binding capacity, as observed here. It is also noteworthy that T-cells can productively rearrange two TCR\u03b1 subunits and express two TCRs that increase reactivity to self- and allo-pMHC (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ni et al., 2014</a>). Whether T-cells expressing two TCRs increase over time remains unexplored."

Here, we extended this observation to naive and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in old mice, indicating that affinity for self-pMHC influences clonal fitness over time. This would be akin to the affinity of TCR\u2013pMHC interactions influencing clonal fitness within a polyclonal response to cognate antigens (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lanzavecchia and Sallusto, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gett et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Malherbe et al., 2004</a>).

Two-color tetramer enrichment and gating for a single pMHC specificity was performed as a method for reducing false-positives in tetramer analysis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stetson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Obar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nelson et al., 2015</a>). The operating principle followed here is that cells which bind to tetramers via TCR\u2013pMHC interactions will fall on a diagonal, since binding should be proportional for each, while those that bind to the FP in a TCR-independent manner should fall off the diagonal (<a href=\"#fig2s1 fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1, 3</a>). The dump tetramer approach was used for samples in which E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>, OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup>, and MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup> tetramers were used in a single sample for enrichment with anti-His beads (<a href=\"#bib40\">Savage et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Newell et al., 2009</a>). Here, cells bound to a tetramer of interest (e.g., E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>) were gated and then those that also bound the other two tetramers (e.g., OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup> and MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup>) were excluded as a \u2018dump\u2019 to enumerate cells bound to one tetramer species only (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The dumped cells could be false-positives binding SA, MHC, or the dump tetramer-associated FP nonspecifically; however, they could be bound via TCR\u2013pMHC interactions. Importantly, the operating principles of both the dump and two-color methods were employed to enumerate cells binding two tetramers at once. Specifically, to enumerate cells bound to a specific combination (e.g., E641:I-A<sup>b</sup> + OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup>), those also binding the third tetramer (e.g., MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup>) were dumped prior to enumerating cells bound to both tetramers of interest by two-color analysis. Combining the two approaches should enumerate cells binding tetramers via TCR\u2013pMHC interactions and exclude dumped cells that bind SA, MHC, or the dump-associated FP and those excluded by two-color analysis that bind the FP associated with the tetramers of interest in a non-specific manner. Combining both approaches by sequential gating (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) yielded the numbers shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J\u2013L</a>.

Since core nonamer sequences are not defined for either E641 or OVA323-339, it is not clear if they share any such TCR contact amino acids.

The second concern is that the seemingly high frequencies of polyreactivity the authors obtain in their analysis of CD4 T cell repertoires necessitate a stringent-ER identification of target-specific TCRs and/or some independent evidence (if not explanation) for high-frequency polyspecificity. This issue has been addressed, albeit mostly via plausible arguments rather than additional data. The third concern is regarding the thymic and/or peripheral origin of the reported repertoire differences. The authors have indeed provided very interesting data for this issue, and have directly and substantively addressed the concern, improving the significance of the findings in the manuscript. The fourth concern is regarding the use of CD5 levels as a surrogate marker for self pMHC-affinity of TCRs. While the revised manuscript makes a case for this by plausible arguments, the relationship still remains a hypothesis, albeit a reasonable one."

Indeed, several studies have described a decrease in the numbers of CD8 T cells specific for foreign class I pMHC with aging. These include a decline in CD8 T cells specific for peptide epitopes from ovalbumin, vaccinia virus, influenza, HSV-1, LCMV (<a href=\"#bib12\">Decman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rudd et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Smithey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yager et al., 2008</a>), and WNV (Janko Nikolich-Zugich, personal communication). In contrast, age-related changes in the capacity of the CD4 T cell compartment to bind foreign-pMHC have been largely unexplored. Our results show a significant increase in CD4 T cells that bind foreign-pMHC over time, even though the absolute number of CD4 T cells declines. Aging thus inversely impacts the CD4 and CD8 T cell compartments. We consider this to represent an important advance in our fundamental understanding of T cell biology. Although the mechanistic basis for these changes will benefit from further elaboration in future studies, here we establish a mechanistic link between tonic TCR interactions with self-pMHC, steady state proliferation in vivo (Figure 6 and 7), and the increase in binding capacity observed in this study (<a href=\"#fig3 fig4\">Figure 3 and 4</a>). We have also now added analysis of thymocytes in response to major point #3 (Figure 5). These data support the notion that both thymic and peripheral pressures contribute to age-related changes in the binding capacity of the CD4 T cell compartment."

With this in mind, our experiments were conducted with an extensive panel of dump antibodies as well as the two main published protocols for stringency in tetramer-based analysis: (i) dump tetramers (<a href=\"#bib32\">Newell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Savage et al., 1999</a>), or (ii) two-color tetramers (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nelson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Obar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stetson et al., 2002</a>). Each strategy has pros and cons. Dump tetramers gate out false-positive cells bound to some component of a tetramer \u2013 be it streptavidin (SA), the MHC, or the fluorescent protein (FP) used for the dump tetramer\u2013 in a TCR-independent manner. This method also excludes cells bound to two different tetramers (the dump and subject tetramers) in a TCR-specific manner, either because they express one TCR that binds both pMHC, or two TCRs that individually bind two distinct pMHC. The two-color approach selectively analyzes cells binding the same tetramer made with two different FPs on a diagonal, since tetramer binding is proportional to the affinity of TCR-pMHC interactions and the differently colored tetramers should bind a specific cell equivalently. This approach lowers the limit of detection for low affinity cells, since tetramers of both colors are competing for limited TCR space on a T cell, but it excludes from analysis those cells that bind exclusively to one of the two FPs as false-positives. Cells bound to SA, the MHC, or shared motifs between FPs (as could occur with the structurally related phycobiliproteins PE and APC) in a TCR-independent manner are included in the analysis as false-positives."

Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 6 has now been added to show how sequential gating impacts enumeration of the tetramer-bound populations under consideration.

Figure 4\u2013figure supplements 8-10 have now been added to better illustrate the application of two-color staining, using quadrant gates, before and after the use of a dump tetramer (e.g. MCC) to identify cells binding strictly to two tetramers (e.g. E641+OVA). The numbers of \u2018polyspecifc\u2019 cells enumerated by two-color staining pre- and post-dump are also shown in these figure supplements.

Indeed, they pointed out that examples exist in the literature for TCRs recognizing non-homologous peptides (Birnbaum et al., 2014). Furthermore, TCRs have been described that focus more on the MHC than the peptide and even cross-react with class I MHC after selection with a single class II pMHC (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huseby et al., 2005</a>). In addition, Jenkins and colleagues showed CD4 SP thymocytes binding both 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> and IgM:I-A<sup>b</sup> or 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> and FliC:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers under conditions of limiting negative selection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chu et al., 2010</a>). By our assessment (not shown), the putative core nonamers of the former share hydrophobic residues at P2 (Trp and Val) and P5 (Leu and Ala) that vary in size, as do the latter at P5 (Leu and Ile) and P8 (Trp and Leu). We think it is therefore possible that exceptions to the requirement of shared TCR contacts for cross reactivity become more frequent under conditions of limiting negative selection with aging. Also, since \u223c10% of peripheral T cells express dual TCRs (which represent &gt; 40% of alloreactive cells), the possibility exists that our polyspecific cells may be recognizing multiple pMHC via dual TCRs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ni et al., 2014</a>). We think this is an important and exciting future direction that extends beyond what can be reasonably explored in one study."

To address this comment, we first analyzed the relationship between CD5 expression on adult and old peripheral T cells versus CD4 SP thymocytes (now shown in Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1). CD5 levels are higher on both adult and old CD4 SP thymocytes than on total adult CD4 T cells, but not different from each other.

Here we dumped the unique colors of two of the tetramers (e.g. OVA and MCC) and then enumerated those cells that bind the remaining tetramer in two colors (e.g. E641). Since old mice had ten-fold fewer (\u223c2X10<sup>7</sup>) total thymocytes than adult mice (\u223c2X10<sup>8</sup>), thymocytes from 4-5 old mice were pooled for tetramer enrichment. This was repeated with two data sets representing 4 mice/group and one representing 5/group from a total of three experiments.

The number of tetramer bound cells for OVA and MCC were not significantly different between adult and old in our sample size. The numbers of tetramer bound cells were so low that we are not surprised we did not detect cells binding two distinct tetramers, given their relatively low frequency in the periphery. Since Fink and colleagues have reported that thymic output is consistent over time relative to thymic size (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hale et al., 2006</a>), the implication is that on a daily basis a higher number of E641 binders leave the thymus in old mice compared with the adult to take up residence in the periphery. Clearly, this is an important direction for further elaboration in future studies."

We also assessed BrdU incorporation, which is dependent on TCR engagement, and showed higher BrdU incorporation occurred in cells with higher CD5 levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The data in these figures were presented to complement the studies we referenced in the text (<a href=\"#bib2\">Azzam et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mandl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mandl et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Persaud et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Smith et al., 2001</a>).
