We have characterized the structure and function of a new member of the ferritin superfamily that is sequestered within an encapsulin capsid. We show that this encapsulated ferritin (EncFtn) has two main alpha helices, which assemble in a metal dependent manner to form a ferroxidase center at a dimer interface. EncFtn adopts an open decameric structure that is topologically distinct from other ferritins. While EncFtn acts as a ferroxidase, it cannot mineralize iron. Conversely, the encapsulin shell associates with iron, but is not enzymatically active, and we demonstrate that EncFtn must be housed within the encapsulin for iron storage. This encapsulin nanocompartment is widely distributed in bacteria and archaea and represents a distinct class of iron storage system, where the oxidation and mineralization of iron are distributed between two proteins."

Another iron binding site in PmFtn_4ITW (the gateway site or Fe<sub>C</sub> site [<a href=\"#bib12\">Bradley et al., 2014</a>]) consists of E48, E45 and E131 which are marked with solid blue circles (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grant et al., 1998</a>). The FOC of <i>R. rubrum</i> EncFtn is labelled with empty red triangles as E32, E62, H65 and Y39; and the iron entry site is marked with empty blue circles including E31 and E34.\u00a0The putative iron exit site is marked with empty blue squares including H57, E61 and E64.

We have characterized the structure and function of a new member of the ferritin superfamily that is sequestered within an encapsulin capsid. We show that this encapsulated ferritin (EncFtn) has two main alpha helices, which assemble in a metal dependent manner to form a ferroxidase center at a dimer interface. EncFtn adopts an open decameric structure that is topologically distinct from other ferritins. While EncFtn acts as a ferroxidase, it cannot mineralize iron. Conversely, the encapsulin shell associates with iron, but is not enzymatically active, and we demonstrate that EncFtn must be housed within the encapsulin for iron storage. This encapsulin nanocompartment is widely distributed in bacteria and archaea and represents a distinct class of iron storage system, where the oxidation and mineralization of iron are distributed between two proteins."

At 32 nm in diameter, it is much larger than other members of the ferritin superfamily, such as the 12 nm 24-subunit classical ferritin nanocage and the 8 nm 12-subunit Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells) complex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grant et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Andrews, 2010</a>); and is thus capable of sequestering up to ten times more iron than these ferritins (<a href=\"#bib38\">McHugh\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>). The primary sequences of EncFtn proteins have Glu-X-X-His metal coordination sites, which are shared features of the ferritin family proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andrews, 2010</a>). Secondary structure prediction identifies two major \u03b1-helical regions in these proteins; this is in contrast to other members of the ferritin superfamily, which have four major \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The \u2018half-ferritin\u2019 primary sequence of the EncFtn family and their association with encapsulin nanocompartments suggests a distinct biochemical and structural organization to other ferritin family proteins. The <i>Rhodospirillum\u00a0rubrum</i> EncFtn protein (Rru_A0973) shares 33% protein sequence identity with the <i>M. xanthus</i> (MXAN_4464), 53% with the <i>T. maritima</i> (Tmari_0787), and 29% with the <i>P. furiosus</i> (PF1192) homologues. The GXXH motifs are strictly conserved in each of these species (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

We have produced recombinant encapsulin (Enc) and EncFtn from the aquatic purple-sulfur bacterium <i>R.\u00a0rubrum</i>, which serves as a model organism for the study of the control of the bacterial nitrogen fixation machinery (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pope et al., 1985</a>), in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that their co-expression leads to the production of an icosahedral nanocompartment with encapsulated EncFtn. The crystal structure of a truncated hexahistidine-tagged variant of the EncFtn protein (EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>) shows that it forms a decameric structure with an annular \u2018ring-doughnut\u2019 topology, which is distinct from the four-helical bundles of the 24meric ferritins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lawson et al., 1991</a>) and dodecahedral DPS proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grant et al., 1998</a>). We identify a symmetrical iron bound ferroxidase center (FOC) formed between subunits in the decamer and additional metal-binding sites close to the center of the ring and on the outer surface. We also demonstrate the metal-dependent assembly of EncFtn decamers using native PAGE, analytical gel-filtration, and native mass spectrometry. Biochemical assays show that EncFtn is active as a ferroxidase enzyme. Through site-directed mutagenesis we show that the conserved glutamic acid and histidine residues in the FOC influence protein assembly and activity. We use our combined structural and biochemical data to propose a model for the EncFtn-catalyzed sequestration of iron within the encapsulin shell."

In both cases the elution profile from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) displayed two peaks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions from these peaks showed that the high molecular weight peak was partially resistant to SDS and heat-induced denaturation; in contrast, the low molecular weight peak was consistent with monomeric mass of 13 kDa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting of these bands confirmed the identity of both as EncFtn. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the SEC fractions showed 100 times more iron in the oligomeric fraction than the monomer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, blue scatter points; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that EncFtn oligomerization is associated with iron binding.

To test the metal-dependent oligomerization of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> <i>in vitro</i>, we incubated the protein with various metal cations and subjected samples to analytical SEC and non-denaturing PAGE. Of the metals tested, only Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> induced the formation of significant amounts of the decamer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1/2</a>). While Fe<sup>2+</sup> induces the multimerization of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>, Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the form of FeCl<sub>3</sub> does not have this effect on the protein, highlighting the apparent preference this protein has for the ferrous form of iron. To determine if the oligomerization of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> was concentration dependent we performed analytical SEC at 90 and 700 \u00b5M protein concentration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). At the higher concentration, no increase in the decameric form of EncFtn was observed; however, the shift in the major peak from the position of the monomer species indicated a tendency to dimerize at high concentration."

Monomer fractions of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> purified from MM were pooled and run in subsequent analytical gel-filtration runs over the course of three days.

The area for resulting protein peaks were calculated using the Unicorn software (GE Healthcare); peak ratios were calculated to quantify the propensity of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> to multimerize in the presence of the different metal ions. The change in the\u00a0ratios of monomer to decamer over the three days of experiments may be a consequence of experimental variability, or the propensity of this protein to equilibrate towards decamer over time. The increased decamer: monomer ratio seen in the presence of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> indicates that these metal ions facilitate multimerization of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> protein, while the other metal ions tested do not appear to induce multimerization.

Informed by the ICP-MS data indicating the presence of iron in the protein we collected diffraction data at the experimentally determined iron absorption edge (1.74 \u00c5) and calculated an anomalous difference Fourier map using this data. Inspection of this map showed two 10-sigma peaks between residues Glu32, Glu62 and His65 of two adjacent chains, and a statistically smaller 5-sigma peak between residues Glu31 and Glu34 of the two chains. Modeling metal ions into these peaks and refinement of the anomalous scattering parameters allowed us to identify these as two iron ions and a calcium ion respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). An additional region of asymmetric electron density near the di-iron binding site in the mFo-DFc map was modeled as glycolic acid, presumably a breakdown product of the PEG 3350 used for crystallization. This di-iron center has an Fe-Fe distance of 3.5 \u00c5, Fe-Glu-O distances between 2.3 and 2.5 \u00c5, and Fe-His-N distances of 2.5 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This coordination geometry is consistent with the di-nuclear ferroxidase center (FOC) found in ferritin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bertini et al., 2012</a>). It is interesting to note that although we did not add any additional iron to the crystallization trials, the FOC was fully occupied with iron in the final structure, implying that this site has a very high affinity for iron."

As described above, by recombinant production of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> in minimal media we were able to limit the bioavailability of iron. Native MS analysis of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> produced in this way displayed a charge state distribution consistent with an EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> monomer (blue circles, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A1</a>) with an average neutral mass of 13,194 Da, in agreement with the predicted mass of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> protein (13,194.53 Da). Under these conditions, no significant higher order assembly was observed and the protein did not have any coordinated metal ions. Titration with Fe<sup>2+</sup> directly before native MS analysis resulted in the appearance of a new charge state distribution, consistent with an EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decameric assembly (+22 to +26; 132.65 kDa) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A2/3</a>). After instrument optimization, the mass resolving power achieved was sufficient to assign iron-loading in the complex to between 10 and 15 Fe ions per decamer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, inset top right), consistent with the presence of 10 irons in the FOC and the coordination of iron in the Glu31/34-site occupied by calcium in the crystal structure (<i>\u0394</i>mass observed ~0.67 kDa). MS analysis of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> after addition of further Fe<sup>2+</sup> did not result in iron loading above this stoichiometry. Therefore, the extent of iron binding seen is limited to the FOC and Glu31/34 secondary metal binding site. These data suggest that the decameric assembly of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> does not accrue iron in the same manner as classical ferritin, which is able to sequester around 4500 iron ions within its nanocage (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mann et al., 1986</a>). Ion mobility analysis of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decameric assembly, collected with minimal collisional activation, suggested that it consists of a single conformation with a collision cross section (CCS) of 58.2 nm<sup>2</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This observation is in agreement with the calculated CCS of 58.7 nm<sup>2</sup>derived from our crystal structure of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marklund, 2015</a>). By contrast, IM-MS measurements of the monomeric EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> at pH 8.0 under the same instrumental conditions revealed that the metal-free protein monomer exists in a wide range of charge states (+6 to +16) and adopts many conformations in the gas phase with collision cross sections ranging from 12 nm<sup>2</sup>\u00a0to 26 nm<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These observations are indicative of an unstructured protein with little secondary or tertiary structure (<a href=\"#bib9\">Beveridge et al., 2014</a>). Thus, IM-MS studies highlight that higher order structure in EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> is mediated/stabilized by metal binding, an observation that is in agreement with our solution studies. Taken together, these results suggest that di-iron binding, forming the FOC in EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>, is required to stabilize the 4-helix bundle dimer interface, essentially reconstructing the classical ferritin-like fold; once stabilized, these dimers readily associate as pentamers, and the overall assembly adopts the decameric ring arrangement observed in the crystal structure."

The resulting CID mass spectrum (<b>A</b>) revealed that dissociation of the holo- EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer primarily occurred via ejection of a highly charged monomer (blue circles), leaving the \u2018stripped\u2019 complex (a 9mer; 118.7 kDa; yellow circles). The mass of the ejected-monomer is consistent with apo- EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> (13.2 kDa), suggesting unfolding of the monomer (and loss of Fe) occurs during ejection from the complex. This observation of asymmetric charge partitioning of the sub-complexes with respect to the mass of the complex is consistent with the 'typical' pathway of dissociation of protein assemblies by CID, as described by <a href=\"#bib24\">Hall et\u00a0al. (2013)</a>. In addition, a third, lower abundance, charge state distribution is observed which overlaps the EncFtn ejected monomer charge state distribution; this region of the spectrum is highlighted in (<b>B</b>). This distribution is consistent with an ejected EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer (orange circles). Interestingly, closer analysis of the individual charge state of this dimeric CID product shows that this sub-complex exists in three forms \u2013 displaying mass consistent with an EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer binding 0, 1, and 2 Fe ions. This is highlighted in (<b>C</b>), where the 15+ charge state of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer is shown; 3 peaks are observed with <i>m/z</i> 1760.5, 1763.8, and 1767.0 Th \u2013 the lowest peak corresponds to neutral masses of 26392.5 Da [predicted EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer, (C<sub>572</sub>H<sub>884</sub>N<sub>172</sub>O<sub>185</sub>S<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>;\u00a026388.6 Da]. The two further peaks have a delta-mass of ~+50 Da, consistent with Fe binding. We interpret these observations as partial \u2018atypical\u2019 CID fragmentation of the decameric complex \u2013 i.e. fragmentation of the initial complex with retention of subunit and ligand interactions. A schematic summary of these results is displayed in (<b>D</b>). We postulate the high stability of this iron-bound dimer sub-complex is due to the metal coordination at the dimer interface, increasing the strength of the dimer interface. Taken together, these observations support our findings that the topology of the decameric EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> assembly is arranged as a pentamer of dimers, with two Fe ions at each dimer interface."

In light of the crystal structure, this observation can be rationalized as dissociation of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer by disruption of the non-FOC interface with at least partial retention of the FOC interface and the FOC-Fe. Thus, this observation supports our crystallographic assignment of the overall topology of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> assembly as a pentameric assembly of dimers with two iron ions located at the FOC dimer interface. In addition, this analysis provides evidence that the overall architecture of the complex is consistent in the crystal, solution and gas phases."

Unlike the Dps family of ferritin-like proteins, EncFtn showed no peroxidase activity when assayed with the substrate <i>ortho-</i>phenylenediamine (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pesek et al., 2011</a>).

To investigate this further, we added Fe<sup>2+</sup> at various concentrations to samples of apo-ferritin, EncFtn, isolated encapsulin, and the EncFtn-Enc protein complex, and subjected these samples to a ferrozine assay to quantify the amount of iron associated with the proteins after three hours of incubation. The maximum iron loading capacity of these systems was calculated as the quantity of iron per biological assembly (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In this assay, the EncFtn<sub>sH\u00a0</sub>decamer binds a maximum of around 48 iron ions before excess iron induces protein precipitation. The encapsulin shell protein can sequester about 2200 iron ions before significant protein loss occurs, and the reconstituted EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment sequestered about 4150 iron ions. This latter result is significantly more than the apoferritin used in our assay, which sequesters approximately 570 iron ions in this assay (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>)."

EncFtn decamers bind up to 48 iron ions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), which is significantly higher than the stoichiometry of fifteen metal ions visible in the FOC and E31/34-site of the crystal structure of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer and our MS analysis. The discrepancy between these solution measurements and our MS analysis may indicate that there are additional metal-binding sites on the interior channel and exterior faces of the protein; this is consistent with our identification of a number of weak metal-binding sites at the surface of the protein in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These observations are consistent with hydrated Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions being channeled to the active site from the E31/34-site and the subsequent exit of Fe<sup>3+</sup> products on the outer surface, as is seen in other ferritin family proteins (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pesek et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Behera and Theil, 2014</a>). While the isolated encapsulin shell does not display any ferroxidase activity, it binds around 2200 iron ions in our assay (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). This implies that the shell can bind a significant amount of iron on its outer and inner surfaces. While the maximum reported loading capacity of classical ferritins is approximately 4500 iron ions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mann et al., 1986</a>), in our assay system we were only able to load apoferritin with around 570 iron ions. However, the recombinant EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment was able to bind over 4100 iron ions in the same time period, over seven times the amount seen for the apoferritin. We note we do not reach the experimental maximum iron\u00a0loading\u00a0for apoferritin and therefore the total iron-loading capacity of our system may be significantly higher than in this experimental system."

In contrast, the encapsulin protein displays no catalytic activity, but has the ability to bind a considerable amount of iron. Finally, the EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment complex retains the catalytic activity of EncFtn, and sequesters iron within the encapsulin shell at a higher level than the isolated components of the system, and at a significantly higher level than the classical ferritins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andrews, 2010</a>).\u00a0Furthermore, our recombinant nanocompartments may not have the physiological subunit stoichiometry, and the iron-loading capacity of native nanocompartments is potentially much higher than the level we have observed."

In the wild-type\u00a0(WT) EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> this leads to electrostatic repulsion between subunits in the absence of iron. Coordination of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in this site stabilizes the dimer and reconstitutes the active FOC. The geometric arrangement of Glu32 and Glu62 in the FOC explains their behavior in solution and the gas phase, where they both favor the formation of decamers due to the loss of a repulsive negative charge. The FOC in the H65A mutant is destabilized through the loss of this metal coordinating residue and potential positive charge carrier, thus favoring the monomer in solution and the gas phase."

Protein-Fe mixtures were centrifuged at 13,000 <i>x</i> g to remove precipitated material and desalted prior to the Fe and protein content analysis by ferrozine assay and BCA microplate assay, respectively. Fe to protein ratio was calculated to indicate the Fe binding capacity of the protein. Protein stability was compromised at high iron concentrations; therefore, the highest iron loading with the least protein precipitation was used to derive the maximum iron loading capacity per biological assembly (underlined and highlighted in bold). The biological unit assemblies are a decamer for EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>, a 60mer for encapsulin, a 60mer of encapsulin loaded with 12 copies of decameric EncFtn in the complex, and 24mer for horse spleen apoferritin. Errors are quoted as the standard deviation of three technical repeats in both the ferrozine and BCA microplate assays. The proteins used in Fe loading experiment came from a single preparation."

In the E32A mutant the position of the side chains of the remaining iron coordinating residues in the FOC is essentially unchanged, but the absence of the axial-metal coordinating ligand provided by the Glu32 side chain abrogates metal binding in this site. The Glu31/34-site also lacks metal, with the side chain of Glu31 rotated by 180\u00b0\u00a0at the C<sub>\u03b2</sub> in the absence of metal (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The H65A mutant diverges significantly from the wild type in the position of the residues Glu32 and Tyr39 in the FOC.

                        "text": "Our study reports on a new class of ferritin-like proteins (EncFtn), which are associated with bacterial encapsulin nanocompartments (Enc). By studying the EncFtn from <i>R. rubrum</i> we demonstrate that iron binding results in assembly of EncFtn decamers, which display a unique annular architecture. Despite a radically different quaternary structure to the classical ferritins, the four-helical bundle scaffold and FOC of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> are strikingly similar to ferritin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). A sequence-based phylogenetic tree for proteins in the ferritin family was constructed; in addition to the classical ferritins, bacterioferritins and Dps proteins, our analysis included the encapsulin-associated ferritin-like proteins (EncFtns) and a group related to these, but lacking the encapsulin sequence (Non-EncFtn). The analysis revealed that the EncFtn and Non-EncFtn proteins form groups distinct from the other clearly delineated groups of ferritins, and represent outliers in the tree (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). While it is difficult to infer ancestral lineages in protein families, the similarity seen in the active site scaffold of these proteins highlights a shared evolutionary relationship between EncFtn proteins and other members of the ferritin superfamily that has been noted in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andrews, 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">Lundin et al., 2012</a>). From this analysis, we propose that the four-helical fold of the classical ferritins may have arisen through gene duplication of an ancestor of EncFtn. This gene duplication would result in the C-terminal region of one EncFtn monomer being linked to the N-terminus of another and thus stabilizing the four-helix bundle fold within a single polypeptide chain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Linking the protein together in this way relaxes the requirement for the maintenance of a symmetrical FOC and thus provides a path to the diversity in active-site residues seen across the ferritin family (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, residues Glu95, Gln128 and Glu131 in PmFtn, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andrews, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lundin et al., 2012</a>)."

The oxidation and mineralization of iron must be spatially separated from the host cytosol to prevent the formation of damaging hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Honarmand Ebrahimi et al., 2012</a>).\u00a0This is achieved in all ferritins by confining the oxidation of iron to the interior of the protein complex, thus achieving sequestration of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> mineralization product. A structural alignment of the FOC of EncFtn with the classical ferritin PmFtn shows that the central ring of EncFtn corresponds to the external surface of ferritin, while the outer circumference of EncFtn is congruent with the inner mineralization surface of ferritin (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This overlay highlights the fact that the ferroxidase center of EncFtn faces in the opposite direction relative to the classical ferritins and is essentially inside out regarding iron storage space (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, boxed region). Analysis of each of the single mutations (E32A, E62A and H65A) made in the FOC highlights the importance of the iron-coordinating residues in the catalytic activity of EncFtn. Furthermore, the position of the calcium ion coordinated by Glu31 and Glu34 seen in the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> structure suggests an entry site to channel metal ions into the FOC; we propose that this site binds hydrated iron ions <i>in vivo</i> and acts as a selectivity filter and gate for the FOC (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haldar et al., 2011</a>). The constellation of charged residues on the outer circumference of EncFtn (His57, Glu61 and Glu64) could function in the same way as the residues lining the mineralization surface within the classical ferritin nanocage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Le Brun et al., 2010</a>), and given their proximity to the FOC these sites may be the exit portal and mineralization site (<a href=\"#bib27\">Honarmand Ebrahimi et al., 2012</a>)."

Our biochemical characterization of EncFtn supports this hypothesis, indicating that while this protein is capable of oxidizing iron, it does not accrue mineralized iron in an analogous manner to classical ferritins. While EncFtn does not store iron itself, its association with the encapsulin nanocage suggests that mineralization occurs within the cavity of the encapsulin shell (<a href=\"#bib38\">McHugh\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>). Our ferroxidase assay data on the recombinant EncFtn-Enc nanocompartments, which accrue over 4100 iron ions per complex and form regular nanoparticles, are consistent with the encapsulin protein acting as the store for iron oxidized by the EncFtn enzyme. TEM analysis of the reaction products shows the production of homogeneous iron nanoparticles only in the EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Thus, it appears that the EncFtn decamer is the physiological state of this protein. This arrangement positions the central ring of EncFtn directly above the pore at the five-fold symmetry axis of the encapsulin shell and highlights a potential route for the entry of iron into the encapsulin and towards the active site of EncFtn. A comparison of the encapsulin nanocompartment and the ferritin nanocage highlights the size differential between the two complexes (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14B</a>) that allows the encapsulin to store significantly more iron. The presence of five FOCs per EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer and the fact that the icosahedral encapsulin nanocage can hold up to twelve of decameric EncFtn between each of the internal five-fold vertices means that they can achieve a high rate of iron mineralization across the entire nanocompartment. This arrangement of multiple reaction centers in a single protein assembly is reminiscent of classical ferritins, which has 24 FOCs distributed around the nanocage."

A single pentamer of the icosahedral <i>T. maritima</i> encapsulin structure (PDBID: 3DKT) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sutter et al., 2008</a>) is shown as a blue surface with the encapsulin localization sequence of EncFtn shown as a purple surface. The C-terminal regions of the EncFtn subunits correspond to the position of the localization sequences seen in 3DKT. Alignment of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> with 3DKT positions the central channel directly above the pore in the 3DKT pentamer axis (shown as a grey pentagon). (<b>B</b>) Surface view of EncFtn within the encapsulin nanocompartment (grey and blue respectively). The lumen of the encapsulin nanocompartment is considerably larger than the interior of ferritin (shown in orange behind the encapsulin for reference) and thus allows the storage of significantly more iron. The proposed pathway for iron movement through the encapsulin shell and EncFtn FOC is shown with arrows. (<b>C</b>) Model ofiron oxidation within an encapsulin nanocompartment. As EncFtn is unable to mineralize iron on its surface directly, Fe<sup>2+</sup> must pass through the encapsulin shell to access the first metal binding site within the central channel of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> (entry site) prior to oxidation within the FOC and release as Fe<sup>3+</sup> to the outer surface of the protein where it can be mineralized within the lumen of the encapsulin cage."

The crystal structure of the <i>T. maritima</i> encapsulin shell protein has a negatively charged pore positioned to allow the passage of Fe<sup>2+</sup> into the encapsulin and directs the metal towards the central, negatively charged hole of the EncFtn ring (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The five metal-binding sites on the interior of the ring (Glu31/34-sites) may select for the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion and direct it towards their cognate FOCs.

In order to obtain Fe-bound EncFtn, 100 \u00b5M or 300 \u00b5M of freshly prepared FeCl<sub>2</sub> was added to apo-EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> (monomer peak) immediately prior to buffer exchange into 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.0). Samples were analyzed on a quadrupole ion-mobility time of flight instrument (Synapt G2, Waters Corp., Manchester, UK), equipped with a nanomate nanoelectrospray infusion robot (Advion Biosciences,\u00a0Ithaca,\u00a0NY). Instrument parameters were tuned to preserve non-covalent protein complexes. After optimization, typical parameters were: nanoelectrospray voltage 1.54 kV; sample cone 50 V; extractor cone 0 V; trap collision voltage 4 V; source temperature 80\u00b0C; and source backing pressure 5.5 mbar. For improved mass resolution the sample cone was raised to 155 V. Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) was performed using the travelling-wave mobility cell in the Synapt G2, employing nitrogen as the drift gas. Typically, the IMS wave velocity was set to 300 m/s; wave height to 15 V; and the IMS pressure was 1.8 mbar. All native MS experiments were performed on samples from two independent protein preparations. For collision cross section determination, IM-MS data was calibrated using denatured equine myoglobin and data was analyzed using Driftscope v2.5 and MassLynx v4.1 (Waters Corp., UK). Theoretical collision cross sections (CCS) were calculated from pdb files using IMPACT software v. 0.9.1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marklund, 2015</a>). In order to obtain information on the topology of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> assembly, gas-phase dissociation of the Fe-associated EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> complex was achieved by increasing the sample cone and/or trap collision voltage prior to MS analysis."

The widespread nature of these compartments and their potential physiological roles have only been appreciated recently.

Here, the authors provide the structure of one such cargo and show that it assembles in a manner that is topologically distinct from ferritin. Additionally, the authors provide evidence that metal binding promotes the assembly of the EncFer and that it does act as a ferroxidase.

To ascertain whether the iron in the assays forms \u2018balls of rust\u2019 we performed transmission electron microscopy on the ferroxidase reaction mixtures after completion of the reaction to assess the formation of free, or encapsulated iron minerals. We provide an additional supplemental figure (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and discuss the observation of iron mineral crystals and nanoparticles in the main text, subsection \u201cFerroxidase activity\u201d, last paragraph. We also attempted to use a commercial luminescence-based ROS detection kit on the reactions to address the possibility that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is produced as a reaction intermediate by the EncFtn protein. We found that the results from this particular kit were inconsistent between repeats, but for the benefit of the reviewer we provide a graph of the results obtained (see <a href=\"#fig15\">Author response image 1</a>). These results show the production of ROS by apoferritin, which is consistent with the published data on the reaction mechanism of certain ferritins; however, no significant ROS were detected for the EncFtn or encapsulin proteins."

The widespread nature of these compartments and their potential physiological roles have only been appreciated recently. While the structure of the encapsulin shell has been determined, that of its cargo, the ferritin-like protein (EncFer), has remained elusive. Here, the authors provide the structure of one such cargo and show that it assembles in a manner that is topologically distinct from ferritin. Additionally, the authors provide evidence that metal binding promotes the assembly of the EncFer and that it does act as a ferroxidase. Altogether, there is a substantial amount of work here that will likely be viewed as a major step forward in understanding these unique bacterial organelles.

Given the fact that the protein is produced recombinantly in <i>E. coli</i> it is not particularly instructive to prove the in vivoproduction of the EncFtn multimer in this host. We have added a panel to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> to show the effect of protein concentration on multimerization in vitro(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Our mass spectrometry results show that the protein spontaneously multimerized in the presence of iron in vitroto form decameric species and that this is metal ion concentration dependent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."
