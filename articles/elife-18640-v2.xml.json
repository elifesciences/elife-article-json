                    "text": "The neural mechanisms underlying hunger are poorly understood. AgRP neurons are activated by energy deficit and promote voracious food consumption, suggesting these cells may supply the fundamental hunger drive that motivates feeding. However recent in vivo recording experiments revealed that AgRP neurons are inhibited within seconds by the sensory detection of food, raising the question of how these cells can promote feeding at all. Here we resolve this paradox by showing that brief optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons before food availability promotes intense appetitive and consummatory behaviors that persist for tens of minutes in the absence of continued AgRP neuron activation. We show that these sustained behavioral responses are mediated by a long-lasting potentiation of the rewarding properties of food and that AgRP neuron activity is positively reinforcing. These findings reveal that hunger neurons drive feeding by transmitting a positive valence signal that triggers a stable transition between behavioral states."

                    "text": "The neural mechanisms underlying hunger are poorly understood. AgRP neurons are activated by energy deficit and promote voracious food consumption, suggesting these cells may supply the fundamental hunger drive that motivates feeding. However recent in vivo recording experiments revealed that AgRP neurons are inhibited within seconds by the sensory detection of food, raising the question of how these cells can promote feeding at all. Here we resolve this paradox by showing that brief optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons before food availability promotes intense appetitive and consummatory behaviors that persist for tens of minutes in the absence of continued AgRP neuron activation. We show that these sustained behavioral responses are mediated by a long-lasting potentiation of the rewarding properties of food and that AgRP neuron activity is positively reinforcing. These findings reveal that hunger neurons drive feeding by transmitting a positive valence signal that triggers a stable transition between behavioral states."

Optogenetic or chemogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons promotes intense food consumption as well as appetitive behaviors that lead to food discovery (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>), whereas inhibition of these neurons leads to aphagia (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gropp et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Luquet et al., 2005</a>).

According to this model, AgRP neurons are activated by gradual changes in the concentrations of hormones such as leptin and ghrelin that develop during food deprivation. This generates a \u201chunger drive\u201d that motivates animals to find and consume food and persists until food consumption restores these hormones to their previous level, thereby inhibiting AgRP neurons and quelling the desire to eat."

These experiments unexpectedly revealed that AgRP neurons are inhibited within seconds by the mere sight and smell of food, or by conditioned cues that predict food availability. These responses were much too fast to be mediated by a hormonal signal, implying that they arise from changes in neural input. Paradoxically, this rapid inhibition was often complete before a single bite of food could be consumed, such that AgRP neuron activity was greatly reduced prior to the onset of feeding. This observation raises the question of how AgRP neurons are able to drive feeding at all."

An important unresolved question regards when AgRP neuron activity must occur in order to influence feeding behavior. While it has long been assumed that AgRP neurons promote feeding primarily through firing that occurs during the act of food intake (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>), an alternative possibility is that AgRP neuron activity before food obtainment could be sufficient to elicit the voracious feeding that occurs later (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Knight, 2016</a>). If such a mechanism were operational, then it would explain how AgRP neurons could promote food intake despite being silenced at the beginning of a meal by sensory cues."

We find that this preparatory photostimulation is sufficient to elicit voracious food consumption and vigorous operant responding for food in well-fed animals. These sustained behavioral effects develop rapidly, persist for tens of minutes, and can be triggered by stimulation of several distinct anatomic pathways. We show that these long-lasting behavioral changes are mediated by a motivational switch that magnifies the positively rewarding properties of food, and furthermore that AgRP neuron activity is positively reinforcing. These findings reconcile the function of AgRP neurons with their paradoxical natural dynamics, and in doing so reveal the motivational mechanism by which these cells drive food consumption."

Ad libitum fed mice expressing channelrhodopsin in AgRP neurons (AgRP-ChR2; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) were acclimated to a behavioral chamber early in the light phase, a time when mice ordinarily eat little, and photostimulated for one hour in the absence of food. Photostimulation was then terminated and food was made available (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Strikingly, we found that this preparatory photostimulation triggered intense feeding upon subsequent food presentation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013G</a>). This voracious feeding approached the level of food consumption observed following an overnight fast (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>); it did not require learning, as it was observed in the first trial of every mouse (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); and it was absent from control mice that lacked ChR2 expression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus stimulation of AgRP neurons in the absence of food is sufficient to elicit intense food consumption at a later time when food is made available. Importantly, this observation provides an explanation for how AgRP neurons can promote feeding despite being inhibited at a meal\u2019s outset by the sensory detection of food (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

Prestimulation of AgRP neurons for as little one minute was sufficient to increase food intake above the baseline level of unstimulated mice (0.34 \u00b1 0.03 vs 0.14 \u00b1 0.03\u2009g, p&lt;0.01), indicating that the response begins to develop rapidly. Increasing the duration of prestimulation progressively increased the amount of food consumed, reaching a plateau at approximately 30 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). This relationship between prestimulation duration and subsequent food intake displayed first order association kinetics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96), suggesting that AgRP neuron activity transmits a saturable signal that \u201cbuilds up\u201d in a downstream circuit element. Consistent with this model, the sustained effects of AgRP neuron activity did not require a specific sequence of light pulses (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), although intermittent, high frequency stimulation (20\u2009Hz) was slightly more effective than tonic lower frequency stimulation (10\u2009Hz) at eliciting feeding when the total number of light pulses was held constant. These sustained effects were long-lasting, as the\u00a0introduction of a delay of 30 min between the offset of AgRP neuron stimulation and onset of food availability only modestly decreased subsequent food consumption (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Analysis of the microstructure of feeding revealed that these long-lasting effects were manifest primarily as an increase in bout size, rather than bout number (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>). Thus AgRP neuron activity transmits a hunger signal that accumulates in a downstream circuit element on a timescale of approximately 30 min, resulting in a sustained potentiation of feeding that persists even after AgRP neurons have been silenced."

To test this, we examined thirst-promoting neurons in the subfornical organ that express Nos1 (SFO<sup>Nos1</sup> neurons). SFO<sup>Nos1</sup> neurons are activated by circulating signals of fluid balance, and their artificial stimulation is sufficient to drive voracious drinking even in water sated animals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Betley et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oka et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zimmerman et al., 2016</a>). We delivered ChR2 to SFO<sup>Nos1</sup> neurons by stereotaxic injection of a Cre dependent AAV into the SFO of Nos1-IRES-Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and then measured the effects of optogenetic stimulation of these cells on water consumption (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As previously reported, photostimulation of SFO<sup>Nos1</sup> neurons resulted in rapid and intense drinking (508 \u00b1 68 licks for stimulated animals versus 3 \u00b1 1 licks for controls, p&lt;0.001 <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). However, unlike AgRP neurons, prestimulation of SFO<sup>Nos1</sup> neurons for one hour prior to water access had no effect on subsequent water intake (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). We confirmed that this was not due to a technical problem associated with chronic photostimulation of these cells, because 30 min of prestimulation did not impair the ability of subsequent co-stimulation in the presence of water to drive drinking (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, column 3). Thus the persistent mechanism utilized by AgRP neurons to promote feeding does not generalize to related ingestive circuits."

For example, optogenetic or chemogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons motivates animals to perform instrumental responses such as lever pressing in order to obtain a food reward (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>). It has been hypothesized that the rapid inhibition of AgRP neurons by the sensory detection of food may serve as a signal that inhibits these appetitive behaviors, thereby enabling the transition from foraging to feeding (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Knight, 2016</a>). However, this possibility has never been directly tested."

We trained AgRP-ChR2 mice to lever press for food pellets and then tested them in a progressive ratio 3 (PR3) reinforcement schedule (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), in which an increasing number of lever presses are required to obtain each successive food reward (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hodos, 1961</a>). In the absence of prior photostimulation, AgRP-ChR2 mice engaged in a low level of operant responding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), consistent with the fact that ad libitum fed mice have little motivation to work for food. In contrast, prestimulation of AgRP neurons for one hour caused animals to engage in vigorous pressing when the levers were subsequently made available (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). This operant responding was specifically directed toward the food reward, because animals pressed the active lever much more frequently than the inactive lever (223 \u00b1 29 for active lever vs. 28 \u00b1 6 inactive, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). This response was also specific to AgRP neuron activation, because it was absent from sham stimulated mice that lacked ChR2 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus prestimulation of AgRP neurons generates long-lasting motivation to work for food that persists even in the absence of continued AgRP neuron activity. This indicates that both appetitive and consummatory behaviors can be driven by a sustained signal from AgRP neurons."

This learned incentive value would then motivate the mice to eat those pellets in future trials even when not food deprived. A prediction of this model is that this specific appetite should undergo extinction if the test pellets are simply provided to the mice in their home cage, so that the pellets become dissociated from AgRP neuron prestimulation. This was indeed the case: providing the mice with overnight access to the test pellets abolished the conditioned appetite in the next trial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a> red). To test this a different way, we prepared a second cohort of laser na\u00efve mice that were given ad libitum access to the test pellets in their home cage from the beginning of the trial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a> black). These animals showed no evidence of conditioned appetite when trained under otherwise identical conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, black, days 4 and 6). Thus AgRP neuron activity can condition appetite for specific foods that are consumed after AgRP neurons have shut off, such that these foods are later consumed in the absence of homeostatic need. This suggests that AgRP neuron prestimulation can attribute incentive value to the sensory properties of subsequently consumed food."

In a baseline trial, AgRP-ChR2 mice were given access two different flavors of non-caloric gels (strawberry and orange) and the amount of each consumed was recorded. The\u00a0mice were then conditioned on four consecutive days by pairing access to the less preferred gel with 30 min of AgRP neuron prestimulation, whereas the preferred gel was paired with 30 min of mock stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The order of these conditioning sessions was randomized each day and they were separated by at least four hours. On day seven, the\u00a0mice were then tested by providing simultaneous access to both gels and measuring consumption of each. We found that this conditioning protocol robustly reversed the mice\u2019s flavor preference, such that the less preferred flavor became more preferred (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Thus, animals learn to prefer flavors that are preceded by AgRP neuron activation, consistent with the idea that AgRP neuron activity induces a long-lasting potentiation of the rewarding sensory properties of food."

The effect of this mechanism is to transform AgRP neuron firing before food availability into a sustained drive that can motivate feeding later. An important question is whether this positive valence mechanism is sufficiently strong to account for the dramatic instrumental responses (e.g. lever pressing, nose poking) that animals exhibit following AgRP neuron activation. Of note, a previous study reported that mice failed to perform operant responses in order to shut off AgRP neuron activity, indicating that these neurons do not motivate behavior by negative reinforcement (<a href=\"#bib8\">Betley et al., 2015</a>), which we confirmed independently (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Mice had ad libitum access to food during both training and testing. We then tested these mice in 150 min trials during the light phase to see whether they would engage in operant responding for AgRP neuron stimulation. Strikingly, we found that mice engaged in lever pressing in order to optically stimulate their AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This lever pressing was specifically directed toward AgRP neuron self-stimulation, because it (1) was highly biased toward the active versus inactive lever (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,H</a>), (2) was greatly reduced in control mice that lacked ChR2 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>), and (3) underwent rapid extinction when the active lever was uncoupled from the laser (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Importantly, the effectiveness of this lever pressing in stimulating AgRP neurons was confirmed by two separate measures. First, we observed reliable temporal coordination between lever pressing and food intake in mice allowed to self-stimulate: mice engaged in repeated cycles of lever pressing followed by food consumption (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>), whereas food consumption was greatly reduced when the lever was uncoupled from the laser (1.5 \u00b1 0.2\u2009g for active laser vs. 0.39 \u00b1 0.07\u2009g for inactive laser, p&lt;0.001). Second, we observed strong induction of the activity marker Fos in AgRP neurons from mice allowed to lever press for self-stimulation, whereas no Fos was observed in otherwise identical trials in which the laser was inactivated (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus mice will actively lever press in order to stimulate their AgRP neurons, indicating that the activity of these cells is positively reinforcing under these conditions."

The second is that AgRP neuron activity becomes rewarding specifically in the presence of food, because it magnifies food\u2019s intrinsic positive valence. In the latter case, mice may self-stimulate their AgRP neurons for one of two reasons: in order to enhance the incentive value of the food directly in front of them during the trial (hypothesis 2a), or because of a learned positive association that developed during training when mice lever pressed for self-stimulation in the presence of food (hypothesis 2b)."

We then tested whether these mice would lever press for self-stimulation. These mice were ad libitum fed, but food was absent during the testing. Under these conditions, we found that mice engaged in minimal lever pressing that was indistinguishable from control mice that lacked ChR2 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). This indicates that AgRP neuron stimulation is not intrinsically rewarding (hypothesis 1), but that prior experience self-stimulating AgRP neurons in the presence of food is sufficient for lever pressing to become positively reinforcing in food\u2019s absence (hypothesis 2b). Taken together, these data strongly support a model in which AgRP neuron activity results in a long-lasting potentiation of the rewarding properties of food. This sustained positive valence signal is sufficient to condition both Pavlovian and instrumental learning, and likely accounts for much of the behavioral response that is elicited by AgRP neuron activity."

Nearly twenty years of investigation into the properties of these cells led to a widely accepted model for their function. The key tenets of this model were that (1) AgRP neuron activity drives feeding directly, and (2) the level of AgRP neuron activity is controlled by changes in hormones and nutrients. Both of these tenets were challenged by the recent discovery that AgRP neurons are rapidly inhibited by the sensory detection of food (<a href=\"#bib8\">Betley et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, because AgRP neurons are inhibited before feeding begins, it has been unclear how these neurons are able to drive food consumption at all (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Knight, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Seeley and Berridge, 2015</a>)."

This would enable AgRP neuron activity before food discovery to drive feeding that occurs later, long after AgRP neurons have been silenced by sensory cues. Here we have shown that this is indeed a robust mechanism by which AgRP neurons can drive food consumption. We have shown that stimulation of AgRP neurons for as little as one minute is sufficient to increase subsequent food intake over baseline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>); that this hunger signal builds up progressively over the course of 30\u201360 min, until prestimulated animals eat nearly as much food as mice fasted overnight (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>); and that this dramatic response is robust to insertion of a delay of tens of minutes between the offset of AgRP neuron stimulation and the onset of feeding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Thus these findings explain how the remarkable behavioral effects of AgRP neurons can be reconciled with their paradoxical natural dynamics."

For this reason, the possibility that AgRP neuron firing and feeding behavior could be separated in time by tens of minutes was unforeseen, and we are aware of few precedents in which such a vigorous and acute behavioral response can be elicited following such a long delay (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hoopfer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015</a>). Consistent with this, we found no evidence for sustained behavioral effects following stimulation of an analogous population of neurons that control thirst (SFO<sup>Nos1</sup> neurons): for these cells, drinking behavior was tightly timelocked to the laser stimulus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Intriguingly, AgRP neuron prestimulation also strongly potentiated appetitive behaviors, since prestimulated animals were willing to perform intense lever pressing in order to obtain a food reward (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Thus the sustained effects of AgRP neuron activity are not restricted to consummatory actions such as licking, chewing, and swallowing, but also extend to flexible, goal oriented behaviors associated with food obtainment. This suggests that the entire \u201chunger drive\u201d that motivates food seeking and consumption is transferred to a downstream circuit node during AgRP neuron firing, such that this drive becomes independent of continued AgRP neuron activity."

The fact that these effects are robust to the\u00a0introduction of a 30 min delay implies that they must result from a stable change in the internal state of the mouse, rather than some feedback process that requires interaction with food. This stable change would presumably be detected as the persistent activity (or inactivity) of a population of neurons downstream of AgRP neurons within the feeding circuit. Such cells would be predicted to integrate AgRP neuron activity over time, so that they responded to rapid changes in AgRP neuron activity with a delay, thereby enabling feeding to continue after AgRP neurons have been silenced by sensory cues (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Knight, 2016</a>). We have shown that projections to the PVH, BNST, and LHA are each individually sufficient to drive long-lasting increases in food intake (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In addition, a recent report showed that consumption of palatable foods can be potentiated by prestimulation of AgRP neuron projections to the parabrachial nucleus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Campos et al., 2016</a>).

These mechanisms are often invoked to explain neural processes that have a duration of seconds, such as maintenance of working memory, rather than the behavioral potentiation that persists for tens of minutes described here. Whether similar or different mechanisms underlie the control of feeding by AgRP neurons remains unknown. Addressing this question will require detailed analysis of the dynamics and physiology of relevant downstream circuit elements, which may be the direct targets of AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib7\">Betley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Campos et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dietrich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Garfield et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Padilla et al., 2016</a>) or alternatively cells that are several synapses removed from the arcuate feeding circuit (<a href=\"#bib57\">Seeley and Berridge, 2015</a>)."

While we have not measured how AgRP neurons respond to our stimulation protocol in vivo, available evidence suggests that optogenetic stimulation does not result in sustained activation of these cells. This evidence includes (1) the observation from in vivo optrode recordings (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</a>) that ~5 min of intermittent 20\u2009Hz optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons does not result in a sustained alteration of firing (31/33 neurons returned to baseline immediately upon laser offset, and the remaining two cells within two minutes); and (2) the finding from slice recordings that 30 min of intermittent 20\u2009Hz optogenetic stimulation does not result in a sustained increase in AgRP neuron firing in vitro (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>). In addition, it is important to note that the sensory detection of food can inhibit AgRP neurons even in the presence of ongoing excitatory input, such as high dose ghrelin treatment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Therefore the presentation of food would likely inhibit any residual AgRP neuron activation that persisted after photostimulation, and consequently the interpretation of the experiments described here would be largely unchanged. Nevertheless, future experiments that record AgRP neuron activity in vivo in the context of different optogenetic stimulation paradigms will further clarify this issue."

However, we believe that AgRP is unlikely to mediate the behavioral responses described here, for two reasons. First, the behavioral responses we observe following AgRP neuron prestimulation are almost immediate, in that animals begin to eat within seconds of food presentation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). By contrast the release of the AgRP neuropeptide requires at least two hours to affect feeding (<a href=\"#bib36\">Krashes et al., 2013</a>). Thus the AgRP neuropeptide appears to act too slowly to explain our findings. Second, our projection stimulation experiments show that AgRP neuron projections to the PVH and BNST are both efficient in driving sustained feeding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However AgRP neuron projections to the BNST have been shown to function by targeting BNST neurons that do not express the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), which is the target of AgRP (<a href=\"#bib27\">Garfield et al., 2015</a>). This implies that the AgRP neuropeptide cannot be the molecule that drives feeding in our ARC \u2192 BNST stimulation experiments, and therefore that other neurotransmitters released by these cells (GABA or NPY) must underlie their sustained effects."

We found that prior AgRP neuron stimulation robustly conditioned flavor and food preference (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This effect was sufficient to motivate mice following a single trial to overeat a test food that had been paired with AgRP neuron prestimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Importantly, this conditioned appetite was specific to the food paired with AgRP neuron prestimulation, because it could be blocked by ad libitum access to the paired food but not a different, unpaired food (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). A similar phenomenon, known as \u2018conditioned craving\u2019, has been observed in rats that are fed a specific kind of pellet only when food deprived (<a href=\"#bib52\">Petrovich et al., 2007</a>). The finding that this food-specific craving can be trained by AgRP neuron prestimulation argues that these neurons motivate feeding by potentiating the incentive salience or perceived rewarding properties of food encountered during a state of energy deficit (<a href=\"#bib57\">Seeley and Berridge, 2015</a>). Of note, the idea that food deprivation can magnify food reward has long been recognized as a critical mechanism that drives feeding (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berridge, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cabanac, 1971</a>), but the underlying neural mechanisms have been unclear.

This observation is again most readily explained by a model in which AgRP neurons enhance food\u2019s intrinsically rewarding properties. By contrast, these findings do not support a model in which AgRP neurons motivate food consumption primarily through a negative valence signal (<a href=\"#bib8\">Betley et al., 2015</a>), since animals do not self-administer aversive stimuli."

This has revealed that AgRP neurons transmit a previously unsuspected positive valence signal that can robustly condition appetite (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and motivate instrumental responding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Therefore, these data support an important role for a long-lasting, positive valence mechanism by which AgRP neurons motivate food consumption. Nevertheless, these arguments do not rule out an additional role for a negative valence signal that functions primarily prior to food discovery and contributes to food seeking or learning (<a href=\"#bib8\">Betley et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, there is evidence that both positive and negative valence mechanisms contribute to the control of feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berridge, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bindra, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fulton, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hull, 1943</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lockie and Andrews, 2013</a>). Investigation of the neural circuitry downstream of AgRP neurons may provide additional insight into how these parallel mechanisms are coordinated."

An assumption implicit in most optogenetic experiments is that the pattern of artificial stimulation approximates the natural firing pattern of the cells, at least in its key features: otherwise, the relevance of any optically-elicited behavior is unclear. While this caveat is widely understood, the lack of information about the in vivo dynamics of many cell types has often precluded consideration of their natural firing patterns. For AgRP neurons, it was long assumed that these cells are highly active during feeding and only inhibited following food consumption, and this model guided the design of early optogenetic studies. However the discovery that AgRP neurons are inhibited by the sensory detection of food, and therefore have a firing pattern during feeding that is the opposite of what was believed, calls for reinvestigation of how these cells control behavior. Here we have explored this question by using a prestimulation protocol that mimics the broad features of the natural dynamics of AgRP neurons. Using this new stimulation protocol, we are able to reconcile the paradoxical dynamics of AgRP neurons with their well-established function to promote feeding; identify novel mechanisms by which these neurons motivate behavior; and raise new questions about the downstream feeding circuit that await investigation."

Multiple measurements from the same mouse in the same experiment (e.g. on different days) were considered technical repeats and were averaged before statistical analysis. The average of these technical repeats for each mouse in each experiment was considered a single biological repeat and was used to determine sample size for statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using Graphpad Prism 6 to test for an effect of genotype and stimulation protocol (experiments with WT control) or one-way ANOVA (experiments without WT control). Individual p-values were corrected using Holm-Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison test. Regression analysis for experiments investigating feeding kinetics was performed using Graphpad."

This should be discussed as possibility for the observations. It is realized that the initial finding of prestim evoking food intake occurs even at 10 Hz photostimulation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) but the remainder of the studies are done at the higher frequency."

It would be insightful to either eliminate this possibility or demonstrate this through combinatorial photometry/optogenetics. However, given the difficulty of such an experiment, a mention of this possibility would be sufficient."

In addition, it is not clear that the approach used (optogenetic stimulation) is altering the excitability of the neurons beyond the period of light exposure. It would be important to record AgRP neuron activity here to understand whether these neurons are switching off or not after ceasing light exposure. Other approaches and controls should be used, including AgRP neuronal inhibition."

The authors note the difference in size, shape and texture between the two food sources but don't elaborate on those specific distinctions or any differences in the nutritive content.

This observation has been logically interpreted to imply that continued stimulation of AgRP neurons is necessary for the acute feeding response. This conclusion is consistent with the general assumption that a neuron driving a behavior should fire during or immediately preceding the behavior\u2019s execution. However we show that this is not the case for AgRP neurons. Instead, the behavioral response can be elicited by prestimulation that occurs tens of minutes before the food is presented. This has never before been shown and is quite surprising. Indeed, we show that an analogous population of thirst neurons do not have this property (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."
