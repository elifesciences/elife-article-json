Despite extant homology between certain subunits, the degree of structural and organizational overlap between budding yeast and metazoan ORC has been unclear. Using 3D electron microscopy, we determined the subunit organization of metazoan ORC, revealing that it adopts a global architecture very similar to the budding yeast complex. Bioinformatic analysis extends this conservation to Orc6, a subunit of somewhat enigmatic function. Unexpectedly, a mutation in the Orc6 C-terminus linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a dwarfism disorder, impedes proper recruitment of Orc6 into ORC; biochemical studies reveal that this region of Orc6 associates with a previously uncharacterized domain of Orc3 and is required for ORC function and MCM2\u20137 loading in vivo. Together, our results suggest that Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutations in Orc6 impair the formation of ORC hexamers, interfering with appropriate ORC functions."

Despite extant homology between certain subunits, the degree of structural and organizational overlap between budding yeast and metazoan ORC has been unclear. Using 3D electron microscopy, we determined the subunit organization of metazoan ORC, revealing that it adopts a global architecture very similar to the budding yeast complex. Bioinformatic analysis extends this conservation to Orc6, a subunit of somewhat enigmatic function. Unexpectedly, a mutation in the Orc6 C-terminus linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a dwarfism disorder, impedes proper recruitment of Orc6 into ORC; biochemical studies reveal that this region of Orc6 associates with a previously uncharacterized domain of Orc3 and is required for ORC function and MCM2\u20137 loading in vivo. Together, our results suggest that Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutations in Orc6 impair the formation of ORC hexamers, interfering with appropriate ORC functions."

The mutations in Orc6 that are associated with this syndrome are in the C-terminus, which suggests that some symptoms of the syndrome may be caused by DNA replication not being initiated correctly. Consistent with this idea, Bleichert et al. show that the introduction of the Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutation into Orc6 prevents this subunit from binding to the rest of ORC, and similar mutations do not support DNA replication in in vivo experiments. These results should increase our understanding of the function of Orc6 and its role in Meier-Gorlin syndrome, and also provide new insights into the changes in ORC architecture that have occurred during evolution."

How individual ORC subunits co-assemble with each other and the nature of the structural transitions that occur within ORC and other pre-RC components during nucleotide-dependent initiation steps are ill-defined, in part due to a paucity of structures for key ORC reaction states. Electron microscopy (EM) studies have provided medium-to-low resolution pictures of the general architecture of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Drosophila</i> ORC, and subunit positions within ORC further have been systematically mapped for the yeast complex (<a href=\"#bib69\">Speck et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Clarey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib73\">2013</a>); however, poor similarity between the 3D reconstructions obtained for the different species, combined with conflicting biochemical data on ORC subunit interactions, have led to different models of subunit arrangement and DNA engagement for the two eukaryotic initiators (<a href=\"#bib80\">Vashee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kneissl et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuda et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Clarey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Li and Stillman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al., 2012</a>).

Based on the fact that MGS mutations cluster in pre-RC components, it has been suggested that the clinical phenotype is caused by defects in DNA replication initiation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Guernsey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bicknell et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">b</a>). Consistent with this interpretation, cells derived from MGS patients with mutations in Orc1 show reduced recruitment of ORC subunits and replicative helicase components to chromatin, and are compromised in their ability to replicate plasmid DNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bicknell et al., 2011b</a>); recent work has also shown a link between origin licensing factors and non-replicative cellular processes, such as centrosome duplication and cilia formation, in MGS patient cells and in cells depleted of licensing proteins (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Stiff et al., 2013</a>). Most MGS mutations in Orc1 lie in the N-terminal domain, which is not part of the central core of ORC, and have been implicated interfering with Orc1\u2019s Cyclin E-CDK2 inhibitory function of centrosome duplication (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</a>). By contrast, the means by which certain mutations in Orc4 and Orc6 result in an MGS phenotype has yet to be determined. Orc6 is particularly enigmatic in this regard: unlike Orc1\u2013Orc5, Orc6 is poorly conserved between budding yeast and metazoans, both in sequence and in aspects of its function (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lee and Bell, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chesnokov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Prasanth et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chesnokov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Semple et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balasov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Duncker et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bernal and Venkitaraman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Bell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Takara and Bell, 2011</a>)."

Using EM we find that apo-<i>Dm</i>ORC is conformationally heterogeneous, but that the non-hydrolysable nucleotide analog ATP\u03b3S locks the complex in a specific conformation that permitted the determination of its 3D structure to 22 \u00c5 resolution. Experimental localization of all subunits reveals that the subunit architecture of <i>Dm</i>ORC is preserved compared to <i>S. cerevisiae</i> ORC (<i>Sc</i>ORC), reconciling different models proposed previously for the two systems. Interestingly, sequence analyses show that this similarity extends to the domain structure of Orc6, suggesting analogous functions for Orc6 from yeast and metazoans. Consistent with this notion, we find that recruitment of Orc6 into ORC across multiple species is aided by the interaction of its C-terminus with a novel domain that resides between the AAA<sup>+</sup>-like and winged-helix domains of Orc3. Strikingly, a mutation found in patients with Meier-Gorlin syndrome maps to a highly-conserved C-terminal segment in Orc6, destabilizing the interaction of <i>Drosophila</i> and human Orc6 with both Orc3 alone and with the core Orc1\u20135 subcomplex. Orc6 transgenes containing mutations in the conserved C-terminal tail fail to incorporate into <i>Dm</i>ORC in vivo, and do not complement an <i>orc6</i>-null allele when introduced into flies. Taken together, these results suggest that the MGS mutation in Orc6 directly affects the integrity of ORC, and indicate that destabilization of ORC contributes to the pathogenesis of Meier-Gorlin syndrome caused by mutations in Orc6, ultimately interfering with pre-RC assembly and origin licensing."

However, the maximal obtainable resolution for these early EM reconstructions was relatively low (34 \u00c5 and 33 \u00c5 resolution, respectively), suggesting that conformational heterogeneity still existed within the ORC sample. To improve the resolution, we therefore tested whether different nucleotide analogs or increased concentrations of ATP\u03b3S could improve conformational uniformity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Similar to prior observations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clarey et al., 2006</a>), 2D EM class averages of apo-ORC yielded crescent-shaped particles. Inclusion of 1 mM ATP, ADP or the non-hydrolysable ATP analog AMPPNP appeared similar to apo-ORC in 2D class averages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, the addition of 1 mM ATP\u03b3S revealed hitherto unobserved detailed features of ORC, indicating that ATP\u03b3S stabilizes interactions between subunits and traps ORC in a better defined conformational state. The ATP\u03b3S-dependent stabilization seen here proved more pronounced than that seen previously (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clarey et al., 2006</a>), likely due to the higher concentration of nucleotide (1 mM vs 5 \u00b5M) used to ensure saturation of ORC with ATP\u03b3S. Such an effect of ATP\u03b3S on <i>Drosophila</i> ORC is somewhat similar to the nucleotide requirement observed for human ORC complex formation and stability (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ranjan and Gossen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</a>); based on this improved behavior, all subsequent EM studies of <i>Drosophila</i> ORC were performed in the presence of 1 mM ATP\u03b3S."

The structure was refined by iterative projection-matching to a resolution of 22 \u00c5 (as judged by the 0.5 Fourier shell correlation criterion) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), yielding forward projections of the 3D structure in excellent agreement with our reference-free class averages (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>).

We therefore set out to localize individual subunits experimentally by EM, using purified recombinant ORC containing N-terminal MBP- and C-terminal GFP-tags on individual ORC subunits, respectively. Fusion proteins of subunits Orc1\u2013Orc5 were able to form stable hexameric ORC complexes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), allowing for the collection of electron micrographs, 2D classification, and 3D EM reconstructions. Comparison of class averages and 3D volumes of tagged ORC with those of untagged ORC revealed extra densities corresponding to the MBP- or GFP-tags, thus marking the positions of the tagged subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We did not observe extra density for MBP when fused to the N-terminus of full-length Orc1 or Orc2, nor did we see GFP fused to the C-terminus of Orc2 and Orc4 (data not shown), suggesting these protein termini are flexible. However, after deletion of the N-terminal domains of Orc1 and Orc2 (which are predicted to contain disordered regions), density became visible for MBP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). During the subunit mapping process, we were unable to definitively distinguish Orc2 and Orc3 from each other, suggesting that the two subunits lie in close proximity within ORC. Collectively, our data indicate that the AAA<sup>+</sup>-like subunits Orc1\u2013Orc5 comprise the crescent-shaped core of ORC, in the order Orc1-Orc4-Orc5-Orc2/Orc3 (when starting at the lower left of the EM structure) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

Interactions between human and yeast Orc2, Orc3, and Orc6 have previously been investigated; however, conflicting results of subunit interactions have been reported (<a href=\"#bib80\">Vashee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kneissl et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuda et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, the interactions between the <i>Drosophila</i> proteins have not been tested. To identify the subunit that recruits <i>Drosophila</i> Orc6 into ORC, we performed pull-down assays from insect cells co-expressing pairwise combinations of <i>Drosophila</i> Orc2, Orc3, and Orc6, with one subunit containing an MBP-tag used as purification bait. As previously observed for both human and yeast proteins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dhar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vashee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Ranjan and Gossen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuda et al., 2007</a>), <i>Drosophila</i> Orc2 interacted with Orc3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This finding is consistent with our EM localization, which positioned these subunits within similar regions of ORC. Orc6, on the other hand, interacted only with Orc3 and not with Orc2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Since Orc6 appears to contact the subunit at the upper left end in the EM class averages, the Orc3\u2013Orc6 interaction allowed us to refine the subunit order of the core AAA+ subunits to Orc1-Orc4-Orc5-Orc2-Orc3 for <i>Drosophila</i> ORC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts (lower panel) shows that C-terminally truncated Orc6 proteins are expressed at similar levels to full-length wild type Orc6. Despite the clear pull-down results for the N-terminally truncated Orc6 proteins, we were not able to detect two of the proteins (Orc6 147\u2013257 and 187\u2013257) in whole cell extracts, possibly due to expression levels too low to be detected with our Western blot conditions.

Consistent with the pull-down results, C-terminally truncated Orc6 proteins did not bind ORC1\u20135 up to concentrations of 1 \u00b5M ORC1\u20135 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In contrast, the C-terminal 71 amino acid residues of Orc6 bound to ORC1\u20135 with an affinity similar to that of full-length Orc6 (K<sub>d, app</sub> = 4.8 \u00b1 0.6 nM). In addition, the Orc6 C-terminal region co-purified with ORC1\u20135 during several chromatography steps (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, lane 5), and when examined by EM, an MBP-fusion of the C-terminal domain of Orc6 localized to the same region as full-length Orc6 in 2D class averages of ORC, indicating that Orc6 did not dissociate from ORC at concentrations used for EM (30 nM ORC) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

In comparing Orc3 protein sequences from various eukaryotes with archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 proteins, we noticed that Orc3 contains an additional domain inserted between its AAA<sup>+</sup>-like and winged-helix domains that is not found in archaeal homologs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This insertion is conserved across eukaryotic Orc3 orthologs, varies in length from 70 amino acids in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to 190 amino acids in <i>Drosophila,</i> and is not found in Orc1, Orc2, Orc4, or Orc5 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since this extra domain is specific to Orc3, we hypothesized that it might interact with Orc6, specifically with the Orc6 C-terminus. To test this premise, we co-expressed the Orc3 insertion as an MBP fusion protein with full-length or truncated Orc6 and performed pull-down experiments. The Orc3 insertion was able to interact with both full-length Orc6 and all N-terminal Orc6 truncations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Conversely, truncating the C-terminus of Orc6 abolished the interaction with the Orc3 insertion. These results mirror our observations with both full-length Orc3 and with ORC1\u20135, and further demonstrate that the C-terminus of Orc6 helps to tether Orc6 to ORC. Moreover, whereas full-length Orc3 was able to interact with Orc2 in addition to Orc6, the Orc3 insertion was unable to do so, suggesting the Orc2\u2013Orc3 interaction is mediated through the two subunits\u2019 AAA<sup>+</sup>-like and/or winged-helix domains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Intriguingly, the MGS mutation in human Orc6 is a missense alteration that maps to the protein\u2019s C-terminal domain, changing a tyrosine at position 232 to serine. The tyrosine is located in a highly conserved, predicted helical element, and is itself highly conserved among eukaryotic Orc6 orthologs, including budding yeast (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since our findings show that the C-terminal domain of Orc6 is essential for the recruitment of Orc6 into <i>Drosophila</i> ORC, we hypothesized that the MGS mutation may interfere with this function. To test this assumption, we introduced the corresponding Y225S mutation into <i>Drosophila</i> Orc6 and asked whether it could affect either the binary Orc3\u2013Orc6 interaction or hexameric ORC formation. In addition, we included another mutant, W228A/K229A, which substitutes an invariant tryptophan close to Y225 and a highly conserved basic amino acid for alanine. Orc6-W228A/K229A is not able to rescue an Orc6 deletion in <i>Drosophila</i> to support viability in vivo, and cells bearing the two mutations showed reduced BrdU incorporation in brain neuroblasts, suggesting defects in DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balasov et al., 2009</a>). When co-expressed in insect cells with MBP\u2013Orc3, drastically reduced levels of Orc6-Y225S and no Orc6-W228A/K229A were pulled-down (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Similar results were obtained when the Orc3 insertion was used instead of full-length Orc3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, the Orc3\u2013Orc6 interaction was not stabilized by additional co-expression of Orc2, suggesting that Orc2 binding to Orc3 has no effect on the Orc3\u2013Orc6 interaction in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

For example, metazoan but not budding yeast Orc6 binds DNA, while yeast Orc6 has been reported to bind Cdt1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balasov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). This lack of similarity is surprising considering the generally high conservation of other licensing factors and the central role Orc6 is reported to play during replicative helicase loading in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib75\">Takara and Bell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Frigola et al., 2013</a>). However, in the course of analyzing our sequence alignments of Orc6, we noticed that significant homology actually exists between metazoan, <i>S. pombe</i>, and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This homology includes both the TFIIB repeat domains and the conserved helix in the Orc6 C-terminal domain that harbors the MGS mutation, indicating that all of the functional domains present in metazoan Orc6 are conserved in budding yeast Orc6 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in contrast to <i>S. pombe</i> and metazoan Orc6, budding yeast Orc6\u2014as well as related <i>Saccharomycotina</i> (<i>Candida albicans</i>) and <i>Pezizomycotina</i> (<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Neurospora crassa</i>)\u2014contain an insertion of \u223c100\u2013200 amino acids between the two TFIIB-like helical domains, an addition that may have complicated former analyses (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                                "text": "Since the C-terminal domain of metazoan Orc6 associates with ORC by binding to Orc3, we reasoned that the conservation of this region in budding yeast might extend to this interaction as well. Despite previous studies, the recruitment mechanism of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 into ORC has been controversial. The C-terminal 62 amino acids of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 have been shown to bind ORC1\u20135, likely through interaction with Orc3 or Orc5 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). However, Orc6 has also been shown to bind Orc2 but not Orc3 or Orc5 (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al., 2012</a>). Hence, we investigated whether <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 could bind to Orc2 or Orc3, and whether a mutation of the conserved tyrosine, which corresponds to the MGS mutations in human Orc6, might affect this interaction. In pull-down experiments from insect cell lysate co-expressing pairwise combinations of budding yeast Orc2, Orc3, and Orc6, we observed a clear interaction between Orc2 and Orc3, and between Orc3 and Orc6 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Orc2, when expressed without Orc3, was typically degraded, preventing an assessment of whether it efficiently bound Orc6 or not. We next tested whether a mutation of the conserved MGS tyrosine to serine (Y418S) could support the binding of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 to Orc3 (the MGS tyrosine in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 highlighted by our alignment differs from that proposed previously [Tyr277], due to a misalignment of the region in the original study [<a href=\"#bib6\">Bicknell et al., 2011a</a>]). Strikingly, the MGS-like mutation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 abolished the interaction with Orc3 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). However, in contrast to what we observed with <i>Drosophila</i> and human proteins, the MGS-like mutation was not sufficient to prevent Orc6 binding to the Orc2\u2013Orc3 subcomplex or to ORC1\u20135 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>). Because Orc6 has been previously reported to interact with Orc2 (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al., 2012</a>), our result suggests that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 is cooperatively recruited into ORC through interaction with both Orc2 and Orc3. In agreement with this interpretation, Orc6 was still recruited into ORC lacking the Orc2 subunit, albeit at reduced levels, whereas Orc6 recruitment was completely lost in the absence of Orc3 (omission of Orc3 further led to concomitant loss of Orc2) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). Thus, unlike in metazoans, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> ORC appears to possess two Orc6 binding sites, one in Orc2 and one in Orc3. Although the interaction with Orc3 is mediated by the C-terminal domain of Orc6, it is not clear which domain is responsible for binding to Orc2. However, since the Orc2\u2013Orc6 interaction appears unique to <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B, 8 and 9</a>), we propose this contact may be mediated by a yeast-specific domain inserted between the two TFIIB-like domains of Orc6, which may in turn bind to the non-conserved N-terminal domain of yeast Orc2 that has been implicated previously in Orc6 interactions (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with our interpretation, an MGS-like mutation in yeast Orc6 supports yeast growth, whereas premature stop codons that result in C-terminally truncated Orc6 proteins do not (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, our results reconcile previously conflicting data regarding Orc6 recruitment into ORC and highlight the importance of the conserved C-terminal segment of Orc6 in the formation of the hexameric ORC assembly through Orc6 binding to Orc3. This interaction appears functionally relevant, as Orc6 C-terminal amino acid residues are required for yeast viablility (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Bell, 2011</a>), and yeast Cdt1 fused to the C-terminal domain of Orc6 alone is able to load MCM2\u20137 to replication origins in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>)."

Replicative functions have been attributed to the N-terminal TFIIB-like region of Orc6, whereas the C-terminal domain is required for cytokinesis and interacts with the septin Pnut (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chesnokov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balasov et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Huijbregts et al., 2009</a>). Our results here show that the C-terminus of Orc6 is also critical for DNA replication. Orc6 is a stable component of <i>Drosophila</i> ORC, and ORC lacking Orc6 cannot support DNA replication in vitro in ORC-depleted <i>Drosophila</i> extracts (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chesnokov et al., 2001</a>). Since the C-terminus of Orc6 mediates the association of Orc6 with ORC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4\u20137</a>), we predict that truncations or mutations abrogating this interaction should impair DNA replication. Indeed, the expression of C-terminally truncated or mutated Orc6 transgenes in <i>orc6</i>-null flies results in reduced levels of Mcm4 associated with chromatin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), consistent with reduced levels of replicative helicase loading. These observations may explain the previously described cell-cycle arrest in mitosis that coincides with broken and uncondensed chromosomes, as well as reduced BrdU incorporation in neuroblasts observed in these fly strains, suggesting DNA is underreplicated (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balasov et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, Orc6 constructs lacking part of the C-terminal domain are compromised for initiating DNA replication in <i>Drosophila</i> extracts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balasov et al., 2007</a>). Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for these observations: since Orc6 contributes to recruitment of ORC to chromatin through the binding of its TFIIB-like domains to DNA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balasov et al., 2007</a>), loss of the interaction between Orc6 and ORC1\u20135 likely reduces the levels of chromatin-associated ORC and impairs ORC-dependent pre-RC assembly. The more moderate replicative phenotype of Orc6 mutations that affect Orc6 recruitment into ORC, compared to Orc6 mutations that affect the DNA binding activity of Orc6 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balasov et al. 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2009</a>), suggests that Orc6 might make contacts with non-ORC pre-RC components that help recruit ORC to DNA during pre-RC assembly. Since a majority of ORC in fly ovary and embryo extracts is not bound to origins, we could not test if mutant Orc6 is recruited into the pre-RC with our assays."

In certain MGS patients, compound heterozygous mutations inactivate one <i>ORC6</i> allele and introduce a missense mutation in the other allele that substitutes serine for tyrosine in a conserved C-terminal helix of the Orc6 protein. We show that tyrosine-to-serine mutation reduces the affinity of Orc6 for the core ORC1\u20135 complex in both <i>Drosophila</i> and humans (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 8</a>), a finding that would appear to implicate this subunit in the formation of the pre-RC. Interestingly, earlier observations have appeared inconsistent with such a role of Orc6 in some metazoans; for example, in contrast to the <i>Drosophila</i> system, Orc6 is only loosely or transiently associated with ORC1\u20135 in humans as well as in other metazoans, while in vitro DNA replication experiments using <i>Xenopus</i> extracts have suggested that Orc6 may not be required for DNA replication in this context (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chesnokov et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dhar and Dutta, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chesnokov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dhar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gillespie et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vashee et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib79\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Giordano-Coltart et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Ranjan and Gossen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</a>). Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that Orc6 is essential for DNA replication in these species as well. First, depletion of Orc6 in human cell lines causes licensing and DNA replication defects (<a href=\"#bib59\">Prasanth et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Stiff et al., 2013</a>). Second, human Orc6 is required in vitro for efficient DNA replication in Orc6-depleted <i>Xenopus</i> extracts (<a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2011</a>); the initial discrepancies between the <i>Drosophila</i> system and other metazoan systems may reflect different extents of immunodepletion of Orc6 from <i>Xenopus</i> extracts due to the use of different antibodies. Third, tethering of human Orc6 to DNA in human cells creates a functional origin and recruits other factors of the licensing machinery (<a href=\"#bib78\">Thomae et al., 2011</a>). Finally, immunodepletion of Orc6 from HeLa cell extracts impairs pre-RC assembly on plasmid DNA (<a href=\"#bib78\">Thomae et al., 2011</a>)."

Consistent with this interpretation, we observe reduced but weak binding of a <i>Drosophila</i> Orc6 construct bearing the MGS mutation to either Orc3 or ORC1\u20135 in equilibrium binding experiments and pull-down assays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>). Nonetheless, additional interactions of Orc6 with pre-RC components other than ORC subunits during origin licensing could also contribute to Orc6 incorporation into the pre-RC, explaining why the MGS mutation is not lethal in humans. In addition to its canonical function during replication initiation, metazoan Orc6 is also essential for cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib59\">Prasanth et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chesnokov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bernal and Venkitaraman, 2011</a>), helps to control centrosome copy number and, along with other pre-RC components, appears to be essential for formation of primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib71\">Stiff et al., 2013</a>). The C-terminal domain of Orc6 harboring the MGS mutation is important for cytokinetic function, both in <i>Drosophila</i> and humans (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chesnokov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bernal and Venkitaraman, 2011</a>). At this point it is not known whether the MGS mutation specficially impairs Orc6\u2019s role in cytokinesis, or whether the C-terminal domain of Orc6 is involved in regulating centrosome copy number and cilia formation in humans. In addition, it is not understood how the defects in origin licensing caused by other MGS mutations would feed back to ciliogenesis (<a href=\"#bib71\">Stiff et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, given the fact that many independent mutations in different human ORC subunits, where some have been shown to affect replication functions directly, and hypomorphic mutations in the ATR replication check point protein lead to primordial dwarfism, it is hard to escape the inference that loss of ORC replication licensing functions are indeed epistatic to the MGS phenotype. Interestingly, MGS patients do not appear to have an increased predisposition to cancer, suggesting chromosome stability is not compromised (<a href=\"#bib18\">de Munnik et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">b</a>). How these observations are linked, how they relate to the phenotypes observed in MGS patients, and how specific MGS mutations intercept these processes will be important tasks for future studies."

This difference in surface charge may explain the distinct DNA binding propensities of metazoan and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lee and Bell, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balasov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). Nonetheless, because the TFIIB domains are preserved across eukaryotic Orc6 orthologs, it is tempting to speculate that these folds also play an important conserved function during origin licensing. While recent reports indicate that Orc6 may not be essential for MCM2\u20137 recruitment to origins, it is essential for loading of MCM double hexamers onto origin DNA (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Frigola et al., 2013</a>). The loading function of Orc6 may involve binding of Cdt1 or another pre-RC component through direct protein interactions, as has been reported for <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 and Cdt1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Notably, of the two regions of Orc6 that were shown to independently interact with Cdt1, each contain one of the TFIIB-like domains identified here in yeast Orc6 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>), suggesting Cdt1 binding may be conserved in metazoan Orc6 as well. Along these lines, acquisition of the MGS mutation in human Orc6 would be predicted to reduce licensing capacity and MCM loading by impeding Orc6 recruitment into ORC and pre-replicative complex formation, respectively (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Future efforts using reconstituted systems will be needed to test these concepts further."

As a starting model, we used the previous 34 \u00c5-resolution EM reconstruction of <i>Drosophila</i> ORC (EMDB-1252) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clarey et al., 2006</a>). To avoid model bias, the starting volume was low-pass filtered using a Butterworth filter with stop band and pass band of 100 \u00c5 and 200 \u00c5, respectively. Images of untilted and 30\u00b0 tilted particles were assigned Euler angles by comparison with reference projections and back-projected to obtain a new volume, which served as a reference during the next refinement iteration. The initial angular increment for projection-matching was 30\u00b0 and was decreased progressively to 8\u00b0 during the refinement. The data converged very quickly to a stable 3D volume of ORC with a resolution of 22 \u00c5 based on the 0.5 Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion."

The agreement between the tilted particles and the model projections is described by a correlation coefficient that is plotted as a function of tilt axis and tilt angle. For ORC, a correlation peak was found at a tilt angle of \u221250\u00b0 instead of +50\u00b0, suggesting the hand of the calculated ORC EM volume was incorrect. For further interpretation of the ORC EM volume, the hand was inverted. As a control, an analogous freehand test was performed with the ribosome, the absolute hand of which is known. In the case of the ribosome, peak correlation was observed at the correct tilt angle and not the inverse, as is expected for the correct absolute hand.

The initial portion of the paper derives a higher resolution EM structure of <i>Drosophila</i> ORC and map the location of a number of ORC subunits on this structure. This structure helps to resolve previous observed differences between the yeast and <i>Drosophila</i> EM structure of ORC bringing helpful agreement between the structures. Using protein sequence analysis, the authors suggest that Orc6 has a similar structure across all eukaryotes (previously Orc6 from fungi was thought to be an outlier). More importantly, the authors find that the C-terminal domain of Orc6 binds to a Orc3 via an insertion between canonical AAA<sup>+</sup> motifs that is specific to Orc3. Finally, the authors show that a previously identified Meier-Gorlin mutation in Orc6 interferes with this interaction using fly, human, or yeast proteins."

The EM studies also help to bring together the structural studies of ORC performed in yeast and <i>Drosophila</i> cells, although they do not provide any major new insights. One significant weakness is the authors fail to clearly delineate what the defect is when they interfere with the Orc1-5/Orc6 interaction. There is no data in the paper addressing this issue and previous data from one of the authors assessing the function of a mutant that interferes with this interaction was assessed to cause defects in mitosis rather than replication. Despite this, the authors state strongly that the defect is in DNA replication but provide no data to support this conclusion (e.g., measure Mcm2-7 chromatin association). The authors point to reduced BrdU incorporation observed for the mutants in the previous studies as evidence in favor of this interpretation but do not explain why their previous reasoning focused on the arrest point was incorrect. One concern with these analyses overall is that they are looking at terminal phenotypes that could reflect defects in both activities since it is clear that Orc6 participates in both events. Given the data in hand, it would make more sense to be a little less focused on a replication defect."

Specifically, we have examined the association of Mcm4 with chromatin in larval brains expressing either GFP-Orc6 wild type or GFP-Orc6 mutant transgenes. Our results show that the amount of Mcm4 in the insoluble pellet fraction after salt extraction is greatly reduced in <i>orc6</i>-null larvae when mutant, but not wild-type Orc6 transgenes, are expressed. These findings suggest that Orc6 mutants that fail to incorporate into ORC also reduce the amount of MCM2-7 complex loaded onto chromatin, supporting our previous conclusion that Orc6 C-terminal mutants impair DNA replication initiation."

While only the results for the W228A/K229A mutant were published at that time, the experiments with the D224A/Y225A mutant fly strain were carried out in parallel. We agree that these mutations are not directly comparable to the MGS mutation in humans; however, the main conclusion we draw from these mutants is that conserved residues in the C-terminal region of Orc6 are necessary for Orc6 incorporation into ORC and, as we have now shown, for MCM chromatin loading. We are still in the process of making the Orc6 MGS mutant in <i>Drosophila</i> and don\u2019t have the results concerning its phenotype yet. Since we have now shown that the C-terminus of Orc6 stimulates loading of MCMs onto chromatin in <i>Drosophila</i> and is required for viability in budding yeast (see below), we don\u2019t feel that the MGS mutant fly is critical for our main conclusions."

In this experiment, we used a strain in which the chromosomal copy of Orc6 has been fused to an N-terminal degron (a kind gift from SP Bell) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al. 2007</a>). Under non-permissive growth conditions, we observe that wild-type Orc6 expressed from a centromeric plasmid under the control of its own promoter can complement depletion of the endogenous Orc6 protein and that the yeast are viable. Yeast expressing Orc6Y418S grow similarly to Orc6WT cells, suggesting that this point mutation is not sufficient to disrupt the replicative function of yeast Orc6 in our experimental conditions. This result is consistent with our observation (and that of the Stillman lab (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al. 2012</a>)) that Orc6 is also recruited into ORC through a yeast-specific interaction with Orc2, a contact that we suggest derives from a pair of domain insertions (one in each protein) that are unique to budding-yeast (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sun et al. 2012</a>). By contrast, yeast Orc6 lacking as little as 11 amino acids from its C-terminus is not able to complement endogenous Orc6 depletion, and these cells have a severe slow growth phenotype, a finding consistent with prior published studies from the Bell lab showing that a larger deletion from the C-terminus of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Orc6 is essential for viability (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Bell 2011</a>). Since only replicative functions have been found thus far for yeast Orc6, this result strengthens the proposition that the C-terminus of Orc6, and the patch of conserved homology we have called attention to in this paper, is important for initiation."

This uncertainty is likely due to conformational changes in ORC subunits with respect to the archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 crystal structures (which themselves have been imaged in a variety of conformational states), whereby different subunits adopting different conformations. Along these lines, the flexible nature of the MBP- and GFP-tags, the modest resolution of the EM reconstruction, and the close spatial proximity of the N- and C-termini of archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 (as seen in available crystal structures) preclude us from pinpointing the N-and C-termini of the subunits in the EM volume. We prefer not to include the fitting into the manuscript because, at this point, we cannot be sufficiently confident whether the conformational changes that we impose on archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 crystal structure during fitting truly reflect the domain organization within eukaryotic ORC subunits. Unambiguous fitting will have to await higher resolution EM structures and/or crystal structures of eukaryotic ORC subunits."
