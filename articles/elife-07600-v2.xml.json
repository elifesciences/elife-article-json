Despite progress in secondary structure modeling, high-throughput methods have generally failed to determine ncRNA tertiary structures, even at the 1-nm resolution that enables visualization of how helices and functional motifs are positioned in three dimensions. We report that integrating a new method called MOHCA-seq (<span class=\"underline\">M</span>ultiplexed <span class=\"underline\">\u2022OH</span> <span class=\"underline\">C</span>leavage <span class=\"underline\">A</span>nalysis with paired-end <span class=\"underline\">seq</span>uencing) with mutate-and-map secondary structure inference guides Rosetta 3D modeling to consistent 1-nm accuracy for intricately folded ncRNAs with lengths up to 188 nucleotides, including a blind RNA-puzzle challenge, the lariat-capping ribozyme. This multidimensional chemical mapping (MCM) pipeline resolves unexpected tertiary proximities for cyclic-di-GMP, glycine, and adenosylcobalamin riboswitch aptamers without their ligands and a loose structure for the recently discovered human HoxA9D internal ribosome entry site regulon. MCM offers a sequencing-based route to uncovering ncRNA 3D structure, applicable to functionally important but potentially heterogeneous states."

We report that integrating a new method called MOHCA-seq (<span class=\"underline\">M</span>ultiplexed <span class=\"underline\">\u2022OH</span> <span class=\"underline\">C</span>leavage <span class=\"underline\">A</span>nalysis with paired-end <span class=\"underline\">seq</span>uencing) with mutate-and-map secondary structure inference guides Rosetta 3D modeling to consistent 1-nm accuracy for intricately folded ncRNAs with lengths up to 188 nucleotides, including a blind RNA-puzzle challenge, the lariat-capping ribozyme. This multidimensional chemical mapping (MCM) pipeline resolves unexpected tertiary proximities for cyclic-di-GMP, glycine, and adenosylcobalamin riboswitch aptamers without their ligands and a loose structure for the recently discovered human HoxA9D internal ribosome entry site regulon. MCM offers a sequencing-based route to uncovering ncRNA 3D structure, applicable to functionally important but potentially heterogeneous states."

Highly reactive chemicals are attached to the nucleotides and these can react with, and damage, other nearby nucleotides. By detecting which nucleotides have been damaged, it is possible to map the positions of these nucleotides and decipher the structure of the RNA molecule using computer algorithms."

This method is likely to speed up the analysis of the complex structures of non-coding RNAs.

In particular, medium-sized non-coding RNA (ncRNA) domains in the 100- to 300-nucleotide size range have been discovered to form specific tertiary structures for sensing intra-cellular metabolites, regulating gene expression, and catalyzing precise splicing events (<a href=\"#bib67\">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Butler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Peselis &amp; Serganov, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Meyer et al., 2014</a>). Similarly functional behaviors may be carried out by the tens of thousands of ncRNA domains expressed in complex organisms (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amaral et al., 2008</a>). High-resolution structure determination techniques such as crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy are providing critical insights into ncRNA behavior but are challenged by the large sizes, conformational heterogeneity, and multiple functional states of most biological ncRNA domains (<a href=\"#bib74\">Weeks, 2010</a>). As an alternative methodology, there is a rich history of specialized biochemical interrogation, phylogenetic analysis, and manual model building to achieve global 3D structures of ncRNAs, including the first discovered ribozymes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kim and Cech, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lehnert et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bergman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kazantsev and Pace, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lipfert et al., 2008</a>). These models have reached nanometer accuracies, comparable to the spacing between adjacent nucleotides (6 \u00c5) and significantly smaller than the diameter of an RNA helix (23 \u00c5). While not atomic accuracy, such models have guided visualization of how an ncRNA's motifs and helices interact to effect functions like catalysis and ligand binding, fueling powerful experiments and evolutionary insights (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hougland et al., 2006</a>). However, the experimental and modeling methods underlying these classic, medium-resolution approaches have not been fully automated or accelerated."

These community-wide exercises provide stringent tests of available computational methods by challenging modelers to predict structures of ncRNA sequences that have been crystallized but whose structures have not been publicly released. The dissemination of SHAPE, DMS, hydroxyl radical footprinting, and M<sup>2</sup> measurements for recent RNA-puzzles has enabled our and other groups to consistently achieve high-secondary structure prediction accuracies. Furthermore, computational integration of available data with the fragment assembly of RNA (FARNA) algorithm in Rosetta (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>) has led to tertiary structure models with accuracies of 1 nanometer or better (all-heavy-atom root-mean-squared-deviation, RMSD). Unfortunately, these computational methods still generate alternative 3D structures consistent with the available data. Out of the 5 to 10 different structures submitted by each participating modeling team for each puzzle, we and others have been unable to rank the models with correct tertiary helical arrangements as our top submissions, much less confidently assign accuracies to these models or select candidates for computationally expensive refinement.

The workflow was designed to read out proximal nucleotide pairs by introducing radical sources at random locations into the RNA, creating radicals that initiate strand breaks at positions close in three dimensions to each source, and mapping the sequence positions of each strand break and its parent source. We randomly incorporated 2\u2032-NH<sub>2</sub>-2\u2032-dATP during transcription so that each RNA contained on average one or fewer modifications and then coupled these sites to isothiocyanobenzyl-Fe(III)\u2022EDTA. We chose these reagents because they are commercially available and therefore can be readily acquired by other laboratories. These RNAs were purified and then folded in buffer containing 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and any ligands appropriate for the system (see below and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). After folding, RNAs were fragmented by activating the Fenton reaction at the backbone-tethered Fe(III) atoms using ascorbate as a reducing agent (<a href=\"#bib23\">Das et al., 2008</a>). In the prior MOHCA-gel approach, electrophoresis in one dimension separated RNAs at strand breaks, and then fragments were cleaved at the location of the radical source by iodine-catalyzed scission of phosphorothioate tags (incorporated with the 2\u2032-NH<sub>2</sub> modifications), before electrophoresis in the second, perpendicular direction (<a href=\"#bib23\">Das et al., 2008</a>). The resulting patterns gave information on pairs of proximal nucleotides based on their position in the 2D gel, but the method's low signal-to-noise necessitated tedious experiments with radical sources separately incorporated at A, C, G, and U residues, each carried out in triplicate, each with at least two different gel electrophoresis times, to achieve a proximity map."

To read out strand cleavage sites, the new workflow includes an end-repair step using T4 polynucleotide kinase under conditions that promote its 3\u2032-phosphatase activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cameron and Uhlenbeck, 1977</a>). This reaction permits ligation of a pre-adenylated universal adapter sequence to the 3\u2032-ends of the hydroxyl radical-cleaved RNA fragments, allowing reverse transcription with primers harboring an Illumina adapter and experiment-specific barcodes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ingolia et al., 2012</a>). We expected reverse transcription to then stop at the nucleotide tethered to the bulky radical source at its C2\u2032 position, providing a readout of the source position that is more convenient than the MOHCA-gel strand-scission method (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left). However, we were surprised to find additional stop sites beyond these source attachment positions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right), suggesting that reverse transcription could also terminate at sites of additional oxidative damage events, including not only radical-induced strand scission but also other products of ribose or nucleobase oxidation (e.g., 8-oxo-purines and 5-hydroxy-pyrimidines) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yanagawa et al., 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib78\">1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rhee et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pogozelski and Tullius, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barciszewski et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gong et al., 2006</a>), which are indistinguishable at the cDNA level from stops at tethered radical sources. This high rate of stops would have been difficult to quantify in prior gel and capillary electrophoresis (CE) measurements (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mitra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kladwang et al., 2014</a>); the rate and proximity of these stops to the radical source were confirmed through both CE and next-generation sequencing tests on a model hairpin RNA with a single radical source attachment position (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). The rate of reverse transcription-terminating oxidative damage events exceeds that of strand scission alone by many fold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Since these sites of reverse transcription termination marked locations that were also nearby in three dimensions to the radical source, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the resulting cDNAs would still be expected to report pairs of sites that were proximal in the RNA structure, albeit at longer average distances than source-to-cleavage pairs (illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Thus, MOHCA-seq enables detection of correlated events previously invisible to MOHCA-gel, and we hypothesized that this significantly larger number of pairwise proximities would permit rapid ncRNA modeling with comparable accuracy to the prior method (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,F\u2013G</a>)."

In comparison to prior MOHCA-gel data in which a single experiment yielded a few proximity pairs, raw sequencing counts from a single MOHCA-seq experiment exhibited dozens of pairwise proximity \u2018hits\u2019 throughout the ncRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013G</a>). Additionally, the digital form of MOHCA-seq data enabled computational analysis to resolve further features. Our analysis, called closure-based \u2022OH correlation analysis (COHCOA), is described fully in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. Briefly, COHCOA assumes a two-dimensional background in the raw aligned sequencing data, which arises from two one-dimensional background profiles that are uncorrelated with tethered radical sources: a strand scission profile (leading to horizontal striations) and a reverse transcription-terminating profile (leading to vertical striations) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Through iterative fitting, COHCOA calculates this two-dimensional background and subtracts it from the raw data and additionally corrects for reverse transcription attenuation. The procedure isolates the MOHCA-seq signal, which arises from oxidative damage that is spatially correlated with tethered radical sources (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To prevent false positive identification of MOHCA-seq hits due to noise in areas of the proximity map with fewer reads and therefore less signal, we apply a two-dimensional smoothing algorithm to produce the final proximity map for visualization (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

Indeed, MOHCA-seq proximity hits corresponded to radicals diffusing across the major and minor grooves of each of these helices (visible as two separate branches, arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), confirming the M<sup>2</sup> secondary structure, albeit at lower resolution (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Importantly, nearly two dozen tertiary proximities, including features marking the bend at the J5/5a hinge, the A-minor contact between the A-rich bulge and P4, and the docking of the L5b tetraloop into the J6a/6b receptor, appeared as punctate hits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>); only the last of these was clearly observed in M<sup>2</sup> mapping (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

In particular, even after 30 min of radical source activation, the proximity information in the experimental data remains clearly visible without noticeable increase in background, suggesting that the radical source cleaves itself off the RNA in minutes, limiting the reaction. CE of ascorbate-treated end-labeled RNA supported this mechanism of self-limiting the reaction (see also <a href=\"#bib23\">Das et al., 2008</a>). A few weak signals in the proximity maps that were not predicted by the crystal structure (pink circles, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) may be caused by perturbations of the ncRNA structure by radical source attachment or by conformational dynamics of the RNA or the \u223c11 \u00c5 benzyl-thiourea linker tethering the radical source to the RNA backbone."

First, to reduce the computational expense of sampling helices, which primarily adopt A-form conformations, we pre-assembled secondary structure elements in Rosetta. To mimic the lack of high-resolution data for cases of blind RNA structure prediction, we used helices derived from M<sup>2</sup> and 1D SHAPE mapping for modeling. Second, we performed global modeling in Rosetta in two stages. We generated an initial set of over 10,000 low-resolution models using FARNA in parallel, independent modeling runs; then, we minimized the 1/6 of the models with the lowest Rosetta energy score using full-atom refinement.

Therefore, we used all data, including the few weak features not explained by the crystal structure (pink circles, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), anticipating that the modeling would automatically determine the maximal subset of contacts consistent with each other and with a single structure. Conformational sampling in Rosetta was constrained by applying a smooth pseudo-energy potential (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) between each pair of residues in the list that favored conformations with the residues between 0 and 30 \u00c5 apart and disfavored conformations with the residues more than 30 \u00c5 apart.

The cluster center represents the best tertiary structure prediction of the MCM pipeline for automated Rosetta modeling guided by experimental data. The RMSD threshold used for clustering represents the intra-cluster RMSD between models in the cluster and is used to calculate an in situ RMSD estimate, representing the precision of modeling (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

This suggests that MCM is capable of defining the global 3D structure of the RNA, without crystallographic information, at near the resolution of a single-nucleotide register shift (6 \u00c5) even when weak MOHCA-seq features not explained by the crystal structure are used to constrain modeling. Performing the same Rosetta modeling protocol without MOHCA-seq pairwise constraints led to a strikingly worse model with 38.3 \u00c5 accuracy to the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), demonstrating that MOHCA-seq constraints are required for accurate modeling. The 8.6 \u00c5 accuracy of the cluster center was better than the previous 13 \u00c5 accuracy of modeling guided by MOHCA-gel data, which were collected at substantially greater experimental expense and did not allow base-pair resolution inference of secondary structure, as is now provided by M<sup>2</sup> analysis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Das et al., 2008</a>)."

Nevertheless, we found that the resolution was not sufficient to recapitulate nucleotide-level details, such as the base stacking and base\u2013triple interactions in the tetraloop/tetraloop receptor contact. If the P4\u2013P6 domain were a blind prediction case, the MOHCA-seq data and MCM model would have marked these regions as sites for further biochemical investigation, but accurate recovery of the detailed interactions would still require advances in computational methods being developed for refining conformations of motifs to high resolution (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sripakdeevong et al., 2011</a>).

To further test this hypothesis, we benchmarked MCM on several additional ncRNAs with known structures but distinct functions: the 89-nucleotide <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) riboswitch aptamer bound to its ligand at 10 \u00b5M c-di-GMP (<a href=\"#bib67\">Smith et al., 2009</a>), the 159-nucleotide ligand-binding domain of the <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> double glycine riboswitch (consisting of two tandem glycine aptamers) bound to two glycines at 10 mM glycine (<a href=\"#bib15\">Butler et al., 2011</a>), the 168-nucleotide <i>Symbiobacterium thermophilum</i> adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) riboswitch aptamer bound to its ligand at 70 \u00b5M AdoCbl (<a href=\"#bib55\">Peselis &amp; Serganov, 2012</a>), and the 127-nucleotide class I ligase including substrate obtained from in vitro selection (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ekland and Bartel, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shechner et al., 2009</a>) (sequences listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). For the glycine riboswitch ligand-binding domain, the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer, and the class I ligase, the secondary structures were first defined at nucleotide resolution by high-throughput M<sup>2</sup> analysis; data from this previously established approach were collected in prior work (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kladwang et al., 2011a</a>) or are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>. MOHCA-seq data and Rosetta modeling completed the MCM pipeline (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013E</a>). As described above for the P4\u2013P6 RNA and in prior work on 3D ncRNA modeling, precision estimates were possible in situ without knowledge of the actual structure by assessing convergence of independent modeling runs (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019); all cases suggested 1-nm resolution had been achieved (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Indeed, this resolution was attained by MCM in all cases: 7.6 \u00c5 for the c-di-GMP riboswitch aptamer; 7.9 \u00c5 for the glycine riboswitch ligand-binding domain; 11.9 \u00c5 for the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer (compare to RNA-puzzle 6 models, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>); and 11.1 \u00c5 (ribozyme) and 14.5 \u00c5 (ribozyme including substrate) for the class I ligase (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shechner et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; clusters with knots were not accepted, see <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The lack of correlation between the fraction of satisfied MOHCA-seq pairwise constraints and the accuracy of the models (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) suggests that unsatisfied constraints are due to conformational fluctuations in the RNA or radical-source linkers around the dominant global structures of these molecules, rather than systematic structural shifts or incomplete computational sampling. The generally consistent accuracy of these predictions supports our hypothesis that highly sampled computational modeling is able to filter out such inconsistent constraints, as has been observed in prior macromolecule modeling based on pairwise information (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bowers et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Das et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Thompson et al., 2012</a>). Further supporting the assumptions of modeling, including the form of the pseudo-energy function, the relationship of MOHCA-seq signal intensities to pairwise distances seen in crystal structures was recovered by MCM models (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). Again, we tested the necessity of MOHCA-seq data for completing the MCM pipeline by performing identical modeling of all ncRNA domains without MOHCA-seq constraints (M<sup>2</sup>/Rosetta modeling). Just as for the P4\u2013P6 domain, these runs produced dramatically less accurate models, as can be visually assessed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and quantitated by both RMSD to the crystal structure and statistical significance (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hajdin et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

However, these data did not disambiguate between a range of 3D structures, and our ten submitted models gave RMSDs from 12.1 \u00c5 to 32.8 \u00c5 to the subsequently released riboswitch aptamer crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). With the developments in this study, we suspected that MOHCA-seq data would complement our M<sup>2</sup>/Rosetta method and permit confident selection and submission of a single model. Indeed, the full MCM pipeline resolved tertiary contacts between the peripheral and core regions of the ncRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and automated modeling converged to a structure defined with 13.9 \u00c5 resolution (in situ precision estimate), which achieved 11.9 \u00c5 RMSD to the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>, and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), comparable to the accuracy of our best RNA-puzzle submission and clearly defining the global structure to helix resolution."

As part of this blind challenge, we previously collected and shared M<sup>2</sup> data (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>) that supported literature models of the ncRNA's secondary structure and suggested two additional tertiary contacts creating a \u2018ring\u2019 around the ribozyme. Nevertheless, during the RNA-puzzle time window in the summer of 2012, modeling from M<sup>2</sup> alone was uncertain, particularly in the long, kissing helical stacks P2.1 and P4\u2013P6, which had no homologies to any experimentally solved structure (blue and green regions, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). After developing MOHCA-seq but before the release of the lariat-capping ribozyme crystal structure, we completed the MCM pipeline by acquiring MOHCA-seq data for the ncRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), and the resulting map highlighted potential errors in these extended peripheral regions. We then blindly refined the peripheral regions based on the full MCM data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and the subsequent release of the ribozyme crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib48\">Meyer et al., 2014</a>) confirmed that their accuracy significantly improved, from an original RMSD of 17.0 \u00c5 (original RNA-puzzle submission, M<sup>2</sup>/Rosetta) to a final RMSD of 11.2 \u00c5 (full MCM, i.e., M<sup>2</sup>/MOHCA-seq/Rosetta). The global accuracy of the models also improved, with a range of RMSDs over the full ribozyme from 7.6 to 8.9 \u00c5, compared to our original submission, which turned out to have an overall RMSD accuracy of 9.6 \u00c5. Taken together, these results rigorously demonstrated the ability of the full MCM pipeline to detect errors and to consistently and blindly refine ncRNA structures to 1-nm resolution or better throughout complex structures."

We tested if MCM could resolve previously missing information on ligand-free states of the three riboswitch aptamers that were characterized above in their ligand-bound forms. Because the computational modeling of heterogeneous conformational ensembles from experimental data is an open problem (<a href=\"#bib10\">Beauchamp et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Salmon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shi et al., 2014</a>), our primary conclusions below are based on the M<sup>2</sup> and MOHCA-seq data themselves, with Rosetta modeling carried out for initial visualization only (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

These prior studies revealed an extended conformation of this ncRNA transiently interconverting with a \u2018docked\u2019 conformation that shares at least one tertiary contact with the ligand-bound docked state (P1b/P2 tetraloop/receptor). MCM rapidly recovered this picture and provided additional information. In terms of secondary structure, M<sup>2</sup> measurements gave P1a, P1b, and P2 helices in both ligand-free and ligand-bound states, up to possible rearrangements in edge base pairs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kladwang et al., 2011a</a>), and MOHCA-seq additionally confirmed all 3 helices in both states (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In terms of tertiary structure, unambiguous proximities between several segments of P1b and P2 that were detected in the ligand-bound state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, left) were also observed at the same locations, albeit weakly, in the ligand-free state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right). To test that these tertiary features were not due to noise or experimental artifacts in MOHCA-seq experiments or data processing, we confirmed that they disappeared in solution conditions without Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The matching \u2018fingerprints\u2019 of cross-helix tertiary features in ligand-free and ligand-bound MOHCA-seq maps provided evidence that the ligand-free riboswitch aptamer samples the same tertiary conformation as the ligand-bound docked state at nanometer resolution, including and going beyond the known tetraloop/receptor contact."

The glycine riboswitch ligand-binding domain consists of two glycine-binding aptamers connected by a linker; the formation of cross-aptamer contacts upon ligand binding could explain the cooperativity of glycine binding between the aptamers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Erion and Strobel, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kladwang et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Esquiaqui et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ruff and Strobel, 2014</a>), but has not been directly visualized. In terms of secondary structure, previous M<sup>2</sup> data indicated that three major helical elements P1, P2, and P3 were formed by each of the two aptamers, both with and without glycine (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kladwang et al., 2011a</a>); MOHCA-seq data gave additional support for this six-helix secondary structure being preformed without ligand (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Strikingly, tertiary proximity hits observed both within and across the two aptamers in the glycine-bound state were retained, though weakened, in the absence of glycine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3H</a>). Analogous to our control experiments for the c-di-GMP riboswitch aptamer, these tertiary proximities were not detectable in conditions without Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Completing the MCM pipeline, Rosetta modeling of the ligand-free state with M<sup>2</sup>/MOHCA-seq constraints gave a structural ensemble with an approximately similar global structure but substantially more conformational variance than the ligand-bound state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). These MCM models provide a framework for further dissection of the ligand-free state of the glycine riboswitch aptamers through mutation and MCM.

Indeed, long-standing controversies in modeling this ncRNA raised the possibility of differences in both secondary and tertiary structure in states with and without ligand (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ravnum and Andersson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nahvi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vitreschak et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nahvi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Barrick and Breaker, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Miao et al., 2015</a>). Nevertheless, MCM revealed striking similarities between the states, most clearly visible in MOHCA-seq data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In terms of secondary structure, features for six major helical stacks appeared identical with and without ligand. In terms of tertiary structure, the data without ligand showed reduction but not complete loss of strong tertiary proximities between helices that enclose the ligand-binding site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As above, Rosetta modeling produced an initial visualization of a loose structural ensemble that samples, but does not stably remain in, the ligand-bound structure within the nanometer resolution of the MOHCA-seq method (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Again, by rapidly resolving secondary and tertiary structure, this MCM analysis sets a foundation for further dissection of this RNA's ligand-free globule. As a first example, we found that the sole long-range tertiary interaction in the AdoCbl-binding site (an A-minor contact between J11-10 and helix P6) was necessary for ligand binding but not the global tertiary proximities measured by MOHCA-seq (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Like the data for the glycine riboswitch aptamers above, these data further suggest that the ligand-free proximities in the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer arise not from direct tertiary contacts but from conformational preferences encoded in the riboswitch aptamer junctions."

To further demonstrate the potential of MCM 3D modeling for investigating systems of timely biological interest, we probed a 176-nt structured domain of the HoxA9 5\u2032-UTR that was shown to be critical for IRES activity. The secondary structure of the domain was determined by M<sup>2</sup>, along with in vivo mutation-rescue experiments that confirmed key helix elements (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Xue et al., 2015</a>). We collected MOHCA-seq data that corroborated the secondary structure described previously and provided independent support for a pseudoknot (pk3-4) connecting two arms of a four-way junction, a common feature of viral IRESes that has not been demonstrated for cellular IRESes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). We completed the MCM pipeline to computationally model the domain's global 3D structure, revealing a core four-way junction aligned by the pseudoknot, defined at an estimated resolution of 19.5 \u00c5, similar to the loose ensembles seen in our MCM models of ligand-free riboswitch aptamers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Supporting this global structure and estimated resolution, modeling that used an alternative pk3-4-free secondary structure gave a final conformation within 19.5 \u00c5 RMSD of the cluster center with pseudoknot (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>; alternative secondary structure from Extended Data <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> in ref. [<a href=\"#bib76\">Xue et al., 2015</a>]). Given the conformational heterogeneity of this 176-nucleotide ncRNA in the absence of partners, MCM appears to be the only front-line technique able to resolve this domain's global structure in isolation, which we propose to be a recognition site for the mammalian 80S ribosome. These models provide fiducial landmarks to seek in upcoming cryo-electron microscopy studies of the HoxA9 IRES in the presence of the ribosome and other macromolecular partners (PDB-formatted models are available online in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Source code 1</a>)."

The MCM methods described herein leverage tabletop sequencing platforms and commercially available reagents to provide a straightforward route to such proximity information. In the MCM pipeline, both M<sup>2</sup> and MOHCA-seq experiments provide critical data to guide Rosetta computational modeling. M<sup>2</sup> defines the secondary structure but cannot generally constrain helical elements into accurate tertiary structures, while MOHCA-seq provides tertiary proximities but does not reveal secondary structure as finely as M<sup>2</sup>. Analogous to how pipelining Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy, NOE measurements, and computational modeling allows routine NMR-based structure determination of small RNA motifs, we have shown that the M<sup>2</sup>/MOHCA-seq/Rosetta pipeline achieves models for larger ncRNA structures, including blind test cases, with accuracies of 1 nm."

MCM data corroborate and refine models of ligand-independent tertiary structure in a c-di-GMP riboswitch aptamer and reveal similarly preformed tertiary structure in glycine and AdoCbl riboswitch aptamers. Mutational analysis confirms the importance of junctions in defining these ligand-free global tertiary preferences. Such preformed structure may be needed for rapid kinetic capture of cognate ligands in vivo. We propose that current exceptions to this rule, such as the thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch aptamer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2010</a>), may also form such \u2018loose tertiary globules\u2019 when probed with flanking elements or macromolecule partners that have not yet been identified, as they were for the glycine riboswitch aptamers.

Cell-permeable nucleotide analogs or chemical modifiers may enable in vivo 3D structure determination. The experimental cost of MCM grows quadratically with the length of the transcript, limiting current analysis to domains of hundreds of nucleotides; however, &gt;1000-nt transcripts may become feasible as sequencing costs continue to decrease and if new strategies to bypass reverse transcription stops are implemented (<a href=\"#bib66\">Siegfried et al., 2014</a>). A fraction of observed MOHCA-seq constraints do not reflect structures solved by crystallography; quantitative relationships correlating MCM data to structural features should further improve modeling accuracy and enable error estimation and cross-validation by leaving out constraints during modeling, analogous to continuing advances in NMR methods. Additionally, stabilization of alternative states by mutation, coupled with ensemble-based analyses, may allow for more detailed dissection of multiple ncRNA tertiary conformations and their functions. Finally, improving computational methods may enable refinement of 1-nm resolution models to higher resolution, possibly near-atomic accuracy; this computational problem appears significantly more amenable than completely de novo 3D modeling. We hope that the public availability of our MCM data, their acquisition in ongoing RNA-puzzles, and the detailed methodological descriptions in this report will help accelerate these developments and more comprehensively illuminate the complex structures underlying ncRNA biology."

Ligation was assayed using 5% of the purified sample by observing the mobility shift of the full-length RNA on CE. Mobility shifts of radical-cleaved fragments were not directly observed in this quality check but were observed in pilot experiments, as described above."

Three of the four primers were used for reverse transcription of the ascorbate-treated sample and the remaining primer was used for reverse transcription of the no-ascorbate control sample. Each 15 \u00b5l reverse transcription reaction contained 250 fmol sequencing primer (which is limiting compared to the \u223c2\u20133 pmol of RNA remaining at this stage), 1\u00d7 First Strand buffer (Life Technologies), 5 mM DTT, 0.8 mM dNTPs, and 120 U SuperScript III (Life Technologies) and was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 30 min. To degrade the RNA templates, 5 \u00b5l of 0.4 M NaOH was added and the samples were incubated at 90\u00b0C for 3 min. After cooling on ice for 3 min, the cDNA samples were neutralized by addition of 1 \u00b5l of an acid quench (2 ml 5 M NaCl, 2 ml 2 M HCl, and 3 ml 3 M Na-acetate) and then purified by incubating with DynaBeads magnetic beads (Life Technologies) conjugated to double-biotin-labeled ssDNA complementary to the TruSeq adapter. For the glycine riboswitch ligand-binding domain with K-turn construct, the cDNA samples after RNA hydrolysis and neutralization were split in half. One half was purified as described above, and the other was purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN), to provide size-selection for larger fragments corresponding to tertiary proximities between more distant sequence positions. Approximately, 65\u201375% of the sequencing primer was extended in the reverse transcription reactions, based on CE detection and quantification of \u2018null ligation\u2019 reads (consisting of the second sequencing adapter ligated directly to the sequencing primer) after paired-end sequencing."

The reverse transcription stop profiles from sequencing and CE are similar, showing reverse transcription-terminating events on the strand of the helix complementary to the radical source, as well as a stronger termination event at the location of the radical source (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, bottom center and bottom). We calculated the rate of reverse transcription stops from the CE and sequencing data by taking the sum of the fraction modified over all stop sites, excluding the signal at residue 13 because the reactivity at that position is due to the tethered radical source and not oxidative modifications. The rate of RT stops was similar between the CE and sequencing data and was at least sixfold higher than the rate of strand scission (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

We used this intra-cluster RMSD to calculate an in situ RMSD estimate (\u2018precision\u2019) of the ensemble to the \u2018true\u2019 structure. The in situ RMSD of the cluster center model to the \u2018true\u2019 structure can be stated as the distance in structure space between the \u2018true\u2019 structure and the cluster center. This can be conservatively estimated as the sum in quadrature of the RMSDs between (1) the \u2018true\u2019 structure and the most accurate member of the cluster and (2) this cluster member and the cluster center. The intra-cluster RMSD represents an upper bound on distance (2), and assuming that distance (1) is no greater than distance (2), the in situ RMSD of the cluster center to the \u2018true\u2019 structure is estimated as the intra-cluster RMSD multiplied by the square root of 2. This precision estimate is reported in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. The accuracy of the ensemble was estimated using the RMSD of the cluster center of the largest cluster to the gold-standard crystal structure. The accuracy and precision of modeling for the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer were determined slightly differently, as described below, to allow direct comparison to prior modeling efforts in the RNA-puzzle challenge."

These values are reported for the benchmark RNAs in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Finally, we calculated the percentage of strong and weak MOHCA-seq constraints satisfied by our models (averaged over all models in each cluster) and the crystal structure. We defined a constraint as \u2018satisfied\u2019 if the O2\u2032 of the first residue was within 30 \u00c5 of the C4\u2032 of the second residue. The cluster center models produced by MCM modeling generally satisfied 80% or more of the strong constraints and 60% or more of the weak constraints. As expected, the models generally satisfied a greater percentage of constraints than the crystal structures; however, the percent of constraints satisfied was not correlated with the accuracy or precision of the models or with the level of cleavage observed in the proximity maps. As described in the main text, unsatisfied constraints could arise from structural perturbations due to radical source attachment, or conformational flexibility of the RNA, or the benzyl-thiourea linker tethering the radical source to the RNA backbone. The details of the modeling results and these statistics are listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1, 2</a>."

For the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer, the pre-built fragments consisted of three models each of the P1 through P6, P7 through P8, and P10 through P11 regions. We modeled the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer with three distinct combinations of these fragments, each containing one fragment of each region. To estimate the precision of MCM modeling for the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer in the ligand-bound and ligand-free states, we calculated the average pairwise all-heavy-atom RMSD between the cluster centers of the largest clusters for the three modeling setups and used this as the intra-cluster RMSD for calculating the in situ precision estimate."

We found that for constructs with weak residual tertiary MOHCA-seq hits, such as the c-di-GMP riboswitch aptamer and glycine riboswitch ligand-binding domain with leader sequence, these lowest energy models included both compact or native-like conformations as well as extended and incorrectly folded conformations. For the AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer, we compared the cluster centers of the three independent modeling setups as a similar way of assessing heterogeneity between modeling runs.

Nevertheless, the very high frequency of additional RT stops could have a negative effect on the modeling, which the authors should discuss. First, by generating reads that are shorter than those arising from RT stops at site of the tether, they inflate the number of short pairwise constraints. It is still not clear to me that these do not bias the modeling procedure. Second, some of these reads could arise from two damaged sites 5' of the tether, producing false constraints."

Could the authors comment on the reason for this difference? Is this because the authors use only ascorbate, rather than a combination of hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate? I am still puzzled by the claim that these additional RT stops arise from common base oxidation products, such as 8-oxoG or 5'-HOC. Reverse transcriptases (and other DNA polymerases) are reported in the literature to bypass such lesions fairly easily."
