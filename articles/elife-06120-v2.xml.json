Fam20C is the physiological Golgi casein kinase, which phosphorylates many secreted proteins and is critical for proper biomineralization. Fam20A, a Fam20C paralog, is essential for enamel formation, but the biochemical function of Fam20A is unknown. Here we show that Fam20A potentiates Fam20C kinase activity and promotes the phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins in vitro and in cells. Mechanistically, Fam20A is a pseudokinase that forms a functional complex with Fam20C, and this complex enhances extracellular protein phosphorylation within the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism by which Fam20C and Fam20A collaborate to control enamel formation, and provide the first insight into the regulation of secretory pathway phosphorylation."

Fam20C is the physiological Golgi casein kinase, which phosphorylates many secreted proteins and is critical for proper biomineralization. Fam20A, a Fam20C paralog, is essential for enamel formation, but the biochemical function of Fam20A is unknown. Here we show that Fam20A potentiates Fam20C kinase activity and promotes the phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins in vitro and in cells. Mechanistically, Fam20A is a pseudokinase that forms a functional complex with Fam20C, and this complex enhances extracellular protein phosphorylation within the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism by which Fam20C and Fam20A collaborate to control enamel formation, and provide the first insight into the regulation of secretory pathway phosphorylation."

In the past several decades, efforts have been focused on understanding phosphorylation events in the cytoplasm and nucleus.

Fam20C was identified as the long-sought Golgi casein kinase, which phosphorylates secreted proteins within Ser-x-Glu/phospho-Ser (SxE/pS) motifs, including casein and members of the secretory calcium binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) family (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kawasaki and Weiss, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, some 75% of phosphoproteins identified in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid contain phosphate within the Fam20C consensus sequence, suggesting that Fam20C may have a broad spectrum of substrates and therefore play a major role in establishing the secreted phosphoproteome (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bahl et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Salvi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tagliabracci et al., 2013</a>). Nonetheless, how Fam20C is regulated is unknown. In addition to Fam20C, Fj, the founding member of the family, phosphorylates extracellular cadherin domains (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ishikawa et al., 2008</a>). Fam20B phosphorylates xylose within a tetrasaccharide linkage region of O-linked proteoglycans and functions to promote glycosaminoglycan chain elongation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koike et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wen et al., 2014</a>).

Patients with non-lethal forms of Raine syndrome exhibit hypophosphatemia, ectopic calcifications and dental anomalies (<a href=\"#bib40\">Simpson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fradin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rafaelsen et al., 2013</a>).

ENAM is an enamel matrix protein that, together with amelogenin X (AMELX), ameloblastin (AMBN) and amelotin (AMTN), makes up a subfamily of the SCPPs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kawasaki and Weiss, 2008</a>).

ENAM, AMELX, AMBN and AMTN are all phosphorylated within SxE motifs and are therefore potential Fam20C substrates (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kawasaki and Weiss, 2008</a>).

Pre-incubation of Fam20A and Fam20C with ATP at 30\u00b0C would allow Fam20C to phosphorylate Fam20A; however, this did not increase subsequent ENAM phosphorylation when compared to conditions where pre-incubation was carried out on ice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, group 2 and 3). Furthermore, ENAM phosphorylation remained constant when Fam20A and Fam20C were pre-incubated with ATP or AMP-PCP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, group 3 and 4).

To test whether Fam20A could stimulate kinase activities of Fam20C mutants, we expressed Fam20A with Flag-tagged Fam20C mutants and monitored V5-tagged OPN phosphorylation by its mobility during SDS-PAGE. As expected, WT and non-lethal Fam20C mutants (T268M and P328S), but none of the other mutants induced a mobility shift in OPN (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2014</a>). However, when Fam20A was co-expressed, we observed enhancement of Fam20C kinase activity in every mutant with the exception of T268M (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Because several of the Fam20C mutations are predicted to prevent proper folding/stability, ectopic expression of Fam20A likely promoted not only Fam20C kinase activity, but also Fam20C stability. These results suggest that Fam20A could help stabilize Fam20C mutations and that recapitulating this effect by pharmacological means may be of therapeutic benefit to patients harboring these Fam20C mutations."

In the Fam20A/Fam20C complex, Fam20C is catalytically active, whereas Fam20A functions as an allosteric activator to increase Fam20C kinase activity. Because the residual time of secreted proteins within the secretory pathway is limited, the formation of Fam20A/Fam20C complex, whose turnover number (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>) is dramatically increased, may reflect an important mechanism to achieve high stoichiometry of secreted proteins phosphorylation. Our model suggests that loss-of-function mutations in Fam20A result in inefficient phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins by Fam20C, which prevents proper enamel formation and leads to AI. The degree of phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins required for proper enamel formation is unknown. However, patients with hypomorphic mutations in Fam20C, including T268M and P328S, survive infancy but developed dental defects (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fradin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rafaelsen et al., 2013</a>), indicating that optimal Fam20C activity is critical for enamel formation."

Approximately 10% of the human kinome encodes pseudokinases, which are predicted to lack essential catalytic residues and primarily exert non-catalytic functions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Manning et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zeqiraj and van Aalten, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shaw et al., 2014</a>). Several pseudokinase-kinase pairs have been revealed, where a pseudokinase binds and potentiates an active kinase. For example, the pseudokinase STRAD, together with MO25, forms a complex with LKB1 and activates LKB1 kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zeqiraj et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2009b</a>). Similarly, the pseudokinase domain of HER3 can dimerize with and allosterically activate catalytically active EGFRs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jura et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, the pesudokinase-like inactivated BRAF, generated through binding to ATP-competitive inhibitors or mutation of a residue in the catalytic spine (C-spine), can still allosterically activate other RAF family kinases via dimerization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Heidorn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hu et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2013</a>). Fam20A lacks a negatively charged residue that is critical for kinase activity and therefore is a pseudokinase. Nevertheless, it binds and increases Fam20C activity in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Discovery of the Fam20A-Fam20C pair extends the concept that the activity of a kinase can be allosterically regulated by dimerization with an inactive paralog, which further expands the pseudokinase-kinase mode of regulation to protein phosphorylation within the secretory pathway."

However, the ability of Fam20A to increase the activity of Fam20C mutants identified in patients may lead to a method to allosterically boost Fam20C activity and this may have therapeutic potential.

Our data demonstrate that Fam20C activity can be allosterically potentiated by Fam20A, and this increased catalytic activity is critical for enamel formation. Because the expression of Fam20A is tissue-specific, it is unlikely that Fam20A functions as a global regulator of Fam20C, arguing the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms for Fam20C activity. Indeed, we show that both Fam20A and Fam20C mRNA levels are dramatically increased in the lactating mammary gland, suggesting transcriptional regulation, which may involve pregnancy-related hormones."

We hypothesize that in cells where Fam20A and Fam20C are co-expressed, Fam20A forms a complex with Fam20C and enhances its kinase activity, leading to high levels of substrate phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This would be especially important in the biological processes where large amounts of substrates need to be phosphorylated, such as teeth development or milk production. Conversely, Fam20A deficiency results in reduced Fam20C activity and basal levels of substrate phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Phenotypes, such as enamel defects, will present when the basal phosphorylation is insufficient to support the corresponding biological process. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel mechanism to regulate secretory pathway phosphorylation and biomineralization."

Why does it then require 15X excess of FAM20A to reach full activity as shown in Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2? One would expect this just to be dependent on the affinity of the interaction."

We stably co-expressed Flag-tagged and V5-tagged Fam20A in mammalian cells and found that they co-immunoprecipitated from detergent soluble extracts.

Consistent with the gel filtration result, the Fam20A/C complex curve of the analytical ultracentrifugation assay also show a lag towards lower molecular mass (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Notably, the concentration of Fam20C used in the kinetic assay is 500 to 1000 fold lower than that in the gel filtration assay, which would result in more complex dissociation. Also, Fam20A purified from insect cells likely switches between monomer and dimer without Fam20C, which makes Fam20A/C complex formation even more difficult at low protein concentration. It might also take a longer time for the complex formation to reach equilibration. Thus, excessive amount of Fam20A would be beneficial for the complex formation under the kinetic assay condition."

This regulatory mechanism will be advantageous during the processes like enamel formation and lactation, when lots of secreted proteins need to be phosphorylated to high stoichiometry."

This mechanism has been reported for other pseudokinases, including STRAD.
