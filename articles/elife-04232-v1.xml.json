We recently reported that rodent malaria parasites infect erythroblasts that express MHC class I antigens, which are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contributes to the protection of mice against blood-stage malaria in a FasL-dependent manner. Malaria parasites infected erythroblasts express death receptor Fas. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induce the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the infected erythroblasts in a cell-to-cell contact-dependent manner. PS enhances the engulfment of the infected erythroid cells by phagocytes. T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule (Tim-4) contributes to the phagocytosis of malaria parasites infected cells as phosphatidylserine receptor. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective immunity exerted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in collaboration with phagocytes."
