Here we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus (IAV) to induce host shutoff. We show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Our measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff, and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions."

Here we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus (IAV) to induce host shutoff. We show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Our measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff, and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions."

Most viruses appear to dedicate themselves to using just one of these strategies. However, evidence suggests that the Influenza A virus uses both strategies to induce host shutoff."

These viruses cause an infectious disease that constitutes an important public health problem and remains today an important cause of morbidity and mortality (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fields , 2007</a>). Like all viruses, IAV is absolutely dependent on the host-cell protein synthesis machinery to produce its proteins. To ensure priority access to host translation machinery, many viruses utilize host shutoff mechanisms that eliminate competition from cellular transcripts (<a href=\"#bib48\">Walsh et al., 2012</a>). Host shutoff could be achieved by two complementary mechanisms: 1. Direct co-opting of the translation machinery by mechanisms that force better translation of viral mRNAs compared to their host counterparts. A classic example for this strategy is employed by poliovirus. It cleaves an essential host cap- binding protein, eIF4G, therefore preventing cap-dependent translation of host mRNAs while viral RNA translation stays unperturbed through the use of an internal ribosome entry site (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ventoso et al., 1998</a>). 2. Viral-induced degradation of host mRNAs. This strategy is employed by several herpesviruses that express endonucleases which cleave host mRNAs, thereby eliminating the competition with host mRNA for the translation apparatus and ensuring efficient cap-dependent translation of viral mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glaunsinger and Ganem, 2006</a>)."

Interestingly, it is one of the few viruses for which both direct translation co-opting and host mRNA degradation were suggested to play a prominent role in host shutoff (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yanguez and Nieto, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jagger et al., 2012</a>). Although IAV mRNAs share the basic features with host mRNAs like a 5\u2019 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) cap and a 3\u2019 poly-adenylate (poly(A)) tail, previous research suggested that influenza mRNAs are preferably translated due to features found in the 5\u2019UTR of viral mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Garfinkel and Katze, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Katze et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Park and Katze, 1995</a>). In addition host mRNA degradation has long been acknowledged (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beloso et al., 1992</a>). The 5\u2019 m7G caps on viral transcripts are acquired by \u201ccap-snatching\u201d\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Plotch et al., 1981</a>), this snatching allows the priming of viral mRNA synthesis but also leads to nascent host transcripts degradation. In addition, inhibition of polyadenylation of host pre-mRNA by IAV Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) protein (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nemeroff et al., 1998</a>), and degradation of the host RNA polymerase II complex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rodriguez and P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2007</a>) could contribute to the reduction in host transcripts in infected cells. Recently, a highly conserved IAV protein PA-X, possessing the PA endonuclease domain, was shown to selectively degrade host mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jagger et al., 2012</a>), strongly suggesting that PA-X is a general influenza host shutoff endonuclease."

To this end, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (deep sequencing of ribosomes-protected fragments) to globally map the changes in host genes RNA and translation levels during IAV infection. These comprehensive and simultaneous measurements complemented with Single molecule Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization (smFISH) revealed that host shutoff is mainly achieved by reduction in cellular mRNAs levels, and that IAV transcripts are not preferably translated. Our systematic analysis also reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and that the extent of mRNAs reduction is related to their length and GC content. Interestingly, we noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation related proteins are less affected by IAV infection, their protein levels remain stable throughout infection and their continuous expression supports the energetic demands that are essential for virus replication."

We designed our experiment to simultaneously monitor both RNA levels and translation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) allows a detailed mapping of transcript levels during infection and these were paired with ribosome footprints, which allow accurate measurement of protein synthesis by capturing the overall in vivo distribution of ribosomes on a given message (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). In order to assess the reproducibility of our experiments we prepared two independent biological replicates for each of these time points. Both the mRNA and footprints read density measurements were reproducible (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of 7211 human transcripts and the 8 viral transcripts that are expressed from the 8 genomic segments of influenza. Metagene analysis, in which gene profiles are aligned and then averaged, revealed the expected profiles of footprints along mRNAs; ribosome density accumulates along the gene body ending at the first in-frame stop codon with pronounced accumulation of ribosomes at the initiation and termination sites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Unexpectedly, examination of the ribosome profiling data obtained from influenza transcripts revealed reads that align to the IAV minus strand (vRNA) that is non-coding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These reads were not correlated with any sequence feature related to translation and were specific for the virus as individual human transcripts presented the expected profiles precluding any general problem in the sample preparation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To test if the footprints we obtained from viral mRNAs indeed originate from the ribosome protected fragments we generated an additional set of ribosome profiling libraries in which cells were pre-treated with harringtonine, a drug which leads to a strong accumulation of ribosomes precisely at translation initiation sites (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). As expected harringtonine treatment led to strong accumulation of ribosome protected fragments at the first AUG and to the\u00a0depletion of ribosome density from the body of the viral and host mRNAs. Thus, this indicates that the protected fragments we captured from both cellular and viral mRNAs originate from ribosome protected fragments of transcripts that were engaged in active translation elongation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B and D</a>). In contrast, the protected fragments that mapped to the IAV minus strand were not affected by harringtonine treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) indicating that the protection of these fragments is probably not mediated by translating ribosomes."

In ribosome-profiling data, the overall size distribution of fragments derived from protein-coding sequences, differs from the lengths of contaminating fragments found in profiling samples (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ingolia et al., 2014</a>). We used a fragment length organization similarity score (FLOSS) that measures the magnitude of disagreement between the footprints distribution on a given transcript and the footprints distribution on canonical CDS. As expected thousands of well-expressed protein-coding transcripts scored well, and the similarity improved with increasing read counts ([<a href=\"#bib20\">Ingolia et al., 2014</a>] and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). IAV mRNAs scored well in these matrixes and they did not differ from well-expressed human transcripts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, blue). However, reads from IAV minus strand could be clearly distinguished from annotated coding sequences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, red). We conclude that the protected fragments originating from minus strand viral RNA are not generated by ribosome protection. These fragments could originate from protection by the viral nucleoprotein (NP) that associates with viral genomes and was shown to sediment with viral RNAs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Duesberg, 1969</a>). This possibility is supported by the observation that the numbers of protected reads originating from the IAV genome increases as the infection progresses (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

TE is defined as the ratio of footprints to total mRNAs for a given gene and reflects how well a gene is being translated. We then compared the TE of human genes to that of viral genes at each of the time points along infection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The analysis shows that the viral genes translation efficiencies fall within the general range of host gene translation indicating that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated during IAV infection and that direct co-opting of the translation machinery does not play a dominant role in cellular gene shutoff. Instead, our systematic analysis demonstrates that host shutoff stems from the\u00a0viral dominance over the mRNA pool. At 8 hpi viral mRNAs take over 53.8% of the translation activity in the cells as 57.3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These findings show that the relative reduction in cellular mRNA expression is the main cause for host shutoff during infection.

This approach allowed clustering of the cellular transcripts into 4 distinct classes based on similarities in temporal expression profiles in the RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data.

Interestingly, cluster 1 which is composed of mRNAs that are most drastically downregulated is enriched with genes related to DNA repair and cell cycle (Pval\u00a0=\u00a01.7E-17 and Pval\u00a0=\u00a04.3E-18 respectively) whereas cellular mRNAs that are barely affected by IAV infection (cluster 3) are enriched with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and for transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins (Pval\u00a0=\u00a03.4E-10 and Pval\u00a0=\u00a03.9E-8, respectively). These measurements and analysis reveal that the shutoff in host protein synthesis is mainly driven by reduction in cellular mRNA levels, and that host mRNAs sensitivity to influenza is not uniform and certain mRNAs are more resistant to viral interference."

This analysis quantifies levels of ribosome occupancy higher or lower than those predicted from transcript abundance. In total, this approach allowed us to identify 210 cellular mRNAs that are differentially translated following IAV infection (Pval&lt;0.01, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Among these, 125 genes were translationally upregulated whereas 85 genes were translationally down regulated. While Go enrichment analysis did not reveal any significant functional category, we noticed that within the group of translationally upregulated genes at 4 hpi, there was an enrichment for genes that were previously shown as translationally induced in conditions in which eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) is phosphorylated (pval&lt;0.002, [<a href=\"#bib3\">Andreev et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sidrauski et al., 2015</a>]). eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is a stress response that reduces overall protein synthesis while enhancing the\u00a0translation of specific transcripts whose products support adaptive stress responses. By performing western blot analysis, we show that at 4 hpi eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is apparent and only at 8 hpi it is drastically reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). By analyzing polysome profiles prepared from uninfected and IAV infected cells at 4 hpi, we confirmed that IAV infection indeed induce the translation of UCP2 and RALGDS (two genes that are also translationally induced following stress induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [<a href=\"#bib3\">Andreev et al., 2015</a>]), but not that of control genes SOX4 and SF3B5 for which no change in translation was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). These results demonstrate that although IAV blocks eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Goodman et al., 2007</a>), at 4 hpi eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation affects the\u00a0cellular translation. In addition, these findings provide another confirmation for the accuracy of our translation measurements."

To this end, we used the smFISH technique that enables visualization of single mRNA molecules in fixed cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Raj et al., 2008</a>). This technique relies on the specific hybridization of short DNA libraries that are coupled to a fluorophore and are complementary to a specific target mRNA sequence.

We also tested the expression of one viral transcript,\u00a0Hemagglutinin (<i>HA</i>). We designed a panel of fluorescently labeled probes, each composed of 48 20-base oligos complementary to the coding sequences of each of these genes. We used A549 cells that were left uninfected or IAV infected and then fixed at 2, 4, and 8 hpi. Hybridization of these cells with the fluorescently labeled probes libraries yielded bright diffraction-limited dots, representing single transcripts. These were automatically counted using a custom image-processing software (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bahar Halpern, 2016</a>). Importantly, when we examined <i>HA</i> expression in uninfected cells we did not detect any diffraction-limited dots demonstrating the specificity of this approach (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Following infection with IAV, <i>HA</i> transcript levels were drastically elevated and at 8 hpi the intensity of the smFISH signal was too high to measure single dots (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The expression levels of the four cellular transcripts we measured by smFISH were highly correlated with our RNA-seq measurements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). These absolute quantifications of viral and host transcripts along IAV infection strongly support the notion that host shutoff is mainly driven by differences in mRNA levels. Furthermore, this data illustrates the variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction during IAV infection, suggesting that IAV-mediated degradation might act differently on different cellular transcripts."

However, recent work presented evidence that PA-X activity might be restricted to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</a>). On top of absolute quantification, smFISH also provides spatial information about mRNA molecule distribution in the cell. This allowed us to test the levels of endogenous cellular transcripts in the nucleus and cytoplasm along influenza infection. We quantified the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of <i>CHML</i> and <i>KIF8A</i>, which showed a\u00a0drastic reduction in their levels, and of <i>MYC</i> that showed subtler but still a\u00a0significant reduction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

If IAV interference with cellular transcript expression occurs mainly in the nucleus and there is no selectivity in this process then the decline in mRNA levels should be correlated with the cytoplasmic half-lives of mRNAs. Using recent measurements of mRNA half-lives in A549 cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maekawa et al., 2015</a>) we identified a significant enrichment in mRNAs with long half-lives in cluster 3, which includes genes that were only mildly affected by IAV infection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, Pval\u00a0=\u00a00.005), but this cluster contained also many genes with short half-life.

Using genome wide measurements of poly-A tail length (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 2014</a>) we did not observe any significant differences between the different clusters (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Taken together, these results strongly suggest that shorter and more structured transcripts (transcripts with higher GC content) tend to be less affected by IAV infection and therefore it is likely that the extent to which cellular mRNAs are degraded is at least partially governed by the quantity of exposed single stranded RNA in the nucleus."

However, dampening cellular gene expression also poses a big challenge, as viruses are fully dependent on cellular resources such as macromolecules\u2019 building blocks, energy production and the host translational machinery. Therefore, the observation that transcripts coding for ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation proteins, are less reduced following IAV infection, implies that the translation maintenance of these cellular pathways might be important for IAV infection. To validate this notion we conducted western blot analysis on cell extracts along IAV infection and could confirm the stable expression of components of the respiratory complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, upper panel), whereas other proteins were reduced following IAV infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lower panel). In accordance with these results, by staining infected cells with the potential sensitive mitochondrial stain Tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM), we show that the mitochondria membrane potential is not affected by IAV infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Next we tested if continuous oxidative phosphorylation is important for IAV propagation by employing drugs that interfere with the function of the\u00a0respiratory chain. We used either the ionophore Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) or Valinomycin that chelates potassium ions, both causing a collapses of the mitochondria membrane potential. When cells were infected for 2 hr and then treated with CCCP or Valinomycin in concentrations that did not affect cell viability (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), IAV titers were significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>). Overall, these results indicate that mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation are less perturbed by IAV infection, and that maintenance of intact oxidative phosphorylation activity during IAV infection is important for viral replication."

Inhibition of cellular pre-mRNAs polyadenylation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nemeroff et al., 1998</a>), 3.

These results are consistent with the notion that NS1 is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production(<a href=\"#bib41\">Salvatore et al., 2002</a>) and that PA-X endonuclease activity is a dominant factor in mediating host shutoff activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jagger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Khaperskyy\u00a0and\u00a0McCormick , 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bavagnoli et al., 2015</a>)."

Therefore, at this time point a portion of the viral RNA plus strand we measured are used as a\u00a0template for replication (cRNA) and not as mRNAs. Since our calculation of viral transcripts TE is based on dividing the number of footprints by the number of corresponding RNA reads it is possible that we underestimate the TE of viral genes at this time point. However, using our smFISH measurements for viral transcript we could show that &gt;90% of the plus strand viral RNA is located in the cytoplasm. Therefore, this potential bias could result in a\u00a0maximum of 10% effect that does not hamper our conclusions."

Our analysis supports the observation that IAV infection inhibit eIF2a phosphorylation but we show that this inhibition is not immediate. In our experimental system eIF2a was phosphorylated at 4 hpi and this stress response affects the expression of cellular genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Since our measurements suggest the P58-IPK (DNAJC3) expression is reduced during IAV infection (by three-fold) it is possible that other mechanisms also contribute to the inhibition of eIF2a phosphorylation."

To address this inherent limitation, we used smFISH, which allows absolute quantification of transcript levels in single cells. Our smFISH measurements correlated well with our global RNA quantification confirming our data and findings. In addition, our smFISH measurements show that after IAV infection RNA levels of endogenous cellular transcripts are reduced to a similar extent in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This observation suggests that cellular mRNAs degradation occurs in the nucleus but it could also be explained by blockage of transcription in conjunction to cytoplasmic degradation that reduces cytoplasmic mRNA levels. The recent observation that PA-X activity is mostly nuclear (<a href=\"#bib29\">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</a>) together with limited correlation with a cytoplasmic half-life strongly points to the former possibility."

The magnitude of reduction could only be partially explained by cytoplasmic half-life and interestingly the extent of reduction was significantly correlated with transcript\u2019s length and GC content. Since cap-snatching activity was shown to target mostly small nuclear RNAs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koppstein et al., 2015</a>), it is likely that the majority of the observed differential reduction in cellular mRNAs is driven by PA-X degradation activity. Therefore, the relation to the\u00a0length and GC content strongly points to a non-selective process of degradation, where the chances of a transcript to be degraded are influenced by the quantity of exposed ssRNA. This notion is consistent with existing in-vitro data showing PA-X preference to ssRNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bavagnoli et al., 2015</a>) and with the findings that PA-X lacks obvious sequence or location specificity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</a>). However, the notion that IAV induced degradation significantly depends on the length of the transcript does not easily reconcile with the evidence that PA-X specifically targets Pol II transcripts and that this specificity is connected to 3\u2019 end processing (<a href=\"#bib29\">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</a>). One way these results could be rationalized is if Pol II transcription and processing is physically limited to specific sub-nuclear compartments (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mitchell, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ghamari et al., 2013</a>). In this case, the specificity of PA-X to Pol II transcripts could originate from physical proximity, while the recognition itself could be random and depends on the length and GC content, which will govern the amount of exposed ssRNA. Another possibility is that degradation activity is coupled to mRNA splicing. This can explain the specificity to Pol II transcripts and the relative resistance of short transcripts which intrinsically also tend to have less exons. However, this possibility seems less favorable as at least by over expression PA-X did not affect the expression of cellular nascent transcripts (<a href=\"#bib29\">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</a>). Future work focused on PA-X activity can help shed light on the exact mechanism."

However, shutting off cellular protein production could also have adverse effects. Viruses are completely dependent on cellular resources and inhibiting cellular protein production can dampen processes that are indispensable for the virus. Interestingly, we noticed that transcripts that are less affected by IAV infection are enriched for genes involved in pathways that the virus potentially depends on, such as oxidative phosphorylation components and ribosomal proteins. In contrast, genes that were most significantly reduced are related to cell cycle, a cellular activity that is often blocked by viruses. Indeed, we were able to show that the levels of mitochondrial proteins are not affected by IAV even at 16 hpi, a time point in which other proteins were reduced. Further experiments demonstrated that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation to levels that do not affect cell\u2019s viability severely impairs viral replication. These results suggest that continuous expression of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation is important for viral propagation. Since viruses mostly interfere with protein synthesis, the level of protein reduction during infection is also tightly connected to the half-life of these proteins. In this regard, the observation that many of the proteins that perform basic cellular functions like translation and cellular respiration have long half-lives (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</a>) could also assist viruses to avoid detrimental damage from shutting-off cellular protein synthesis. The inherent difficulties in blocking host protein production should be common to other viruses inducing host shutoff, particularly viruses with long infection cycle. It will therefore be interesting to see whether other viruses that interfere with cellular protein synthesis will also do this in a differential manner, facilitating the maintenance of cellular functions that are important for viral propagation."

Significantly, they elegantly show that the potent suppression of host protein synthesis observed in IAV-infected cells does not result from preferentially IAV mRNA translation. Instead, declining host protein synthesis reflects virus-induced alterations to the composition of the underlying infected cell mRNA pool where viral mRNAs become the predominate species. For the first time, the variable impact of IAV infection on the host mRNA population is revealed and host transcripts able to sustain translation in IAV-infected cells are identified. Host transcripts that were less affected by IAV infection were significantly shorter in length and had higher GC content. Furthermore, IAV infection stimulated translation of host mRNAs responsive to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which reduces overall protein synthesis while enhancing translation of specific transcripts whose products support adaptive stress responses. In particular, host mRNAs refractory to IAV-induced host shut off are involved in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, which the authors show is continuously required throughout the viral replication program for optimal viral genome replication. This work is important to our understanding of virus-host interactions in IAV-infected cells not only because it addresses a fundamental biological problem, but also as it conclusively overturns incorrect ideas in the older literature that proclaimed preferential translation of IAV mRNAs (often without the rigorous evidence to warrant such a conclusion). The experiments are superbly and expertly executed, the data are clearly presented and the manuscript is well written."

Our new western blot analysis supports the observation that influenza virus blocks eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In our ribosome profiling measurements P58-IPK (DNAJC3) expression levels are reduced by 3-fold, but since our measurements are reporting on the level of translation (and not the levels of the protein) and previous reports suggested that P58-IPK activity is increased but not its expression, these results by themselves do not contradict or support the proposed model.
