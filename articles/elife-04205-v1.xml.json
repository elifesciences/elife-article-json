Several studies have suggested that behavior during the immature larval stages of <i>Drosophila</i> development is influenced by pheromones, but none of these compounds or the pheromone-receptor neurons that sense them have been identified. Here we report a larval pheromone-signaling pathway. We found that larvae produce two novel long-chain fatty acids that are attractive to other larvae. We identified a single larval chemosensory neuron that detects these molecules. Two members of the <i>pickpocket</i> family of <i>DEG/ENaC</i> channel subunits (<i>ppk23</i> and <i>ppk29</i>) are required to respond to these pheromones. This pheromone system is evolving quickly, since the larval exudates of <i>D. simulans</i>, the sister species of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, are not attractive to other larvae. Our results define a new pheromone signaling system in <i>Drosophila</i> that shares characteristics with pheromone systems in a wide diversity of insects."

While <i>Drosophila simulans</i> larvae were not attracted to the cues left by their own species, they were attracted to the pheromones produced by <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, indicating that they retain the sensory mechanisms to detect and respond to these pheromones. These results suggest that larvae experience a rapidly evolving, complex, pheromone-rich environment that may help them tailor their behavior to survive."

For example, pheromones mediate courtship, aggression, alarm signaling, parental care, navigation, aggregation and many other behaviors (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shorey, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib1a\">de Bruyne and Baker, 2008</a>). While the use of chemical cues is widespread amongst insects (<a href=\"#bib63\">Symonds and Elgar, 2008</a>) and other taxa, including mammals (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dulac and Torello, 2003</a>), the majority of our understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms that mediate insect pheromone signaling has come from studies of a single species, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. This is because many powerful genetic tools have been developed to study gene and neural circuit function in <i>Drosophila</i>. Most studies of pheromones in <i>Drosophila</i> have focused on pheromones related to sex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dahanukar and Ray, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fern\u00e1ndez and Kravitz, 2013</a>). These studies have provided a rich mechanistic understanding of the receptor genes and sensory neurons that detect these cues, and of the circuit architectures that mediate these behaviors, linking the detection of specific molecules to appropriate behavioral outputs."

For example, ants employ substrate-born pheromones to establish and maintain foraging trails (<a href=\"#bib59\">Steck, 2012</a>) and caterpillars use pheromones to organize mass migrations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fitzgerald, 1976</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2003</a>). To date, it has not been possible to study such problems in <i>Drosophila</i> because no pheromones were known that exclusively mediate aggregation or trail following. Nonetheless, several previous studies have provided suggestive evidence that <i>Drosophila</i> larval behavior is influenced by social cues. First, <i>Drosophila</i> larvae are robustly attracted to odors produced by other larvae in food (<a href=\"#bib17\">Durisko and Dukas, 2013</a>). Second, when in close proximity on a food source, larvae both aggregate (<a href=\"#bib18\">Durisko et al., 2014</a>) and engage in a form of co-operative digging, which may effectively increase their rate of feeding (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Xu et al., 2008</a>). Finally, in natural conditions, where different species of drosophilids can be found sharing the same food resource, larvae preferentially pupariate with conspecific larvae and avoid pupariating with larvae of other species (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beltram\u00ed et al., 2012</a>). Each of these three phenomena, it has been proposed, may be mediated by chemical cues produced by larvae or by larval activity."

We discovered two novel pheromones\u2014<i>(Z)-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid and <i>(Z)-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid\u2014that larvae deposit on substrate and that act as larval attractants. We identified a larval chemosensory neuron that is responsive to these compounds and that is required for behavioral attraction to these pheromones. We found that, in addition to their previously described roles in sex-pheromone detection, two members of the <i>pickpocket</i> family of <i>DEG/ENaC</i> channel subunits, <i>pickpocket23</i> and <i>pickpocket29,</i> are required for detecting (<i>Z)-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid and <i>(Z)-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid. Finally, we have found evolved differences in the production of these pheromones in the genus <i>Drosophila,</i> which, along with a repellent cue, cause differences in larval social behavior between these species<i>.</i> Our work provides the first window into social signaling during the larval stage of <i>Drosophila</i> and demonstrates that these mechanisms, and this social behavior, have evolved rapidly. Many insects employ fatty acid derived pheromones in the context of aggregation and navigation, and our work in <i>Drosophila</i> establishes a model system with which to further explore the sensory mechanisms and neural circuits that process this class of chemical cues."

Then, we cut away half the agarose surface, replaced it with fresh agarose, and placed a single new larva on the plate. We found that test larvae spent more time on the larval-treated substrate than on the untreated control substrate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting that the population of larvae had deposited an attractive pheromone on the substrate."

A high density of wild-type early third instar larvae were allowed to crawl over the surface of an agarose plate for 20 min.

Control larvae were attracted to low concentrations (50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup>) of (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid and (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid, but not to any other compound (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, larvae showed a sustained response to these two molecules over the entire duration of a 5-min assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). Dose response curves revealed that (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid and (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid are strongly attractive to larvae across a broad range of concentrations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Larvae responded most strongly to pheromone concentrations of 50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and this effect decreased at higher concentrations. A similar phenomenon has been observed for pheromones in multiple other species where higher doses induce a less robust behavioral response, or even begin to elicit alarm or escape behaviors, compared with lower doses (<a href=\"#bib37\">Leal et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shimizu et al., 2003</a>). Finally, we assayed the larval response to an equimolar mixture ((25 fmol:25 fmol)/cm<sup>2</sup>) of the two compounds. Larvae were attracted to a blend of these compounds, but were less responsive to this mixture than to a presentation of each molecule alone, which suggests an interaction between the two pheromones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I,J</a>). These results indicate that larvae deposit the two compounds (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid and (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid on substrate and that low concentrations of these compounds provide an attractive cue to other larvae."

This concentration corresponds to the concentration of compounds in extract of larval residue generated by hundreds of individuals. Thus, in principle, many or all of these larval compounds might contribute to larval social behavior. To determine which, if any, of these compounds are detected by <i>R58F10</i> neurons, we tested the behavioral response of larvae to synthetic compounds with and without silenced <i>R58F10</i> neurons. Silencing <i>R58F10</i> neurons with tetanus toxin blocked larval attraction to (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid, (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid, and a mixture of the two pheromones, but had no significant effect on the response to the other compounds at 50 fmol/cm<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,I</a>). Driving a mutant form of tetanus toxin carrying two point mutations that block its cleavage of synaptobrevin (<i>IMPTV</i>) caused an intermediate response to these pheromones. This suggests that some of the effect of driving <i>TNT</i> in <i>R58F10</i> may arise from indirect toxicity. Other groups have also found that expressing IMPTV can sometimes produce intermediate phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kain et al., 2013</a>). These results demonstrate that larval attraction to previously occupied substrate can be mediated by the sensitivity of <i>R58F10</i> neurons to (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid and (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid."

To determine if larval pheromone signaling has evolved within the <i>D. melanogaster</i> species group, we investigated social behavior in two sister species of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, <i>Drosophila simulans</i> and <i>Drosophila sechellia</i>. These species diverged from <i>D. melanogaster</i> approximately 3\u20135 MYA and diverged from each other approximately 0.5 MYA (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kliman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lachaise and Silvain, 2004</a>). First, we tested if <i>D. sechellia</i> and <i>D. simulans</i> larvae deposit residue that is attractive to other larvae. We found that third instar <i>D. sechellia</i> larvae are attracted, and <i>D. simulans</i> larvae are not attracted, to substrate treated with conspecific larvae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

We reasoned that this difference could be caused by evolved changes in <i>D. simulans</i> leading to either (1) loss of sensitivity to an attractant, (2) loss of production of an attractant, (3) production of a repellent molecule, or a combination of these factors."

These molecules could be released locally to enhance larval aggregation at a food source, since <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, like many other insect species, exploit their food resource more efficiently in aggregates (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allee and Bowen, 1932</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lewontin, 1955</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wertheim et al., 2002</a>).

These genes play broad, non-redundant roles in sex pheromone-mediated behaviors, courtship and aggression, and are required for detecting the male pheromones, cVA, (Z)-5-pentacosene, and (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tricosene, and the female pheromones, 7,11-heptacosadiene and 7,11-nonacosadiene (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Toda et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>).

Members of this family form heteromeric protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eskandari et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Benson and et al., 2002</a>). It has been proposed by several research groups that the responses to specific pheromones could be conferred by other channel subunits or by an accessory protein that forms a complex with <i>ppk23</i> and/or <i>ppk29</i>. Alternatively, <i>ppk23</i> and <i>ppk29</i> may act more generally in pheromone transduction or to maintain the excitability of neurons. Recent work has demonstrated that <i>ppk29</i> is expressed more broadly than initially characterized, and that <i>ppk29</i> mRNA regulates a second channel gene (<i>seizure</i>) to control membrane excitability of motor neurons through a protein independent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>). In either case, our work broadens the roles that <i>ppk23</i> and <i>ppk29</i> play in detecting pheromones.

First, the reduced attractiveness of <i>D. simulans</i> is caused, at least in part, by a reduction in (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid production. Second, an unidentified repellent cue present in <i>D. simulans</i> residue blocks the attractive activity of the reduced levels of (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid, and may act through a (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid-dependent mechanism to block larval attraction to (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid. Interactions between pheromones that cause behaviorally antagonistic effects, such as we have observed, have been studied most intensively in the context of plume following during moth courtship (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker, 2008</a>). In many species, female moths release blends of volatile attractive pheromones to attract courting males. The major components of these blends are often shared in closely related sympatric species of moths, while these blends differ in minor components. These species-specific minor components can block the attraction of males to the blend (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vickers and Baker, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Quero and Baker, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lelito et al., 2008</a>), a mechanism that likely reduces interspecific courtship. An alternative hypothesis that can explain the evolved difference in larval attraction that we observed is that larvae are exquisitely sensitive to the ratio of (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>5-tetradecenoic acid to (<i>Z</i>)<i>-</i>7-tetradecenoic acid. We believe that this explanation is unlikely, because, although the levels of both pheromones are reduced in <i>D. simulans,</i> the ratio of these two pheromones is not significantly different from the ratios observed in <i>D. sechellia</i> and <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Alternatively, the costs associated with providing positional information by releasing pheromones, such as the increased risks of predation, parasitism, or even cannibalism by conspecific larvae (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hassell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Vijendravarma et al., 2013</a>) might in some situations outweigh the benefits of aggregation. Finally, the geographic range of <i>D. simulans</i> is largely overlapping with other species in this subgroup, and larvae of different species can often be found exploiting the same resource. While <i>D. simulans</i> produces little (<i>Z</i>)-5-tetradecenoic acid or (<i>Z</i>)-7-tetradecenoic acid, it is still attracted to these molecules. When sharing habitat with heterospecific larvae, it is possible that <i>D. simulans</i> larvae could benefit from eavesdropping on aggregation signals produced by other species while avoiding the direct and indirect costs of producing these compounds themselves."

However, recent studies have revealed rich detail about their social environments. For example, nematodes produce a complex set of pheromone signals mediated by a diverse family of molecules called ascarisides (<a href=\"#bib9\">Braendle, 2012</a>). These molecules act to coordinate aspects of development and serve as both aggregation and dispersal cues (<a href=\"#bib47\">Macosko et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yamada et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Srinivasan et al., 2012</a>). Both the synthesis and behavioral responses to these pheromones are evolving rapidly, and may be adaptations related to ecological specialization of these nematodes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Braendle, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Choe et al., 2012</a>). Our identification of <i>Drosophila</i> larval aggregation pheromones represents a similarly unexpected level of complexity in invertebrate behavior, and may be only the first example of multiple pheromones that mediate larval social experience in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Larvae were isolated using standard procedures (<a href=\"#bib45\">Louis et al., 2008</a>). All video recordings were performed with SONY DCR-HC52 MiniDV Handycam Camcorders, backlit with a white lightboard. To measure the activity of larval residue, 100 mm \u00d7 15 mm polystyrene petri dishes (Fisher Scientific International, Inc., Hampton, New Hampshire) filled with 2% agarose were treated with a high density of larvae, nearly coating the entire surface for 30 min. The larvae were removed and discarded, and half of the larval-treated agarose was cut away and replaced with untreated 2% agarose. Single test larvae were deposited in the center of each prepared assay plate and their locations were recorded for 10 min. Larval positions were analyzed afterward by hand in 10 s intervals. To isolate and assay the activity larval extract, we treated pre-washed WHEATON Glass 20 ml Scintillation Vials with isolated larvae standardized by volume for 30 min. We removed the larvae and extracted the larval residue off the glass surface for 20 min with 2 ml (for behavioral assays) or 200 \u00b5l (for chemical analysis) solvent. To measure the activity of extracts, we coated half of an agarose petri dish with extract and half with solvent. We deposited a single larva in the center of each prepared assay plate and recorded their locations for 10 min. Larva positions were determined afterward by hand in 30 s intervals. To test the attraction of larvae to individual compounds, each synthetic compound was solubilized in acetone and deposited onto a Corning 245 mm Square BioAssay Dish filled with 2% agarose. We used a 16 square stainless steel stencil adhered to the agarose to print a checkerboard pattern of control and treated squares. The dimensions of each square was 25 mm \u00d7 25 mm. Small groups (8\u201312) of larvae were place in the center of the assay area and monitored for 5.5 min.

The activity of pheromone-sensing neurons was performed on second instar larvae carrying two copies of the Janelia enhancer R58F10-GAL4 and two copies of 20XUAS-GCaMP6-S (the slow, sensitive variant). Larvae were isolated and washed as described above. Hydrophobic test compounds were mobilized in adult hemolymph saline (AHS) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 2003</a>) using detergent, CYMAL-7 (1.5 critical micelle count (CMC)) (Affymetrix; C327, Santa Clara, CA). Larvae were partially dissected in AHS and mounted on a custom-built, acrylic, 75 mm \u00d7 25 mm slide, with a 2 mm slot cut down the center for test compound delivery ending in a small reservoir. Larvae were positioned perpendicular to and facing the slot and loosely fixed into position with a 22 mm coverslip (Fisher Scientific; 12-542-B.) and the slide was flushed with AHS. GCaMP fluorescence was measured by scanning at 1 Hz on a Leica DM5500 Q Microscope using Leica Microsystems LAS AP software. Neurons were imaged for 30 s to establish baseline fluorescence, after which 200 \u00b5l AHS with 1.5 CMC CYMAL-7 (control) or AHS with 1.5 CMC CYMAL-7 and 1 nM test compound were gently injected into the central slot. Recordings continued for 150 s. Changes in fluorescence were calculated using MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox and Fiji. To calculate the appropriate concentrations of pheromone to test, we posited that the larva might detect molecules within 1 mm<sup>2</sup> in behavioral assays, and within 1 mm<sup>3</sup> around its terminal organ in calcium imaging experiments. We therefore estimate that 50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 nM amount to 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> molecules and 6.0 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> molecules, respectively."

First though, we would like to point out that we have not claimed that <i>R58F10</i> is the only sensory neuron responsive to these pheromones. Rather, in the Discussion we argue that because the single cell marked by <i>R58F10</i> is necessary for this behavior, this reagent provides a unique opportunity to dissect pheromone processing in the sub-esophageal zone of the brain. Nonetheless, we agree that testing other <i>ppk23</i> expressing neurons would be interesting. With our current calcium imaging setup, it is not possible to record from all chemosensory neurons, or from all <i>ppk23</i>-expressing neurons simultaneously. Therefore, we decided to focus on two sensory neurons most similar to <i>R58F10</i> that also innervate the dorsolateral terminal organ sensillum and that express <i>ppk23</i>. These neurons are marked by <i>Gr33a-GAL4</i>, they can be identified morphologically in our recording preparation, and their cell bodies are often adjacent in the dorsal organ ganglion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Also, we demonstrated that these cells are not necessary for the described behavioral response to larval pheromone (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We cannot discriminate between these two cells, so we pooled the calcium imaging data from both."

The units we used to express the concentration of pheromone used in behavior and physiology experiments are different because in the behavior experiment the pheromone was spread across a small surface and in the GCaMP assay the pheromone was mobilized in solution. We estimate that the concentration of pheromone exposed to the larval dorsal organs is similar in the two experiments. If we posit that the larva detects molecules within 1 mm<sup>2</sup> around the dorsal organ in the behavior assay and within 1 mm<sup>3</sup> around the dorsal organ in the calcium imaging experiments, then the concentrations used\u201450 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 nM\u2014translate to 3.0x10<sup>8</sup> molecules and 6.0 x10<sup>8</sup> molecules, respectively. Again, we did not make this clear in the original manuscript, and we now mention this in the text: \u201cWe tested a range of pheromone concentrations estimated to encompass those encountered by larvae in the previously described behavioral assays\u201d and include a fuller explanation in the Methods: \u201cTo calculate the appropriate concentrations of pheromone to tests, we posited that the larva might detect molecules within 1 mm<sup>2</sup> in behavioral assays, and 1 mm<sup>3</sup> around its terminal organ in calcium imaging experiments. With this estimate 50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 nM amount to 3.0x10<sup>8</sup> molecules, and 6.0 x10<sup>8</sup> molecules, respectively\u201d. In addition, we agree that a dose-response analysis may be informative and we now show GCaMP results for three concentrations of pheromones spanning from 0.1 nM to 10 nM in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>."
