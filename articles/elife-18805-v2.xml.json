Although, this sequential activity is formed by collective communication among the neurons, it is unknown how the participation is shared versus divided within the population. Distinct motor tasks have been reported to be divided among dedicated microcircuits in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ampatzis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bagnall and McLean, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fetcho and McLean, 2010</a>). Nevertheless, do all neurons, which are dedicated to a particular motor activity, spike at approximately the same rate? Or do only some neurons spike at high rate, while most others spike at lower rates? An arrangement with a spectrum of different firing rates could be beneficial by adding the possibility of increasing the overall activity, for instance during uphill walking where a stronger force is needed. In this way the spinal circuit could enhance flexibility by adopting a diversity of firing rates across the population. Other networks in the central nervous system face a similar challenge of how to distribute the activity across the population in order to collectively increase the dynamic range (<a href=\"#bib110\">Wohrer et al., 2013</a>). In sensory processing, neural circuits must be able to retain sensitivity both to weak and strong input. Weak stimuli are amplified whereas strong stimuli are attenuated in order to reduce saturation. If there is too much activity, the circuit reaches saturation and therefore loses the ability to resolve differences in sensory input. Furthermore, amplification of weak signals by recurrent excitation pose the risk of unstable activity, which can spin out of control (<a href=\"#bib107\">Vogels et al., 2005</a>). This computational challenge of how networks maintain both stability and sensitivity is an open question especially for spinal networks."

It is well\u2013established that unstable states such as epileptiform activity can easily be achieved by shifting the balance in favor of excitation, e.g. by blocking inhibition (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dichter and Ayala, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bazhenov et al., 2008</a>). The concept of <i>balanced excitation (E) and inhibition (I)</i> (balanced networks in short) was introduced two decades ago (<a href=\"#bib88\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</a>) and has sparked numerous studies both theoretical (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amit and Brunel, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Ozeki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>) as well as experimental (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Okun and Lampl, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Higley and Contreras, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kishore et al., 2014</a>). The primary purpose of theoretical models of balanced networks was initially to understand irregular spiking, which was widely observed in experiments (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bell et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1994</a>). Irregular spiking was puzzling because it could not be explained by random arrival of excitatory input alone, since this randomness was effectively regularized by temporal integration (<a href=\"#bib22\">Den\u00e8ve and Machens, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Softky and Koch, 1993</a>). Models of balanced networks not only were able to explain irregular spiking, but also revealed other interesting phenomena, such as emergent linearity (<a href=\"#bib103\">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</a>), multifunctionalism (<a href=\"#bib100\">Sussillo and Abbott, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hennequin et al., 2014</a>) and self\u2013sustained stable network activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amit and Brunel, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hansel and Mato, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ikegaya et al., 2013</a>)."

This view was essentially predicted much earlier in random walk models (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gerstein and Mandelbrot, 1964</a>). The concept of balanced E/I is now an integrated part of understanding network processing in cortex and elsewhere, but for some reason it has been forgotten in understanding spinal motor networks, with the exception of a few isolated studies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Petersen et al., 2014</a>)."

These two regimes have contrasting manifestations (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>): The fluctuation\u2013driven regime has a skewed/lognormal firing rate distribution whereas the mean\u2013driven regime has regular spiking and a symmetric distribution. A simple mechanism has been proposed to explain the lognormal firing in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime by <a href=\"#bib83\">Roxin et al. (2011)</a>: The skewness in distribution arises out of a supralinear transformation of the synaptic input, which is Gaussian by virtue of the central limit theorem (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A response to multiple input, which is larger than the sum of their individual responses (i.e. supralinear), will enhance sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib84\">Rubin et al., 2015</a>) and therefore this mechanism may constitute an important physiological purpose."

Such linear (or sublinear) transformation will reduce rather than enhance sensitivity and therefore the mean\u2013driven regime will curb network activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmadian et al., 2013</a>). These two transformations work together into an S-shaped IO-curve, where weak input are amplified yet the network is kept stable for strong activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Sample neurons in the two regimes are shown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>).

The high resistance to anoxia of turtles allows using adult animals with fully developed spinal circuitry, which have healthy network activity and which can perform multiple complex motor behaviors (<a href=\"#bib97\">Stein, 2005</a>). Thus, we can investigate the population activity during, not just one behavior, but multiple motor behaviors. Custom designed high\u2013density silicon electrodes recorded the population activity from hundreds of cells in the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal axes along with the intracellular <math id=\"inf5\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> of single neurons and multiple relevant motor nerves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This is a unique experimental investigation, because it explores the link between neuronal ensemble data, which in itself is rare in spinal motor research, and the forefront of theoretical neuroscience."

The array recordings were performed simultaneously with recording of the intracellular activity of a single neuron in parallel with electroneurograms (ENGs) from relevant motor nerves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Site\u2013specific rhythmic hindlimb scratching was induced by tactile touch of the carapace (<a href=\"#bib12\">Berkowitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Stein, 2005</a>) and could be reproduced reliably over multiple trials (<a href=\"#bib72\">Petersen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Vestergaard and Berg, 2015</a>).

                                "text": "Two mechanisms have previously been proposed to explain the skewned lognormal firing rate distribution, which is also observed in other parts of the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib19\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Mizuseki, 2014</a>). Lognormal distributions could either arise from a nonlinear transformation of normally distributed inputs (<a href=\"#bib83\">Roxin et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or from a linear transformation of a lognormally distributed synaptic input (<a href=\"#bib110\">Wohrer et al., 2013</a>). The latter mechanism was considered in connection with the sparse spiking activity in auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib54\">Koulakov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hrom\u00e1dka et al., 2008</a>) and since synaptic weights within neocortex have a heavy tail lognormal distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ikegaya et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Song et al., 2005</a>). Models also show that the <math id=\"inf10\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> distribution can be either skewed or Gaussian depending on the synaptic input intensity (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ostojic, 2011</a>). Therefore, to distinguish between the proposed mechanisms, it is important to first assess whether the synaptic current is normally versus lognormally distributed. Secondly, to test whether the transformation of the synaptic input to spiking output is linear versus supralinear. We started by addressing the first requirement by investigating the synaptic input in intracellular recordings. The most relevant part of the data was found during the peak of a locomotor cycle where the <math id=\"inf11\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> was in vicinity of <math id=\"inf12\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></math> and was dominated by synaptic potentials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>). The motor activity was clearly non\u2013stationary, which means that the spike activity was likely to move between the fluctuation\u2013 and mean\u2013regime. Nevertheless, the rhythmic activity possessed a separation of timescales in the sense that the activity between cycles (<math id=\"inf13\"><mo>\u223c</mo></math>1 s) contained much larger excursions in <math id=\"inf14\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> than within cycles (<math id=\"inf15\"><mo>\u223c</mo></math>2-400 ms). Here, the mean <math id=\"inf16\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> did not change much and for practical purposes it could be considered constant within the cycle. In the following analysis of the intracellular data we regarded the dynamics in <math id=\"inf17\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> as stationary within a cycle \u2013 well aware that the comparison to theoretical models, which are based on assumption of stationarity, should be taken with a grain of salt. We intended to investigate the symmetry of the distribution of synaptic current using this assumption. The synaptic current within a cycle is difficult to assess, but rather than the mean current, we were primarily interested in the fluctuations in current, which we could approximate from <math id=\"inf18\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> via Ohm\u2019s law under the following conditions. Within a cycle, the mean <math id=\"inf19\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> was just below threshold and did not change its value much. Therefore the voltage\u2013activated conductances were approximately constant such that there was an Ohmic relationship between synaptic current and <math id=\"inf20\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>. This is likely justified for neurons in fluctuation\u2013driven regime, since the conductance is often high and dominated by balanced E/I synaptic input (<a href=\"#bib23\">Destexhe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>). The high conductance suppresses the coupling between <math id=\"inf21\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> and intrinsic conductance in a divisive manner (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kolind et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Tiesinga et al., 2000</a>). Thus, in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime the non\u2013Ohmic contributions were likely smaller and the <math id=\"inf22\"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>-relationship more linear than in the mean\u2013driven regime."

                                "text": "We intended to test the hypothesis of normally distributed input, but since the approximation of using the variability in <math id=\"inf23\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> as a proxy for the variability in synaptic current is most valid for the neurons in fluctuation\u2013driven regime, we needed a way to distinguish neurons that were primarily in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime. We therefore propose a novel metric, the return map ratio , which quantifies the degree of fluctuations leading up to a spike (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The return map ratio (RMR) quantifies how direct the subthreshold <math id=\"inf24\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>\u2013trajectory is between spikes and this forms the basis for selecting neurons in our analysis. An RMR close to 0.5 has fluctuation\u2013driven spiking whereas a value close to 1 has mean\u2013driven spiking (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Therefore, we defined a neuron as fluctuation-driven if its RMR <math id=\"inf25\"><mrow><mi></mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0.7</mn></mrow></math>; in our sample of intracellular recordings we found 50/68 neurons in this regime. A sample neuron, which was found in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime based on this metric illustrates how we obtained the distribution of sub\u2013threshold <math id=\"inf26\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The distribution was estimated both by selecting the <math id=\"inf27\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> in between spikes (temporal distribution) and by collecting instances of <math id=\"inf28\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> prior to spike peak in a spike triggered overlay (\u2018sigma\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These two estimates are in agreement with one another for the sample cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This agreement is also found across the population as quantified by the mean and SD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The skewness for the distributions across the population is small and scattered around zero as expected for normal (symmetric) distributions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). From these data we conclude that the subthreshold <math id=\"inf29\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>\u2013distributions are not skewed, but rather symmetrical and <i>Gaussian\u2013like</i> (cf. inset distributions, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Nevertheless, the minimal requirement for confirming the two\u2013regime hypothesis for the single neuron is that the synaptic current (not the synaptic potentials) is Gaussian (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). As we argued earlier, if there is an Ohmic relationship between current and potential, which is likely during high\u2013conductance states, then this requirement would be granted. More importantly, now that we do find a Gaussian <math id=\"inf30\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>\u2013distribution, it is difficult to contemplate a non-linear <math id=\"inf31\"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></math>-relationship, which would result in such a symmetric distribution. The synaptic input current would have to have a finely matched inverse distribution to cancel out this non\u2013linearity in order to achieve a symmetric <math id=\"inf32\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>\u2013distribution. A more parsimonious explanation therefore is that, since the synaptic potentials are normally distributed, they are a result of a linear transformation of synaptic currents, which are also normally distributed."

Nevertheless, the foundation of the skewness in population rate distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) is not necessarily directly linked to the skewness of the instantaneous rate distribution of single neurons. In principle, it is possible to have a population with a normal distribution of mean firing rates, where the cells themselves have lognormally distributed firing rates and vice versa. Therefore, we needed to address the distribution of mean <math id=\"inf61\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> across the population and test whether this was skewed or normal. Further, since the sub\u2013threshold IO-curve is linked to threshold, it is important to establish the distance of mean <math id=\"inf62\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> from threshold with respect to the size of synaptic fluctuations, i.e. standard deviation of <math id=\"inf63\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> (<math id=\"inf64\"><mi>\u03c3</mi></math>).

If we assume, when normalizing <math id=\"inf69\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> this way, the IO-curve has approximately the same nonlinearity across all neurons, the population distribution of firing rates will also be skewed due to the nonlinear transformation of the normally\u2013distributed input (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>) to a lognormally\u2013distributed output. These results are in qualitative accordance with the scheme proposed previously (<a href=\"#bib83\">Roxin et al., 2011</a>).

                                "text": "The link between a normally distributed input and a lognormally distributed output is a supralinear transformation. To test whether this is a hallmark of the fluctuation\u2013driven regime, we needed to estimate the input\u2013output (IO)\u2013function for the subthreshold domain. The IO\u2013function of neurons is a fundamental property of the nervous system, and therefore it is well-characterized both theoretically (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gerstner et al., 2014</a>) and experimentally (<a href=\"#bib94\">Silver, 2010</a>). Nevertheless, it has rarely been established for fluctuation\u2013driven spiking. Here, we estimated the IO-function for subthreshold spiking via the probability of eliciting a spike as a function of <math id=\"inf70\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> in the following way. First, we collected instances of <math id=\"inf71\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> shortly before the spike\u2013onset, where <math id=\"inf72\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> is depolarized yet still not part of the deterministic spike trajectory. The probability that a given value of <math id=\"inf73\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> will cause a spike was estimated as the histogram of <math id=\"inf74\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>\u2013instances (gray histogram, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) divided by the total time spent at all values of <math id=\"inf75\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> (green histogram). This gives the empirical relationship between <math id=\"inf76\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> and the firing rate (<a href=\"#bib45\">Jahn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Vestergaard and Berg, 2015</a>). The IO\u2013function had a strong non\u2013linear shape (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To capture the curvature we fitted both a power\u2013law and an exponential for all <math id=\"inf77\"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>68</mn></mrow></math> neurons and the curvature had a weak negative correlation with the SD of the <math id=\"inf78\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>\u2013fluctuation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>) as demonstrated previously (<a href=\"#bib106\">Vestergaard and Berg, 2015</a>). Similar expansive nonlinearity has previously been characterized in sensory\u2013driven neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hansel and van Vreeswijk, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Miller and Troyer, 2002</a>). It will transform the normally\u2013distributed synaptic potentials into a lognormally\u2013distributed spiking output in the fluctuation-driven regime (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). For mean\u2013driven spiking the IO-function is not supralinear, but rather linear (or even sublinear), and the normally\u2013distributed synaptic input will therefore be transformed to a normally distributed spiking output (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In conclusion, neurons that have fluctuation\u2013driven spiking also have a non\u2013linear IO-transformation of synaptic potentials to spiking output."

To confirm this, we measured the distribution of the instantaneous firing rate, i.e. the inverse of ISIs. The quiet period in between burst cycles were not included in the analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>), since in these periods <math id=\"inf91\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> was far from <math id=\"inf92\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></math> and therefore in an irrelevant part of the IO\u2013function. The firing rate distribution of many cells was positively skewed and resembled a normal distribution with near zero skewness on a log-scale (sample cell shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This is expected for poisson\u2013like spiking in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ostojic, 2011</a>). Nevertheless, distributions for all the intracellularly recorded neurons (<math id=\"inf93\"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>68</mn></mrow></math>) were skewed to a varying degree from strong positive to zero skewness on a linear axis and similarly shifted downwards on log axis (cf. gray and green histograms, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This suggests that neurons were found in a spectrum between fluctuation\u2013 and mean\u2013driven spiking. More negative log\u2013skewness were associated with higher mean rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This is probably due to a larger presence in the mean\u2013regime at higher firing rates, where the distribution skewness is expected to be negative on a log\u2013scale, i.e. Gaussian on a linear scale. Note that the spectrum of skewness was substantially larger than it was for the <math id=\"inf94\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> distributions above (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Skewed Gaussian distributions are shown to illustrate the range of skewness in the data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In conclusion, these results suggest that the skewness in firing rates is an indicator of the degree of participation in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime."

We first look at two heuristic neurons, one in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime and one in the mean\u2013driven regime. The fluctuation\u2013driven neuron spent most of the time below threshold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and had more irregular spiking as quantified by a local measure of irregularity, the <math id=\"inf97\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> (green line). <math id=\"inf98\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> is the difference of two adjacent ISIs divided by their mean (<a href=\"#bib41\">Holt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Bruno et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, the mean\u2013driven neuron spent most time above threshold and had more regular spiking, i.e. <math id=\"inf99\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> closer to zero (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

The distribution of <math id=\"inf101\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> for all trials had higher mean for the fluctuation\u2013driven cell than the mean\u2013driven (cf. arrows, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Also, the cumulative time spent below threshold was higher for the fluctuation\u2013driven cell (96%) than the mean\u2013driven cell (35%, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This fraction of time spent below threshold was quantified for every neuron (<math id=\"inf102\"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>68</mn></mrow></math>) and the population distribution had a strong mode at 1 (top, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) suggesting many neurons spent much time in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime. To compress the diversity within the population into a simpler representation, we used the reverse cumulative distribution of neurons versus time spent below threshold (bottom, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This indicates how many neurons (y-axis) spent at least a given fraction of time (x-axis) below threshold. The intercept with the 50%\u2013line (broken line) indicates what fraction of time half the population at least spent below threshold. This fraction is remarkably high (84%) suggesting a prominent presence within the fluctuation\u2013driven regime."

To verify these traits, we used another sample neuron as a heuristic illustration. We injected different levels of either positive or negative bias currents in different trials while keeping all else constant. A negative constant current injection (\u22121.0 nA) caused a decrease in firing rate and a slight increase in irregularity (green line) compared with zero injected current (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>). Similarly, a positive current injection (1.7 nA) caused more spikes and a decrease in irregularity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) consistent with a movement between regimes (inset in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The decrease in irregularity with increasing input was further quantified as a negative correlation between mean <math id=\"inf119\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> and injected current (<math id=\"inf120\"><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>0.84</mn></mrow></mrow></math>, p<math id=\"inf121\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mo>\u226a</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>0.001) over multiple trials (n=18, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>).

The instantaneous firing rate in the control condition (0 nA) was lognormal as expected for the fluctuation\u2013driven regime (top, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). When adding input current the distribution was shifted to the right and enriched with a negative skewness as expected for mean-driven spiking (bottom, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). This relation between input and shape of rate distribution was further confirmed by a negative correlation between multiple current injections and skewness both on linear scale (gray dots) and log\u2013scale (red dots, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Hence, skewness and irregularity are indicators of the spiking regime."

This is important for understanding the cause of irregularity and the fluctuation\u2013driven regime. Hence, we manipulated the synaptic input in a reduced preparation with micro\u2013superfusion of strychnine, a glycinergic blocker, over the transverse cut surface of the spinal cord (described in [<a href=\"#bib9\">Berg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Vestergaard and Berg, 2015</a>]). This affected only neurons at the surface (<math id=\"inf128\"><mo>&lt;</mo></math>300 \u03bcm) without affecting the rest of the network, which was verified by careful monitoring of flow and the network activity via the nerve recordings. Comparing the spiking during control condition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) with that during blockade of inhibition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), we noticed a strong increase in spiking. This is consistent with a depolarization due to disinhibition, thus \u2018unbalancing\u2019 the excitatory and inhibitory input. Reducing inhibition tipped the balance of E/I toward larger inward synaptic current, which resulted in a more depolarized <math id=\"inf129\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> (blue line) well above threshold (arrows, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure A\u2013B</a>). It also resulted in higher firing rates and lower irregularity on the peak (cf. green lines). Generally, the irregularity (<math id=\"inf130\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>) was higher in the control case than in the unbalanced case (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) similar to the results observed with current injection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>). The irregularity was also negatively correlated with depolarization of the mean <math id=\"inf131\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> when unbalancing the E/I although it was uncorrelated in the control condition, where the spiking occurred in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The instantaneous firing rate was skewed and lognormal in the control case (top, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), similar to the above sample cell (top, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). This distribution became negatively skewed when adding inward current (bottom, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Similar effect was seen when \u2018unbalancing\u2019 the synaptic input, which also result in larger inward current. The firing rate increased (cf. broken lines, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) and the distribution became negatively skewed (cf. \u22120.2 and \u22121.5) as expected in the mean\u2013driven regime (bottom). To quantify the increase in time spent in the mean\u2013driven regime, we performed an analysis similar to the analysis in the above section (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The cumulative time spent below threshold was larger in the control condition (78%) compared with the unbalanced case (56%, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These observations are largely consistent with the consensus view that irregular fluctuation\u2013driven spiking is due to a balance between excitation and inhibition (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Nevertheless, a noisy threshold can only explain a small part (if any) of the spiking irregularity. First of all, if the irregularity, that we observed in spike times, was due to a noisy threshold mechanism, we should see the same irregularity regardless of the depolarization, i.e. regardless of whether the neuron was in the sub\u2013threshold or supra\u2013threshold domain. Yet, the spiking irregularity was strongly dependent on depolarization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>). There was an adaptation in threshold (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This was not random, but rather due to a gradual inactivation of Na <math id=\"inf181\"><msup><mi></mi><mo>+</mo></msup></math>\u2013channels throughout the burst (<a href=\"#bib39\">Henze and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2001</a>). The threshold of a given spike strongly depended on the threshold of the previous spike (panel F) as well as the mean firing rate (panel G). The same mechanism is behind spike\u2013frequency adaptation, which is a well\u2013described phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib32\">Grigonis et al., 2016</a>). The adaptation in threshold is likely to make the IO-function more sublinear in the mean\u2013driven regime, which will generally curb network activity."

The variance of the first\u2013spike threshold (<math id=\"inf182\"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>51</mn></mrow></math>) in a sample neuron was <math id=\"inf183\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>0.8</mn></mrow></math> mV<sup>2</sup> whereas the variance in synaptic potentials was more than 17\u2013fold higher (<math id=\"inf184\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>14.0</mn></mrow></math> mV<sup>2</sup>). Therefore a randomness in the threshold had little of no effect on the irregularity of spiking compared with the randomness in synaptic input. In some recordings the threshold may appear as uncorrelated with the membrane potential prior to the spike onset. However, rather than a noisy threshold this is likely attributed to cellular morphology. If the cell is not electrically compact, the axon initial segment, where the spike is initiated, will have a different potential than what is recorded with the electrode. If this was the case, these observations would still be compatible with the two\u2013regime hypothesis, since spikes would still be driven either by fluctuations or a large mean current, despite the disguise of a long electrotonic distance to the recording site."

To address this issue we analyzed the population spiking for multiple motor behaviors. The induction of a distinct scratch behavior is location\u2013specific (<a href=\"#bib97\">Stein, 2005</a>). Multiple behaviors can be evoked depending on exact location and which side of the body is touched. This allowed us to induce two distinct behaviors: ipsi\u2013 and contralateral hindlimb scratching, while recording from the same neuronal ensemble (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). These behaviors were reproducible over multiple trials (<math id=\"inf186\"><mo>&gt;</mo></math>9 trials). Both behaviors had similar phase relationships between the muscle synergists, although ipsilateral scratching had stronger activity (cf. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u00a0and\u00a0B</a>). The firing rate distribution was positively skewed in both behaviors with the similar qualitative shape (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013F</a>). This skewness was also found across animals (green bars, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>, n=5) and close to zero on log\u2013scale, i.e. lognormal (black lower bars). To further quantify the uneven neuronal participation we used Lorenz statistics and the Gini-coefficient (<a href=\"#bib68\">O\u2019Connor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ikegaya et al., 2013</a>). The Lorenz curve characterizes the share of cumulative participation of individual neurons of the population (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a>). The diagonal corresponds to the case where all neurons have the same firing rate. The deviation from equality is quantified by the Gini\u2013coefficient, which is the fraction of area <math id=\"inf187\"><mi>a</mi></math> to the total area <math id=\"inf188\"><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a>). The higher the coefficient, the more unequal the participation across neurons is. Both scratch behaviors had a Gini\u2013coefficient of <math id=\"inf189\"><mo>\u223c</mo></math>0.5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>). Although the mean firing rate could change between behaviors and between animals (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9J</a>), the skewness was qualitatively similar (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K</a>). This suggests that the skewed lognormal\u2013like firing rate distribution, and hence a presence of the fluctuation\u2013driven regime, was preserved across behaviors and animals."

Individual neurons can move back and forth between regimes depending on the synaptic current they receive. Neurons that spike predominantly in the mean\u2013regime will have their mean firing rates closer together and more normally distributed compared with those spiking in the fluctuation\u2013regime. Hence, we expected the skewness of the distribution of mean firing rates across the population to become more negative (on log\u2013scale) as the general network activity increases. To address this, we analyzed the spiking across neurons in parallel. First, we estimated the time\u2013dependent firing rate of each neuron in the population using optimal Gaussian kernel (<a href=\"#bib90\">Shimazaki and Shinomoto, 2010</a>) and measured skewness of the population distribution. The time\u2013dependent population distribution was achieved by binning the rates in 10 ms windows (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). The mean population rate and its SD are indicated as black <math id=\"inf190\"> <mo>\u00b1 </mo></math> gray lines (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). As the mean firing rate increased, the skewness of the distribution (log\u2013scale) became negative, which is a sign of more neurons were occupying the mean\u2013driven regime (cf. inset histograms, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). This was further confirmed by a negative correlation between the mean firing rate (black line in A) and the log\u2013skewness for all time points (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Hence, as the general activity increased, the population distribution became less lognormal and more Gaussian, which suggests more neurons occupied the mean\u2013driven regime during a higher general activity."

A similar value was previously chosen to distinguish between regular vs. irregular \u2018choppers\u2019 in the cochlear nucleus (<a href=\"#bib111\">Young et al., 1988</a>). Thus, the population of spinal neurons had a large diversity in time spent in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime. Some neurons spent as little as 20% in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime while other spent as much as 80%. To get a quantitative handle on the occupation of neurons in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime across the population, we considered the distribution of time spent with <math id=\"inf215\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mtext>\u00a0</mtext><mo>&gt;</mo><mtext>\u00a0</mtext><msub><mi>i</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>. This was formally quantified using the reverse cumulative distribution of neurons that spend a given fraction of time in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). The reverse cumulative distribution is plotted for 3 values of <math id=\"inf216\"><msub><mi>i</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></math> (0.4, 0.5 and 0.6) to indicate the sensitivity to parameter choice. Obviously, choosing a lower <math id=\"inf217\"><msub><mi>i</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></math> results in a larger fraction of\u00a0time in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime, i.e. the curve is shifted to the right.

This inverted <math id=\"inf219\"><mi>S</mi></math>\u2013shaped curve gives the fraction of neurons (y\u2013axis), which spend at least a given time in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime normalized to 100% (x\u2013axis). Hence, half of the population spent at least 58% of time in the fluctuation regime during ipsilateral scratching (intercept of curve with the broken line, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). We refer to this metric as the time in the fluctuation\u2013regime for half the neurons (<math id=\"inf220\"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>50</mn></msub></mrow></math>).

In addition to measuring the time in regimes, we measured how many spikes were in one regime vs. the other. Hence, we calculated the reverse cumulative distribution of neurons that had a given fraction of spikes in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Nevertheless, there is a spatial division subtypes of spinal neurons, which we could take advantage of. During development, a distinct laminar organization of different cellular subtypes is formed in the dorsoventral axis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arber, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jessell, 2000</a>). In particular, motoneurons are primarily found in the most ventral part of the horn whereas interneurons are found in more medial to dorsal territory. Since this is the same axis that our electrode arrays were located along, it was possible to infer a likelihood of cellular identity based on location. The electrode shanks have multiple distributed electrodes (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>), which made it possible to approximate the soma location using <i>trilateration</i>. Trilateration is the geometrical process of determining the location of a source in space using multiple recording sites combined with the fact that signals decay in the extracellular space (<a href=\"#bib58\">Manolakis, 1996</a>). Thus, the node locations were approximated based on the amplitude of spike waveforms, which clearly decayed with distance (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). Node locations were combined for all shanks, probes and animals to form a scatter (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). Combining these locations with depth of individual shanks with respect to the surface of the spinal cord, we were able to investigate the spike patterns with respect to the absolute neuronal location. The irregularity in spiking was quantified (mean <math id=\"inf229\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>) with respect to dorsoventral depth (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>). The distributions of mean firing rates (not shown) and the mean <math id=\"inf230\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>) had no obvious dependence on depth. In particular, the spread in means was much smaller than the SD of the distributions themselves. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that the fluctuation\u2013driven spiking regime was both present and equally prominent in all the neurons, regardless of whether the cell body was in the ventral horn or in the medial horn, i.e. equally present in motoneurons and interneurons."

In this report we present evidence for the existence of both regimes during motor pattern generation in the spinal cord. We consistently found normally distributed synaptic input combined with the supralinear shape of the IO\u2013function in the subthreshold region, and suggest this as a compelling mechanism behind the lognormal population firing rate distribution (<a href=\"#bib83\">Roxin et al., 2011</a>). Using spiking irregularity across the neuronal population as a hallmark of the fluctuation regime, we found that half of the neurons spent at least 50% of the time in this regime. Thus, the fluctuation\u2013regime was not a rarity, but rather had a prominent presence both across behaviors and across animals (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>).

A fundamental challenge for neuronal networks is to perform functions while keeping the population activity from falling into either of the two extreme states: (1) the quiescent state where the neuronal spiking activity cannot remain self\u2013sustained and (2) the unstable state of run\u2013away recurrent spiking activity (<a href=\"#bib107\">Vogels et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>). It is well known that recurrent inhibition is important for maintaining stability, but other mechanisms may participate as well, e.g. synaptic depression or active adjustment of the shape of the neuronal response function by adaptation of spiking threshold. A nonlinear response function, as we observed in the fluctuation\u2013regime (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), will amplify input via supralinear summation (<a href=\"#bib84\">Rubin et al., 2015</a>). The upward curvature will enhance synaptic fluctuations, which then accelerates the recurrent excitatory activity causing a potentially unstable state. In contrast, the response function in the mean\u2013driven regime, is linear or even sublinear, which is likely to curb strong input. We therefore propose that the close proximity of the <math id=\"inf234\"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>50</mn></msub></mrow></math>\u2013value to 50% is an indication of a self\u2013organizing trade\u2013off between sensitivity and stability in order to preserve at once both network homeostasis and dynamical functionality. This conjecture remains to be further substantiated in future studies.

The fluctuation\u2013driven spiking is believed to be caused by concurrent and random arrival of excitatory and inhibitory potentials resulting in a fluctuating subthreshold <math id=\"inf237\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In the mean\u2013driven regime, on the other hand, the net membrane current is so large that the mean <math id=\"inf238\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math><math id=\"inf239\"> <mo>\u00b1 </mo></math><math id=\"inf240\"><mi>\u03c3</mi></math> is above threshold, and the ISIs are therefore determined by the recharging of the membrane capacitance following the refractory period of the previous spike (<a href=\"#bib74\">Powers and Binder, 2000</a>). This results in a deterministic trajectory of <math id=\"inf241\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> and regular ISIs. More importantly, for the mean\u2013driven spiking the membrane current can be caused by intrinsically electrical properties as well as synaptic input, whereas the fluctuation\u2013driven spiking is exclusively caused by synaptic input. An intrinsic property, which is commonly believed to be involved in rhythm\u2013generation, is the pacemaker property that can autonomously generate neuronal bursting in the absence of synaptic input (<a href=\"#bib16\">Brocard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Ramirez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">2011</a>). The prominent presence of the fluctuation\u2013regime therefore implies that the majority of neuronal spikes were not driven primarily by intrinsic properties such as pacemaker potentials, but rather by synaptic communication. This can be interpreted in two ways: (1) if there is a pacemaker\u2013driven rhythmogenic core of oscillatory neurons responsible for the motor activity (<a href=\"#bib43\">Huckstepp et al., 2016</a>), the core only represents a small fraction of the network, or (2) since the fluctuation\u2013regime is prominent and pacemaker neurons are difficult to find, the motor\u2013rhythm may be generated by other means such as emergent collective processes in the network (<a href=\"#bib112\">Yuste, 2015</a>). Generation of movements without the need of pacemaker neurons have been predicted theoretically in central pattern generators (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kleinfeld and Sompolinsky, 1988</a>) as well as more complex sequence generation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hennequin et al., 2014</a>). Even in the respiratory system, which has the most stereotypic motor rhythm, pacemaker cells appear not to be essential for generation of the rhythmic breathing, although this topic is still debated (<a href=\"#bib25\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Ramirez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Carroll and Ramirez, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Chevalier et al., 2016</a>). It remains to be understood how a distributed emergent processes can generate motor rhythms on a network level if, in fact, the pacemaker bursting is not an essential component."

Pinning down cellular identity improves the search for a potential specialization in the circuit. However, the sole focus on cellular identity to address questions in spinal research carries a weakness as well as a strength. It contains the risk of missing the collective dynamics and the delicate interaction among neuronal cell types. Neural circuits operate to perform functions by collective interaction between all neurons, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to link a particular function to the individual neuron. Functional activity may very well arise on circuit level as opposed to cellular level. This caveat is known as the neuron doctrine versus emergent network phenomena (<a href=\"#bib112\">Yuste, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Grillner, 2006</a>), and the neuron doctrine has almost exclusively been adopted in previous investigations of spinal motor circuits.

The fraction of motoneurons to interneurons is 1:8 (<a href=\"#bib108\">Walloe et al., 2011</a>), but we were also likely to sample motorneurons, since they have large somata. To explore this further, we investigated the population activity and its relation to cellular identity by taking advantage of their spatial segregation in the dorsoventral axis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arber, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jessell, 2000</a>). We were able to associate an absolute location of the cellular somata (using trilateration), and thus test for differences in spiking activity (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>).

This suggests that the fluctuation\u2013driven spiking regime was both present and equally prominent in all the neurons, regardless of whether the cell bodies were in the ventral or medial horn, i.e. regardless of whether they were motoneurons or premotor interneurons."

Roxin et al proposed the mechanism where the skewness arises from a nonlinear transformation of Gaussian input (<a href=\"#bib83\">Roxin et al., 2011</a>). Our data supports this hypothesis. First, we observed a normally distributed <math id=\"inf247\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> for individual cells, which is a proxy for the requirement of normally distributed input currents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Second, a supralinear IO\u2013function covering most of this input (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Third, a firing rate distribution of individual cells which was typically highly skewed and lognormal\u2013like although some did not have lognormal firing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Nevertheless, there is a distinction between the lognormal firing of individual neurons and the lognormal distribution of mean rates across the population. Whereas the lognormal population firing rate remains to be fully understood, the skewed firing rate distribution of individual neurons is fairly well understood. Here, the skewness is due to the fluctuating input and irregularity of spiking (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ostojic, 2011</a>). Nevertheless, we argue the mechanism for the lognormal population firing is the same as that for the individual neuron. If the subthreshold IO-function is approximately similar across the population, which our data implies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we can explain the lognormal population firing by a supralinear transformation, if the mean <math id=\"inf248\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> across the population is also Gaussian.

This characterization was associated with the intrinsic properties without synaptic input being present. Nevertheless, a different type of fluctuation\u2013driven spiking was discovered in experiments where synaptic input were present, in what was referred to the subprimary range in mice (<a href=\"#bib59\">Manuel and Heckman, 2011</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib55\">Kudina, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Matthews, 1996</a>). This subprimary range conforms to the fluctuation\u2013regime though under a different terminology. As the name indicates, the primary range has been considered to represent the dominant mode of spiking whereas the subprimary range is a peculiarity. Nevertheless, a recent study recorded for the first time the motoneuron discharge and muscle force and found that the subprimary range accounts for 90% of the contraction force (<a href=\"#bib59\">Manuel and Heckman, 2011</a>). This indicates that the fluctuation\u2013regime may have a more noteworthy role in covering the dynamical range in motor control than previously assumed, which is in agreement with the observations of the present study."

These sample sizes where assumed to be large enough in the experimental design and because of a consistency in results, although a specific power analysis was not conducted. To avoid the confounding factors of supraspinal input, we spinalized the turtle. The transection was performed at the spinal cord at segments (D3-4) caudal to the cervical segments, where the local circuitry has only little or no involvement in generation of motor patterns (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mortin and Stein, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hao et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Mui et al., 2012</a>). The adult turtle preparation is capable of producing elaborate motor patterns such as scratching. We used the semi-intact spinal cord of adult turtles (<a href=\"#bib48\">Keifer and Stein, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Petersen et al., 2014</a>) and recorded from the segments D8-D10. These segments contain the essential CPG circuits (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mortin and Stein, 1989</a>). Most of the spinal cord including the sensory periphery is left intact. The blood is replaced and the spinal column is provided with oxygenated Ringer's solution so that the neurons and the network have optimal conditions. In this experimental situation the motor behavior is as close to in vivo situation as possible, and is indistinguishable from the intact condition (<a href=\"#bib48\">Keifer and Stein, 1983</a>). The turtle preparation allow for mechanical stability and the turtle\u2019s resistance to anoxia allow for remarkable durability of both the recording conditions and the motor pattern reproducibility (<a href=\"#bib106\">Vestergaard and Berg, 2015</a>)."

This may be caused by a systematic bias in the way the intracellularly recorded neurons were collected, as there is an experimental bias towards high firing rates. Spike sorting processing of the extracellular recordings, on the other hand, is likely to both miss spikes and contain false positives, which will cause overestimation of spiking irregularity."

Regarding excluding spikes from the analysis in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>: For the temporal distribution (panel C), only ISIs &gt;\u00a06\u00a0ms was included and for the spike triggered <math id=\"inf361\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>-distribution only ISIs &gt;\u00a020\u00a0ms was included, all having ISIs &lt;\u00a0300\u00a0ms. Estimating the FV-curve (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) all spikes having ISIs &gt;\u00a01.7\u00a0ms was included."

                                "text": "Neuronal spiking has traditionally been considered to occur when the mean inward current of the cellular membrane is large enough to cross the rheobase such that the mean membrane potential (<math id=\"inf362\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>) is above threshold (<math id=\"inf363\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></math>). In practice, the mean <math id=\"inf364\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> will not exceed <math id=\"inf365\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></math> by very much due to the active spiking and after\u2013hyperpolarization, but if this mechanism was turned off the mean membrane current (<math id=\"inf366\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math>) would drive <math id=\"inf367\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> across threshold, formally written as <math id=\"inf368\"><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></math> where <math id=\"inf369\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> is the membrane resistance. Spikes elicited in this manner are in the mean\u2013driven regime (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gerstner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Renart et al., 2007</a>). They have shorter inter\u2013spike intervals (ISIs) because of the large <math id=\"inf370\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> and regular spiking due to the after\u2013hyperpolarization. In contrast, when the mean <math id=\"inf371\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> is below threshold, i.e. <math id=\"inf372\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mtext>\u00a0</mtext><mo>&lt;</mo><mtext>\u00a0</mtext><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo>/</mo></mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, spikes are elicited by temporary fluctuations in <math id=\"inf373\"><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></math> due to synaptic bombardment. Such spiking is in the fluctuation\u2013driven regime (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kuhn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Tiesinga et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gerstner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Roxin et al., 2011</a>). The random synaptic fluctuations cause the spiking to be more irregular, which results in a higher coefficient of variation (CV, defined as the standard deviation (<math id=\"inf374\"><mi>\u03c3</mi></math>) divided by the mean of ISIs), than for the mean\u2013driven regime (cf. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>). Therefore irregularity is an indicator of the spiking regime. Another indicator of the fluctuation\u2013driven regime is positive skewness of the firing rate distribution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). These indicators are used to quantify the fraction of the population that is in one versus the other regime."

The authors have beautifully combined intracellular and large-scale extracellular recordings to reveal the wide-spread existence of \"fluctuation-driven\" activity in spinal motor networks. These neurons (50% or more) discharge in a \"subthreshold\" manner. The authors suggest that the existence of these neurons is a strategy to increase stability and sensitivity in the locomotor network. The return map ratio as used here is a metric that has the potential for wide application in a variety of networks. Indeed, the authors nicely discuss their work in the context of a variety of networks. The study elegantly links spiking dynamics to subthreshold activity and therefore shows that the fluctuation-driven versus mean-driven regimes as described in theoretical work appears to be consistent with real networks. The strength of the study is the use of electrophysiology to test a theoretical framework on neuronal dynamics. There are not many studies, specially in spinal circuits that explore this in great detail. Another strength is the use of the turtle model, which allows the characterization of neuronal discharge in a relatively intact animal."

It is not clear what the authors mean e.g. with networks being in unresponsive quiescence and saturation. A thorough revision of the Introduction is critical. There is a body of literature on \"fluctuation-driven regimes in which excitatory and inhibitory inputs are balanced (e.g. van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, Science 1996), and recent in-vivo electrophysiology in cortical circuits supports this idea, e.g. Renart et al.

This means that measures of the spiking activity such as firing rate distributions and CVs of inter-spike-intervals represent very long-time averages and, in fact, in a simulation will converge to the theoretical predictions if ever-longer time intervals are used to evaluate them. In short, there is a proper self-consistent network state for which such statistical measures can be estimated. In the case of the present work the activity is highly non-stationary. It seems the authors take advantage of a sort of separation of time scales in that the bursts, which drive the scratching behavior, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a> for example, are long compared to the inter-spike interval within the burst. However, it seems this non-stationarity should introduce additional variability to any measures of spiking or subthreshold activity beyond the effects of a pure \u2018fluctuation-driven' or \u2018mean-driven' regime. The authors should find a way to better characterize (quantify) this, since it is one of the important messages of the paper."

Specifically, a strongly variable threshold would create the appearance of a fluctuation-driven regime, even given approximately constant input (because the timing of ISIs then depends on the noise in the threshold, not the noise in the input). To solve this, the authors could perhaps estimate the degree of non-stationarity by estimating the local variance in the threshold within the burst e.g. computing Var(threshold) in overlapping windows of 10 ISIs. In that way, they could determine if there is only strong variation at the start and end of the bursts (as suggested in some of the example figures), and so would little affect their conclusions."

In that figure, correlating LTBT versus RMR, a linear correlation is poor because most of the data-points are clustered close to LTBT=1, and so points inside that cluster dominate the correlation, obscuring any relationship over the whole range of LTBT. So presumably LTBT vs CV2 has the same issue. Perhaps try estimating the distribution of RMR (or CV2) values per LTBT bin e.g. for the bin of, say, LTBT in [0.8 0.9], take the median RMR (or CV2) value. That way, you can correlate (or regress) the medians of the distribution per bin, estimating the relationship between the LTBT and the centre of mass of the values of RMR and CV2."

In short, there is a proper self-consistent network state for which such statistical measures can be estimated. In the case of the present work the activity is highly non-stationary. It seems the authors take advantage of a sort of separation of time scales in that the bursts, which drive the scratching behavior, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a> for example, are long compared to the inter-spike interval within the burst. However, it seems this non-stationarity should introduce additional variability to any measures of spiking or subthreshold activity beyond the effects of a pure \u2018fluctuation-driven\u2019 or \u2018mean-driven\u2019 regime.

So presumably LTBT vs CV2 has the same issue. Perhaps try estimating the distribution of RMR (or CV2) values per LTBT bin e.g. for the bin of, say, LTBT in [0.8 0.9], take the median RMR (or CV2) value.

Since the authors also discuss their paper in the context of breathing it would be appropriate to also cite: Ramirez et al. 2011, PMID: 22654176 and Ramirez et al. 2004: Pacemaker neurons and neuronal networks: an integrative view (Curr Opin Neurobiol). The authors may also want to discuss Carroll and Ramirez 2013, a paper which discusses the role of pacemaker neurons, and discharge pattern in respiratory rhythm generation using a population approach as similarly applied here for the locomotor network.</i>"
