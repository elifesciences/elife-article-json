In this study, we show that the mating circuits\u2019 functional durability depends on the metabolic regulator SIR-2.1, a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase. Aging <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males display accelerated mating behavior decline due to premature hyperexcitability of cholinergic circuits used for intromission and ejaculation. In <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males, the hypercontraction of the spicule-associated muscles pinch the vas deferens opening, thus blocking sperm release. The hyperexcitability is aggravated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral analyses suggest that in <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> and older wild-type males, enhanced catabolic enzymes expression, coupled with the reduced expression of ROS-scavengers contribute to the behavioral decline. However, as a compensatory response to reduce altered catabolism/ROS production, anabolic enzymes expression levels are also increased, resulting in higher gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis."

For example, behavioral and/or mental ability starts to decline during early aging, prior to any dramatic structural or morphological dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib56\">Salthouse, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). The decline could be due to physiological alterations toward a non-optimal state, which leads to the failure of proper behavioral execution.

Through pharmacological, optogenetics, and genetic analyses, we found a correlation between the increased excitability of the spicule intromission circuit and the decline of mating at early adulthood (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>).

In <i>C. elegans</i>, caloric deprivation such as transient starvation for 3 to 18 hr during early adulthood can reduce excitability in the spicule intromission circuitry and prolong the mating potency of wild type (<a href=\"#bib41\">LeBoeuf et al., 2011</a>). We showed that the effect of transient starvation is partially mediated by UNC-43/CaMKII and up-regulation of the <i>unc-103</i> and <i>egl-2</i>-encoded ERG-like K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib41\">LeBoeuf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). Although males with mutations in both K<sup>+</sup> channels abrogate most of the beneficial effects of transient starvation, we still observed a small increase in the mating ability of aged double-mutant males, suggesting that other mechanisms are applied by transient starvation to improve mating (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). One possibility is that metabolic alteration, induced by transient starvation, compensates for the physiological changes that occur during aging. The connection between metabolic change and physiological status might be the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). First, metabolic status determines the oxidative stress burden: ROS is the byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Murphy, 2009</a>). Second, emerging evidence shows that ROS modulates the excitability of neuromuscular system through modification of ion channels (<a href=\"#bib62\">Taglialatela et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cai and Sesti, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aggarwal and Makielski, 2013</a>).

SIR-2.1 is an ortholog of yeast SIR2 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001</a>). Yeast SIR2, a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase, with a role in chromatin regulation, can silence ribosome DNA expression and recombination (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gottlieb and Esposito, 1989</a>). When overexpressed, <i>sir2</i> extends yeast lifespan, whereas deletion of the gene shortens the lifespan by 50% (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</a>). Although there is controversy on whether overexpression of invertebrate <i>sir2</i> ortholog extends lifespan (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burnett et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Viswanathan and Guarente, 2011</a>), sirtuin family proteins have been shown to regulate glucose and fat metabolism (<a href=\"#bib33\">Houtkooper et al., 2012</a>). For example, the <i>C. elegans</i> SIR-2.1 inhibits lipid synthesis during fasting (<a href=\"#bib69\">Walker et al., 2010</a>). In addition, sirtuin proteins mediate an oxidative stress response by regulating antioxidant gene expression through transcriptional factors such as FOXO in a 14-3-3-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berdichevsky et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Webster et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Merksamer et al., 2013</a>). Overall, sirtuin proteins could be involved in age-related diseases, such as type II diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib57\">Satoh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Houtkooper et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, it is possible that sirtuin proteins regulate the cell\u2019s metabolic status and physiology, which further alters the coordination of specific behaviors."

We found that wild-type males require SIR-2.1 to maintain mating potency, and <i>sir-2.1</i> mutant males show a premature decline in copulation behavior, consistent with oxidative stress-induced hyperexcitability of their mating circuit. We propose that in <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males, enhanced glycolysis/fatty acid oxidation, coupled with a compromised anti-stress system, contribute to premature mating decline. However, in mutant and aged wild-type males, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase are up-regulated, likely as a compensatory mechanism to shunt excess pyruvate from glycolysis and the TCA cycle to lipid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and glyceroneogenesis."

We demonstrated that transient starvation of young males can extend their mating span, partially through up-regulation of <i>ether-a-go-go</i> K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib41\">LeBoeuf et al., 2011</a>); however, our data also suggested that transient starvation can improve mating through additional mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>).

Regulated by proteases, individual sperm goes through a morphological change to form a pseudopod. This pseudopod provides mobility for the sperm to fertilize the hermaphrodite oocyte (<a href=\"#bib61\">Smith and Stanfield, 2011</a>). To test whether the low mating potency of 2-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males is due to failure in sperm activation, we did an in vitro sperm activation assay and found that similar to wild type, 92.0 \u00b1 4.3% of sperms from 2-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> can be artificially activated by pronase (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).Taken together, we speculate that the premature mating decline in <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> is due to physiological changes, rather than the structural degeneration of either neuromuscular circuits or sperm."

Hence, we hypothesized that <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> mating decline might also be due to a premature increase in the cellular excitability. To test this, we used two acetylcholine (ACh) agonists, levemisole (LEV) and arecoline (ARE) to determine the responses of wild-type and <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males at multiple ages. In the male spicule intromission circuit, LEV binds to ionotropic ACh receptors, whereas ARE is a nonselective ACh agonist (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Correa et al., 2012</a>). Activation of ACh receptors depolarizes the male\u2019s neurons and muscles, and ultimately causes sex muscle contractions; as a result, males protrude their copulatory spicules. We found that at day 1, <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> and wild-type males had similar response to a sub-threshold effective concentration of ARE (50 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> (i)). However, 2-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males were more sensitive to agonist stimulation and required significantly less time to respond (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> (ii)). Additionally, 2-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males were more sensitive to sub-threshold LEV stimulation. 58% <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> compared to 35% of wild type protracted their spicules in 500 nM LEV (p&lt;0.05, n &gt; 30) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> (ii)). These results indicate that the loss of <i>sir-2.1</i> in males alters the spicule intromission circuit\u2019s excitability during early aging."

Contraction of the protractor muscles leads to spicules insertion into the vulva (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garcia et al., 2001</a>). During the normal ejaculation step of mating behavior, after spicule penetration, the posterior gubernaculum erector and retractor muscles contract, presumably to pull the proctodeum posteriorly, so that sperm can drain from the vas deferens (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2007</a>). In <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males, we speculated that after spicule insertion, the abnormal increased cell excitability causes the spicule protractor and anal depressor muscles to hypercontract, which during sperm transfer, would pinch close the vas deferens opening. To test this, we imaged the Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the spicule-associated dorsal protractor and anal depressor muscles (region-of-interest, ROI, indicated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), by expressing G-CaMP3 in these sex muscles of both <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> and wild-type males (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tian et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). During the mating behavior of 2-day-old wild-type males, the G-CaMP3 \u0394F/F0 increased to 129.0 \u00b1 32.5% (n = 5) at the time of spicule insertion, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal started to decline to 86.7 \u00b1 30.8% during the 10-s period after spicule insertion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). This indicates that the spicule protractor muscles partially relax after spicule insertion. However, in 2-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males, \u0394F/F0 increased up to 204.3 \u00b1 97.5% (n = 5) upon spicule insertion. Unlike wild type, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients did not decrease as much, and the \u0394F/F0 fluctuated at about 129.8 \u00b1 33.0% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). The sustained higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in 2-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males suggest that spicule protractor and anal depressor muscles are hypercontracted and pinch the vas deferens opening, thus blocking sperm release."

This is consistent with the published observation that hexokinase is also up-regulated in the whole body of conditional <i>sirt1</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gomes et al., 2013</a>). Most enzymes involved in the TCA cycle did not change in their levels (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In contrast, expression of ETC/OXPHOS components (<i>cco-1</i>, W09C5.8) was reduced in <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Other genes that were significantly up-regulated include key anabolic enzymes like fatty acid desaturase (<i>fat-5,6,7</i>), pyruvate carboxylase (PC) (<i>pyc-1</i>) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (<i>pck-1</i> and <i>pck-2</i>), isocytrate lysase (<i>icl-1</i>) and aconitase-cytosol (<i>aco-1</i>), which are important for fatty acid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, glyceroneogensis, and glyoxylate cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yang et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with this, hepatic cells without <i>sirt1</i> also have an up-regualtion of PEPCK gene expression (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Fatty acid desaturase plays a critical role in lipid/triglyceride biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib67\">Van Gilst et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Flowers and Ntambi, 2008</a>). PC catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate (OAA), the first step that shunts pyruvate from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis/glyceroneogenesis. Alternatively, OAA, an intermediate of TCA, can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEPCK directly inside the mitochondrion or transported and converted to PEP by PEPCK in cytosol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The up-regulation of fatty acid desaturase is consistent with the increased lipid staining in <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

However, we found that transgenic overexpression of <i>sir-2.1</i> does not improve the mating potency of 3-day-old wild type (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). It is unlikely that the fusion with YFP disrupts SIR-2.1 function, because the same transgene can rescue the <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> phenotype. Thus, we speculate that up to a point, the expression level of <i>sir-2.1</i> is not rate limiting for SIR-2.1 activity during early aging. However, one could also speculate that the normal endogenous levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> limit the function of SIR-2.1. To test this, we grew males in the presence of the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor nicotinamide (NAM) at 200 \u03bcM concentration (<a href=\"#bib32\">Houtkooper et al., 2010</a>), and then conducted the mating potency. Indeed, NAM exposure significantly improves 3-day-old wild-type mating potency, but not 2-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). This result is consistent with the idea that excess NAD<sup>+</sup> might stimulate SIR-2.1 activity. But additionally, excess NAD<sup>+</sup> might also reduce ROS production by relaxing the demand of oxidizing NADH back to NAD<sup>+</sup>; as a corollary to this possibility, the lack of excess NAM to positively affect the <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> male\u2019s behavior might be aggravated by the abnormally high expression of catabolic enzymes in the mutant males. To further test if overexpressing SIR-2.1 activity can promote mating behavior in older males, we exposed 3-day-old transgenic SIR-2.1 over-expressed males with exogenous NAM, but found that excess SIR-2.1 does not amplify the positive effect of NAM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that NAM or possibly NAD<sup>+</sup> additionally promotes behavioral extension through mechanisms parallel to SIR-2.1 activity."

However, during early aging, prior to any significant cellular decay, physiological changes that affect neuronal and muscular functionality can contribute to the reduction of behavioral coordination (<a href=\"#bib56\">Salthouse, 2004</a>). Male mating in <i>C. elegans</i> is a complex behavior that requires coordination of multiple motor systems to impregnate the hermaphrodite (<a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Correa et al., 2012</a>). Previously, we showed that male mating behavior declines significantly during early aging. Wild type cannot mate well at adulthood day 3, and this decline is correlated with an increased excitability in the sex circuitry (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). Similar to aging males, a recent study using hermaphrodites showed that synaptic transmission in the locomotion circuit is enhanced after 5 days of adulthood (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mulcahy et al., 2013</a>). Thus, it is possible that during early aging, the neuromuscular systems of both sexes become hyperexcitable. However, the faster decline in mating suggests that the male reproductive circuitry is more sensitive to age-related physiological changes."

However, unlike wild-type males, the mating ability of <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> prematurely drops at day 2. This is due to hyperexcitability of the reproductive circuitry that coordinates spicule intromission and ejaculation. The hyperexcitability of the spicule muscles causes the male proctodeum to block the connection between the vas deferens and the cloacal opening, which indirectly obstructs the transfer of sperm. The mutant phenotype resembles the behavioral, physiological, and pharmacological changes that occur in older wild-type males. This indicates that in wild type, SIR-2.1 maintains the functional excitability of the intromission and ejaculation circuit, possibly by slowing down the deteriorative events that accumulate during aging. We suggest that as the male ages, SIR-2.1 regulates the amounts of catabolic, anabolic, and free radical scavenging enzymes to balance the energy demands needed for rapid reproductive motor responses, with the generation of damaging metabolic by-products, such as ROS."

We showed previously and in this study that perturbation of the male\u2019s physiology through genetic mutation or through dietary alterations during early adulthood will affect his ability to mate later in life. The physiology of wild-type males is likely changing from day 1 to day 2, as determined by the level of mRNAs encoding metabolic enzymes and the amount of terminal metabolic products. These physiological changes can ultimately lead to excessive carbon flow into the TCA cycle, and consequently, more NADH to be oxidized by ETC complexes (<a href=\"#fig6 fig9\">Figures 6A and 9</a>). This promotes ROS generation via electron leak (<a href=\"#bib16\">Federico et al., 2012</a>), which can be reflected by behavioral decay at day 3. Analysis of <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males allowed us to extrapolate how this protein deacetylase regulates male physiology. Lack of SIR-2.1 will induce these deleterious changes to occur sooner, and degenerative behavioral responses in the mutant males are measured at day 2. Under standard laboratory conditions, wild-type males are raised constitutively on abundant <i>E. coli</i> until senescence. We speculate that since SIR-2.1 uses NAD<sup>+</sup> as a cofactor to deacetylate proteins, the physiological changes that occur after 2 days of constitutive feeding in wild type adults might be due to reduction in SIR-2.1 function, via the lower ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH in wild type. The phenomenon of altering NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH levels in vertebrate cells is shown to reduce the activity of SIRT1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braidy et al., 2011</a>). Decreased activity of SIR-2.1 will not only aggravate a bias towards catabolism, but will also decrease the levels of ROS scavengers. This is consistent with a hermaphrodite study, which showed that <i>sir-2.1</i> overexpression can protect the organism from ROS, possibly via HCF-1 and FOXO/DAF-16, to regulate the expression of stress response genes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rizki et al., 2011</a>)."

Without SIR-2.1, ROS accumulation by day 2 of adulthood can lead to hyperexcitability of the male\u2019s genital neuromuscular circuitry. This results in blocked ejaculation and impotency. It is possible that in 2- to 3-day-old wild-type males, the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent SIR-2.1 activity declines due to a lower ratio of NAD to NADH; thus older wild-type males might have a similar physiology as 1-day-old <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males."

In addition to enhanced expression of catabolic genes, mRNAs encoding enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) appeared to be also up-regulated. This could be a likely reason for why the males contain more measurable lipids and glycogen. We propose that the up-regulation of anabolic process is a self-compensatory mechanism to divert carbon from the TCA cycle (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). <i>sir-2.1(0)</i> males that are mutant for PEPCK genes, lose their ability to generate fat and fail to mate efficiently on day 1. Likewise <i>sir-2.1 (+)</i> males with a mutation in PEPCK genes also display premature mating decline. We hypothesize that anabolic pathways could act as a homeostatic mechanism to reduce ROS production. This idea raises the possibility that obesity as a phenotype might be a compensatory mechanism to alleviate the effects of other underlying metabolic dysfunctions. Indeed, by switching of glycolysis to gluconeogenesis has been shown to be a potential strategy to cure hepatocarcinoma (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ma et al., 2013</a>).

Oxidation of different types of ion channels changes their conductance and alters the cell\u2019s excitability (<a href=\"#bib3\">Annunziato et al., 2002</a>). One <i>C. elegans</i> study indicates that oxidative stress reduces cell excitability by increasing the conductance of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sesti et al., 2010</a>). Another mammalian study showed that oxidative stress hyperpolarizes the resting potential, but extends the duration of the action potential in cardiac ganglion (<a href=\"#bib74\">Whyte et al., 2009</a>). Mitochondria ROS has been shown to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in the pulmonary arterial myocytes (<a href=\"#bib72\">Waypa et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">2006</a>). In a study using glia, L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (L-VGCC) were found to be a target of ROS. After modification by ROS, their conductance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was increased (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bond and Greenfield, 2007</a>). Different from vertebrate skeletal muscles, L-VGCC in <i>C. elegans</i> propagates action potentials, and the entry of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly promotes excitation\u2013contraction coupling (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Maryon et al., 1998</a>). Previous work showed that L-VGCC EGL-19 in <i>C. elegans</i> is required for sustained tonic contraction of the copulatory spicule muscles (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garcia et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, oxidation of L-VGCC in <i>C. elegans</i> might contribute to the increased excitability of mating circuits. Other major targets of ROS are voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels. In <i>C. elegans</i>, oxidation of KVS-1 slows down its inactivation, leading to hyperpolarization and sensory function loss (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cai and Sesti, 2009</a>). The ERG-like K<sup>+</sup> channel UNC-103 is a major excitability regulator of the sex circuit (<a href=\"#bib54\">Reiner et al., 2006</a>). Although there is no report of oxidative modification on UNC-103, human encoded H-ERG channels can be activated by oxidative stress, so that cells become hyperpolarized and less excitable (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cui and Zhang, 2013</a>). Considering that ROS increases the excitability of the mating circuit, it is possible that L-VGCC is more prone to be oxidized than K<sup>+</sup> channels in male reproductive cells."
