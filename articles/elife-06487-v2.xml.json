We develop a model for terrestrial, cursorial predators to examine how animal mass modulates predator and prey trajectories and affects best strategies for both parties. We incorporated the maximum speed-mass relationship with an explanation of why larger animals should have greater turn radii; the forces needed to turn scale linearly with mass whereas the maximum forces an animal can exert scale to a 2/3 power law. This clarifies why in a meta-analysis, we found a preponderance of predator/prey mass ratios that minimized the turn radii of predators compared to their prey. It also explained why acceleration data from wild cheetahs pursuing different prey showed different cornering behaviour with prey type. The outcome of predator prey pursuits thus depends critically on mass effects and the ability of animals to time turns precisely."

We develop a model for terrestrial, cursorial predators to examine how animal mass modulates predator and prey trajectories and affects best strategies for both parties. We incorporated the maximum speed-mass relationship with an explanation of why larger animals should have greater turn radii; the forces needed to turn scale linearly with mass whereas the maximum forces an animal can exert scale to a 2/3 power law. This clarifies why in a meta-analysis, we found a preponderance of predator/prey mass ratios that minimized the turn radii of predators compared to their prey. It also explained why acceleration data from wild cheetahs pursuing different prey showed different cornering behaviour with prey type. The outcome of predator prey pursuits thus depends critically on mass effects and the ability of animals to time turns precisely."

Wilson et al.'s model predicts that chases between large predators and smaller prey should feature frequent sharp turns, as the prey try to exploit their superior turning ability. However, when the predators and prey are of similar size, the prey gain little or no advantage from executing high-speed turns. Indeed, as turning slows the prey down, turning may often be disadvantageous, and so fewer turns should be seen during a pursuit."

This means that there must be a broad scaling trend in turning performance with body mass. To our knowledge though, although such scaling trends have been considered for animals operating in water and air (<a href=\"#bib15\">Domenici, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hedenstr\u00f6m and Ros\u00e9n, 2001</a>), this has not been explicitly examined in the literature for terrestrial animals. This trend is due to the mismatch between the linear relationship of increased force demands with body size (proportional to Mass<sup>1.0</sup>), and the non-linear scaling of leg strength (roughly proportional to Mass<sup>0.66</sup> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984</a>) (but see <a href=\"#bib6\">Biewener, 1989</a>), leading to a relative decrease in strength, and therefore turn capacity, with increasing size.

We limit ourselves to terrestrial predation because mass effects have already been examined for organisms in fluid media (<a href=\"#bib15\">Domenici, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Van den Hout et al., 2010</a>) and because dealing with animals that operate in a 2-dimensional surface obviates many of the complexities associated with the energetics of changing height in aerial animals (<a href=\"#bib70\">Weihs and Webb, 1984</a>). In order to tease out expected trends, we use a simple model that isolates only the features of mass relevant to force demands, and mass-linked capacity for force production. Thus, we assume, among other things, that both predators and prey are geometrically similar (which ignores compensating mechanisms such as upright posture and more robust limbs of some large animals as well as variation in traction) and that the chase environment is flat, open and homogeneous (<a href=\"#bib30\">Howland, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wilson et al., 2011</a>). We propose that the attack phase of pursuit predators is essentially what has been treated within theory encompassing the \u2018homicidal chauffeur\u2019 game (<a href=\"#bib40\">Marec and Van Nhan, 1977</a>), where a car driver attempts to hit a pedestrian in a defined open space. In this, we divide trajectories of both parties into straight line and turn sections and, by adopting a game theory-based approach (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dugatkin and Reeve, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lima, 2002</a>), we distil out simple objectives for both parties; predators should attempt to minimize their distance to the prey, while prey attempt to maximize this distance (<a href=\"#bib70\">Weihs and Webb, 1984</a>). To date, the most notable attempt to define the predator-prey chase scenario is the work by <a href=\"#bib30\">Howland (1974)</a>, who defined many of the rules and consequences for a single turn gambit and we use this work as a starting point. However, a large body of theory also exists (notably <a href=\"#bib69\">Wei et al., 2009</a> and references therein), particularly that dealing with the best strategy for missiles to engage with their targets to maximize strike probability (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shneydor, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Siouris, 2004</a>) and this is also considered within our terrestrial pursuit scenario."

A third scenario might be where the predator follows the prey trajectory precisely, in which case there is no change in benefit to either party although in this circumstance, the predator, with its higher speed, will eventually converge on the prey (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Although a single turn may not lead to capture or escape of the prey, multiple turns with consistent undershooting by the predator can do so (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). For any given turn, the change in predator-prey distance over time was predicted to be critically dependent on; (i) the distance between the parties at the moment of the turn (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), with shorter distances (for distances &gt;0) at the moment of the turn leading to greater overshoot by the predator, (ii) the difference in speed between parties (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), with greater speed differences leading to greater overshoot by the predator, and (iii) the reaction time of the predator (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), with slower reaction times leading to greater overshoot."

This is due to the combined effect of generally increasing maximum speeds with mass (see above) and the additional effect of mass on turn radius (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Importantly though, the surface describing comparative turn abilities showed that predators turn tighter relative to prey in a specific area of the surface defined in terms of predator and prey mass ratios (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Insertion of the mean mass of 54 species of canids and felids and their (predominantly mammalian) prey from an extensive database (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carbone et al., 1999</a>) into this plot, shows that all predators were located in the area where predator turn capabilities were maximized compared to their prey (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The implication from this is that there is strong selection pressure for turning ability in predators and that (i) predators evolve to take particular sized prey with a mass that results in the minimum turn radius ratio most in favour of the predator, and/or (ii) prey sizes that have minimum turn radii that most closely accord with those of the predators tend to be caught more often than other-sized prey."

Our work echoes that of <a href=\"#bib30\">Howland (1974)</a>, which dealt with the same issue using a different approach, emphasising that high speed, aside from being necessary for the predator to gain on the prey, also increases the likelihood that the predator will overshoot the prey turn trajectory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Howland, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alexander, 2003</a>). Conversely, as speed decreases, the difference in distance covered during any turn between predator and prey decreases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1\u20133</a>), fulfilling the fundamental game rule for the predator. The optimum strategy for a pursuit predator should, therefore, be to attempt to elicit turns by the prey which, if the prey are working close to maximum power, will result in a reduction in their speed (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shubkina et al., 2012</a>), because energy is needed for the turn (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wilson et al., 2013c</a>). Invoking multiple rapid turns might therefore be a strategy that predators seek to promote. Here, decreasing turn duration over time is expected during successful chases, as we observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), coupled with generally decreasing speed, as reported by Wilson et al. (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wilson et al., 2013b</a>). However, turning is also critical for survival of prey because maintenance of a straight line trajectory leads to inevitable capture if the predator is faster. This seemingly contradictory situation of whether the predators or prey benefit most from prey turns is clarified by timing. When the predator is far from the prey, the prey should not turn since to do so allows the predator to cut the corner of the prey's trajectory and decrease the distance between itself and the prey more rapidly (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eilam, 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, turns by the prey do benefit the prey if the timing is correct because this leads to an overshoot by the predator (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Where such overshoot turns are consistent, they should generally lead to rarefying turn rates with reduced chances of capture (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wilson et al., 2013b</a>)."

Both parties will have power limitations restricting their options on instantaneous performance, as well as ultimately limiting how long the chase can continue before exhaustion. A multiple turn terrestrial chase has energetic costs associated with straight line travel that are a (linear) function of speed (<a href=\"#bib60\">Taylor and Heglund, 1982</a>) so, all other things being equal, at such times the predator should be expending energy faster if it is to gain on the prey. However, there are substantial costs to turning above those of straight line travel (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wilson et al., 2013c</a>) so the angular extent of the turn and the time spent turning will both affect the rate of energy expenditure (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wilson et al., 2013c</a>). Thus, where the predator cuts the corner compared to the trajectory taken by the prey (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the reduced turn costs should act to reduce its overall rate of energy expenditure, making the predator energy expenditure closer to that of the prey. This will tend to lead to similarity in power use between parties resulting in similar giving-up times, assuming both parties can allocate similar amounts of energy to a pursuit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, where a predator overshoots the cornering trajectory of the prey (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), it has to contend with the increased energetic demands of travelling farther, and with a greater turn angle, than the prey (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Thus, where overshooting occurs consistently, it will tend to make cumulative energy expenditure between the two parties more disparate resulting in the predator reaching endurance limits earlier than the prey (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In reality, multiple turn pursuits, such as we observed in our cheetah-prey interactions, will consist of a both corner-cutting and overshooting by the predators with the proportion of either perhaps biasing the likelihood of prey capture or the chase being abandoned."

This is complicated by the degree of geometric similarity between animals and models for elastic similarity (cf. <a href=\"#bib23\">Garland, 1983</a> and refs therein), all factors which might also help explain the modest reverse trend in the maximum speed vs mass relationship for animals exceeding about 70 kg (<a href=\"#bib23\">Garland, 1983</a>). That greater mass leads to greater turn radii, because the forces that animals can exert for a turn relate to a mass exponent of less than one, whereas the forces required for a turn scale to a mass exponent of one has not, to our knowledge, been previously discussed. Both these mass-dependent attributes lead to a tendency for larger animals to be faster, but less able to turn than smaller animals, which presumably has profound consequences for strategies adopted by predators and prey during pursuits."

Similarly, our mass-dependent model of performance points to how predator size in relation to that of the prey results in differential distances travelled by both parties during turns. So the distance run during any given turn by a predator with similar mass to its prey should not be markedly greater than its prey, while a larger predator chasing the same prey must contend with covering a substantial increase in the distance travelled (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). However, the scaling of turning radius with speed is complex because either party may elect to travel more slowly to produce a tighter turning radius, which also reduces the chances of mistakes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chittka et al., 2009</a>), although the predator must always presumably travel faster than the prey. Certainly, workers have suggested (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wilson et al., 2013a</a>), and found (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wilson et al., 2013b</a>), that cheetahs tend to reduce speed in the final stages of their chases (cf. <a href=\"#bib55\">Shubkina et al., 2012</a>)."

Clearly, if this occurs in planar environments, choices for changing trajectory can only amount to movement that is either left or right, and should not be executed too early where there are substantial corner-cutting benefits to be gained by the predator. However, since the timing of corners would appear so critical (see above), we would expect selection pressure for random turns just before the critical phase. Future work would do well to consider this. Finally, predator-prey pursuit options by terrestrial animals will undoubtedly be altered when the condition changes from single to multiple predators. Here, observed manoeuvres are complex and include fanning out of predators (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kelley, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mills, 1990</a>) which should allow larger predators to mitigate for the effects of their reduced turning radii with respect to those of their prey.

We expect, however, pursuit strategies for flying animals (and some latter-day missiles) to differ from those of terrestrial animals. This is because initial engagement between two aerial parties invariably involves both moving prey and the pursuer having an approach that tends to occur at a tangent to the target (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hedenstr\u00f6m and Ros\u00e9n, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ghose et al., 2006</a>), rather than from directly behind. Part of the reason for this tangent relates to both predators and prey operating in 3-d, rather than 2-d, space so that the simple probability of a line of attack being directly along and behind the prey flight path at first encounter is correspondingly reduced. Tangential approach provides various options for pursuers to calculate trajectories and compute intersection points (<a href=\"#bib45\">Olberg et al., 2000</a>) that minimize time and/or distance (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ghose et al., 2006</a>). It also helps mitigate manoeuvring problems likely to occur during pure pursuit as the inter-party distance approaches zero (particularly where pursuer speed is much greater than that of the prey) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Siouris, 2004</a>)."

                                "text": "The development of the chase for a cursorial predator operating in the planer environment of the ground, however, invariably starts with a stalking phase on essentially non-moving prey followed by the rush (<a href=\"#bib20\">Estes and Goddard, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Elliot et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mills, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Williams et al., 2014</a>). This situation is very different from some modelled interactions where both predators and prey have constant speed (e.g., <a href=\"#bib70\">Weihs and Webb, 1984</a>). Two options would seem appropriate for predator-prey encounters that start prey at, or close to, zero speed in planer environments faced with a predator moving rapidly towards them. One, which is more appropriate where the predator speed is markedly higher than prey and the distance between them small, involves prey escaping in a trajectory that is perpendicular to that of the predator (<a href=\"#bib70\">Weihs and Webb, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stankowich and Coss, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Domenici et al., 2011</a>). In part, this \u2018side step\u2019 strategy capitalizes on the speed-linked smaller turn radius of the prey compared to the predator. Otherwise, if prey react to a distant, but approaching, predator by generally moving away, the speeds of both parties will tend to become better matched over time. Here, the best strategy is for prey to continue to move directly away because any other direction will reduce the inter-party distance correspondingly (cf. <a href=\"#bib16\">Domenici et al., 2011</a>). This explains observations reporting that prey typically do indeed initially run directly away from the predators (cf. <a href=\"#bib21\">Finney et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Broom and Ruxton, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Eilam, 2005</a>) although this is not always the case (see review in <a href=\"#bib16\">Domenici et al., 2011</a>). This manoeuvre puts the pursuer directly behind the prey. During the ensuing pursuit phase, straight line pursuit by the predator towards the prey is the only viable predator option when the prey travels in a straight line (ignoring topographic complexity \u2014see \u2018Discussion\u2019), which is also what has been observed (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shubkina et al., 2012</a> and refs therein). As the predator-prey distance tends towards zero, the prey must turn to avoid capture, and may even have particular strategies such as stotting to enhance this (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stankowich and Coss, 2007</a>). We demonstrate later that there is considerable selection pressure on the prey to time this turn so that it occurs close to the contact point (but not so close that the predator catches it). This scenario reduces differences, in both trajectories and time to contact, between the different pursuit strategies (see above) although any predictive pursuit options typically have a reduced trajectory length and time to contact than pure pursuit (see below). Differences between the pursuit strategies are also likely reduced by prey reaction to the approaching predator based on the prey having properly informed assessment of predator trajectory. In this regard, typical terrestrial \u2018prey\u2019, such as ungulates, have large panoramic visual fields with laterally facing orbital margins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Heesy, 2004</a>) and so may be able to assess the movements of their pursuers as well as their pursuers can assess them. Indeed, escape trajectories may be modulated to keep predators within the prey's visual (or other sensory) fields (<a href=\"#bib16\">Domenici et al., 2011</a>). In any event, the substantive differences between terrestrial and fluid media interactions may partly account for the reason that <a href=\"#bib53\">Shneydor (1998)</a> considers that many terrestrial cursorial predators adopt pure pursuit (hence the name \u2018hound-hare pursuit\u2019), something that is backed up by observation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schaller, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shubkina et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2012</a>). Importantly though, quantitative differences in trajectories and pursuit times between pure- and predictive pursuit strategies do not change qualitative patterns. Thus, the essential message of the work, which considers mass effects, does not depend on our choice of pursuit strategy."

Thus, the mediolateral acceleration data (heave and sway axes) were initially smoothed over 2 s to derive a measure of the static (nominally gravity-based) acceleration (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shepard et al., 2008</a>) and were found to show obvious waveforms due to the bounding gait of the cheetahs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). These data were thus further smoothed over 0.5 s to minimize the influence of these waveforms while not overly compromising smoothed values (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Turns were identified as increasing departures of the doubly smoothed data from 1\u00d7<i>g</i>. The specific points of their maxima were identified by values that departed maximally from 1.0.

In addition to broadening the focus of the paper taxonomically, including additional complexities of the predator-prey pursuit, in particular the element of endurance would greatly broaden the appeal of the analysis."

The other is Siouris 2003, Missile Guidance and Control Systems. That deals with this problem in chapter 4 where Siouris writes: \u2018Pursuit guidance is considered impractical as a homing guidance law against moving targets because of the difficult maneuvers that are required to end the attack in a tail chase. That is, the maneuvers required of the missile become increasingly hard during the last, critical, stages of the flight. Another disadvantage of this guidance method is that the missile speed must be considerably greater than that of the target. The sharpest curvature of the missile flight path usually occurs at the end of the flight, so that at this time the missile must overtake the target. If the target attempts to evade, the last-minute angular acceleration requirements placed on the missile could exceed the aerodynamic capability, thereby causing a large miss distance\u2019, which rather captures the situation in the manuscript.\u201d"

Manoeuvrability is certainly a major factor in predator-prey gambits, although it is largely overlooked in certain taxa and therefore this manuscript is potentially a welcome addition to the literature. My main comment is that this paper really mainly applies to terrestrial mammals, and the authors should clarify this point right from the title and the Abstract. A lot of work on manoeuvrability and predator-prey interactions has been done on aquatic and aerial species. Some of that work may actually be relevant for this manuscript as well, at least in the discussion for comparing various predator-prey situations."

Indeed, if a prey has a blind zone posteriorly, turning itself could be a way to keep track of where the predator is.

The other is Siouris 2003, Missile Guidance and Control Systems. That deals with this problem in chapter 4 where Siouris writes: \u2018Pursuit guidance is considered impractical as a homing guidance law against moving targets because of the difficult maneuvers that are required to end the attack in a tail chase. That is, the maneuvers required of the missile become increasingly hard during the last, critical, stages of the flight. Another disadvantage of this guidance method is that the missile speed must be considerably greater than that of the target. The sharpest curvature of the missile flight path usually occurs at the end of the flight, so that at this time the missile must overtake the target. If the target attempts to evade, the last-minute angular acceleration requirements placed on the missile could exceed the aerodynamic capability, thereby causing a large miss distance\u2019, which rather captures the situation in the manuscript</i>.<i>\u201d</i>"

The issue of missile manoeuvres becoming more difficult towards the end of the chase is obviously critical for flight pursuit, not least because airborne predators (or missiles) cannot reduce speed without losing lift, with all the stability and turn radii complications that this engenders. In addition, missiles typically have much greater speed than their targets, which is not the case in many terrestrial encounters. Having now clearly specified that we only consider terrestrial predators, many of these particular problems become less critical (terrestrial predators actually have smaller turn radii with decreasing speed and are liable to have greater stability and accuracy \u2013 see e.g. <a href=\"#bib12\">Chittka et al.

Therefore, not all angles of escape may be the same, for a prey chased by a predator. There may be optimal ones, from a sensory perspective, that allow keeping track of the danger. Indeed, if a prey has a blind zone posteriorly, turning itself could be a way to keep track of where the predator is. While this paper is mainly about the biomechanical principles that may determine predator-prey strategies, some considerations on the sensory systems of predators and prey would increase the ecological and behavioural relevance of this work</i>."
