A candidate mechanism underlying the centrifugal direction selectivity of SAC dendrites is synaptic inhibition onto SACs. Here we disrupted this inhibition by perturbing distinct sets of GABAergic inputs onto SACs \u2013 removing either GABA release or GABA receptors from SACs. We found that lateral inhibition onto Off SACs from non-SAC amacrine cells is required for optimal direction selectivity of the Off pathway. In contrast, lateral inhibition onto On SACs is not necessary for direction selectivity of the On pathway when the moving object is on a homogenous background, but is required when the background is noisy. These results demonstrate that distinct sets of inhibitory mechanisms are recruited to generate direction selectivity under different visual conditions."

A candidate mechanism underlying the centrifugal direction selectivity of SAC dendrites is synaptic inhibition onto SACs. Here we disrupted this inhibition by perturbing distinct sets of GABAergic inputs onto SACs \u2013 removing either GABA release or GABA receptors from SACs. We found that lateral inhibition onto Off SACs from non-SAC amacrine cells is required for optimal direction selectivity of the Off pathway. In contrast, lateral inhibition onto On SACs is not necessary for direction selectivity of the On pathway when the moving object is on a homogenous background, but is required when the background is noisy. These results demonstrate that distinct sets of inhibitory mechanisms are recruited to generate direction selectivity under different visual conditions."

SACs are monostratified, axonless interneurons that release GABA and acetylcholine from varicosities at the distal ends of their dendritic arbors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brecha et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Famiglietti, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kosaka et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">O'Malley and Masland, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Vaney and Young, 1988</a>). Generating directionally tuned GABAergic inhibition onto DSGCs requires two mechanisms. First, GABAergic inputs preferentially originate from SAC dendritic sectors that extend in the anti-preferred (null) direction of On-Off DSGCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fried et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wei et al., 2011</a>). Second, the dendritic sectors of SACs are electrotonically isolated and directionally tuned to motion in the centrifugal direction (from soma to dendritic tips) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">Euler et al., 2002</a>). Since null-direction motion for a DSGC corresponds to centrifugal motion for its presynaptic SAC dendrites, maximal GABA release from SACs to DSGCs occurs during motion in the null direction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

The first one disrupted GABA release from SACs by conditionally knocking out the vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat) gene <i>Slc32a1</i> in SACs. This selectively removed reciprocal SAC-SAC inhibition and allowed us to determine its contribution to the centrifugal direction selectivity of SACs. The second manipulation blocked all GABAergic inputs onto SACs by removing their functional GABA receptors. This enabled us to determine the role that total GABAergic inhibition onto SACs plays in the direction selectivity of both SACs and On-Off DSGCs. Combining these genetic manipulations with pharmacology, we found that motion stimuli with different contrast and backgrounds recruit different sets of inhibitory mechanisms for the computation of motion direction."

This line contains homozygous floxed <i>Slc32a1</i> alleles (acronym: <i>Slc32a1</i><sup>flox/flox</sup>) to replace the endogenous <i>Slc32a1</i> gene, and a choline acetyltransferase (<i>Chat)-IRES-Cre</i> knockin allele for SAC-specific <i>Cre</i> expression (acronym: <i>C</i>). A floxed <i>tdTomato</i> transgene (acronym: <i>T</i>) was also included when SACs were targeted for electrophysiological recordings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We have previously shown that these KO mice display disrupted GABAergic inhibition from SACs to DSGCs and no detectable developmental compensation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pei et al., 2015</a>). To confirm that GABAergic synapses between neighboring SACs are also lost in these mice, we performed paired recordings from neighboring SACs in the ganglion cell layer with intersoma distance of 50~100 um. Evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were measured from one SAC at holding potential of \u221280 mV while the other SAC was depolarized to 0 mV for 20 ms in voltage clamp configuration. We detected reciprocal inhibition between SACs in 9 out of 9 pairs in the control group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, mean peak amplitude 16.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8 pA, five mice), consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee and Zhou, 2006</a>).

We imaged calcium transients in varicosities located in the furthest distal 20 \u03bcm of GCaMP6-expressing SAC dendrites while a bright bar moved against a homogeneous dark background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We term this stimulus \"simple moving bar stimulus\u201d. As expected, the leading edge of the bright bar evoked calcium transients in On SACs and the trailing edge evoked responses in Off SACs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). We used the peak amplitude of the calcium transients in varicosities as a measure of the strength of dendritic activation. We quantified direction selectivity of responses using the direction selectivity index (DSI, see Experimental methods) and the vector sum. In control mice, dendritic calcium signals in both On and Off SACs show strong directional tuning to motion in the centrifugal direction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). In <i>Slc32a1</i> KO mice, centrifugal direction selectivity (both DSI and vector sum) of On SACs is similar to that of control mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). However, Off SACs exhibit a small, but statistically significant, increase in DSI and vector sum values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) due to decreased centripetal direction response (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Adding the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 to <i>Slc32a1</i> KO retinas reduces these direction selectivity parameters for both On and Off SACs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u20132G</a>), indicating a role for GABAergic inhibition of SACs by non-SAC amacrine cells. Our results demonstrate that, for a simple moving bar stimulus, losing reciprocal SAC-SAC inhibition in <i>Slc32a1</i> KO mice does not affect the direction selectivity of On SACs, and enhances the direction selectivity of Off SACs."

Therefore, we examined other critical synapses involved in direction selectivity: the GABAergic and cholinergic synapses between SACs and DSGCs. Using paired voltage-clamp recording, we depolarized SACs and measured evoked GABAergic IPSCs and cholinergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in pDSGCs. We targeted SAC-pDSGC pairs with overlapping dendritic arbors and intersoma distances of 60\u201380 \u00b5m. In control mice, SACs from the null side provide strong GABAergic inputs onto pDSGCs while SACs from the preferred side provide weak GABAergic inputs. In <i>Gabra2</i> KOs, this asymmetric wiring pattern remains unchanged (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>). Similarly, cholinergic transmission in the KO is unaffected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>). Thus our results show that GABAergic and cholinergic synapses from SACs to DSGCs are not altered in the <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice. In addition, the amplitude of EPSCs in pDSGCs evoked by a bright flashing spot is similar between control and <i>Gabra2</i> KO groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), indicating that both cholinergic and glutamatergic synapses onto pDSGCs are unaltered."

To address this question, we measured centrifugal direction selectivity by monitoring GCaMP6 fluorescence in On and Off SACs of <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice during the simple moving bar stimulus described above. We found that Off SACs in these KOs display a significant increase in centripetal-direction response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), resulting in reduced direction selectivity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u20134F</a>).

In contrast, we found that On SACs in the KOs exhibit centrifugal preference similar to those of control mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), suggesting that direct GABAergic inputs are not required for direction selectivity in On SACs during the simple moving bar stimulus.

We recorded the spiking activity of pDSGCs in loose-patch configuration, and compared the direction selectivity of the leading edge-evoked On response and the trailing edge-evoked Off response in control and <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice during the simple moving bar stimulus. Consistent with the reduced directional tuning of IPSCs observed in the Off component, we found that the Off response of pDSGC spiking activity in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice shows less direction selectivity than that in control mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and C</a>). In contrast, the On responses in KOs display direction selectivity similar to that of controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). To rule out the possibility that the Off response is influenced by prior activation of the On pathway, we reversed the contrast of the moving bar stimulus by presenting a dark bar against a bright background. We found that direction selectivity of the leading edge-evoked Off component in <i>Gabra2</i> KOs was again less than that in controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and F</a>), while the trailing edge-evoked On response of KOs shows direction selectivity similar to controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and E</a>).

What, then, is the role of lateral inhibition in the On pathway? We hypothesized that our stimulus conditions did not optimally activate this inhibitory pathway. In particular, a noisy background may more effectively engage this inhibition and reveal its functional importance in direction selectivity. To test this idea, we measured the direction selectivity of pDSGCs in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice using a bright bar moving against a flickering checkerboard background. This flickering checkerboard provides \"white noise\" that is commonly used for mapping receptive fields in the spike-triggered average method (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chichilnisky, 2001</a>). We set the brightness of this moving bar equal to that of our simple moving bar stimulus, and varied the brightness of the checker pattern from 0% to 100% of the moving bar intensity. In control mice, the pDSGC spiking response maintains direction selectivity over a wide range of checker intensities (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u20137C</a>). Consistent with the earlier finding that lateral inhibition is crucial for direction selectivity of the Off component (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and E</a>), the direction selectivity of the Off response in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice is reduced regardless of checker intensity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and C</a>). Interestingly, however, replacing the gray background with a flickering checkerboard also significantly reduces the On direction selectivity in KO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>), indicating a functional contribution of lateral inhibition during more complex stimuli."

In our study, we selectively remove from SACs the two genes involved in GABAergic transmission, <i>Slc32a1</i> and <i>Gabra2</i>, during the early postnatal period (<a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, we must verify that aside from loss of SAC-mediated GABA release in <i>Slc32a1</i> KO mice and loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in SACs in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice, the rest of the direction selectivity circuit is not altered. To address this issue, we examined the other known synapse types that are involved in retinal direction selectivity, including the cholinergic and GABAergic synapses between SACs and DSGCs, as well as the glutamatergic inputs onto DSGCs from bipolar cells. We found that these synapses showed no detectable changes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pei et al., 2015</a>) and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), indicating that removing GABA release or GABA receptors from SACs does not lead to compensatory developmental changes at other synapses in the direction selective circuit. We cannot discount the possibility that developmental compensation has occurred at sites not examined in this study. However, our findings are consistent with multiple previous studies that demonstrate that the early development of retinal direction selectivity is highly resistant to changes in neural activity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chan and Chiao, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Elstrott et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hamby et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wei et al., 2011</a>)."

This effect does not stem from SAC-SAC inhibition, since the\u00a0loss of this inhibition in <i>Slc32a1 KO</i> mice does not reduce direction selectivity of Off SACs, but rather slightly enhances it by decreasing centripetal-direction response. This indicates that the centrifugal preference of Off SAC dendrites requires additional GABAergic inputs onto Off SACs from non-SAC amacrine cells. These cells are presumably the wide-field amacrine cells that synapse onto the proximal dendrites of Off SACs and contribute about 8% of the total number of inhibitory synapses onto Off SACs identified by connectomic reconstruction (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ding et al., 2016</a>). Though these synapses represent a small fraction of the synaptic inputs onto Off SACs, they may be sufficiently strong and efficient for shunting glutamatergic excitatory inputs that are also clustered in the proximal SAC dendrites (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vlasits et al., 2016</a>)."

In the absence of GABA release from SACs in <i>Slc32a1</i> KO mice, these non-SAC amacrine cells might be disinhibited, thus providing stronger lateral inhibition to Off SACs to decrease their centripetal-direction response.

Thus, the direction selective circuitry is not merely mirrored in the On and Off layers of the IPL, but consists of distinct sets of mechanisms in each sublamina. Our study therefore adds to others that have demonstrated differences and interactions between the On and Off pathways of the direction selective circuit (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackert et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Vlasits et al., 2014</a>) and of other retinal circuits (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geffen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tikidji-Hamburyan et al., 2015</a>).

                                "text": "Lateral inhibition plays an important role in feature selection in multiple sensory systems. One elaborated form, the reciprocal inhibition between inhibitory neurons, has been described in multiple brain areas such as retina, thalamus, midbrain and cortex (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee and Zhou, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Machens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Miller and Wang, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Papadopoulou et al., 2011</a>). In sensory and cognitive systems, lateral inhibition motifs have been implicated in selecting the target feature in an environment when other 'competitor' features are present (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sharpee, 2012</a>). In the visual system, moving objects in natural scenes have backgrounds that are rarely homogeneous and stationary, but rather are spatially and temporally noisy. These can serve as 'competitor' stimuli that pose challenges to the direction selective circuit for reliably detecting motion direction. We postulate that lateral inhibition onto On SACs functions to safeguard direction selectivity against a noisy environment. A noisy background increases activation of bipolar cells, which in turn provides stronger glutamatergic drive to the downstream amacrine cells including SACs. Under this condition, the lateral inhibitory network may be in a more 'primed' state to be efficiently recruited by the motion stimuli and to exert its function. In contrast, amacrine cells involved in lateral inhibition are less activated when bipolar cells adapt to the gray background, and thus the moving bar alone may not be sufficient to significantly recruit lateral inhibition in the On pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, direction selectivity of the On response of DSGCs in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice is normal when the background is homogeneous but deteriorates as soon as white noise is introduced into the background. These findings represent an intriguing example in which additional neural mechanisms are recruited when the visual stimulus more closely resembles natural viewing conditions, but simpler visual stimuli involving only the feature of interest may not reveal the functional significance of these mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib12\">David et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Felsen and Dan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Felsen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Turner and Rieke, 2016</a>). A notable analogy has been reported in the visual cortex: a prominent inhibitory component in the receptive field of visual cortical neurons is uniquely revealed by more complex natural stimuli but is not observed with synthetic sinusoidal gratings (<a href=\"#bib12\">David et al., 2004</a>)."

This variability may be due to a number of factors, such as species differences, conditions of visual stimulation, somatic recordings versus calcium imaging at the dendrites, and locations of varicosities along SAC dendrites. Furthermore, the effect of the antagonist cannot be attributed to specific type(s) of GABAergic synapses since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are extensively expressed in amacrine cells and bipolar cells in the IPL. Here, we combined pharmacology with the genetic dissection of the GABAergic circuitry to determine the synaptic loci that participate in direction selectivity. This approach allowed us to assign functional roles to different inhibitory synaptic components, and to identify a new component in the functional wiring diagram of the direction selective circuit: inhibitory inputs from non-SAC amacrine cells onto Off SACs."

However, by genetically eliminating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors but not neurotransmitter release from SACs in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice, we preserved the critical synaptic connections between SACs and DSGCs, and determined the role that GABAergic inputs onto SACs play in the spiking output of DSGC\u2019s. We found that the direction selectivity of On-Off DSGC spiking decreases when SAC centrifugal preference is reduced. Therefore, the inhibitory mechanisms contributing to the centrifugal preference of SACs that we have studied here are functionally relevant for determining the signals that are relayed from the retina to the brain."

For statistical analysis, we compared variance across varicosities on the dendrites of the same SAC versus variance across varicosities of different SACs. Since the latter was larger, we averaged DSI and vector sum values of all the varicosities belonging to one SAC to get a single data point, and took N in the statistical analysis to be the number of cells, which approximately equals the number of imaging windows."

Briefly, the retinas were perfused with oxygenated Ames at 32\u201333\u00b0C. Cells were visualized with infrared light (&gt;900 nm) and an IR-sensitive video camera (Watec). <i>Drd4-GFP</i>-positive cells were identified using a two-photon microscope (Bruker Nano Surface Division) and a Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II) tuned to 920 nm. An electrode of 3\u20135 M\u03a9 was filled with Ames\u2019 medium for loose patch recordings of spikes. Then the electrode was carefully removed, and a new electrode filled with cesium-based internal solution and 25 \u03bcm Alexa 594 was used to fill the recorded cell. An image stack of the Alexa-488 filled pDSGC was acquired with the two-photon microscope at <i>z</i> intervals of 1.5 \u03bcm and was resampled three times for each z-plane using a 60x objective (Olympus LUMPlanFl/IR 60x/0.90W). Images were acquired to cover the entire dendritic field of the cell to verify the bistratified dendritic arbor and the cofasciculation with <i>tdTomato</i>-expressing SACs. Rarely, we encountered <i>Drd4-GFP</i> positive neurons that did not show the above two characteristics in both control and knockout groups. These mislabeled cells are not included in the analysis."

The specific question addressed in this study concerns the role of lateral inhibition between starburst amacrine cells (SACs), the inhibitory interneurons that provide a source of directional inhibition onto direction selective ganglion cells. Using precise genetic manipulations to SACs, they provide direct evidence that the circuitries of ON and OFF SACs must indeed be different, as they rely on GABAergic input to very different degrees. The most exciting result of this study, however, is that SAC-SAC interactions render SAC direction selectivity more robust under more natural stimulus conditions, that is in the presence of noise. This is, to our knowledge, the first convincing demonstration of the long standing idea that different dendritic direction selectivity mechanisms supplement each other in order to render motion direction detection robust and as independent as possible from the stimulus."

If it is, we should see reduced direction selectivity in the On pathway in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice during a moving bar stimulus with contrast and background luminance levels that are similar to the equivalent flickering checkerboard stimulus. Thus, we performed this experiment and found that direction selectivity in the On pathway in <i>Gabra2</i> KO mice is not affected at all contrast and background luminance levels we tested. Therefore, lateral inhibition in the On pathway is functionally recruited by the noisy background but not by the specific contrast of the primary stimulus nor the background luminance levels. This data has now been included in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, and in the text (subsection \u201cLateral inhibition in the On pathway is required for direction selectivity on a noisy background\u201d, last paragraph)."

We have previously recorded from DSGCs from Vgat KO mice and have found that the tuning of DSGCs is significantly impaired (Pei et al., 2015). However, in these KO mice, the SAC-DSGC inhibition is also disrupted. Therefore, we cannot assign the reduced direction selectivity to SAC-SAC inhibition. Since we currently cannot provide direct support for a role of SAC-SAC inhibition in a noisy background, we have modified the Discussion section accordingly (subsection \u201cThe role of lateral inhibition during a moving bar stimulus against a noisy background\u201d)."
