Theoretical attempts to unify the multiple roles assigned to serotonin proposed that it regulates the impact of costs, such as delay or punishment, on action selection. Here, we show that serotonin also regulates other types of action costs such as effort. We compared behavioral performance in 58 healthy humans treated during 8 weeks with either placebo or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram. The task involved trading handgrip force production against monetary benefits. Participants in the escitalopram group produced more effort and thereby achieved a higher payoff. Crucially, our computational analysis showed that this effect was underpinned by a specific reduction of effort cost, and not by any change in the weight of monetary incentives. This specific computational effect sheds new light on the physiological role of serotonin in behavioral regulation and on the clinical effect of drugs for depression."

Theoretical attempts to unify the multiple roles assigned to serotonin proposed that it regulates the impact of costs, such as delay or punishment, on action selection. Here, we show that serotonin also regulates other types of action costs such as effort. We compared behavioral performance in 58 healthy humans treated during 8 weeks with either placebo or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram. The task involved trading handgrip force production against monetary benefits. Participants in the escitalopram group produced more effort and thereby achieved a higher payoff. Crucially, our computational analysis showed that this effect was underpinned by a specific reduction of effort cost, and not by any change in the weight of monetary incentives. This specific computational effect sheds new light on the physiological role of serotonin in behavioral regulation and on the clinical effect of drugs for depression."

Another issue is that apathy may not be a simple construct. It is typically captured as a loss of behavioral activation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cl\u00e9ry-Melin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Treadway et al., 2012</a>), which could arise from different causes at the cognitive level: for instance a diminished sensitivity to reward attractiveness, or alternatively an exacerbated sensitivity to action cost. The ambition of the present study therefore was two-fold: we aimed (1) to clarify the effects of an SSRI on the motivation of effortful behavior in healthy volunteers, unconfounded by psychopathology, and (2) to reconcile these effects with a more general role of serotonin in the sensitivity to action costs vs. benefits."

Previous studies suggested that serotonin is implicated in the motor aspects of action production and also the valuation processes that motivate the action. Notably, serotonin was found to condition impulse control and the capacity for behavioral inhibition (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cools et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Crockett et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Warden et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Guitart-Masip et al., 2014</a>) and to promote patience for delayed rewards (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schweighofer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Worbe et al., 2014</a>). Serotonin also impacts the determinants of actions, for instance, how positive and negative outcomes guide learning in humans (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chamberlain et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Crockett et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Faulkner and Deakin, 2014</a>), monkeys (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clarke et al., 2004</a>) and rodents (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bari et al., 2010</a>). Several attempts have been made previously to capture serotonin function in a coherent computational theory. Key ideas are that serotonin (1) regulates the impact of action costs such as punishments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Daw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Niv et al., 2007</a>) or delay (<a href=\"#bib44\">Niv et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>) and (2) adjusts the propensity to activate versus inhibit the action (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>)."

Indeed, in the literature quoted above, actions are mostly implemented as binary responses (e.g., approach vs. avoidance) and their costs or benefits are manipulated through the valence of their outcome (e.g., monetary gain or loss). Such tasks therefore over-simplify the real-life situation, where actions may often require more or less effort, depending on their intensity and duration."

To assess the impact of changing cerebral serotonin levels and how it unfolds over time, we compared different groups of healthy subjects treated under double blind conditions with escitalopram (an SSRI) or placebo during eight weeks. Participants performed a previously published task (<a href=\"#bib42\">Meyniel et al., 2013</a>), during which they allocated physical effort over time in order to maximize a monetary payoff that increased with effort duration (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The task thus involves trading a physical effort cost against distinct levels of monetary incentives. Although changes in cost and benefit were independently manipulated in the task, they may result in intricate effects at the behavioral level. To disentangle between potential effects of serotonin on cost or benefit estimates, or both, we used a formal model of how decisions are generated by a hidden level of computations in our task, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib42\">Meyniel et al., 2013</a><a href=\"#bib41\">, 2014</a>). Based on this computational analysis of the behavior, we could pinpoint the specific effect of serotonin on cost-related parameters, and track the predicted effects of such a computational change onto the experimental measures."

They were instructed that their monetary payoff would be proportional to both the monetary incentive and the effort duration, i.e. the time spent squeezing a handgrip harder than a target force level, which varied with task difficulty. Subjects were provided with on-line feedback on the payoff accumulated in the trial (score on the top) and on the instantaneous pressure exerted on the grip (fluid level in the thermometer). The force time series of an example trial is shown below the screenshots, revealing 3 effort periods, with rewarded effort (force above target) plotted in black (not gray). Two factors were manipulated across trials: (i) the incentive level, shown as a coin image (1, 2 or 5p) and (ii) the difficulty level, corresponding to the same white bar in the thermometer reached with different target force levels (70%, 80% or 90% of the maximal force). The last screen summarized the payoff cumulated over preceding trials.\u00a0(<b>B</b>) Using a double-blind procedure, healthy subjects were assigned to one of the two treatment groups, corresponding to a daily intake of either placebo or escitalopram (10 mg during the initial phase, 20 mg during the intermediate and late phase) during 9 weeks.

To disentangle between the two mechanisms, we relied on a computational model of effort allocation that was previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib42\">Meyniel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Meyniel et al., 2014</a>). This model assumes that a single computational variable, termed cost evidence, accounts for the decision to stop and resume effort exertion. Cost evidence waxes during effort (with slope Se) until reaching an upper bound where effort is stopped, and it wanes during rest (with slope Sr) until reaching a lower bound where effort is resumed. The distance between bounds is the cost-evidence amplitude (denoted A). Effort and rest durations are determined by the ratios of amplitude and slopes (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) so that performance depends on the value of latent parameters (A, Se, Sr) and its potential modulation by task factors (monetary incentive and effort difficulty). We used a Bayesian Model Selection procedure previously validated (<a href=\"#bib42\">Meyniel et al., 2013</a><a href=\"#bib41\">, 2014</a>) to pinpoint the effect of the task factors onto these latent parameters (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

For instance, interventions targeting serotonergic transmission during probabilistic and reversal learning paradigms in rodents, monkeys and humans suggested that serotonin impacts sensitivity to negative rather than positive feedback (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clarke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chamberlain et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Crockett et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>). The reduction of serotonergic transmission in humans following acute tryptophan depletion (for a review, see <a href=\"#bib27\">Faulkner and Deakin, 2014</a>) reduced information sampling in a decision-making task, but crucially, only when sampling had a financial cost (<a href=\"#bib18\">Crockett et al., 2012</a>). Serotonin may also impact moral costs, such as unfairness in social decision-making (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crockett et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, serotonin may control the cost of delay in reward delivery in rodents, such that a higher firing rate of serotonergic neurons correlates with an increased ability to wait for bigger rewards (<a href=\"#bib43\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>), without affecting the sensitivity to the reward itself (<a href=\"#bib30\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>). Conversely, low serotonin levels, e.g. after acute tryptophan depletion, were suggested to exacerbate sensitivity to the cost of waiting, which could result in impulse control disorders (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crockett et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dayan, 2012</a>). Thus, it is tempting to build a parsimonious computational theory on the idea that serotonin is involved in processing all kinds of action costs. This is compatible with the notion that different types of costs are processed by distinct neural circuits, since neuromodulators such as serotonin can affect many brain regions. However, such a generalization would necessitate assessing the putative role of each mono-amine and their interactions with different types of costs within the same study. Previous attempts in rodents have observed effects that\u00a0are\u00a0inconsistent with the present results: in cost/benefit trade-off tasks, serotonin blockers impacted choices only when costs were delays, and not physical efforts (<a href=\"#bib23\">Denk et al., 2005</a>), whereas dopamine blockers affected both types of costs. Such discrepancies may call for caution when translating the\u00a0results of pharmacological studies in rodents into medication effects in humans."

However, the net effect of SSRI might not be so straightforward to interpret at the molecular level for several reasons. First, a high tonic concentration could have the paradoxical effect of reducing the sensitivity to phasic serotonergic signals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Faulkner and Deakin, 2014</a>). Second, the ubiquitous negative feedback regulation by auto-receptors can initially revert the response expected from high extracellular levels of serotonin (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stahl, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fischer et al., 2014</a>) and also produce non-linear dose-response functions for cognitive performance (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bari et al., 2010</a>). Third, much evidence suggests that different serotonin projections to different forebrain systems mediate varying acute and chronic adaptive responses to aversive events (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hale et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Faulkner and Deakin, 2014</a>). The effect of serotonin also depends on the location in the brain and on the type of receptors, for instance, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors respectively inhibit and excite motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992</a>). Thus, the superficial interpretation that serotonin helps overcoming effort costs will need to be refined by addressing the complexity of SSRI effects at the molecular level. We nevertheless note that the superficial interpretation is consistent with demonstrations that serotonin also helps overcoming other costs such as delay in humans (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schweighofer et al., 2008</a>)."

An indirect effect through an increase in muscular capacity can be excluded since there was no difference in maximal force between the placebo and SSRI groups at any visit. The computational analysis simply suggests that a slower accumulation of effort cost (lower Se<sub>m</sub>) under SSRI prolonged effort duration. It does not distinguish between down-regulation of the cost signal itself, or down-regulation of the weight this cost has in the decision to produce an effort. The former (perceptual) view would be in line with an analgesic effect of escitalopram, which is consistent with the findings that nociception and/or somatosensory perception are both modulated by serotonin at central levels (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992</a>), that serotonin is targeted by common drugs modulating pain like acetaminophen (<a href=\"#bib55\">Smith, 2009</a>) and that serotonin modulates the inhibitory feedback loop that allows muscular fatigue to down-regulate the motor command (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gandevia, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cotel et al., 2013</a>).

Indeed, the beneficial effect of SSRI shown here is reminiscent of previous reports about dopaminergic manipulations in mesolimbic structures, which affected the propensity to choose high reward \u2013 high effort over low reward \u2013 low effort options in rodents (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cousins et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Salamone et al., 2007</a>). However, if SSRIs antagonize dopamine release (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dremencov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>), escitalopram should have reduced effort production in our task (but see <a href=\"#bib52\">Schilstr\u00f6m et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, the fact that escitalopram did not modulate incentive effects on parameters such as the amplitude or dissipation slope argues against a participation of dopamine. Indeed dopaminergic manipulations in humans have been repeatedly shown to affect reward processing, not only in learning contexts (<a href=\"#bib31\">Frank et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pessiglione et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Palminteri et al., 2009</a>) but also in reward/effort trade-off paradigms (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wardle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Treadway et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Le Bouc et al., 2016</a>).

We did not find an interaction with time in our results but only a main effect of treatment group. Both parametric and non-parametric statistics showed that such a group difference is very unlikely to arise from chance in sampling the population (under the null hypothesis). General psychological assessment at baseline was also similar in the two groups. However, we acknowledge that our shortest time since treatment onset (3 days) may already depart from the acute regime, that ceiling effects in the SSRI group could in principle mask an interaction with time, and that our study may lack the statistical power to reveal such an effect. This absence of an interaction contrasts with the apparently delayed clinical effect of SSRIs in depressed patients, which usually take weeks to improve mood (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stahl, 2008</a>). However, at the molecular level, serotonin release is boosted by SSRIs from treatment onset (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kobayashi et al., 2008</a>) and SSRI effects on emotional processing also occur with little or no delay in healthy subjects (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harmer et al., 2003</a>). In pathological conditions, time may be needed to adjust to the new, less negative perception of costs, as well as the reduced emotional bias, and convert these implicit changes into a conscious subjective improvement that can be reported to the practitioner (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harmer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>). This idea has been formalized in a recent study showing how positive and negative outcomes can shape mood on the long run (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eldar and Niv, 2015</a>). Further studies in depressed patients are needed to assess whether an early detection of effort cost attenuation could be used to predict long-term treatment effects on clinical symptoms."

Intuitively, this effect on reward sensitivity corresponds to the idea that when perceived costs are too high, a change in reward prospect will have little effect. Thus, our analysis shows that the behavioral consequences of cost and benefit estimates are intricate but computationally tractable. Our paradigm and model could provide experimental and conceptual tools to refine the description of motivational disorders. Distinct dysfunctions, such as amplification of effort cost vs. flattening of reward prospects, might call for different treatments: if drugs modulating serotonin only affect cost estimates, then other drugs (possibly dopaminergic) should aim to impact the valuation of potential benefits."

Subjects were asked to produce an effort in every trial. As there were eight trials per condition in the task, a given visit was excluded for non-compliance when the total number of effort (or rest) was lower than three in at least one condition.

Interestingly, effort was not resumed immediately after cessation, but only after a substantial decrease in cost evidence. Waiting until a lower bound is reached may ensure that effort is not systematically produced at maximal instantaneous cost. Rest may therefore contribute to optimizing the cost/benefit balance on the long run. Importantly, an exceedingly long rest would also be suboptimal since it would reduce the payoff. Indeed, only efforts are rewarded in the task: there is therefore an opportunity cost to rest (<a href=\"#bib44\">Niv et al., 2007</a>).

For each subject in the placebo group, we fitted the model and took the mean value over visits of a given parameter (henceforth the 'target'). To simulate a potential effect of the SSRI treatment on this target parameter, we increased this value by a 20%. Then we computed mean effort and rest durations in each experimental condition using <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a> and we corrupted these means with noise (we added the residuals of fitted data taken from another random subject in the placebo group). Last, we fitted again the model by adjusting a second set of parameters onto these simulated mean effort and rest durations. To assess statistical significance, we repeated this procedure 100 times for each subject and each target parameter. We compared the initial parameter values (fitted on actual data) and the new ones (fitted on simulated data) for each simulation with paired t-test across subjects and the threshold p&lt;0.05/5 to correct for the 5 parameters tested. For 'target' parameters, a significant difference indicates that the fitting procedure correctly recovers the simulated increase (a\u00a0'hit'); for 'non-target' parameters, a significant difference indicates a lack of specificity (a\u00a0'false alarm'). We report the simulated changes identified by the fitting procedure in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, as the median parameter change (across subjects), averaged over simulations."

We designed single-modulation variants of the accumulation model (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>) by forcing \u03b4 to zero for all but one parameter, for which \u03b4 remained free. In other words, a modulation of only one single parameter was permitted. We also designed double-modulation models in which two modulations are permitted and modeled with distinct \u03b4s. All models were fitted with the variational Bayesian procedure by (<a href=\"#bib20\">Daunizeau et al., 2014</a>). Values of log model evidence are reported in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> for model comparison."

We used a repeated-measure ANOVA with subjects as a random factor, treatment group as a between-subject factor and time since treatment onset (initial, intermediate, late) as a within-subject factor. Interaction between the within-subject factors was included in all ANOVAs. We followed up the ANOVA results with two-sample two-sided t-tests at a given time since treatment onset.

Several of the authors had previously developed a rise-to-bound computational model to account for behavior on this task in terms of a \"cost evidence\" variable that rises during effort and falls during rest. Here they used the model to show that overall better performance of the SSRI group (more reward) is associated with reduced effort costs and not the weight in monetary incentives. Thus, 5HT's role in action costs might be more general than hitherto thought, extending from the regulation of punishment and delay to that of effort costs."

The role of serotonin in behavioral control and decision-making is complex, and this paper makes a solid contribution to shrinking some of this complexity by sharpening our understanding of it in relation to effort. The ubiquity of SSRI use \u2013 in depression, Parkinson's Disease, and other disorders \u2013 and the lack of model-based understanding of what these drugs do in terms of information processing makes the contribution important. It is also commendable from a clinical perspective that chronic rather than just acute effects of the drug were assessed."

It is stated that interactions between treatments and pairs of computational variables (Se<sub>m</sub> versus each other parameter) were always significant. The implication of this result depends on the sign of the parameters. The cumulative payoff effect might represent, for example, enhanced amplitude modulation (A<sub>i</sub>) and/or reduced cost-evidence accumulation (Se<sub>m</sub>). How were computational parameters coded when entered into the ANOVA? To assess specificity, one might want to reverse the coding for A and Sr. More generally, to what extent were the parameters independent of each other in the model? Also, might it be possible to define a different model space that would allow the use of Bayesian stats, and model comparison to estimate the drug effects on the various parameters? The distinct advantage of such an approach would be that it allows the capturing of drug effects despite the presence of individual differences of no interest."

The main effects coming out of the modeling analysis appear to be related to effort duration. But longer effort durations are also longer overall durations, which brings up the literature on 5-HT and delay costs (some of the delay discounting papers with 5-HT manipulations are actually cited in the manuscript). The authors appear to favor the view that different types of costs can be reduced to one process that is related overall to multiple types of costs. There is evidence both for and against this, and the authors are of course free to interpret their results in this way. In fact, this discussion contributes to the field in an interesting way. However, how much of the effect they are seeing is related to time per se? The authors should discuss this."

The parallel with our task is limited since here, external stimuli are mostly restricted to cues that have an explicit meaning (coins indicating the reward rate) and outcomes are deterministically and immediately coupled to actions: the cumulative payoff is displayed continuously as a function of the current force and incentive level. Second, the dynamics in RL reflects the learning of stimulus-response-outcome mapping across trials, whereas in our task, the dynamics reflects the allocation of effort within and between trials. Third, RL usually comes with a discretization of events into trials, with transient prediction errors whereas in our task, actions and feedback are continuous in time. Last, in RL, \u201ccost\u201d refers to negative outcomes that thereby vary along the same axis as \u201cbenefit\u201d with a negative valence. In contrast, the effort cost is instrumental to get reward in our task. In total, the processes that we intended to model here do not involve much RL, as the mapping is clearly specified in the instructions. These processes are meant to solve a choice problem: knowing all the contingencies, how should I allocate my effort over time?"

We believe it is both transparent and statistically correct."
