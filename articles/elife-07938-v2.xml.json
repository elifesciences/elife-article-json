We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578, leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-messenger RNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration. Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia."

We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578, leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-messenger RNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration. Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia."

Perhaps most importantly, RNA molecules act as messengers and carry genetic instructions during gene expression.

Previous research has linked the incorrect control of RBM15 with an increased risk of certain cancers, including megakaryocytic leukemia. However, it is not clear what role RNA-binding proteins such as RBM15 play during differentiation."

First, the experiments demonstrated that an enzyme called PRMT1 modifies RBM15. This enzyme adds a chemical mark called a methyl group at a specific site (an arginine amino acid) on the RNA-binding protein. Next, Zhang, Tran, Su et al. showed that the addition of this methyl group earmarks RBM15 for destruction. This means that an increase in PRMT1 levels reduces the amount of RBM15 in cells, while decreases in PRMT1 have the opposite effect."

An excess of PRMT1 enzyme leads to a lack of this RNA-binding protein. This in turn interferes with the differentiation process, and can contribute to the development of cancers such as megakaryocytic leukemia. Future work will therefore explore whether targeting PRMT1 with drugs could represent an effective treatment for these kinds of cancers."

RBM15 is essential for the development of multiple tissues in mouse knockout models, in particular, for the maintenance of the homeostasis of long-term hematopoietic stem cells and for megakaryocyte (MK) and B cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Niu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Raffel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Xiao et al., 2015</a>).

Reducing RBM15 protein concentration by PRMT1-mediated methylation favors the production of the alternatively spliced isoforms: RUNX1a, GATA1s and c-MPL-exon9-, a truncated c-MPL isoform. We also found that RBM15 promotes MK maturation in human primary cells. Therefore, PRMT1-RBM15 pathway fine-tunes cell differentiation via controlling the RBM15 protein concentration."

Therefore, we concluded that PRMT1 enzymatic activity is responsible for the methylation of RBM15 at R578. RBM15 might be methylated by other PRMTs and at other sites since some methylation signals, especially the monomethylation signals, are present despite PRMT1 knock-down or inhibition and in the R578K mutant. Nevertheless, the PRMT1-dependent R578 methylation forms the majority of dimethylated species."

Furthermore, CNOT4, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, has been shown to be an E3 ligase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albert et al., 2002</a>). To examine whether CNOT4 might be responsible for ubiquitylation of RBM15, we co-expressed CNOT4 with RBM15 in 293T cells. Strikingly, when RBM15 was co-expressed with PRMT1 and CNOT4, RBM15 was more severely ubiquitylated than RBM15 expressed with PRMT1 or CNOT4 alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We also detected the interaction between PRMT1 and RBM15 WT and mutant proteins in 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> lanes 3,4 and 7,8). Moreover, only the WT and not the mutant RBM15 interacted with HA-tagged CNOT4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> lane 3, 4). In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, we showed that the RBM15 R578K, which cannot be methylated by PRMT1, had significantly less ubiquitylated RBM15 protein. This data strongly suggest that methylation is required for subsequent ubiquitylation by the CNOT4 complex."

When MEG-01 cells were treated with DB75, CNOT4 knockdown did not further stabilize the RBM15 protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These results confirm that methylation is required for the subsequent degradation of the RBM15 protein. We used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology to knockout one allele of CNOT4 gene in 293T cells. We also found that removal of one allele of CNOT4 stabilized the endogenous RBM15 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B&amp;C</a>)."

Taken together, we demonstrated that the RBM15 protein stability is negatively regulated by PRMT1-mediated methylation at R578, and CNOT4 is an E3 ligase responsible for degrading the methylated RBM15. To understand further whether the methylation site on RBM15 is sufficient to bind to CNOT4 complex, we synthesized two RBM15 peptides covering the arginine methylation sites to pull-down CNOT4 from cell extract. The di-methylated peptide bound specifically to the CNOT4 protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), which is agreeable with the coimmunprecipitation data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> showing that CNOT4 only interacted with WT RBM15 proteins.

Upon PMA stimulation, we observed upregulation of the RBM15 protein within 12\u2009hr and simultaneous down-regulation of the PRMT1 V2 protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> left and middle panels). During the incubation period, neither the RBM15 mRNA level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right panel) nor the total PRMT1 protein level (mainly V1 isoform) changed more than 1.5-folds, nevertheless we found that RBM15 protein level was significantly increased. The methyl-RBM15 level reduced coinciding with the decrease of the isoform V2 protein (detected by V2-specific antibody). Thus we conclude the isoform V2 \u2013mediated methylation is one mechanism for upregulating RBM15 protein level, although we cannot rule out other possibilities such as enhanced protein translation. To assess RBM15 effects on MK differentiation, we ectopically expressed the WT and the R578K mutant proteins in MEG-01 cells by retroviruses.

Mass spectrometry analysis showed that RBM15 was associated with ASH2 and WTAP, two known RBM15-bound proteins (<a href=\"#bib35\">Horiuchi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lee and Skalnik, 2012</a>) as well as proteins involved in RNA splicing (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>), which is consistent with prior findings that RBM15 resides in nuclear splicing speckles (<a href=\"#bib35\">Horiuchi et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we reasoned that RBM15 might regulate alternative splicing. We performed RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP) under stringent wash conditions with an RBM15 antibody recognizing the N-terminal region, followed by real-time polychromase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect genes known to be important for MK differentiation. We detected the bindings of RUNX1, GATA1 and c-MPL mRNAs with RBM15, while we did not detect that of control GAPDH mRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Then we took an unbiased approach to identify global RBM15 target genes using RIP-seq. We have identified 1297 genes to which RBM15 binds directly (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Fifty-five percent of RBM15 binding sites are in intronic regions and 41% are in 3\u2019UTR regions, with the remainder in 5\u2019UTRs and CDS elements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis showed RBM15 regulates genes involved in differentiation and signal transduction via binding to intronic regions, whereas genes involved in RNA splicing and metabolic pathways were regulated via binding to 3\u2019UTRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C&amp;D</a>). We found that overexpression of PRMT1 V1 and V2 isoforms as well as reducing the expression level of RBM15 enhanced mitochondria biogenesis in MEG-01 cells (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which implies that PRMT1-RBM15 axis regulates metabolism.

The gene expression profile analysis showed that RBM15 knock-down alters metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathways as well as proteins involved in chromatin assembly (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). We then used two programs (<i>DEXSeq</i> and MISO) to detect the alterations of exon usage. <i>DEXSeq</i> detected 9704 differential exon usage events with P value lower than 0.05 and fold change higher than 1.2 fold. The MISO program detected 2027 differential exon usage events with Bayes factor higher than 2. RBM15 regulates differential exon usage in all eight categories in either directions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Significant exon usage changes of 156 genes in the RIP-seq group were detected by both programs (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 3</a>) including transcription factors <i>RUNX1, GATA1, STAT5A, TAF9, TAL1, LEF1</i> and <i>ZNF160</i> as well as chromatin remodeling factors such as <i>macroH2A, DEK, BRD9, TLE3, NCOR1</i> and <i>HDAC4. RUNX1, GATA1, STAT5A</i> and <i>TAL1(SCL)</i> are well-studied transcription factors for their roles in MK differentiation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Crispino, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Olthof et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tijssen et al., 2011</a>). Signal transduction genes important for hematopoiesis such as <i>RPTOR</i> and <i>CDC42</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kaushansky and Kaushansky, 2014</a>) were found on the list as well. Therefore, RBM15 protein level may affect hematopoiesis via multiple pathways. At a molecular level, RBM15 not only affects alternative RNA splicing such as <i>RUNX1, GATA1, TAL1, STAT5A, LEF1</i> but also affects UTR utilization (e.g. <i>TAL1</i>), mixed exon usage (e.g. <i>CDC42</i>) and intron retention (e.g. <i>macroH2A</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The MISO program was used to analyze how GATA1 is alternatively spliced. After knocking down RBM15, we found skipping of exon 2 on GATA1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) and validated our results by resolving GATA1 isoforms in an agarose gel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>)."

In Down syndrome leukemia, GATA1fl mRNA translates the GATA1s protein when mutations on GATA1fl mRNA create an alternative translation start site. Using isoform specific probes targeting to the exon junctions of GATA1s and GATA1fl to perform real-time PCR assays, we found that reducing RBM15 protein level favored the accumulation of GATA1s as the ratio of GATA1fl/GATA1s was reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> top panel). Conversely, overexpression of RBM15 reversed the ratio of GATA1fl/GATA1s in favor of GATA1fl. The RBM15 R578K protein, which is more stable, altered the ratio more than the WT RBM15. Furthermore, overexpression of V2 in MEG-01 cells reduced the ratio of GATA1fl to GATA1s, similar to the effect of RBM15 knockdown. When we used inducible cell lines to knockdown PRMT1, we observed a higher ratio of GATA1fl/GATA1s-like in cells overexpressing RBM15 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To further probe the importance of PRMT1 enzymatic activity in alternative splicing, we used PRMT1 inhibitor DB75 to treat MEG-01 cells, CMK cells and CMY cells, which all derived from AMKL leukemia patients. All three AMKL cell lines had higher GATA1fl/GATA1s ratio when treated with DB75 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Both isoforms of GATA1 can support MK differentiation, but only GATA1s supports unrestricted proliferation due to losing the interaction with E2F1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, fine-tuning the ratio between two different GATA1 isoforms regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of MK progenitors."

In RBM15 knock-down MEG-01 cells, the ratio between RUNX1a and RUNX1b,c switched in favor of RUNX1a. RUNX1a, which lacks the transactivation domain, acts as a dominant negative regulator to antagonize the function of RUNX1b,c (<a href=\"#bib73\">Ran et al., 2013a</a>). Increasing the amount of RUNX1a may interfere with the differentiation into mature MKs. Consistent with RBM15 knockdown data, we showed that overexpression of RBM15 as well as knockdown of PRMT1 tilted the isoform balance toward RUNX1b,c. In agreement with the PRMT1 knockdown data, overexpression of PRMT1 V2 switched the ratio in favor of RUNX1a (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> middle panel)."

Using reported primers (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2000</a>) to amplify cDNA from MEG-01 cells, we found an additional band on the PAGE gel, which was identified as an undescribed isoform lacking exon 9 (c-MPL-exon9-\u2013) through sequencing. The c-MPL-exon9\u2013 mRNA was predicted to yield a truncated protein (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus we designed specific primer spanning the junction between exon 8 and 10 to detect c-MPL-exon9\u2013 mRNA. We also used a pair of primers, the forward primer spanning exon 8 and 9 and the reverse primer annealing to exon 9, to detect the full-length MPL (i.e. c-MPL-exon 9+). The c-MPL-exon9-\u2013/c-MPL-exon9+ ratio was higher in favor of c-MPL-exon9- (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, bottom panel) when RBM15 protein level is reduced. Furthermore, when RBM15 or RBM15 R578K was overexpressed, the ratio was down in favor of c-MPL-exon9+. Given that c-MPL exon9+ is required for MK differentiation, the data further support for the positive role of RBM15 at MK maturation. All other isoforms with part of exon 9 or with both exon 9 and 10 missing were spliced in the same way by RBM15-PRMT1 pathway (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Furthermore, we confirmed the interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody for Flag-tagged RBM15 proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and with anti-RBM15 antibody (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). To further confirm that PRMT1 enzymatic activity is important for alternative RNA splicing, we inhibited PRMT1 activity with DB75 or shPRMT1. The interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 was subject to methylation regulation. One simple explanation is that RBM15 might recruit more SF3B1 because of more RBM15 and SF3B1 proteins available. It is also possible that methylation might be directly involved in RBM15 and SF3B1 interaction. Given that co-immunoprecipitation assays cannot distinguish the direct and indirect protein-\u2013protein interaction in a protein complex, interaction of RBM15 with SF3B1 only implies that RBM15 recruits the 3\u2019RNA splicing complex. Since SF3B1 is often mutated in leukemia cells, we sequenced the <i>SF3B1</i> gene in MEG-01 cells and confirmed that <i>SF3B1</i> was not mutated in this cell line.

We validated the RIP-seq data by real-time PCR with primer sets covering the GATA1 intron 1. Analysis of immunoprecipitated RNA associated with SF3B1 indicated that SF3B1 also preferentially bound to the same region that RBM15 bound to. Furthermore, with RBM15 knockdown, less SF3B1 was associated with GATA1 pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). On the other hand, GAPDH has similar level of SF3B1 binding to introns regardless of RBM15 expression level. Thus, RBM15 is responsible for recruiting SF3B1 to pre-mRNA molecules. In this case, RBM15 facilitates the inclusion of GATA1 exon 2. For c-MPL pre-mRNA, RBM15 preferentially bound to the intron 8 and 10 of the pre-mRNA molecules with two distinct peaks (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> left), while SF3B1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> right) did bind to regions between the two RBM15 bound peaks at higher level than other regions. When we used RBM15 knockdown MEG-01 cells to do SF3B1 RIP on c-MPL pre-mRNA, we found that SF3B1 binding was significantly reduced in RBM15 bound regions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> right). In this case, RBM15 functions as a splicing enhancer for inclusion of exons 9 and 10. In aggregate, these data show that RBM15 is responsible for recruiting SF3B1 containing branch point recognition complex to introns, and methylation controls the RBM15 dosage thereby controlling alternative RNA splicing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

                        "text": "We report here that PRMT1 V2 dimethylates RBM15 within the sequence (LYRDRDR(me2)DLY). Although the most common sequence for arginine methylation is arginine flanked by glycines, PRMT1 has been previously reported to methylate arginines in PGC1-\u03b1 and in RUNX1 flanked by other amino acids (<a href=\"#bib85\">Teyssier et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Recent proteomics work further proves that the methylation motif can be very diverse (<a href=\"#bib32\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). Since we can still detect a low level of mono-methylation signal after R578K mutation, we believe that the mono-methylation signals come from additional arginines methylated by PRMT1 or other arginine methyltransferases. Protein mono-methylation sites, in general, are redundant and prevalent and are catalyzed by multiple protein arginine methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dhar et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, these potential sites are not involved in methylation-mediated ubiquitylation. Another surprising result is that the V2 isoform, which contains additional amino acids on the N-terminus, primarily dimethylates RBM15 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Data from PMA-treated MEG-01 cells argue that the V2 isoform is more relevant to MK maturation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Although it has been demonstrated that V1 and V2 have different substrate specificities in vivo (<a href=\"#bib30\">Goulet et al., 2007</a>), RBM15 is the first V2-specific substrate identified. Of note, the V2 isoform only comprises less than 5% of total PRMT1 level, but V2 is mainly responsible for oncogenic activities in colon and breast cancers (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baldwin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Papadokostopoulou et al., 2009</a>). We cannot completely exclude a role for V1 in RBM15 methylation due to the inability to knockdown V1 specifically. Because developing inhibitors specific for PRMT1 V2 isoform will potentially alleviate off-target effects, which remain a major impediment for developing anti-PRMT1 inhibitors, our data offers new clues on how to achieve V2-specific inhibition. RBM15 is involved in chromosome translocation t(1;22), which produces the fusion product RBM15-MKL1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ma et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Mercher et al., 2001</a>). Whether the fusion protein, which retains R578, is methylated by PRMT1 is still an unanswered question."

Here we report that PRMT1 methylation triggers protein degradation via ubiquitylation by the E3 ligase CNOT4. CNOT4 is loosely associated with the other subunits of CCR4-NOT complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lau et al., 2009</a>). Apart from deadenylation activity of other CCR4-NOT complex, CNOT4 has been shown to ubiquitylate a histone demethylase Jhd2, which is responsible for erasing the histone H3K4 trimethylation marks in yeast (<a href=\"#bib59\">Mersman et al., 2009</a>). Given that RBM15 interacts with histone methyltransferases complexes to maintain histone H3K4 methylation level (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lee and Skalnik, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Xiao et al., 2015</a>), our data provide new insights into a potential crosstalk between methyltransferases and demethylases."

Given that CNOT4 is within a large CCR4-NOT complex with nine subunits, we have not determined which domain in CNOT4 or other subunits of CCR4-NOT complex recognizes the methylated RBM15. The peptide pull-down experiments strongly support that methylated region on RBM15 is sufficient for binding to CNOT4. Since we found that the RING domain on CNOT4 alone was not sufficient for binding to methylated RBM15 (data not shown), it is possible that more than one region on CNOT4 or other subunits in CCR4-NOT complex might interact with RBM15."

Normal MK differentiation can be divided into two phases: from hematopoietic stem cells to MK progenitor cells and from MK progenitor cells into mature polyploidy MK cells. Genes such as ARHGEF1 (ARHGEF1,2 are in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>) play opposite roles at different phases of MK differentiation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Smith et al., 2012</a>). The number of MEP progenitor cells increases, while the polypoidy of mature MKs decreases in <i>Rbm15</i> knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib65\">Niu et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with this, RBM15 knockdown in human primary cells like Rbm15 knockdown in mice produces low percentage of mature MKs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). PRMT1 promotes the production of MEP cells, but PRMT1 has to be turned off to generate mature, polyploid CD41<sup>+</sup>/CD61<sup>+</sup>CD42<sup>+</sup> MK cells. Because both PRMT1 and RBM15 are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, PRMT1-\u2013RBM15 might regulate differentiation in the same fashion in other tissues such as cardiac tissue, spleen and placenta where RBM15 has been shown to be essential for development (<a href=\"#bib71\">Raffel et al., 2009</a>)."

PRMT1 accounts for 4% gene mutations, amplifications and deletions in solid tumors (see www.cbioportal.org) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gao et al., 2013</a>). The relevance of PRMT1 inhibition in cancer therapies is summarized in reviews (<a href=\"#bib31\">Greenblatt and Nimer, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Yang and Bedford, 2013</a>). The roles of PRMT1 in supporting cancer cell proliferation are shown in AML1-ETO and MLL-EEN-initiated leukemia (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cheung et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Shia et al., 2012</a>). A PRMT1-mediated MK block may therefore be contributory to AMKL leukemogenesis. Apart from their functions in MK differentiation, RUNX1, GATA1 and c-MPL as well as other epigenetic factors such as BRD4 found in this study are dysregulated in a broad spectrum of hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baratta et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Crawford et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Crispino, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Harada et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Pikman et al., 2006</a>).

Our studies offer mechanisms on how RNA splicing is regulated during hematopoiesis. RBM15 directly recruits the SF3B1 branch point recognition complex to introns. <i>SF3B1</i> has been found to have mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome and in leukemia (<a href=\"#bib100\">Yoshida et al., 2011</a>). Given that SF3B1 knockout mouse cannot mimic defects seen in myelodysplastic syndromes (<a href=\"#bib92\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), mutations in <i>SF3B1</i> are likely gain-of-function mutations.

Abnormal expression of GATA1s and RUNX1a are associated with leukemia (<a href=\"#bib22\">Crispino, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). By controlling isoform ratios, HSCs fine-tune the lineage preference and the magnitude of lineage production during differentiation.

As a result, RBM15 enhances the inclusion of exon 2 to generate the GATA1fl mRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). RBM15 facilitates the production of more full-length RUNX1b,c by skipping the exon that encodes RUNX1a. Knockdown RBM15 also facilitate the generation of RUNX1-exon6-<sup>\u2013</sup>. Based on our proteomic data, RBM15 binds to RNA binding proteins that are involved in RNA surveillance, transport and degradation (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). Consistently, we also detected association of RBM15 with matured mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In addition, RBM15 associates with transcriptional elongation factors such as Tho2 and CTR9 besides its role in transcription initiation by positively regulating histone H3K4 methylation (<a href=\"#bib97\">Xiao et al., 2015</a>). We speculate that RBM15 participates in regulating the whole lifecycle of a messenger RNA. This is reminiscent of the functions of CCR4-NOT complex (<a href=\"#bib60\">Miller and Reese, 2012</a>). RBM15 has been shown to be a part of RBM20-mediated RNA splicing network in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Maatz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Raffel et al., 2009</a>).

In BPPM, designated methyltransferases are engineered to process sulfonium-alkyl SAM analogues as alternative cofactors and thus transfer the distinct sulfonium alkyl handles to substrates (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Because the alkyl handles contain a terminal-alkyne for the azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (the click reaction), we can then couple the chemical moiety with a biotin-containing azide probe for amenable target enrichment and characterization. With the previously-identified Y39F-M48G PRMT1 mutant and the matched 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl SAM (Pob-SAM) as BPPM reagents (<a href=\"#bib95\">Wang et al., 2011</a>), RBM15 in the context of Meg-01 cells was readily labeled by the enzyme-\u2013cofactor pair, modified by a biotin-containing azide probe, and enriched by streptavidin beads (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

The immunofluorescent staining data from Horiuchi et al., 2013, as well as from our unpublished immunofluorescent staining data demonstrated that RBM15 colocalizes with splicing speckles, which implies that RBM15 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing or at least in some step along the mRNA maturation pathway. By clustering proteins found in mass spectrometry analysis, we showed that a large proportion of RBM15-associated proteins are involved in many steps of RNA processing. Given that RBM15 binds to intronic regions, we focused on SF3B1 which is a core general splicing factor interacting with introns. In addition, SF3B1 is often mutated in myeloid dysplasia syndrome a pre-leukemic disease often associated with defects in MK development. Moreover, since SF3B1 is a component of the U2 snRNP, which itself depends on previous recruitment of U2AF to the polypyrimidine stretch/3\u2019AG region in order to stably interact with the branch point, we reasoned that assessing SF3B1 binding should serve as a surrogate measure of constitutive splicing factor interactions with 3\u2019 splice sites. That being said, U2AF is mutated in hematological malignancies as well. Intriguingly mutations in U2AF and SF3B1 are often mutually exclusive from each other in hematological malignancies (Patnaik et al., 2013). Both U2AFand SF3B1 are within the A complex, but RBM15 might bind to U2AF in the E complex before interacting with the A complex. Further biochemistry experiments with a splicing minigene reporter and in vitro splicing assays would be required to dissect the precise molecular mechanism by which RBM15 regulates splicing, which we are definitely planning to pursue with our collaborators, but which we feel, falls beyond the scope of the current manuscript."

One of our co-author Dr. Glen Raffel has tried and failed to rescue MK differentiation using the RBM15 knockout cells by overexpressing MPL gene. The results were presented in the blood paper (Xiao et al., 2014). Given that multiple transcription factors genes essential for megakaryocyte differentiation such as <i>GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1, GFIB</i> and <i>FLI1</i> are affected and knockout of any one of these transcription factors will lead to MK differentiation defect, correcting splicing of one transcription factor may not be enough. Using oligonucleotides to correct RNA splicing defects has been used successfully for muscle diseases, and would be a very interesting and an important experiment to do with therapeutic potentials in acute megakaryocytic leukemia with chromosome translocation t(1;22) which produces RBM15-MKl1 fusion. To give definitive answer to this question needs to do more screening to narrow down which gene can rescue MK differentiation by cDNA overexpression first before designing oligos to correct splicing."

From our own data, we know that RUNX1 directly activates the transcription of RBM15 gene. Here in panel A, we knocked down RUNX1 by two different shRNAs in HEL cells. We detected the expression levels of RUNX1 and RBM15 were decreased in the RUNX1 knockdown cells by real time PCR assays. Furthermore, we detected that RUNX1 binds to RBM15 promoter specifically in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP), as controls RUNX1 did not bind to RBM15 promoter in HEL cells with RUNX1 knock down. These results were consistent with RUNX1 and RUNX1-ETO ChIP-seq data in literature (GSE24674, GSE42075, GSE46044, GSE43834). Thus, RUNX1-mediated rescue of MK differentiation in RBM15 knockdown cells is not due to the correction of RBM15-mediated RNA splicing but rather due to the activation of RBM15 gene expression by RUNX1. Increased expression of RBM15 by RUNX1-mediated transcriptional activation will further correct the alternative splicing of genes like GATA1 and TAL1 etc."
