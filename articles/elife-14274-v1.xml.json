Such measurements have advantages over standard biochemical experiments, which can only record average values measured over a large number of molecules, and traditional structural biology techniques that cannot gather dynamic information. However, a drawback of single-molecule techniques is that they typically involve measuring how just a few structural parameters \u2013 often only one, such as the end-to-end length of the molecule \u2013 vary over time. Thus, a growing trend in the field is to use hybrid instruments that combine different single-molecule techniques, and so allow more than one parameter to be observed simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ha, 2014</a>)."

Now, in eLife, Steven Block and co-workers from Stanford University \u2013 Van Duesterberg, Irena Fischer-Hwang, Christian Perez and Daniel Hogan \u2013 combine two single-molecule techniques to investigate the structural changes that occur in the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch as it unfolds and binds to TPP and other ligands (<a href=\"#bib2\">Duesterberg et al., 2015</a>)."

Duesterberg, Fischer-Hwang, Perez et al. used optical trapping to apply a pulling force to the ends of the molecule and to measure the overall end-to-end extension (\u0394<i>x</i>). Simultaneously, they used smFRET to measure the separation between fluorophores (green and red fuzzy circles) placed on L5 and P3. Mechanical unfolding and the state of ligand binding affect both secondary structures and tertiary interactions. Secondary structural changes, such as unzipping one or more helices (helix P1 in this example), cause a corresponding change in \u0394<i>x</i>. Changes in long-range tertiary structure, such as the two sensor arms docking with each other, does not affect \u0394<i>x</i>, but cause a corresponding change in FRET efficiency."

This technique has been used to monitor the mechanical unfolding of secondary structures in the TPP riboswitch, such as the various helixes that make up the aptamer (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anthony et al., 2012</a>). Depending on how the TPP molecule is bound to the riboswitch (it can be bound strongly, weakly or not at all), these secondary structures unfold at different values of pulling force, thus producing distinct force-extension curves. However, these curves are typically insensitive to long-range tertiary interactions, such as the interactions that occur between the L5 structural loop at the tip of one sensor arm and the P3 helix at the end of the other arm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

However, this variability is greater in the TPP-bound case. Duesterberg et al. hypothesize that the flexibility of the riboswitch\u2019s structure when weakly bound to TPP might be essential for proper docking of the helix arms and the subsequent transition of the aptamer to the strongly bound configuration."

However, this work by Duesterberg et al. represents the first example of combining the two in order to simultaneously report on secondary and tertiary structural changes during folding and ligand binding. Large-scale tertiary structural transitions are ubiquitous in biology. Applying similar approaches to the wide body of proteins and RNAs whose folding characteristics have been studied by force-extension curves alone will greatly enhance our understanding of the overall structural transitions essential for their biological functions."

For instance, FRET has recently been combined with patch clamping in order to correlate structural transitions in ion channels with the flow of ionic current (<a href=\"#bib7\">Sasmal and Lu, 2014</a>). Combining traditional single-molecule workhorses, as well as pairing single-molecule techniques with other recent advances in coarse-grained modeling and genomic techniques, will likely serve the critical need to increase the number of observable parameters available when studying molecules one at a time."
