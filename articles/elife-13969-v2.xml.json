Despite the fundamental mechanical origin of tactile information, primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (Vg) have often been described as encoding the kinematics (geometry) of object contact. Here we aimed to determine the extent to which Vg neurons encode the kinematics vs. mechanics of contact. We used models of whisker bending to quantify mechanical signals (forces and moments) at the whisker base while simultaneously monitoring whisker kinematics and recording single Vg units in both anesthetized rats and awake, body restrained rats. We employed a novel manual stimulation technique to deflect whiskers in a way that decouples kinematics from mechanics, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to show that Vg neurons more directly encode mechanical signals when the whisker is deflected in this decoupled stimulus space."

Despite the fundamental mechanical origin of tactile information, primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (Vg) have often been described as encoding the kinematics (geometry) of object contact. Here we aimed to determine the extent to which Vg neurons encode the kinematics vs. mechanics of contact. We used models of whisker bending to quantify mechanical signals (forces and moments) at the whisker base while simultaneously monitoring whisker kinematics and recording single Vg units in both anesthetized rats and awake, body restrained rats. We employed a novel manual stimulation technique to deflect whiskers in a way that decouples kinematics from mechanics, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to show that Vg neurons more directly encode mechanical signals when the whisker is deflected in this decoupled stimulus space."

Bush, Schroeder et al. therefore devised a method to deliver touch stimuli to the whiskers in a way that separates kinematic from mechanical information. Mathematical models were then developed to compare how well the neurons represent each type of information. The models showed that whisker sensory neurons generally encode mechanical signals more directly than kinematic ones."

Tactile signals are generated both during active whisker movement \u2013 when the rat brushes and taps its whiskers against objects \u2013 and during passive contact. Deformations of the vibrissae are transduced by mechanoreceptors in the follicle (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ebara et al., 2002</a>), and the resulting electrical signals are integrated by primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (Vg). From the Vg, signals are relayed to the brainstem trigeminal nuclei, thalamus, and primary somatosensory cortex. Neurons in the Vg are thus the 'gatekeepers' of tactile information for the vibrissal trigeminal system (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jones et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leiser and Moxon, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2007</a>)."

We recorded from single Vg neurons in both anesthetized and awake animals, extracted the kinematics of contact from high-speed video, and computed the mechanics of contact using a quasi-static model of whisker bending. We then used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to quantify Vg responses in terms of both sets of variables and investigate which description more accurately predicts Vg firing rate. We found that only when the input space is large and kinematics are decoupled from mechanics does mechanical information better predict firing activity for a majority of Vg neurons."

In the awake animal, capillaries at the level of the cavernous sinus could increase hydrostatic pressure and thereby the rigidity of the whisker-follicle junction (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rice, 1993</a>). In addition, the activation of muscles surrounding the whiskers could increase the rigidity of the follicle with respect to the mystacial pad. Either or both of these changes near the whisker base could alter the whisker\u2019s deformation in response to an applied force. Given that the follicle-whisker junction has been shown to be rigid in the anesthetized animal (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bagdasarian et al., 2013</a>), blood-based hydrostatic changes are unlikely to be responsible for differences in rigidity between awake and anesthetized states. Changes in muscle activation, however, are a potentially significant effect that remains to be fully investigated."

This line of evidence suggests that previous results describing the encoding of kinematic variables in the Vg correspond to scenarios characterized by strong correlations between kinematic and mechanical variables.

This type of simplified Linear-Nonlinear (LNL) model offers strong mathematical advantages; in the case of a GLM, a guarantee that the fitting function that determines the coefficients of the model is convex and has a unique solution easily reachable by gradient methods. However, these models do not allow for linear combinations or nonlinearities that could be specific to some regions in the space of inputs. As our experimental methods sample wider regions of input space, it seems reasonable to expect that a single linearized assumption over the full space followed by a single, global nonlinear transformation will prove to be too simplistic.

To do so they also adopted a Generalized Linear Model approach, as in Campagner et al. [NB \u2013 GLMs were used by the Petersen group in earlier work as well (Bale et al., 2013).] The conclusions of Campagner et al. are very similar to the present manuscript. Primary sensory neurons in the whisker system (of awake animals) encode primarily rotational forces, rather than whisker angle or speed. The Campagner study also includes a comparison of active vs. passive stimulation.

They have shown that the variables <i>F<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub></i> and <i>M</i> can be calculated if <i>\u03b8</i> and <i>r</i> are known, and vice versa. For that case, the information about the firing rates of Vg neurons from the mechanical variables should be equal to the information extracted from the kinematic variables. The whisker, however, emerges from the mystacial pad and the whisker base can move under the effect of contact forces. Therefore, kinematic variables do not determine the forces uniquely if the properties of the pad vary with time. Forces and moments that directly affect the mechanoreceptors are expected to predict the firing properties of Vg neurons better than kinematic variables."

Both laboratories show that torque is an essential variable in the coding of contact by primary sensory neurons. Hartmann and colleagues further show that the impulse and the radial location of touch are coded, an issue not considered by Petersen's group, albeit these play a lesser role in determining the spike response. Petersen's group shows that phase in the whisk cycle is encoded in the absence of touch, an issue not explored by Hartmann. Thus the two papers agree on the big issue, perhaps not in every detail, and otherwise offer complementary information on the potential coding of vibrissa contact."

In contrast, in the Campagner et al. anesthetized experiments, <i>\u03b8<sub>head</sub></i> and curvature are always strongly correlated because the whisker is trimmed (to 5 mm), angles of deflection are relatively small (10\u00b0), and the deflection is always applied at the same <i>\u03b8<sub>head</sub></i>.

This effect occurs because of basepoint translations, head movements, and changes in whisker orientation (concave forward or concave backward) during <i>\u03b8<sub>push</sub></i>. More specifically, when a concave-forward whisker protracts against a peg, the protraction will tend to pull the whisker out of the follicle; <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> is thus positive. When a concave-backwards whisker protracts against the peg, the protraction will tend to push the whisker into the follicle, so <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> is negative."

Our reexamination of this data brought to light a minor error in our calculation of geometric variables used across analyses. This error was identified and corrected, and all data were re-analyzed. This resulted in changes in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> to 6; notably, these corrections did not alter any of the findings reported in this manuscript or their significance."
