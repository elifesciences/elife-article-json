Here we show that NG2 cells perform linear integration of glutamatergic synaptic inputs and respond with increasing dendritic calcium elevations. Synaptic activity induces rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated by low-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels under strict inhibitory control of voltage-gated A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can be global and originate throughout the cell. However, voltage-gated channels are also found in thin dendrites which act as compartmentalized processing units and generate local calcium transients. Taken together, the activity-dependent control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by A-type channels and the global versus local signaling domains make intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in NG2 cells a prime signaling molecule to transform neurotransmitter release into activity-dependent myelination."
