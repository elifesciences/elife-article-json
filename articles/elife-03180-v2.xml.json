Despite this critical role, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation. To determine the role for CD28 after T cell priming, we generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after priming. We show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming."

Despite this critical role, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation. To determine the role for CD28 after T cell priming, we generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after priming. We show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming."

The binding of CD28 to its ligands, CD80/CD86, initiates a transcriptional program that enables effective T cell proliferation and differentiation. In the absence of CD28 signaling T cells fail to respond, and become anergic (<a href=\"#bib17\">Diehn et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Riley et al., 2002</a>). CD28 signaling is essential for multiple facets of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harding et al., 1992</a>), including proliferation, survival (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boise et al., 1995</a>), glucose metabolism (<a href=\"#bib20\">Frauwirth et al., 2002</a>), and migration (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marelli-Berg et al., 2007</a>). Consequently, CD28-deficient mice have reduced expansion of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and do not form T helper type 1 (Th1) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells after infection or immunization. Tfh cells provide growth and differentiation signals to germinal center B cells, enabling them to exit the germinal center as long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crotty, 2011</a>). Th1 cells are formed during a Type 1 immune response and facilitate the clearance of intracellular pathogens (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhu and Paul, 2010</a>). Impaired formation of Tfh and Th1 cells results in impaired cellular and humoral immunity to foreign antigens in CD28-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shahinian et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Green et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ferguson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">King et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mittrucker et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Walunas et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Walker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bertram et al., 2002</a>). From this extensive body of literature, it is clear that CD28 signaling plays an essential role in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming and the formation of effector T cell subsets, but this has made it difficult to determine whether CD28 signaling also contributes to the ongoing immune response, as downstream phenotypes may be due to defective initial activation of CD28-deficient T cells. The expression of CD28 and its ligands increases progressively after priming, raising the possibility that CD28 signaling is utilized during the effector phase of the immune response."

This is likely to be because the role for CD28 after T cell priming is difficult to determine experimentally. CD28-deficient helper T cells do not become activated, and thus cannot be used to evaluate the role for CD28 after T cell priming. Moreover, CD28 has two ligands, CD80 and CD86, which it shares with the inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Consequently, manipulating CD80/86 cannot be used to draw conclusions on the role of CD28 alone, as CTLA-4 ligation will also be affected. The role for CD28 on activated T cells is particularly pertinent as CD28 expression is lost on a proportion of activated T cells with age, in HIV infection, and in the number of immune disorders in primates (but not rodents) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Weng et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aberg, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Broux et al., 2012</a>), and the functional consequence of this loss of CD28 is unknown. In addition, the CD28 pathway is an area of considerable research interest as it can be manipulated by a number of therapeutics: blocking this pathway is being used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disease and to prevent transplant rejection (<a href=\"#bib45\">Salomon and Bluestone, 2001</a>). In contrast, engaging this pathway can expand anti-tumor T cells and regulatory T cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carreno et al., 2005</a>). Because of the considerable therapeutic potential of this pathway, understanding its biology is of direct clinical relevance."

These studies support the possibility for a role for CD28 in an ongoing immune response. However, attributing these phenotypes to a role for continued CD28 expression in established immune responses is not possible because CD28 signaling is blocked on all cells, and not only on previously activated T cells. To determine whether there is a role for CD28 signaling after T cell activation, we generated a strain of <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice where CD28 expression is lost after T cell priming. We show that the numbers of both Tfh and Th1 cells are reduced in <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice after influenza A virus infection, although, surprisingly, the requirement for CD28 on each cell type is distinct. Tfh differentiation requires CD28 ligation during interactions of primed T cells with B cells and fully differentiated Tfh cells require CD28 expression for their survival. By contrast, Th1 cells do not require CD28 for their maintenance, but do for their expansion following T cell activation. Furthermore, <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice are unable to clear <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> from their gastrointestinal tract following oral infection. This demonstrates that CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for intact effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses during infection."

A strain of mice that expresses cre-recombinase from the <i>Ox40</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Klinger et al., 2009</a>) was crossed with <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> mice. In these mice, we expect that cre-recombinase will be expressed after T cell priming, and CD28 signaling will be intact for initial T cell priming, then removed. To test this, we bred <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice with OT-II transgenic mice, which express a T cell receptor specific for peptide 323\u2013339 of chicken ovalbumin (OVA). We assessed whether CD28 was lost after T cell activation and if early CD28-dependent events, proliferation and production of the mitogenic cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harding et al., 1992</a>), occur in OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> cells. OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>+/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> control or OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> T cells labeled with cell trace violet were transferred into CD45.1 C57BL/6 mice, and immunized with OVA. In the absence of immunization, all cells expressed CD28, and did not divide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). 48 hr following immunization both OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>+/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> control and OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> T cells had undergone up to four cell divisions, as measured by dilution of cell trace violet, and around 30% of activated OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup>cells had lost CD28 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Both OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>+/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> control and OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> T cells produced IL-2, consistent with activation via CD28 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). Importantly, IL-2 was produced by <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> T cells irrespective of whether they have maintained (CD28<sup>+</sup>) or lost CD28 expression (CD28<sup>\u2212</sup>), suggesting that CD28<sup>\u2212</sup> cells have indeed been activated through CD28 signaling prior to induction of OX40cre (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). There was also equivalent induction of the Inducible T-cell COStimulator (ICOS), a molecule whose expression is dependent on CD28 signaling (<a href=\"#bib38\">McAdam et al., 2000</a>), and the T cell activation marker CD44 on OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>+/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> and OT-II <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>).

These data demonstrate that <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> T cells can be primed and subsequently divide, produce IL-2, and upregulate activation markers."

We observed that the percentage of Tfh cells that had lost CD28 expression decreased over time during the response to influenza (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), suggesting that Tfh maintenance is impaired by the loss of CD28. Consistent with this, there was an increase in the number of apoptotic Tfh cells 14 days after influenza infection in <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice compared with heterozygous controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and this was most pronounced in the cells that had lost CD28 expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). There was also an increase in proliferation of Tfh cells in <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), although this was equivalent in CD28<sup>+</sup> and CD28<sup>\u2212</sup> Tfh cells, suggesting a broader, perhaps compensatory increase in proliferation, rather than the one that can be specifically attributed to the loss of CD28. There was also a decrease in expression of two molecules downstream of CD28; the pro-survival molecule Bcl-<sub>XL</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and the costimulatory molecule ICOS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) in Tfh cells that had lost CD28. Expression of the activation marker CD44, on the other hand, was equivalent between these cell types (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) suggesting that activation is intact. We hypothesized that reduced expression of Bcl-<sub>XL</sub> or ICOS might contribute to the reduced population of Tfh cells in <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice. However, halving the amount of Bcl-<sub>XL</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>) or ICOS (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>) alone was not sufficient to cause increased Tfh cell death and reduced Tfh number during influenza A virus infection. Together, these data demonstrate that CD28 is required for the survival of the Tfh population and suggest that the loss of continued CD28 signaling affects the expression of multiple molecules in Tfh cells."

This occurs at a time in the response where B cells provide a second round of antigen presentation to Tfh-precursors, allowing for stabilization of Bcl-6 expression and full differentiation into Tfh cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumjohann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Choi et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that CD28:CD80/86 interactions are important for Tfh differentiation during early T:B interactions. We identified that CD28 is also required for maintenance of the Tfh population in established germinal centers, by preventing apoptosis of these cells. This result was somewhat surprising in light of the work of <a href=\"#bib54\">Walker et al. (2003)</a> who used a CTLA-4-Ig transgenic mouse to show that blocking both CTLA-4 and CD28 during an established GC increased the size of the response. This, taken together with our data and the report that CTLA-4-deficient mice form spontaneous GC (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wing and Sakaguchi, 2014</a>), suggests that CTLA-4 plays a more dominant role in suppressing the GC response than the role for CD28 in supporting the response via Tfh maintenance. Our results are consistent with those of <a href=\"#bib21\">Good-Jacobson et al. (2012)</a> who reported that mice lacking CD80 on B cells have fewer Tfh cells due to an increased frequency of apoptosis. However, because CD80 is a ligand for CD28, CTLA-4, and PD-L1, this study could not discriminate which binding partner mediated this effect (<a href=\"#bib27\">Keir et al., 2008</a>). Our study, together with this work from Good-Jacobson et al., suggests that interaction of CD28 with CD80 is important for maintaining the Tfh population, whereas CD86 appears to have a more dominant role in the formation of Tfh cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Salek-Ardakani et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that IL-21, a cytokine produced by Tfh cells, can induce CD86 upregulation on B cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attridge et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that Tfh cells can stimulate B cells to express ligands required for their own formation, and that the dialogue between Tfh and B cells is reciprocal, and may form a positive feedback loop that supports the germinal center response. Our data suggest that the role for CD80/86 in Tfh biology occurs through interactions of CD28, rather than CTLA-4. Together, this indicates that the interactions between CD28 and CD80 may be important for maintaining the Tfh population, and that the dominant role of CD86 in promoting Tfh formation is likely to be driven by interactions with CD28, rather than CTLA4."

The lack of Tbet<sup>+</sup> Treg and Tfr cells in <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice suggests that the germinal center and the Th1 response are not under the normal Treg-mediated control (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Linterman et al., 2011</a>), and this would likely result in a relative expansion of these cells. Mixed bone marrow chimera experiments, in which wild-type Tregs are present from control bone marrow show Tfh and Th1 from <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> are almost absent.

Both ageing and HIV infection are associated with impaired immune responses to foreign antigens (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cubas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Linterman, 2014</a>), and part of this might be due to an increasing proportion of CD28-negative CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that are not able to respond appropriately to foreign antigen. Furthermore, blocking the CD28 pathway is used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases and to prevent allograft rejection, conversely this pathway can be stimulated to increase T cell immunity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Salomon and Bluestone, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Scalapino and Daikh, 2008</a>). Our data reveal that CD28 is not only important for T cell activation, but that it also plays important roles in the ongoing immune response. Therapeutic targeting of CD28 would therefore be expected to effectively dampen established T cell responses as well as interfering with priming. This is especially important for the treatment of autoimmunity, where the initial priming event would have already occurred, and explains how CD28 intervention is effective at controlling ongoing autoimmune disease. Furthermore, our results suggest that the loss of CD28 on activated T cells with age, or during chronic immune stimulation, may reduce the number of T cells that are able to respond to an infection, thereby functionally restricting the immune response and resulting in relative immunodeficiency, as are well described in ageing and in HIV infection. Taken together, this illustrates that CD28 is a critical co-stimulatory molecule throughout the effector phase of the response to infection, which has significant implications for applied immunology."

Using this system they demonstrate that loss of CD28 has clear consequences for Tfh and Th1 function. Tfh displayed a need for CD28 signalling to progress from pre-Tfh to full Tfh, probably due to a loss of CD28 signalling via CD86 expressed by cognate B-cells, and a further requirement for CD28 to maintain the cells. Th1 cells on the other hand appear to require CD28 for their post-priming expansion but not their maintenance."

We have altered a paragraph in the Introduction to emphasise this. However, we feel that it remains relevant to discuss a potential role for CTLA-4 in the manuscript, particularly as CD28 and CTLA-4 have opposing roles in T cell biology and it is possible that blocking CD80/86 may mask effects of blocking CD28 signalling if CTLA-4 was to play a dominant role. For example, Walker L.S.K. et al (JI 2003) use an elegant CTLA-4 transgenic mouse to block CD80/86 after GC induction, resulting in a larger GC response which is the opposite of what we observe in our <i>Cd28</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> <i>Ox40</i><sup><i>cre/+</i></sup> mice in which CD28 alone is targeted. This is likely to be because in the absence of both CD28 and CTLA-4 ligation, the effects of loss of CTLA-4 are more prominent. This has been elaborated on in the Discussion section."
