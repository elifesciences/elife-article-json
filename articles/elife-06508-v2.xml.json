Perforin-2 is expressed constitutively in phagocytes and inducibly in parenchymal, tissue-forming cells. In vitro, Perforin-2 prevents the intracellular replication and proliferation of bacterial pathogens in these cells. Perforin-2 knockout mice are unable to control the systemic dissemination of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) or <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> and perish shortly after epicutaneous or orogastric infection respectively. In contrast, Perforin-2-sufficient littermates clear the infection. Perforin-2 is a transmembrane protein of cytosolic vesicles -derived from multiple organelles- that translocate to and fuse with bacterium containing vesicles. Subsequently, Perforin-2 polymerizes and forms large clusters of 100 \u00c5 pores in the bacterial surface with Perforin-2 cleavage products present in bacteria. Perforin-2 is also required for the bactericidal activity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and hydrolytic enzymes. Perforin-2 constitutes a novel and apparently essential bactericidal effector molecule of the innate immune system."

Perforin-2 is expressed constitutively in phagocytes and inducibly in parenchymal, tissue-forming cells. In vitro, Perforin-2 prevents the intracellular replication and proliferation of bacterial pathogens in these cells. Perforin-2 knockout mice are unable to control the systemic dissemination of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) or <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> and perish shortly after epicutaneous or orogastric infection respectively. In contrast, Perforin-2-sufficient littermates clear the infection. Perforin-2 is a transmembrane protein of cytosolic vesicles -derived from multiple organelles- that translocate to and fuse with bacterium containing vesicles. Subsequently, Perforin-2 polymerizes and forms large clusters of 100 \u00c5 pores in the bacterial surface with Perforin-2 cleavage products present in bacteria. Perforin-2 is also required for the bactericidal activity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and hydrolytic enzymes. Perforin-2 constitutes a novel and apparently essential bactericidal effector molecule of the innate immune system."

It is likely that immunity began to develop shortly after the emergence of Earth's first single-celled organisms and a remnant of that distant past still exists in our present day immune system in the form of Perforin-2. This ancient protein has been highly conserved throughout evolution from sea sponges to humans. Some studies have suggested that Perforin-2 may have an antimicrobial role in invertebrates (including clams, mussels, and snails) and fish. However, its mechanism of killing and its role in the mammalian immune systems has remained largely unknown."

McCormack et al. also showed that when Perforin-2 is produced at optimal levels, cells are able to combat otherwise lethal, drug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). This means that Perforin-2 provides a rapid self-defense mechanism for cells against bacterial invaders. The protein's dual role as a pore-forming protein and a supporter of other antibacterial molecules is unprecedented. In the future, these findings could inform the development of treatments that activate and optimize Perforin-2 production to target and eradicate bacterial infections."

(<a href=\"#bib61\">Stevanin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Uzzau et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krishnakumar et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Prior et al., 2009</a>). If ROS and NO activity is dependent upon Perforin-2 we hypothesized that bacterial ROS and NO defense mechanisms would be unnecessary in Perforin-2 knockout cells. Unlike other superoxide dismutases that protect bacteria from oxygen radicals produced intracellularly as a byproduct of cellular respiration, SodC1 is a periplasmic superoxide dismutase. In vivo, <i>sodC1</i> mutants are significantly attenuated relative to wild-type <i>S. typhimurium</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Groote et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krishnakumar et al., 2004</a>). Flavohemoglobin acts by either catalyzing an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent denitrosylase reaction converting NO to a nitrate ion or N<sub>2</sub>O, or an anoxic reductive reaction forming NO<sup>\u2212</sup>. As with SodC1, in vivo and in vitro studies substantiate the role of HmpA with significant attenuation observed with HmpA deficient bacteria (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stevanin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bang et al., 2006</a>). In the presence of Perforin-2, SodC1<i>-</i>deficient <i>S. typhimurium</i> were killed more efficiently than wild-type <i>S. typhimurium.</i> However, SodC1-deficient <i>S. typhimurium</i> replicate similar to wild-type <i>S. typhimurium</i> when Perforin-2 was absent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Similarly, <i>hmpA</i> mutants are more susceptible to killing by NO than wild-type bacteria, but only when Perforin-2 is present. In the absence of Perforin-2, Flavohemoglobin does not enhance the survival and replication of wild-type <i>S. typhimurium</i> relative to the <i>hmpA</i> mutant."

Moreover, all cell types analyzed (54 out of 54) are able to kill bacteria in an in vitro bactericidal assay when Perforin-2 is expressed. When infection occurs prior to Perforin-2 induction or when Perforin-2 is siRNA-ablated or genetically deficient using the above assay, bacteria were not killed by cells and consequently replicate. In contrast, cells that express Perforin-2 were bactericidal. These results suggest that Perforin-2 can be expressed ubiquitously to defend cells against bacterial invasion."

Although IFN induces hundreds of antimicrobial genes in addition to Perforin-2, silencing of Perforin-2 alone was sufficient to cause bacterial replication. Without exception, Perforin-2 expression and function were essential for killing a diverse array of intracellular pathogenic bacteria by parenchymal or phagocytic cells. Examples of bactericidal activity include human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC); human pancreatic cells (MIA-PaCa-2); human uroepithelial cells (UM-UC-9); murine ovarian epithelial cells (MOVCAR 5009); murine colon epithelial cells (CT26); and murine cardiac myoblasts (C2C12), respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>).

The cytoplasmic domain of Perforin-2 has a predicted trypsin cleavage site close to the N-terminus of its transmembrane domain which may be functionally important. We observed clusters of typical membrane pores of \u223c100 \u00c5 inner diameter in these membranes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) that were morphologically similar to poly-C9 and poly-Perforin-1 pores on bacterial and cell membranes (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schreiber et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Podack and Tschopp, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Podack and Dennert, 1983</a>). Pores were not observed on any membranes in the absence of trypsin treatment. These experiments suggest that Perforin-2, putatively via its MACPF domain, is able to form clusters of regular polymeric pores on membranes akin to C9 of complement and Perforin-1. Although our methodology facilitated visualization of poly Perforin-2 pores, we are not suggesting that Perforin-2 is typically activated by trypsin nor are we suggesting that eukaryotic membranes are typical targets of Perforin-2."

The physical proximity of the pore-forming MACPF domain of Perforin-2 to endocytosed bacteria suggested that bacteria killed inside the endosomes might also exhibit electron microscopic images typical for Perforin-2-lesions on bacterial surfaces/membranes. To test this hypothesis, we induced Perforin-2 expression in MEF overnight with IFN-\u03b3 and infected the following day with <i>M. smegmatis</i> or MRSA. Intracellular bacteria were then re-isolated from MEFs after 5 hr and bacterial surfaces were inspected by negative-staining electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013G</a>). Large patches of densely clustered pores of ca. 100 \u00c5 inner diameter are visualized on both MRSA and <i>M. smegmatis</i> surfaces with similar irregularities as those observed in complement lesions on <i>E. coli</i> surfaces (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schreiber et al., 1979</a>). MRSA bacterial surfaces are more hydrophilic and show more uniform negative staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>) when compared to <i>M. smegmatis</i> samples that appear washed out with lower detail and contrast. This observed difference is due to the high hydrophobicity of the mycobacterial surface that repels negative stain except where it accumulates in the pore (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Noda and Kanemasa, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stokes et al., 2004</a>). Pores are only visible after bacteria were isolated from cells expressing Perforin-2. Pores were not present on control bacteria or after isolation of bacteria from Perforin-2 deficient cells as determined by blinded quantification of the pore-like structures (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). There were significantly greater numbers of pore-like structures (two or more orders of magnitude) associated with bacteria isolated from Perforin-2 expressing cells compared to Perforin-2 deficient cells.

Since we have a panel of antibodies that recognize denatured Perforin-2, we reasoned that it is possible to prove or disprove the latter. To accomplish this, we utilized five antibodies raised against peptides from different regions of human Perforin-2 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Perforin-2\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transfected with either GFP or human Perforin-2-GFP plasmids and infected for 1 hr with a gram-negative bacteria (Enteropathogenic <i>E. coli,</i> EPEC) or gram-positive bacteria (MRSA). Of note these two species were chosen due to their common extracellular preference in order to improve the isolation of bacteria undergoing Perforin-2 mediated bacteriolysis following infection with eukaryotic cells. In order to determine eukaryotic cellular contamination following bacterial purification, non-infected cells were processed in parallel as a control. Bacterial isolation and enrichment was successful as all fractions and filtrates were below detection for contaminating mammalian membranes and cellular debris as determined by immunoblot with antibodies targeting murine clathrin, actin, and GFP (data not shown)."

Perforin-2 was not detected after these fractions were passed through 0.22 \u03bcM filters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Prior to filtration each sample was spiked with goat IgG to account for nonspecific loss of soluble proteins. Unlike Perforin-2, goat IgG was equally detected in both bacterial fractions and filtrates. This indicates that Perforin-2 was not present as a soluble protein nor associated with cellular debris or microvesicles. Rather, Perforin-2 was associated with particles larger than 0.22 microns, such as bacterial cells. This conclusion was supported by the detection of the EPEC transcription factor ADA in the bacterial fractions but not filtrates. Likewise, MRSA Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) was only detected in the unfiltered bacterial fractions."

Both MACPF domain antibodies also identified another band of ca. 37kD that is not detected with the Perforin-2 domain antibody, indicative of a MACPF domain fragment.

In this study we have characterized an additional effector, Perforin-2, present in professional phagocytes and barrier forming cells such as keratinocytes and mucosal epithelial cells. In the absence of Perforin-2, the ability of these cells to destroy bacteria is severely compromised (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). These findings suggest that Perforin-2 may act upstream of other antimicrobial effectors or that their potency is enhanced by Perforin-2."

Perforin-1 is stored in granules in NK and CTL that are exocytosed into the immunologic synapse, thereby exposing Perforin-1 to extracellular calcium ions that trigger Perforin-1 polymerization in target membranes. The components of the MAC of complement are secreted by the liver into blood to exert their antibacterial effects after binding of C3b to the bacterial surface which initiates the assembly of the pore-forming C5b-8-poly-C9 complex."

Owing to this innate intrinsic protection of kc, bacteria may be cleared by these barrier cells even before the influx and assistance of professional phagocytes. The lack of barrier protection by kc when Perforin-2 is deficient may explain why Perforin-2 knockout mice rapidly (within days; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) exhibit symptoms to epicutaneous infection with MRSA. Thereafter the combined absence of Perforin-2 in the barrier tissue and in professional phagocytes may overwhelm the host by enhancing the systemic dissemination of the bacteria (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and, ultimately, leading to multiple organ failure. The speed and severity of infections in Perforin-2 deficient animals, including sepsis and death following traditional non-lethal inocula of bacteria (<a href=\"#fig7 fig8\">Figures 7, 8</a>), may also be assisted by the seemingly ubiquitous expression and function of Perforin-2, either inducible or constitutive. We suggest that this ubiquitous mechanism provides heretofore unrealized defenses at all potential sites of infection including barrier cells, phagocytes, parenchyma, and possibly even stroma. Further studies are required to determine the relative contribution of Perforin-2 expressed in each of them."

It is constitutively expressed in macrophages (and at least in certain barrier cells like kc) but requires induction in parenchymal cells. Therefore we speculate that unactivated parenchymal cells offer invasive bacteria a window of opportunity for replication and further dissemination. A second issue is that some pathogens have evolved mechanisms to suppress Perforin-2 (see accompanying report by McCormack et al.). On the other hand, our data also shows that when Perforin-2 is expressed at optimal levels, highly pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be killed by Perforin-2. This leads us to speculate that supraphysiologic levels of Perforin-2 expression could be an approach to defeat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Vice versa, serious clinically relevant infections including antibiotic resistant strains of MRSA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), <i>S. typhimurium</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), and <i>M. avium</i> as well as <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) are all susceptible to Perforin-2, as demonstrated by greater bacterial pathogenesis in the absence of Perforin-2."

First, we isolated eukaryotic membranes from Perforin-2 overexpressing cells following limited trypsin digestion (to activate poly-Perforin-2 pore formation presumably by cleaving the cytoplasmic domain at a predicted trypsin-sensitive site) and observed 100 \u00c5 pores. The caveats of this approach entail its unphysiological setting especially the use of eukaryotic cell membranes that seem unlikely to compromise Perforin-2\u2032s natural target. However, the visualization of pores on bacterial surfaces (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) was dependent on the availability of Perforin-2 and the bacterial membranes contained Perforin-2-derived fragments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) that were only discernable following infection with Perforin-2 expressing cells. These results strongly imply that the antibacterial properties of Perforin-2 involve polymerization and pore-formation in bacteria. The detection of cleavage proteins suggests that Perforin-2 also could be cleaved physiologically at some point during the bacterial infection; however, the order of cleavage and pore-formation as well as the role of additional proteins requires further investigation."

Complement, Perforin, and Perforin-2 are all members of the MACPF super family of pore-forming proteins. Unlike these members, GNLY is a member of the saposin-like protein family. Further, recent manuscripts have demonstrated that while GNLY has anti-bacterial activity when combined with the activity of granzymes, it does not have great lytic activity on its own (requiring micromolar GNLY concentrations or extremely hypotonic or acidic buffers (Ernst, 2000; Stinger, 1998). Due to the above reasons, we do not believe that GNLY would easily mesh with our discussion which focuses on pore forming proteins."
