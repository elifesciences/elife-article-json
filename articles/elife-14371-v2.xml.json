NOVA proteins regulate at least 700 alternative splicing events in vivo, yet relatively little is known about the biologic consequences of NOVA action and in particular about functional differences between NOVA1 and NOVA2. Transcriptome-wide searches for isoform-specific functions, using NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq data from mouse cortex lacking either NOVA isoform, reveals that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing events of a series of axon guidance related genes during cortical development. Corresponding axonal pathfinding defects were specific to NOVA2 deficiency: <i>Nova2-/-</i> but not <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice had agenesis of the corpus callosum, and axonal outgrowth defects specific to ventral motoneuron axons and efferent innervation of the cochlea. Thus we have discovered that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing of a coordinate set of transcripts encoding key components in cortical, brainstem and spinal axon guidance/outgrowth pathways during neural differentiation, with severe functional consequences in vivo."

NOVA proteins regulate at least 700 alternative splicing events in vivo, yet relatively little is known about the biologic consequences of NOVA action and in particular about functional differences between NOVA1 and NOVA2. Transcriptome-wide searches for isoform-specific functions, using NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq data from mouse cortex lacking either NOVA isoform, reveals that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing events of a series of axon guidance related genes during cortical development. Corresponding axonal pathfinding defects were specific to NOVA2 deficiency: <i>Nova2-/-</i> but not <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice had agenesis of the corpus callosum, and axonal outgrowth defects specific to ventral motoneuron axons and efferent innervation of the cochlea. Thus we have discovered that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing of a coordinate set of transcripts encoding key components in cortical, brainstem and spinal axon guidance/outgrowth pathways during neural differentiation, with severe functional consequences in vivo."

These cues are sensed by the growth cone, a motile structure at the extending axon edge, and they control growth cone motility through directed cytoskeletal remodeling. Netrins, slits, semaphorins, and ephrins are the major classic guidance cues and elicit attractive or repulsive responses in growth cones via specific receptors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brose et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Drescher et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fan and Raper, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kapfhammer and Raper, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kidd et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Serafini et al., 1994</a>). An important aspect of axon guidance is the spatial and temporal control of response to the guidance cues. For example, the spinal cord commissural axon reaching the midline senses netrin-1, secreted from the floorplate as a chemoattractive cue; however, once it has crossed the floorplate, this cue becomes repulsive (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kidd et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tessier-Lavigne et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zou et al., 2000</a>). Furthermore, the spatiotemporally restricted expression of Robo3 alternative splicing isoforms in spinal cord commissure axons are essential for the switching of the growth cone response to the axon guidance cues (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2008</a>), indicating that spatiotemporally regulated protein isoform expression and diversity is crucial to establish proper neuronal networks."

NOVA1 and NOVA2 harbor three KH-type RNA binding domains, and in vitro RNA selection (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buckanovich and Darnell, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jensen et al., 2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Yang et al., 1998</a>) and X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lewis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Teplova et al., 2011</a>) demonstrate that NOVA1 and NOVA2 bind directly to RNA sequences harboring YCAY motifs. The development of RNA:RBP crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) (<a href=\"#bib74\">Ule et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">2005a</a>) followed by high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Licatalosi et al., 2008</a>) methods has enabled identification of genome-wide RBP:RNA interaction maps in vivo. The bioinformatic integration of HITS-CLIP binding data and functional outcome revealed by exon junction microarray and RNA-seq data sets led to the conclusion that NOVA regulates alternative splicing following the rule that the position of NOVA binding to pre-mRNA predicts its action to enhance or inhibit alternate exon inclusion (<a href=\"#bib49\">Licatalosi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Ule et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wu et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). These analyses revealed ~700 NOVA1/NOVA2 target alternate exons and allowed to predict the biological process regulated by NOVA1/NOVA2.

These findings derived from combining transcriptome-wide NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP with RNA-seq analysis in the cortex of mice lacking either <i>Nova1</i> or <i>Nova2. Nova2</i> deficiency results in some common phenotypes, such as severe growth retardation, as previously reported in <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jensen et al., 2000a</a>), as well as unique phenotypes, including agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) in <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice. Unexpectedly, given that motoneurons express both NOVA1 and NOVA2, a subset of motoneuron axons directed to the ventral diaphragm show outgrowth defects in <i>Nova2-/-</i> but not <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice. In addition, the efferent innervation to the cochlea which is derived during development from a ventral subpopulation of facial motoneurons, is normal in <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice, reduced in <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice, and completely stalled in the absence of both <i>Nova1</i> and <i>Nova2</i>, suggesting that alternative splicing regulator NOVA2 plays critical roles in axon pathfinding context in mammals and that NOVA1 may have a cooperative role in this process. Based on these observations from genome-wide and histological analyses of <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice, we conclude that NOVA2-mediated RNA regulation is essential for CNS development by regulating neural networks wiring."

We found three putative initiator ATG sequences upstream of the known <i>Nova2</i> start codon on the 5\u2019 UTR of the transcript. The mobility of SuperNOVA2 on electrophoresis was comparable with the protein product expressed from SuperNOVA2 plasmid containing full-length sequence of the 5\u2019 UTR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), confirming that SuperNOVA2 translation started from an upstream codon in the <i>Nova2</i> 5\u2019 UTR.

Thus NOVA1 has partially overlapping distributions with SuperNOVA2/NOVA2 (hereinafter we defined SuperNOVA2/NOVA2 as NOVA2), is upregulated by unknown means in the absence of <i>Nova2</i>, and may have partially redundant functions with NOVA2 in the cortex."

NOVA1 and NOVA2 CLIP reads were filtered and aligned to the mouse genome (mm9). A total of 2,318,553 unique NOVA2 CLIP tags were obtained from three biological replicates (483,446, 836,678, and 998,429 unique tags, respectively), with a total of 139,007 clusters from at least two or three biologic replicates (defined as biological complexity of two (BC2)). A total of 910,342 unique NOVA1 CLIP tags were obtained from three biological replicates (319,904, 292,709, and 297,729 unique tags, respectively), with a total of 54,546 clusters (BC2). To identify sequence features most commonly associated with either NOVA1-RNA or NOVA2-RNA interactions, 4 nucleotide (nt) long motifs were counted in BC2 NOVA1 and NOVA2 clusters and in a set of shuffled control sequences as a control. Each of the top five ranking tetramers in NOVA1 and NOVA2 clusters were the same (UCAU, CAUC, CAUU, UCAC, and UUCA) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and coincided with the previously identified YCAY NOVA binding motif. Enrichment of the YCAY motif around NOVA1 and NOVA2 clusters was comparable between NOVA1 and NOVA2 and greatly enriched within NOVA1 and NOVA2 CLIP clusters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting that NOVA1 and NOVA2 recognized the same YCAY RNA sequence. NOVA1 and NOVA2 CLIP tag positions on known NOVA regulated alternatively spliced exons (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>) were comparable (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>). For example, alternative splicing of <i>Agrn</i> minigene containing exon 31\u201334 were regulated by NOVA1 and NOVA2 in the same splicing direction, in this case mediating the inclusion of the exon (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that NOVA1 and NOVA2 have similar RNA interaction profiles on NOVA1/2 target alternative splicing sites and are capable of regulating the same alternative splicing events."

The NOVA2 expressed cell in the cortical plate of neocortex was ubiquitously distributed at comparable expression level, yet NOVA1 was expressed in the specified cell types. Taken together, the HITS-CLIP and immunohistochemical data suggest that NOVA1 and NOVA2 perform unique biological functions in different brain areas and cell types, and that in those few cortical neurons expressing NOVA1, NOVA2 might be expected to have some redundant activity, while the reciprocal may not so often be the case."

A total of 225,054,059 and 213,596,515 unique reads were obtained from three biological replicates of wild-type and <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice, respectively, and a total of 190,282,241 and 180,200,564 unique reads were obtained from three biological replicates of wild-type and <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice, respectively. These experiments showed that the abundance of 60 transcripts were significantly changed in <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice compared to only 2 transcripts which showed steady-state changes in <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice compared to wild-type littermates (FDR&lt;0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub>FC|&gt;=1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), consistent with lower levels of NOVA1 expression in cortex. More changes were seen in analyzing splicing-dependent changes, and this pattern of differential NOVA2 and NOVA1 effects was also seen. We integrated NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP data, RNA-seq data, and NOVA binding YCAY motifs to define 1991 NOVA2 and 58 NOVA1-mediated alternative splicing events in the mouse cortex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, there was no correlation between <i>delta</i> I (<i>\u0394</i>I) of wild-type versus <i>Nova1-/-</i> and wild-type versus <i>Nova2-/-</i> (R\u00a0=\u00a00.09) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Taken together, this data shows that <i>Nova1</i> and <i>Nova2</i> have different RNA regulatory networks in developing cortical neurons; while the quantitative differences likely relate to the greater and more unique cellular expression of NOVA2 relative to NOVA1 in cortex, they also support the suggestion that the two NOVA homologues may regulate unique biological processes."

The L1 positive axons detected in the deeper cortical layer in <i>Nova2-/-</i> appeared normal, in that they passed through similar cortical layers as did axons in wild-type mice. In contrast, separated axons passing through the upper L1 positive axonal pathway, which were Netrin-G1 (NTNG1) positive axons, were only seen in <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice and were passed along a subplate path enriched in NURR1 (a subplate marker), as revealed by L1/NTNG1 or L1/NURR1 double-immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These results indicate that only a portion of the L1 positive axonal path, which is NTNG1 positive, is specifically affected by the absence of <i>Nova2</i>.

Mice that lack both <i>Nova</i> family members fail to cluster AChR at neuromuscular junctions, including those of the diaphragm. Given the role for NOVA2 in axon guidance in the developing cortex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), we revisited the role of NOVA1 and NOVA2 on motoneuron axon guidance. The axons of peripheral motor neurons innervating the diaphragm muscle were visualized by immunostaining of neurofilaments at E18.5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) and at E14.5 and E16.5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) and the innervation percentage of muscle in each quadrant of diaphragm at E18.5 was quantified (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Although the motor innervation patterns and percentages of the dorsal diaphragm were normal in <i>Nova2-/-</i> and <i>Nova1/Nova2</i>-double knockout (dKO), those of the ventral diaphragm were severely abnormal with approximately 60\u201385% of the muscle uninnervated in either <i>Nova2-/-</i> and <i>Nova1/Nova2</i> dKO mice (p&lt;0.001). Similar abnormalities were observed in <i>Nova2-/-</i> and <i>Nova1/Nova2</i> dKO mice at E14.5 and E16.5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). These innervation defects were specific to <i>Nova2</i>-deficient mice, as defects in ventral diaphragmatic innervation were never observed in wild-type or <i>Nova1-/-</i> mice. We cannot rule out a role of NOVA1 in the axon guidance of a subset of motoneurons given the slight decrease in ventral innervation in the Nova1/2 double-KO compared to the <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice. Nevertheless, taken together, these data demonstrate that in addition to what was observed in CC axons, <i>Nova2</i> is also essential for phrenic nerve innervation of the ventral but not dorsal diaphragm."

                                "text": "The inner ear is innervated by two types of fibers, afferent innervation consisting of both vestibular and cochlear (spiral ganglion neurons; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mao et al., 2014</a>) and from efferent fibers derived from rhombomere 4 of the hindbrain (<a href=\"#bib68\">Simmons et al., 2011</a>). Efferents are guided by and extend along afferents to reach the sensory epithelia of the ear arriving at approximately the same time (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fritzsch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ma et al., 2000</a>). Efferents are a unique population of ventral brainstem neurons derived from facial motoneurons that project to the inner ear in contrast to facial muscle fibers or glands (<a href=\"#bib39\">Karis et al. 2001</a>). Some transcription factors have been hypothesized to be relevant for guiding inner ear efferents (<a href=\"#bib18\">Duncan and Fritzsch, 2013</a>), however, essentially nothing is known about how these neurons diverge from facial motoneurons to selectively reach the ear to innervate hair cells and afferent processes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Simmons et al., 2011</a>). Dye tracing analysis comparing with control mice at E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,A\u2019</a>) showed that <i>Nova2</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,C\u2019</a>) but not <i>Nova1</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,B\u2019</a>) was essential for proper progression of efferent growth along afferents. Moreover, although efferent neurons expressed both NOVA1 (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013J</a>) and NOVA2 (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>), <i>Nova1</i> by itself was not capable of maintaining the function. In the absence of both <i>Nova1/Nova2,</i> the efferents stalled when they reached vestibular ganglion neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D,D\u2019</a>) while afferent fibers that also expressed both NOVA1 and NOVA2 (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E, K</a>) reached the cochlea normally. Our data suggested that <i>Nova2</i> played a crucial role for efferent guidance relative to <i>Nova1,</i> but both cooperate for normal efferent fiber extension. Interestingly, vestibular efferent innervation which segregated from cochlear efferents at E14.5 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bruce et al., 1997</a>) was unaffected by the absence of <i>Nova1 or Nova2</i> alone (see <i>green</i> efferents reaching the posterior canal crista (PC) in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>) but was also completely stalled in <i>Nova1/Nova2</i> double knockouts (<i>green</i> label, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Postnatal <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice vestibular innervation was also normal (not shown)."

Dye tracing analysis showed that the loss of efferent innervation was frequency specific; it was almost completely lost in the base of the <i>Nova2-/-</i> cochlea and only partially lost towards the apex (compare <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2019 and C\u2019</a> ). A more detailed analysis was possible at E18.5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013L</a>), when the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent axons expand through the tunnel of <i>Corti</i>, prior to their reaching the outer hair cells (OHC) at P2 and establishing functional synapses at P7 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Simmons et al., 2011</a>). These axons stained strongly with the Thy-1, YFPJ line that also has high expression in motor neurons, demonstrating the motor origin of auditory efferents. Thy-1 positive axons reached the inner hair cells (IHC) at E18.5 in control (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,I</a>) and <i>Nova1-/-</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F,J</a>) mice but this innervation was reduced in the <i>Nova2-/-</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G,K</a>) mice, and this was especially evident in the base (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K</a>). In the absence of both <i>Nova1/Nova2</i> there were no labeled axons reaching the cochlea (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H,L</a>), showing that efferents remain stalled. Imaging of efferent innervation at the onset of hearing (P14) showed a clear reduction in axons reaching IHC and specially OHC in the base when comparing <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C,D,G,H</a>) to controls (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B,E,F</a>).

In prior studies, integration of transcriptome-wide HITS-CLIP analysis, exon junction microarray data sets, and bioinformatics led to the identification of a large set of NOVA1/2 RNA functional interaction sites and major biological pathways which NOVA1/2 orchestrates in vivo (<a href=\"#bib49\">Licatalosi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Ule et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Ule and Darnell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). Given identical binding characteristics in shared transcripts (e.g. <i>Agrin</i>, others in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we infer the following: 1) specificity is determined primarily by biochemical interactions: kD of NOVA KH domains binding to accessible YCAY motifs; this might include differential levels of NOVA1/NOVA2 expression within a cell; 2) differential binding is a function of differences in cell expression and/or differences in cell biology (e.g. subcellular distribution of NOVA1 and NOVA2). Evidence for differences in cell expression is clear in the cortex. Differences in actions within cells such as motoneurons that express both NOVA1 and NOVA2 isoforms could arise from different levels of NOVA1 and NOVA2 within the neurons, or due to differential localization of NOVA1 and NOVA2 within the motoneuron, as suggested by the differences in CLIP binding (intron versus 3\u2019 UTR) of the two proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The development of single cell-type CLIP would be able to address this issue. Prior genomic and biochemical studies have found no actions that were unique to either NOVA1 or NOVA2 paralogues. The present study identifies NOVA2 as playing a unique role in axonal pathfinding in embryonic development by combining histological analysis with genome wide NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq analysis in <i>Nova1-/-</i> and <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice. These data build upon previously identified roles for NOVA1 and NOVA2 in early development as modifiers of neuronal migration in late-generated cortical neurons and Purkinje neurons through control of splicing of <i>Dab1</i> exon 7b/7c (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yano et al., 2010</a>), for <i>Nova1/Nova2</i> as essential factors for AChR clustering at the NMJ through the regulation of <i>Agrin</i> Z exons (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ruggiu et al., 2009</a>), and for <i>Nova2</i> in the induction of long term potentiation of slow inhibitory, but not excitatory, post synaptic potential currents after coincidence detection in CA1 hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huang et al., 2005</a>). The current study provides the first evidence that the formation of corpus callosum in brain, proper innervation of ventral diaphragm, and efferent innervation to the cochlea at developing embryonic stage all require specific actions mediated by NOVA2 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>)."

NOVA2 HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq analysis revealed that 11 NOVA2 target alternative splicing events on 9 genes (<i>Dcc, Robo2, Epha5, Slit2, Ank2, Dclk1, Enah, Cask, Ptprs</i>) intersected with the genes associated with mouse ACC phenotypes and human ACC syndromes (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that the ACC phenotype in <i>Nova2</i>-/- mice may be caused by splicing dysregulation of multiple coordinately NOVA2-regulated transcripts, consistent with previous observations that NOVA proteins regulate subsets of transcripts that mediate coordinate biologic functions (<a href=\"#bib76\">Ule et al., 2005b</a>).

The expression of DCC-long (long isoform of exon 17) isoform in cingulate cortex at E14.5 was not sufficient to form the commissure corpus callosum, indicating that the DCC-long isoform was not sufficient to rescue the ACC phenotype, and suggesting the possibility that the ACC phenotype in <i>Nova2</i>-/- mice either does not involve the DCC-long isoform or is caused by the dysregulation of multiple transcriptomes."

In the spinal cord, <i>Dcc</i> exon 17 is regulated by NOVA1/2 and required for the spinal commissural neuron development (see accompanying paper by Leggere et al.). Recent structure analysis of netrin-1/NEO1 and netrin-1/DCC-short (short isoform of exon 17) revealed that netrin-1/NEO1 form a 2:2 heterotetrameric netrin-1/NEO1 complex and netrin-1/DCC-short have a continuous netrin-1/DCC assembly (<a href=\"#bib84\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). Netrin-1 recognizes the fourth and fifth fibronectin type III domains (termed FN4 and FN5, respectively) of both NEO1 and DCC. Interestingly, the NOVA2-regulated <i>Dcc</i> exon 17 is located in the linker region between the FN4 and FN5 domains, and this splicing switch from DCC-short to DCC-long isoform is enough to support the architectural switch of netrin-1/DCC complex from the continuous assembly to the 2:2 assembly (<a href=\"#bib84\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that NOVA2-dependent splicing regulation results in architecturally distinct netrin-1/DCC complexes that elicit distinct downstream signaling. Changes in NOVA2-dependent regulation of <i>Dcc</i> exon 17 splicing during development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) further indicate that NOVA2-regulated splicing controls the ability of cortical and spinal neurons to utilize distinct netrin-1/DCC assemblies to respond to a variety of cellular demands."

The NEO1 extracellular region is a receptor for repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family molecules in addition to netrins. Upon ligand binding to the extracellular domain of NEO1 and DCC, their intracellular domains can activate multiple downstream signal transduction pathways, that modulate chemotropic axon guidance (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bradford et al., 2009</a>). The inclusion of <i>Neo1</i> exon 27 inserts a 53 amino acid sequence into the intracellular region. Inclusion is increased in E18.5 <i>Nova2-/-</i> cortex, suggesting that NOVA2-dependent alternative splicing of <i>Neo1</i> exon 27 regulates downstream signal transduction. It is well-established that DCC receptors mediate chemo-attraction upon netrin-1 binding, while the UNC5 receptor alone or heterodimerized with DCC elicits chemo-repulsive activity in neuronal tissues (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hong et al., 1999</a>). Interestingly, UNC5B interacts with NEO1 as a co-receptor for RGMa and associates with leukemia-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG, also termed as ARHGEF12) to mediate the signal transduction leading to growth cone collapse (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hata et al., 2009</a>). Although the abundance of <i>Arhgef12</i> RNA in cortex was comparable between E18.5 wild-type and <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 0.10, FDR = 0.78), <i>Arhgef12</i> exon 4 inclusion was significantly increased in <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting the possibility that NOVA2 modulates RGM signal transduction mediated by NEO1, UNC5b, and ARHGEF12 through coordinate regulation of alternative splicing of those RNAs."

The opposite possibility, that the defect evidenced by ABRs is responsible for the reduction in DPOAEs is unlikely since it has been reported that even with 80% loss of IHC (with intact OHC) the DPOAEs are only reduced by 10\u201320 dB SPL (<a href=\"#bib73\">Trautwein et al., 1996</a>). It has also been recently shown that afferent innervation to the OHC has no effect on DPOAEs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Froud et al., 2015</a>). Despite the reduction in ABRs which measure afferent pathway function, we found an increase in afferent innervation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013L</a>) quantified by synaptic ribbon count in <i>Nova2-/-</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013J</a>) although further study will be necessary to determine if this synapses are functional. Increase in afferent innervation could be a compensatory mechanism to decreased lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferents, which form synapses on IHC afferents, or a direct effect of the loss of <i>Nova2</i> expression in afferent neurons through an ephrin-dependent pathway (<a href=\"#bib15\">Defourny et al., 2013</a>).

                                "text": "ABRs were recorded from deeply anesthetized mice. The positive needle electrode was inserted subdermally at the vertex, the negative electrode was placed beneath the pinna of the left ear, and the ground electrode was located on the hind leg. ABRs were evoked by tone bursts ranging from 4\u201364 kHz and were produced by a closed-field electrostatic speaker connected to a driver (EC\u20111 and ED\u20111; Tucker-Davis Technologies). The 5 ms tone bursts were presented 33.3 times per second; their 0.5 ms onsets and offsets were tapered with a squared cosine function. The speaker\u2019s audio output was transmitted into the ear through a custom acoustic assembly. Sound-pressure levels were measured with a calibrated microphone and preamplifier connected to a conditioning amplifier (4939\u2011A\u2011011 and 2690\u2011A\u20110S1, Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r). The response was amplified x10,000 and bandpass filtered at 0.3\u20113 kHz (P55, Natus Neurology Inc.). The amplified response was then digitally sampled at 10 \u03bcs intervals with a data acquisition device (PCIe-6353, National Instruments) controlled by custom software (LabVIEW 2010, National Instruments). The responses to 1000 bursts were averaged at each intensity level to determine the threshold, defined as the lowest level at which a response peak was distinctly and reproducibly present. For each frequency, sound-pressure level was decreased from 80 dB SPL in 5 dB steps until threshold was reached. DPOAEs were then elicited with an acoustic coupler that allowed for recording ear-canal sound pressure levels via a probe tube concentrically situated within the common sound-delivery tube. The acoustic coupler consisted of two electrostatic speakers (EC\u20111, Tucker-Davis Technologies) to generate primary tones and a miniature microphone (EK\u201123103, Knowles) to measure ear-canal sound pressure (coupler from Mike Ravicz, EPL, Eye&amp;Ear; inf, Boston). The speakers and the microphone were both calibrated using the calibrated microphone described above. The 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub> \u2212 <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> distortion product was measured with <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> = 6\u201354 kHz, <i>f</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>f</i><sub>1</sub> = 1.2, and L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>2</sub> = 55\u201175 dB SPL. The acoustic signal was amplified by a preamplifier (ER\u201110B+, Etymotic Research) and the sound pressure measured in the ear canal was digitally sampled at 10 \u03bcs intervals with the data-acquisition system described above. Each frequency pair was presented for 1\u2009s. After fast Fourier transforms had been computed and averaged over ten consecutive traces, the amplitudes of the 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub> \u2212 <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> distortion product and the surrounding noise floor (+/- 100\u2009Hz of 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub> \u2212 <i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) for each frequency pair were determined, a procedure requiring 17\u2009s of data acquisition and processing time."

In the second part of the paper, genetic studies are presented demonstrating defects in axon guidance in different developmental contexts. The authors argue that these data support the conclusion as stated in their title \"NOVA-1 mediated RNA regulatory networks are required for axonal pathfinding during development\".

That said, at least some guidance receptors are targets for NOVA-2 regulation and this observation as well as observations in the companion paper provide support for a direct role in this process. It is important to note, however, that the GO analysis presented in the supplementary material <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a> indicates that other categories of genes are also significantly altered in NOVA-2 mutants, including genes involved protein modification, phosphorlyation, metabolism and chromatin modification. Thus, to what extent the observed phenotypes reflect alterations in axon guidance receptors per se, as opposed to proteins acting to regulate neuronal differentiation more generally and axon guidance only indirectly remains unclear.</i>"
