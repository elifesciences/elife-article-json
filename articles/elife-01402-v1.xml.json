Previously, using FRET-based microscopy, we observed heterogeneity in cellular c-di-GMP levels. In this study, we show that c-di-GMP heterogeneity in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is promoted by a specific phosphodiesterase partitioned after cell division. We found that subcellular localization and reduction of c-di-GMP levels by this phosphodiesterase is dependent on the histidine kinase component of the chemotaxis machinery, CheA, and its phosphorylation state. Therefore, individual cell heterogeneity in c-di-GMP concentrations is regulated by the activity and the asymmetrical inheritance of the chemotaxis organelle after cell division. c-di-GMP heterogeneity results in a diversity of motility behaviors. The generation of diverse intracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP by asymmetric partitioning is likely important to the success and survival of bacterial populations within the environment by allowing a variety of motility behaviors."

Previously, using FRET-based microscopy, we observed heterogeneity in cellular c-di-GMP levels. In this study, we show that c-di-GMP heterogeneity in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is promoted by a specific phosphodiesterase partitioned after cell division. We found that subcellular localization and reduction of c-di-GMP levels by this phosphodiesterase is dependent on the histidine kinase component of the chemotaxis machinery, CheA, and its phosphorylation state. Therefore, individual cell heterogeneity in c-di-GMP concentrations is regulated by the activity and the asymmetrical inheritance of the chemotaxis organelle after cell division. c-di-GMP heterogeneity results in a diversity of motility behaviors. The generation of diverse intracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP by asymmetric partitioning is likely important to the success and survival of bacterial populations within the environment by allowing a variety of motility behaviors."

Second messenger-based signaling, having a global impact on cellular physiology (<a href=\"#bib46\">Romling et al., 2013</a>), can be a mechanism by which environmental signals are rapidly translated into phenotypic heterogeneity. However, such mechanisms for generating phenotypic heterogeneity have yet to be described for many cell types, including bacteria. Nucleotide-based second messengers including cAMP and cyclic dinucleotides perform crucial functions within prokaryotes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Corrigan and Grundling, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kalia et al., 2013</a>). The bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP is synthesized and degraded by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to regulate diverse processes including cell-cycle progression, motility, and exopolysaccharide production (<a href=\"#bib46\">Romling et al., 2013</a>). Traditional bulk culture-based biochemical measurements cannot determine the variation of second messenger levels within populations. To measure c-di-GMP concentrations in individual cells, our laboratory developed a genetically encoded FRET-based biosensor using the <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium c-di-GMP binding protein YcgR (<a href=\"#bib12\">Christen et al., 2010</a>). FRET microscopy analysis using this biosensor revealed that the concentration of the second messenger c-di-GMP varies bimodally in populations of diverse bacterial species (<a href=\"#bib12\">Christen et al., 2010</a>)."

Therefore, bimodal distribution of c-di-GMP was not a surprising observation for <i>C. crescentus</i>.

Other species we examined, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium, and <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Christen et al., 2010</a>), all produce morphologically similar progeny.

Current knowledge suggests variation resulting from cell division could occur through several mechanisms including inherent cellular polarity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dworkin, 2009</a>). Cellular heterogeneity can also result from processes that are stochastic including mutations, unequal partitioning of less abundant proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elowitz et al., 2002</a>), or alterations in gene expression as a result of phase variation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henderson et al., 1999</a>)."

The daughter cell that does not inherit the flagellum following cell division rapidly synthesizes a new flagellum (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suzuki and Iino, 1980</a>). The daughter cell with the lower c-di-GMP concentration after cell division was previously demonstrated to inherit the single polar flagellum, suggesting this asymmetry is not a stochastic process (<a href=\"#bib12\">Christen et al., 2010</a>). In this work, we define the mechanism that generates <i>P. aeruginosa</i> c-di-GMP heterogeneity during the cell cycle. We have discovered that the chemotaxis machinery, the signal transducing system required for directed bacterial navigation, additionally activates a PDE to generate low c-di-GMP levels in flagellated cells. This PDE is localized to the flagellated cell pole by the chemotaxis machinery, indicating that asymmetry in organelle distribution during cell division results in the bimodal distribution of c-di-GMP. This heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels in turn controls flagellar-based motility behavior."

Use of an automated method to segment cells and analyze their fluorescence intensity allowed us to determine that 20% of wild type <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PA14 cells reproducibly exhibit c-di-GMP concentrations less than 200 nM during exponential growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,G</a>). <i>P. aeruginosa</i> encodes multiple isoforms of DGCs and PDEs. We hypothesized that the activity of one or more of these c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes is responsible for c-di-GMP heterogeneity and therefore screened a transposon mutant bank for mutants with altered levels of c-di-GMP. Out of a potential 38 enzyme homologs, we did not identify any single <i>dgc</i> genes required to maintain the population of cells with high c-di-GMP, suggesting more than one DGC is involved in synthesizing c-di-GMP during exponential growth. However, we identified one gene, PA5017, responsible for maintaining the population of cells with reduced c-di-GMP levels. Previous characterization has shown that the protein encoded by this gene is a PDE (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roy et al., 2012</a>).

Therefore, we constructed a functional Pch-mCherry fusion to simultaneously characterize the location of Pch and measure cellular c-di-GMP levels. Pch-mCherry exhibited polar localization in 50% of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Using time-lapse FRET imaging, we observed that polarly localized Pch-mCherry is partitioned to a single cell following cell division (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Furthermore, Pch-mCherry localizes to the pole of the incipient daughter cell that exhibits reduced cellular c-di-GMP following cell division (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We quantified the association between Pch-mCherry localization and c-di-GMP levels from single time point FRET microscopy images (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Cells were separated into two groups according to c-di-GMP levels and the polar intensity of Pch-mCherry was plotted for each group. Few cells were found to demonstrate high levels of c-di-GMP and to have Pch-mCherry at the cell pole. Overall, cells with c-di-GMP levels less than 200 nM exhibited high amounts of Pch-mCherry at the pole (the median polar intensity was increased by 63 \u00b1 23%) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These results indicate that c-di-GMP heterogeneity occurs mostly through differential polar localization and the subsequent asymmetric partitioning of Pch during cell division."

FlhF is a GTPase required for polar positioning of the flagellum, and an <i>flhF</i> deletion causes the flagellum to delocalize from the pole in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murray et al., 2006</a>). We observed that an <i>flhF</i> deletion also causes Pch-mCherry foci to delocalize from the pole (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C,D</a>). Nevertheless, biosensor activity showed that <i>flhF</i> mutant cells are able to maintain c-di-GMP heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, right panel). Thus, the flagellum, but not its polar positioning, is required for the maintenance of low c-di-GMP concentrations. These data suggested that Pch may bind to a flagellar component. However, an intact flagellar basal body rod-hook structure is additionally required for expression of the chemotaxis machinery (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dasgupta et al., 2003</a>), which is also polarly localized in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guvener et al., 2006</a>). We therefore systematically deleted <i>che</i> genes to determine whether the chemotaxis machinery is required for polar localization of Pch. Deletions of the methyl accepting chemoreceptor (MCP) methyltransferase, <i>cheR</i>, and chemotaxis machinery response regulators, <i>cheY</i> and <i>cheB,</i> did not have any effect on Pch-mCherry localization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, we discovered that a <i>cheA</i> null strain lacks Pch-mCherry localization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and also fails to demonstrate c-di-GMP heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). Moreover, mean cellular intensity of Pch-mCherry in a <i>cheA</i> mutant is similar to that of wild type and exceeds that of the <i>flhF</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that the chemotaxis machinery histidine kinase, CheA, is required for both polar localization and activity of Pch."

For many species of bacteria, counter clockwise rotation of the flagellum propels the cell forward in a smooth, straight trajectory, and clockwise rotation causes the cell to tumble and reorient (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berg and Brown, 1972</a>) or, in the case of the cell with a unipolar flagellum, to reverse and then reorient (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Qian et al., 2013</a>). The chemotaxis machinery modulates the bacterial trajectory by controlling the frequency of clockwise rotational events. Clockwise rotation is initiated by phosphorylated CheY binding to the flagellar rotor (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2006</a>) and MCPs control the rate of CheY phosphorylation by CheA (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vladimirov and Sourjik, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hazelbauer and Lai, 2010</a>). Constitutively active CheR methylates MCPs, of which <i>P. aeruginosa</i> possesses 26, whereas phosphorylated CheB demethylates MCPs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2006</a>). Methylation specifically decreases MCP affinity for its ligand (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</a>) and increases CheA kinase activity. MCP methylation functions to provide memory of the past few seconds of the cell\u2019s environment and render cells sensitive to changes relative to recent conditions. When cells are in a uniform environment, the resulting steady-state kinase activity initiates a low basal rate of cell reversals, conferring a random walk trajectory (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berg and Brown, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vladimirov and Sourjik, 2009</a>). As CheA is required to generate low c-di-GMP levels, we thought it possible that the steady-state activity of CheA also affects c-di-GMP heterogeneity."

We found that this phosphotransfer mutant conferred by the CheAH49N allele had no effect on Pch-mCherry localization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, c-di-GMP levels increased relative to wild type, as more than 90% of cells exhibited greater than 200 nM intracellular c-di-GMP, decreasing heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We obtained a similar result for the <i>cheR</i> deletion strain, which confirms the result from the CheA kinase mutant because CheR stimulates auto-kinase activity of CheA. The requirement of CheA histidine-49 for the maintenance of low c-di-GMP indicates that the chemotaxis apparatus controls c-di-GMP heterogeneity in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of CheA."

To determine whether Pch co-localizes with CheA, we constructed and imaged functional CheA-mTurquoise (CheA-mTq) and Pch-Yfp fusions. The majority (93 \u00b1 1%) of cells containing both CheA and Pch fusions had these proteins co-localized to the same pole (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Furthermore, the <i>flhF</i> deletion caused Pch-Yfp and CheA-mTq to delocalize from the pole but to still associate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). The identity of the pole the chemotaxis machinery assembles at was unknown; therefore, we simultaneously measured localization of CheA and FliM, a flagellar rotor protein. A functional CheA-mTq fusion localized to the same pole as a functional FliM-mKate2 fusion in 87 \u00b1 3% of cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). However, these two protein complexes were separated by a measurable distance as indicated by a peak in the histogram (median distance of 0.190 \u00b1 0.010 \u03bcm) in contrast to the undetectable spacing between Pch-Yfp or Pch-mCherry and CheA-mTq (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These co-localization studies indicate Pch is associated with the chemotaxis machinery but not with the flagellar apparatus present at the same pole. As previous observations have shown that a <i>cheA</i> mutant is still motile (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ferrandez et al., 2002</a>), and a <i>cheA</i> deletion does not affect FliM-mKate2 polar localization (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), these observations indicate that a <i>cheA</i> deletion does not affect flagellar assembly and that that Pch activation and localization is mostly dependent on CheA."

Cell motility was subsequently monitored in the same growth medium, but with the addition of viscous 1% methyl cellulose to reduce swimming velocity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schneider and Doetsch, 1974</a>) and facilitate the capture of cell trajectories by video microscopy. To exclude other forms of motility that require surfaces, we imaged cells at a focal plane 50 microns above the coverslip. We implemented an automated method of cell tracking and processing to quantify motility in an un-biased and large-scale fashion. We quantified mean cell velocity and determined that the majority of \u0394<i>pch</i> cells were either amotile or traveled at a much lower velocity than wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Conversely, ectopically reducing c-di-GMP to levels lower than wild type, utilizing a PDE expressing strain, increased the population of cells with mean velocities between four and eight microns/s and decreased the population of amotile cells. These results indicate that the c-di-GMP levels in wild-type cells have a physiological role in modulating cell velocity, as both reducing and increasing c-di-GMP levels affects velocity."

In this environment, cells utilize the chemotaxis machinery to exhibit reverse movement, not in response to a chemical gradient, but due to the effect of steady-state kinase activity. Approximately 25% of the wild-type cells exhibited at least one reversal in direction for trajectories of 25 microns (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Reversals were increased in cells ectopically expressing a PDE as at least 60% of cells exhibited one or more reversals. In contrast, the small percentage of motile \u0394<i>pch</i> cells exhibited fewer reversals than wild type. Control strains, \u0394<i>cheY</i> and \u0394<i>cheB</i> gave the expected results in which more than 95% of \u0394<i>cheY</i> cells exhibited no reversals and more \u0394<i>cheB</i> cells relative to wild type exhibited increased reversals. These data indicate that c-di-GMP levels act to create heterogeneity not only in cell velocities but also in modulating chemotaxis machinery output. For organisms such as <i>E. coli</i>, the effect of c-di-GMP on reversals and velocity is mediated by the PilZ domain protein, YcgR that binds the flagellar rotor or stator upon forming a complex with cyclic di-GMP. We deleted the homolog of this gene in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, PA3353, and found this gene did not have a significant effect on either velocity or reversal rate, as both were similar to that of wild type. This result suggests, in the conditions used for the assay, that this PilZ domain protein does not mediate reduction of cell velocity or inhibition of flagellar motor reversals by c-di-GMP."

We identified the PDE activity of Pch as necessary for the maintenance of low c-di-GMP and for generating asymmetry in c-di-GMP levels following cell division. We also found that Pch is not sufficient to generate low c-di-GMP levels but additionally requires an intact flagellar apparatus as well as the chemotaxis machinery protein CheA for its localization and activity. Our results from imaging and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest Pch binds to CheA or a CheA-associated protein, targeting it to the pole. As CheA is part of the chemotaxis machinery and is normally localized to one cell pole, this localizes Pch to the pole of a single daughter cell following cell division. Together these events contribute to differential c-di-GMP levels in daughter cells following cell division."

Only CheW-like and response regulator receiver domains have been characterized to interact with CheA orthologs. Pch lacks such domains, and as receiver domains are typically phosphorylated by histidine kinases, it is unlikely Pch is phosphorylated by CheA. Pch possesses, in addition to an EAL domain that confers PDE activity, GAF, PAS, and PAC sensory input domains and a degenerate GGDEF domain. GGDEF domains confer DGC activity when functional, and have been shown to interact with receiver-like adaptor domains (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2004</a>). This interaction suggests that an unidentified receiver domain protein could serve as an adaptor mediating an association between the Pch GGDEF domain and CheA. As receiver domains are often phosphorylated by histidine kinases, this putative adaptor could also modulate the control of Pch activity in response to CheA phosphorylation. One of the multiple domains in Pch may also modulate additional, uncharacterized protein\u2013protein interactions. Evidence for additional interactions includes the observations that Pch-mCherry localization appears to be more diffuse in the <i>cheA</i> deletion than in the <i>fliF</i> deletion. FliF is required for assembly of a flagellar basal-body rod-hook structure that facilitates secretion of the FliA anti-sigma factor, FlgM (<a href=\"#bib30\">Karlinsey et al., 2000</a>). FlgM secretion enables FliA mediated expression of the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> flagellar regulon Class IV genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dasgupta et al., 2003</a>). Other, unidentified proteins within the FliA regulon, whose expression is abrogated in the <i>fliF</i> mutant, could therefore mediate the difference in Pch-mCherry subcellular localization observed between the <i>fliF</i> and <i>cheA</i> deletions. Such an interaction could facilitate the transport and localization of Pch to the chemotaxis machinery, or modulate its turnover in the cell. Interestingly, the Pch PDE has been shown to be activated by another molecule controlled by external signals, cAMP (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roy et al., 2012</a>). We observed that a minority of cells exhibited high c-di-GMP concentrations, yet showed polarly localized Pch (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In these cells, Pch could be lacking a specific form of allosteric activation. Consistent with this possibility, Pch has several putative sensory input domains that could bind additional, yet to be identified allosteric effectors."

In this study, we found that reducing cyclic di-GMP levels in the chemotaxis competent <i>P. aeruginosa</i> population enables increased cell velocities and reversals. Therefore, heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels within a population confers diversity in cell reversal rates and in cell velocities. Populations of motile <i>E. coli</i> cells have been noted to exhibit a variety of chemotaxis responses to chemical gradients (<a href=\"#bib32\">Koshland, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Spudich and Koshland, 1976</a>).

Identical adjustments were made for images of the same protein\u2013fluorophore fusions in all strain backgrounds. To adjust brightness in fluorescence images, we altered the parameters of a transfer function defined by the three parameters of an image\u2019s lookup table (LUT), the minimum, maximum, and gamma values. The maximum LUT value of these 16-bit images was chosen to be just greater than the 99th percentile of the pixel intensity distribution from the wild-type strain of a protein\u2013fluorophore set. A protein\u2013fluorophore fusion in the wild type background typically exhibited the greatest signal intensity. For Pch-mCherry, this resulted in a LUT range of 0\u201310,000. The timelapse image of Pch-mCherry was collected using an exposure time of 800 ms instead of 1 s and microscopy was performed near the end of the lamp\u2019s lifetime, meaning that the illumination was not comparable to that of the other images. Therefore, we set the LUT range from 0 to 4500, utilizing selection parameters mentioned above. For Pch-Yfp, the LUT range was 0\u20134000, and for CheA-mTurquoise, the LUT range was 0\u201312,000. For FliM-mKate2, the range was from 0 to 5500. All LUTs utilized a gamma value of 0.8."

It was necessary to use different contrast adjustments for this type of overlay because only a single color was used to represent fluorescence intensity and it was therefore more difficult to discern pixels with lower intensity. This is especially true for the strain backgrounds that result in a diffuse localization pattern, because the protein is effectively distributed to a much larger volume, reducing signal. The maximum LUT value was chosen such that the localization pattern of the strain with the most diffuse protein\u2013fluorophore could be visualized and was typically 60\u201370% of the maximum LUT value above.

(2012)</a>. Prior to analysis in Matlab, images for the measurement of biosensor activity were preprocessed in ImageJ. To correct sub-pixel registration defects both Cfp and Yfp images were aligned to the Fret image using the Plugin TurboReg (<a href=\"#bib57\">Thevenaz et al., 1998</a>) and background was subtracted using the rolling ball subtract background menu option, automated by a custom written Plugin. These were the only changes made to the raw fluorescence intensity images. In Matlab phase images were used for automated segmentation (<a href=\"#bib34\">LeRoux et al., 2012</a>). The segmentation defined the boundaries of individual cells used in all analyses of fluorescence intensities. The cells not expressing the biosensor (less than 5% of cells) were excluded from the analysis by removing those cells with Yfp average arbitrary fluorescence units of less than 1500. In this study, net Fret (nFret) is defined as the average Fret intensity minus the average Cfp intensity multiplied by the spectral bleedthrough coefficient for Cfp into the Fret channel. This was calculated for these exposure conditions for the cells expressing mCyPet alone to be 0.46. The original nFret equation subtracts bleedthrough from Yfp into the Fret channel as well (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xia and Liu, 2001</a>). Because imaging mYPet significantly increases photobleaching over time, our calculation of nFret does not include subtracting Yfp from the Fret signal. Polar intensity was defined as the area residing within either the end of the cell along the long axis within one fourth of the length of the cell. Polar localization is defined by a locus intensity score of greater than 14 where the locus must be within 7 pixels of the cell pole. Individual fluorescent foci were isolated using a watershed-based segmentation algorithm and fit using a Gaussian point-spread function. To ensure that only bright, localized foci were used in analysis, a score was assigned to each focus proportional to the ratio of the peak intensity value to the standard deviation of the fit function."

The remaining mutants, except for those in PA5017, exhibited a difference of less than 15% relative to wild type. The PA5017 transposon mutants exhibited a difference of greater than 60%.

For preparing bacterial cell lysates, bacteria containing either pMMB67EHGm-<i>pch</i>::VSV-G or the vector alone were grown in identical conditions to those used for microscopy studies with the following modifications: overnight cultures were resuspended in 50 ml of fresh LB broth, and the fusion protein expression was induced by using IPTG at 250 \u03bcM at 0.1 OD600 nm. The cultures were further grown until OD600 nm reached 0.5. Bacteria were spun down and resuspended in 1.5 ml TBS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), Dnase1 and lysozyme), sonicated, pelleted, and the cell lysate was collected for further studies. Protein levels of each lysate were normalized to have identical concentrations for the pull down assay. Monoclonal Anti VSV-G agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Catalog # A1970) were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and 20 \u03bcl of beads were incubated with 1 ml of cell lysates overnight at 4\u00b0C.

However, we disagree that contrast adjustment is not good practice when studying low copy number proteins in bacteria; in fact we found contrast adjustment was necessary to visualize any signal. The fact that an image requires contrast adjustment means that the average fluorescent signal is significantly less than the maximum intensity value for the image\u2019s bit depth. Furthermore, adjusting contrast does not mask significant fluorescent signals if the contrast adjustments are made to represent the range of intensities within an image. We carried out such efforts, as outlined in the Materials and methods section. Additionally, we would like to remind the reviewers that we imaged all protein-fluorophore fusions that are expressed under native control of the promoter and present in single copy, rather than protein-fluorophore fusions expressed off of a multi copy plasmid from an inducible promoter. We intentionally chose this methodology as an optimal means for visualizing protein localization, as it preserves the native stoichiometry between the protein-fluorophore fusion and any interacting partners. As expected, we have maintained the contrast adjustment across each set of individual protein-fluorophore fusions. Finally, these images were included to illustrate the differences in protein-fluorophore localization; however, we hope that the more extensive analysis entailing the automated quantitation of protein localization will also be persuasive in convincing the reviewers of the validity of our results."

Using these two pairs of fluorophores allows us to use the same pair of filters for both strains. Therefore, the error introduced by using the same pair of filters should be identical, and the calculated distance between fluorophore centroids can then be compared. In this instance, the diffraction limit does not apply because we are comparing the distance between centroids from two different fluorophores.
