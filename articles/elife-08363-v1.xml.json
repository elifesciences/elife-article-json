The fundamental question of whether human telomerase catalytic activity requires cooperation across two TERT subunits remains under debate. In this study, we describe new approaches of subunit labeling for single-molecule imaging, applied to determine the TERT content of complexes assembled in cells or cell extract. Surprisingly, telomerase reconstitutions yielded heterogeneous DNA-bound TERT monomer and dimer complexes in relative amounts that varied with assembly and purification method. Among the complexes, cellular holoenzyme and minimal recombinant enzyme monomeric for TERT had catalytic activity. Dimerization was suppressed by removing a TERT domain linker with atypical sequence bias, which did not inhibit cellular or minimal enzyme assembly or activity. Overall, this work defines human telomerase DNA binding and synthesis properties at single-molecule level and establishes conserved telomerase subunit architecture from single-celled organisms to humans."

The fundamental question of whether human telomerase catalytic activity requires cooperation across two TERT subunits remains under debate. In this study, we describe new approaches of subunit labeling for single-molecule imaging, applied to determine the TERT content of complexes assembled in cells or cell extract. Surprisingly, telomerase reconstitutions yielded heterogeneous DNA-bound TERT monomer and dimer complexes in relative amounts that varied with assembly and purification method. Among the complexes, cellular holoenzyme and minimal recombinant enzyme monomeric for TERT had catalytic activity. Dimerization was suppressed by removing a TERT domain linker with atypical sequence bias, which did not inhibit cellular or minimal enzyme assembly or activity. Overall, this work defines human telomerase DNA binding and synthesis properties at single-molecule level and establishes conserved telomerase subunit architecture from single-celled organisms to humans."

Eukaryotic cells control these reactions through the function of telomeres, typically consisting of telomeric repeat DNA bound by proteins that comprise the telosome, or in mammalian cells, shelterin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Palm and de Lange, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stewart et al., 2012</a>). Telomeric repeat tract maintenance depends on the specialized reverse transcriptase telomerase, which can extend a chromosome 3\u2032 end by processive addition of single-stranded repeats (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blackburn et al., 2006</a>). Insufficient telomere synthesis ultimately compromises telomere function and signals a halt to cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib40\">O'Sullivan and Karlseder, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Aubert, 2014</a>). This telomere-linked restriction of cellular renewal leads to failures of highly proliferative human tissues, with clinical manifestations including bone marrow failure, aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</a>)."

The unique repeat addition processivity of telomerase requires conserved domains in both TERT and hTR that distinguish telomerases from other polymerase families (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blackburn and Collins, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Podlevsky and Chen, 2012</a>). The TERT N-terminal (TEN) domain allows retention of single-stranded DNA during the template repositioning required for tandem repeat synthesis. TEN-domain-truncated TERT, designated \u2018TERT ring\u2019 based on <i>Tribolium</i> TERT structure (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gillis et al., 2008</a>), supports only single-repeat synthesis that can be complemented to high repeat addition processivity by the TEN domain as a separate polypeptide (<a href=\"#bib44\">Robart and Collins, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu and Collins, 2014a</a>). In addition to these and other catalytic activity requirements for TERT and hTR, a biologically functional human telomerase holoenzyme contains two sets of H/ACA proteins (dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, and GAR1) bound to hTR to direct RNP biogenesis and TCAB1 to redistribute the RNP from nucleoli to Cajal bodies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Egan and Collins, 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Podlevsky and Chen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</a>).

Consequently, biochemical investigations of human telomerase have been greatly facilitated by enzyme reconstitution. Enzyme reconstitution in cells exploits transiently introduced plasmids to overexpress TERT and the 451-nucleotide mature hTR, which must be 3\u2032-processed from an appropriate precursor (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mitchell et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fu and Collins, 2003</a>). Telomerase complexes reconstituted in cells have a diversity of substoichiometric-associated factors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Egan and Collins, 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nandakumar and Cech, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</a>). As an alternative reconstitution approach, a minimal-subunit catalytically active RNP can be assembled by expressing TERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) with in vitro transcribed full-length hTR (<a href=\"#bib53\">Weinrich et al., 1997</a>) or a half-sized RNA such as hTRmin used here (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wu and Collins, 2014a</a>), which lacks the two-hairpin H/ACA motif that assembles the holoenzyme subunits dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, GAR1, and TCAB1. Only two hTR domains are critical for telomerase catalytic activity: a domain containing the template and adjacent pseudoknot and a branched stem-junction domain containing stem-loop P6.1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mitchell and Collins, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). Importantly, human telomerase enzymes reconstituted in cells or in RRL can interact with the same length of single-stranded DNA, have similar specific activity, and have only minor differences in other enzyme properties such as repeat addition processivity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jurczyluk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zaug et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu and Collins, 2014a</a>)."

RNP affinity purification and structural studies indicate a single RNA and single TERT per biologically functional telomerase holoenzyme of single-celled eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Livengood et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Witkin and Collins, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cunningham and Collins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bajon et al., 2015</a>). This subunit stoichiometry is recapitulated by the minimal <i>Tetrahymena</i> telomerase RNP assembled in RRL (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bryan et al., 2003</a>). However, the subunit stoichiometry of an active human telomerase RNP is unresolved: some assays suggest TERT and hTR function as monomeric subunits, without dominant-negative inhibition of a wild-type (WT) subunit by co-expressed mutant subunit (<a href=\"#bib23\">Errington et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Egan and Collins, 2010</a>), while other assays suggest obligate co-dependence of active site function across TERT and hTR subunits (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wenz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sauerwald et al., 2013</a>). Size fractionation of human telomerase holoenzyme has been suggested to establish TERT dimerization based on molecular mass by gel filtration of \u223c600 kDa (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wenz et al., 2001</a>) or by glycerol gradient sedimentation of 550 kDa (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schnapp et al., 1998</a>) or 670 kDa (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen et al., 2007</a>) relative to protein standards, but similar fractionation would be predicted for a holoenzyme with a single TERT, single hTR, single TCAB1, and a complex of dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, and GAR1 bound to each of two H/ACA-motif hairpin stems (<a href=\"#bib21\">Egan and Collins, 2012a</a>). Analysis using single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy detected one TERT and one hTR per RRL-reconstituted minimal RNP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alves et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, cellular subunit overexpression, purification, and crosslinking yielded particles observed by electron microscopy that were proposed to be active dimeric TERT RNPs, based on detection of two bound single-stranded DNAs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sauerwald et al., 2013</a>). Unfortunately, all of the experiments above suffer from the caveat that individual complexes are inferred to have the activity measured only for a bulk population."

We therefore developed a single-molecule TERT-labeling strategy to determine the TERT subunit content of human telomerase RNPs assembled and purified using methods typical in previous studies. We exploited the preserved function of N-terminally tagged human TERT to introduce the acyl carrier protein (ACP) tag for covalent labeling by prosthetic group transfer from derivatives of Coenzyme A (CoA). ACP and ACP-based tags are well suited to the applications developed here because they are small, monomeric, and expose the conjugated prosthetic group as a conformationally dynamic extension from the protein surface (<a href=\"#bib12\">Byers and Gong, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chan and Vogel, 2010</a>). We applied previously developed tag labeling methods (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>) to investigate the TERT content of individual complexes from purifications of cellular telomerase holoenzyme reconstituted by assembly in human 293T cells and minimal recombinant RNP reconstituted by assembly in RRL. Surprisingly, different affinity purifications yielded different mixtures of complexes monomeric or variously multimeric for TERT. TERT complexes were also heterogeneous in catalytic activity and DNA-binding properties. Complexes with TERT monomer supported DNA synthesis. Apparently non-productive TERT self-association occurred through a low-complexity region of the protein dispensable for RNP catalytic activity. Overall, these studies support the function of human telomerase holoenzyme and minimal recombinant RNPs with a single subunit of TERT and demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved telomerase subunit architecture."

Therefore, we fused the human TERT N-terminus to a triple FLAG peptide and either the ACP or MCP tag (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right). To assemble telomerase holoenzyme, TERT was overexpressed in 293T cells along with full-length hTR overexpressed using the U3 small nucleolar RNA promoter (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fu and Collins, 2003</a>). To reconstitute catalytically active minimal RNP, TERT was expressed in RRL pre-supplemented with vast molar excess of purified recombinant hTRmin (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wu and Collins, 2014a</a>). TERT complexes from each reconstitution method were enriched by each of two purification approaches: TERT binding to FLAG antibody resin followed by peptide elution (F purification) or RNA template base-pairing to a resin-immobilized 2\u2032O-methyl RNA (2\u2032OMe) oligonucleotide followed by displacement oligonucleotide elution (O purification; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panels A, B; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schnapp et al., 1998</a>).

To investigate the amounts of tagged TERT vs active RNP, we compared the levels of TERT protein and enzyme activity across the four combinations of reconstitution and purification, subsequently designated 293T-F, 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,F</a>). TERT was detected by an antibody raised against its C-terminal region (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel D). Activity was quantified from reactions with dTTP, ddATP, and radiolabeled dGTP. O-purification by the hTR template enriched more telomerase activity relative to TERT than did F-purification (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), as would be expected based on template hybridization vs antibody binding to TERT. Comparison between the pair of 293T or RRL purifications suggests that most of the TERT in 293T-F and RRL-F was not assembled as telomerase RNP. This was anticipated for the 293T-F purification, because cellular expression of hTR is limited by inefficient co-transcriptional H/ACA RNP assembly (<a href=\"#bib19\">Darzacq et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Egan and Collins, 2012b</a>). However, RRL reconstitution exploits the use of pre-transcribed hTR added at very high final concentration relative to TERT. Nonetheless, even optimized RRL expression produced hTR-free TERT enriched by F-purification."

Fields of individual complexes were imaged to detect both dyes, and images were scored for the fraction of Cy5-labeled ACP-TERT that co-localized a Cy3-labeled MCP-TERT. In the second TERT subunit counting method (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, left), we assembled telomerase complexes containing only MCP-TERT and labeled using SFP synthase and CoA-Cy5. Fields of individual complexes were imaged, and each Cy5 \u2018spot\u2019 in the flow cell was analyzed for the number of dye photobleaching steps that occurred before the spot vanished. In the parallel approaches, the fraction of two-color co-localized spots and the number of photobleaching steps are both readily related to the sample fractional content of TERT monomer and dimer considering all possible two-subunit combinations (see Materials and methods, Equations 1, 2). Fluorescently labeled TERT complexes were diluted to obtain 1\u20134 spots per 100 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> of the slide surface, and unbound protein was removed before imaging. To attain similar spot count per field across samples, labeled O-purification complexes required dilution relative to F-purification complexes isolated from an equal amount of the same extract, consistent with the greater yield of active RNP for O-purification (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

In the two-color co-localization assay, there was no statistically significant difference in TERT co-localization comparing DNA-bound 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O complexes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; 17\u201323%, p = 0.58). In contrast, 293T-F complexes had much more TERT co-localization (46%, p = 0.0015). This distinction was consistent across a range of fluorescent spot density per field and different 293T cell extracts used for purifications (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Results from the photobleaching method of TERT subunit counting also indicated no statistically significant difference in TERT subunit content across the population of DNA-bound complexes from 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; 19\u201327% bleaching in multiple steps, p = 0.33). In contrast, 293T-F complexes had much more multistep photobleaching (43%, p = 0.0066) including a substantial fraction of complexes that photobleached in three or even more than three steps (12%). We analyzed whether the results from the methods of subunit counting were consistent with each other, assuming a mixed population of TERT monomer and TERT dimer complexes (Materials and methods, Equation 3, and see below). There is excellent correlation of two-color co-localization to two-step photobleaching results for 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O but not 293T-F (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The abundance of 293T-F TERT complexes that photobleached in three or more steps is likely responsible for this discord, as this population of complexes was distinguished from TERT dimer complexes in the count of photobleaching steps but would be lumped together with TERT dimer complexes in the count of two-color co-localization. Together, the findings above reveal a surprising diversity of TERT subunit content in DNA-bound complexes. Furthermore, it is evident that this heterogeneity varies across the methods of telomerase reconstitution and purification (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

Therefore, in order to calculate the fraction of complexes with TERT monomer or TERT dimer for each method of reconstitution and purification, it was necessary to establish MCP-TERT-labeling efficiency. Labeling of 293T- and RRL-reconstituted, F-purified MCP-TERT complexes was to saturation within 30 min of a reaction with CoA-Cy3 or CoA-Cy5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), well within the standard 2-hr labeling protocol. Also, labeling efficiency was not dependent on the reconstitution and purification method (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We adapted a previously developed approach to quantify a minimum lower bound of labeling efficiency without assumptions from fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yin et al., 2005</a>). Using CoA-biotin as the synthase substrate results in covalent target protein biotinylation, which can be used as the basis for protein depletion by binding to streptavidin resin. The minimum lower bound of labeling efficiency can be calculated from the amount of protein remaining in the unbound fraction. First, we confirmed that CoA-biotin is used equivalently to CoA-fluorophore by measuring competition between CoA-biotin and CoA-Cy3. If RRL-reconstituted F-purified MCP-TERT was labeled to saturation with CoA-Cy3 and then labeled with CoA-biotin, no biotinylation of TERT could be detected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Similarly, labeling with CoA-biotin drastically reduced subsequent labeling with CoA-Cy3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Therefore, biotin labeling provides a surrogate for quantification of dye labeling efficiency."

The single-stranded T<sub>15</sub>(T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> DNA primer used to bind TERT complexes to the flow cell surface has extremely slow dissociation from the telomerase holoenzyme active site (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wallweber et al., 2003</a>).

Thus, Cy5-labeled MCP-TERT complexes with DNA bound in a functional active site would exhibit activity-dependent elution in buffer with dTTP + dATP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Inactive RNP and hTR-free TERT would remain bound as well as some active RNP not dissociated from product (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and also any 293T TERT bound to DNA indirectly through an associated shelterin complex. To control for activity-independent dissociation of TERT complexes from DNA, we performed parallel incubations without dTTP + dATP. We also assayed complexes reconstituted with the catalytic-dead TERT D868A (<a href=\"#bib53\">Weinrich et al., 1997</a>).

Many variations of reconstitution method had surprisingly little impact on the DNA-bound TERT monomer/dimer ratio, with one exception: elimination of the 125 amino acid linker between the TERT ring and TEN domain. Phylogenetic comparison revealed that this domain linker is particularly long in vertebrate TERTs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Podlevsky et al., 2008</a>), approximately 100 amino acids longer than in the ciliate and budding yeast TERTs that assemble only TERT monomer RNPs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Livengood et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bryan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Witkin and Collins, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cunningham and Collins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bajon et al., 2015</a>). Scanning six-residue substitutions of human TERT linker sequence did not uncover any significance of the region for telomerase catalytic activity or telomere maintenance (<a href=\"#bib4\">Armbruster et al., 2001</a>), but this approach did not alter the atypical amino acid composition of the linker region overall. Human TERT amino acids 201\u2013325 are 18% proline, 14% arginine, and 12% glycine. When subject to bioinformatical analysis for amino acid content (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harbi et al., 2011</a>), this region is identified as having high compositional bias. We also used SEG analysis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wootton and Federhen, 1993</a>) to search for low-complexity sequence within the human TERT linker. SEG analysis identified two segments of the linker, residues 213\u2013248 and 313\u2013323, as low complexity. Low-complexity regions can mediate diverse protein\u2013protein interactions including concentration-dependent self-association (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coletta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the TERT low-complexity <span class=\"underline\">p</span>roline/<span class=\"underline\">a</span>rginine/glycine-rich <span class=\"underline\">l</span>inker (termed the PAL) is a candidate region for mediating self-association of overexpressed TERT."

Previous assays that separated the TEN domain from the TERT ring retained the PAL on either the TEN domain or TERT ring (<a href=\"#bib44\">Robart and Collins, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu and Collins, 2014a</a>). We therefore removed TERT residues 201\u2013325 from the N-terminally F-tagged full-length protein, either by simply deleting the region (TERT-\u2206PAL; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) or replacing it with 5, 10, or 20 repeats of the sequence NAAIRS (TERT-5N, \u221210N, \u221220N; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), the six amino acid motif used previously in the non-disruptive scanning mutagenesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Armbruster et al., 2001</a>). The PAL-mutant TERT proteins expressed at levels similar to WT TERT in 293T cells and in RRL (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and binding of WT and PAL-mutant TERT complexes to FLAG antibody resin enriched similar amounts of catalytic activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Although direct fusion of the TEN domain to the TERT ring did not substantially affect the quantified overall activity it appeared to reduce the amount of the longest product DNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This change in product profile was rescued by NAAIRS repeat insertion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Since the number of radiolabeled dGTP nucleotides incorporated into a product DNA is proportional to length, products elongated by many repeats are detected with disproportionately high sensitivity relative to their actual abundance. To more accurately profile the repeat addition processivity of the reconstituted enzymes, we assayed telomerase activity using a primer radiolabeled at its 5\u2032 end rather than by extension with radiolabeled dNTPs. This also allowed the use of a non-limiting concentration of dGTP in the activity assay reaction (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A 5-min pulse of primer extension was followed by a chase period with excess unlabeled primer to eliminate telomerase reinitiation on released product DNA. Under these conditions, primer extension was highly processive for complexes of WT TERT, TERT-\u2206PAL, and TERT-20N assembled in 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Similar results were obtained with RRL-reconstituted enzymes (data not shown). We conclude that human TERT linker length and linker sequence have a very limited influence on the catalytic activity of reconstituted holoenzyme or minimal RNPs."

The WT TERT proteolysis products correspond to the TEN domain fused to lengths of PAL ending at the two computationally identified low-complexity regions. A simple hypothesis to explain these findings is that an hTR-bound full-length TERT can co-purify a TERT fragment dimerized through the PAL. This would account for the detection of some PAL-containing TEN domain in the 293T-O bulk purification, which unlike the bulk F-purification should not directly enrich TERT fragments compromised for hTR binding. Bulk purification fractions of RRL-reconstituted WT TERT lacked the TERT proteolysis products detected in the 293T bulk purifications (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and data not shown), suggesting that the TERT PAL may be a target of protease cleavage in cells. Furthermore, this proteolysis is specific for WT PAL sequence because no TEN domain fragments were observed the TERT-\u2206PAL and TERT-20N purifications (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). We note that although TERT proteolysis products are present in the 293T WT TERT bulk purifications, they may not be represented in the DNA-bound subset of TERT complexes assayed by single-molecule imaging."

The similar TERT monomer/dimer ratio observed for DNA-bound O-purified 293T vs RRL complexes suggests that TERT self-association accounts for the vast majority of dimer formation, since 293T and RRL TERT complexes differ in all components other than TERT (full-length hTR and H/ACA proteins vs hTRmin). TERT complexes with multistep photobleaching appeared to support little if any activity-dependent elution from DNA. It remains possible that active RNP dimers form under reconstitution conditions other than the standard protocols used in this work. Also, not all TERT monomer complexes had efficient activity-dependent elution: a larger fraction of 293T-O complexes than RRL-O complexes failed to elute with the opportunity for DNA synthesis, even when these complexes were converted to nearly homogeneous TERT monomer content by PAL deletion. We speculate that this difference arises from the greater heterogeneity of TERT structure, modification, and interaction partners produced by expression in cells. All of the findings above raise the need for caution in the interpretation of biochemical assays conducted using bulk purifications of TERT complexes.

Although the PAL mediates dimerization of overexpressed TERT, at lower endogenous TERT expression level, we propose that the PAL has other biological roles. To address this hypothesis, it will be important to determine PAL interaction partners using approaches that recapitulate a physiological TERT expression level. Also, it will be of interest to understand which features of the TERT PAL are functionally significant. Because the PAL is present in vertebrate but not ciliate or budding yeast TERTs, we predict that it has biological function(s) related to the assembly of the vertebrate telomerase holoenzyme as an H/ACA RNP."

Telomeric oligonucleotide (TTAGGGTTAGGG) 5\u2032-end labeled with Cy5 was incubated for 15 min. Excess DNA was washed away and imaging buffer was flowed into the sample chamber. Bound DNA was detected by collecting 30 frames at 100-ms time resolution with 633-nm excitation."

Resolution of this question is fundamental to full understanding of telomerase mechanism and how heterozygous TERT or telomerase RNA mutations cause human disease. The current manuscript circumvents the past problems associated with bulk population assays by taking very powerful and creative single molecule approaches to analyze both subunit composition and enzyme activity. They show unequivocally that telomerase is fully functional as a monomer: i.e. it shows the expected high affinity primer binding and activity with high repeat addition processivity. They also show that the approach used for enzyme production and purification has major effects on the fraction of enzyme in monomeric versus multimeric form."

We had hesitated to include quantification of photobleaching steps on a post-elution field of TERT complexes already imaged several times to quantify spot count per microscope field.
