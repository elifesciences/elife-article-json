                    "text": "Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) activates calcium-dependent chloride currents; neither the target, nor mechanism, is known. We demonstrate that secreted CLCA1 activates calcium-dependent chloride currents in HEK293T cells in a paracrine fashion, and endogenous TMEM16A/Anoctamin1 conducts the currents. Exposure to exogenous CLCA1 increases cell surface levels of TMEM16A and cellular binding experiments indicate CLCA1 engages TMEM16A on the surface of these cells. Altogether, our data suggest that CLCA1 stabilizes TMEM16A on the cell surface, thus increasing surface expression, which results in increased calcium-dependent chloride currents. Our results identify the first Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channel target of the CLCA family of proteins and establish CLCA1 as the first secreted direct modifier of TMEM16A activity, delineating a unique mechanism to increase currents. These results suggest cooperative roles for CLCA and TMEM16 proteins in influencing the physiology of multiple tissues, and the pathology of multiple diseases, including asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and certain cancers."

We demonstrate that secreted CLCA1 activates calcium-dependent chloride currents in HEK293T cells in a paracrine fashion, and endogenous TMEM16A/Anoctamin1 conducts the currents. Exposure to exogenous CLCA1 increases cell surface levels of TMEM16A and cellular binding experiments indicate CLCA1 engages TMEM16A on the surface of these cells. Altogether, our data suggest that CLCA1 stabilizes TMEM16A on the cell surface, thus increasing surface expression, which results in increased calcium-dependent chloride currents. Our results identify the first Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channel target of the CLCA family of proteins and establish CLCA1 as the first secreted direct modifier of TMEM16A activity, delineating a unique mechanism to increase currents. These results suggest cooperative roles for CLCA and TMEM16 proteins in influencing the physiology of multiple tissues, and the pathology of multiple diseases, including asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and certain cancers."

CLCA family members are highly expressed in mucosal epithelia where they play important roles in mucus homeostasis and related diseases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Patel et al., 2009</a>). For example, human CLCA1 plays a central role in interleukin (IL-) 13-induced mucus cell metaplasia, the main source of inflammatory mucus overproduction in chronic obstructive airway diseases, such as asthma and COPD (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alevy et al., 2012</a>). Both clinical and animal model studies suggest a compensatory role for CLCAs in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF): the fatal intestinal disease, meconium ileus, arising in CFTR-deficient mice is corrected by overexpression of mCLCA3 (an orthologue of human CLCA1) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Young et al., 2007</a>) and, correspondingly, mutations in <i>CLCA1</i> are found in a subset of CF patients with aggravated intestinal disease (<a href=\"#bib32\">van der Doef et al., 2010</a>). At the cellular level, overexpression of CLCA proteins leads to activation of calcium-dependent chloride currents (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gandhi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Britton et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Elble et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Greenwood et al., 2002</a>), and this functional observation had caused CLCAs to be initially misidentified as calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) themselves (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cunningham et al., 1995</a>). However, further bioinformatic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that CLCA proteins are secreted, soluble proteins and that they act to modulate CaCCs that are endogenous to mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gibson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hamann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yurtsever et al., 2012</a>). The molecular identity of these channels, the mechanism of CLCA activation, and their potential roles in CLCA-mediated diseases, remain unknown."

                        "text": "TMEM16A (also known as Anoctamin1/DOG1) was recently identified as the first genuine CaCC in mammals by three independent groups (<a href=\"#bib5\">Caputo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Schroeder et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). 10 members of the TMEM16/Anoctamin family have been identified (TMEM16A-K, or Ano1-10); these proteins, predicted to be transmembrane proteins with eight membrane-spanning helices, have been found to function predominantly as CaCCs (TMEM16A and B) or as phospholipid scramblases (TMEM16C, D, F, G, and J) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014</a>). TMEM16A, the best-characterized member of the family to date, is expressed in airway epithelia and smooth muscle, and its activity recapitulates some of the airway disease traits associated with CLCA1. Not only is TMEM16A expression significantly increased by IL-13 and IL-4 in primary cell models of chronic inflammatory airway disease (<a href=\"#bib5\">Caputo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alevy et al., 2012</a>), but TMEM16A overexpression is also linked to mucus cell metaplasia and airway hyperreactivity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Scudieri et al., 2012</a>). In addition, TMEM16A-specific inhibitors decrease mucus secretion and airway hyperreactivity in cellular models (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Although experiments with purified TMEM16A protein reconstituted in liposomes indicate that it can form a functional channel on its own (<a href=\"#bib29\">Terashima et al., 2013</a>), several cytosolic modulators and interaction partners, such as calmodulin, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), ezrin, radixin, and moesin, have been described (<a href=\"#bib30\">Tian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Perez-Cornejo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Pritchard et al., 2014</a>). However, no secreted regulators of TMEM16A activity have been identified as of yet. Here we report that secreted CLCA1 modulates TMEM16A-dependent calcium-activated chloride currents, and that this activation can occur in a paracrine fashion. Furthermore, we show that CLCA1 and TMEM16A co-localize and physically interact on the surface of mammalian cells, and that CLCA1 increases the level of TMEM16A protein at the cell surface, representing a novel mechanism of channel regulation by a secreted protein. We thus demonstrate a first downstream target of CLCA proteins and provide the first example of a secreted protein modulator of TMEM16A activity. These findings have significant implications for the roles of CLCA1 and TMEM16A proteins as cooperative partners, not only in the physiology and pathophysiology of the airways, but also in those of other tissues and organs."

Given that CLCA1 proteins are cleaved and secreted from these cells, we hypothesized that exogenous CLCA1 may activate I<sub>CaCC</sub>. In a first set of experiments to test this idea, GFP-expressing cells that had been co-cultured overnight with cells transfected with CLCA1-pHLsec plasmid (CLCA1) or with empty pHLsec vector (pHLsec) were tested for I<sub>CaCC</sub> by means of whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In the presence of 10 \u03bcM intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and physiological concentrations of extracellular Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, robust, slightly outward rectifying currents were activated in cells co-cultured with CLCA1-transfected cells, but only substantially smaller currents were detected in cells co-cultured with vector-transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). In a complementary experiment, whole-cell I<sub>CaCC</sub> were measured in untransfected cells that had been cultured in medium obtained from CLCA1- or from pHLsec-transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We observed activation of large currents in cells exposed to CLCA1-conditioned medium that had the same Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and voltage-dependence properties as those induced in cells co-cultured with CLCA1-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>, outward rectification of the CLCA1-activated current decreases at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. In addition, current reversal potential shifts positive upon lowering extracellular Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. These features are in agreement with the properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> conductance observed in CLCA1-expressing 293T cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hamann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yurtsever et al., 2012</a>), and consistent with those of CaCCs in native cells and heterologous expression systems (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jeong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yamazaki et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>).

Cells transfected with pHLsec vector alone did not display noticeable staining for either CLCA1 or TMEM16A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>), consistent with lack of endogenous expression of CLCA1 and low endogenous levels of TMEM16A in these cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kunzelmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Pritchard et al., 2014</a>). However, cells transfected with CLCA1 stained strongly both for CLCA1 and, surprisingly, for TMEM16A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013H</a>), suggesting that CLCA1 increases TMEM16A protein levels. Furthermore, signal for both proteins clearly overlapped with the membrane stain (WGA), consistent with a model in which CLCA1 and TMEM16A associate with and stabilize one another on the cell surface. Since secreted CLCA1 can activate TMEM16A-mediated I<sub>CaCC</sub> in a paracrine manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1\u20133</a>), we carried out similar imaging experiments to determine whether exogenously applied secreted CLCA1 also increased TMEM16A surface expression. Cells cultured in media from pHLsec-transfected cells again displayed no detectable staining for either CLCA1 or TMEM16A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013L</a>), but cells exposed to secreted CLCA1 displayed robust staining for TMEM16A. Signal for CLCA1 was also detected in a few cells, overlapping with TMEM16A and WGA staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M\u2013P</a>). Surprisingly, although TMEM16A surface levels increased after exposure to CLCA1, total TMEM16A in cells did not change (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

We previously demonstrated that CLCA1 is cut into two fragments by self-cleavage and that the N-terminal fragment is necessary and sufficient to activate CaCCs in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yurtsever et al., 2012</a>). Thus, for these assays we developed a CLCA1 cell-staining reagent composed of the N-terminal fragment of CLCA1 (N-CLCA1) containing a specific biotinylation motif on the C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Biotinylated N-CLCA1 was coupled to SA-PE (streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin) to produce a tetrameric fluorescent reagent with enhanced avidity toward its ligand. Cell-binding assays were carried out in the presence or absence of an anti-TMEM16A antibody raised against epitopes in the last extracellular loop and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The tetramerized N-CLCA1 displayed robust binding to intact HEK293T cells compared to background, and this binding was significantly reduced by pre-incubating the cells with the anti-TMEM16A antibody (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Two control antibodies, one raised against an intracellular epitope of TMEM16A and the other an isotype control, did not affect N-CLCA1 binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In order to validate that the biotinylation of N-CLCA1 did not adversely affect function, we carried out whole-cell patch clamp experiments where either purified N-CLCA1 or purified biotinylated N-CLCA1 was exogenously applied to HEK293T cells. We found that both of these proteins were able to robustly activate the observed currents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). These results indicate that N-CLCA1 engages TMEM16A on the surface of HEK293T cells, and suggests that the enhanced TMEM16A level is a consequence of stabilization by CLCA1."

However, a recent proteomics approach has identified a large number of endogenous proteins implicated in protein trafficking, surface expression, folding and stability that interact with TMEM16A, including SNAREs such as syntaxins and syntaxin-binding proteins, and the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) scaffolding complex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Perez-Cornejo et al., 2012</a>). Our data identify CLCA1 as the first secreted direct regulator of TMEM16A, and our findings suggest that CLCA1 may modulate TMEM16A channel activity by stabilizing it at the cell surface, much like the SNARE and ERM protein networks of the TMEM16A interactome."

We observe that CLCA1 increases TMEM16A surface expression without increasing expression of the protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). A model consistent with our data and the current literature is that CLCA1 engages and stabilizes dimeric TMEM16A on the surface of the cell. Previous studies have shown that TMEM16A can exist as a dimer (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fallah et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Sheridan et al., 2011</a>), dimerization being mediated by an intracellular region in the N-terminus of TMEM16A (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tien et al., 2013</a>). Mutations to this region abolish dimerization, prevent protein trafficking to the plasma membrane, and, consequently, ablate channel activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tien et al., 2013</a>). These observations indicate that dimerization regulates TMEM16A trafficking and channel activity. It is possible that TMEM16A dynamically shuttles between the cell surface and intracellular compartments. One possibility is that CLCA1 engages monomeric TMEM16A and drives dimerization; alternatively, CLCA1 may engage and stabilize dimeric TMEM16A on the cell surface, thereby preventing its removal and, consequently, increasing calcium-dependent chloride currents (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This highlights an unprecedented mechanism for regulating ion channel currents by a secreted protein."

Cells were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 1% blocking solution in PBS (Life Technologies) and then incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-human CLCA1 polyclonal antibody 1228 at 1:100 dilution and goat-anti-human-TMEM16A polyclonal antibody S-20 at 1:50 dilution) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were washed and incubated with WGA-Alexa Flour 633 conjugate (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate at 1:250 dilution and donkey anti-goat IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate at 1:200 dilution) for 2 hr at room temperature. Washed slides were then mounted in VECTASHIELD H-1200 Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Confocal microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 META Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY). The images were acquired with LSM 4.2 software and batch processed with AxioVision 4.8.2 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy)."

Prior to staining, intact HEK293T cells were treated with human FcR blocking reagent at 1:100 dilution (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA) for 15 min. The biotinylated N-CLCA1 was pre-incubated with SA-PE at a 4:1 molar ratio for 15 min at room temperature to produce fluorescently labeled tetramers of N-CLCA1 (N-CLCA1/SA-PE). Cells (4 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells/sample) were either stained with SA-PE alone (1:50) or N-CLCA1/SA-PE (1:50) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA (FACS buffer) at 4\u00b0C. In order to validate specific binding of N-CLCA1/SA-PE to cell surface TMEM16A, goat-anti-human-TMEM16A polyclonal antibody S-20 (1:10), which was raised against a 15\u201320 amino acid peptide within residues 820\u2013870 (corresponding to the last extracellular loop; UniProt Q5XXA6), was added prior to addition N-CLCA1/SA-PE. A goat polyclonal IgG antibody for human Aquaporin5 was used (1:10) as an isotype control for the blocking antibody S-20. Mouse-anti-human-TMEM16A monoclonal antibody C5, which binds a cytosolic epitope, was used as a second control antibody (1:10). Following staining, cells were washed with FACS buffer, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACScan). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR)."

Samples were boiled for 5 min, and then loaded on a 4\u201312% bis-tris Nupage gel (Life Technologies). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using an iBlot Gel Transfer Device (Life Technologies). Membranes were blocked by 0.5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% TWEEN. Primary antibodies (mouse \u03b1-human CLCA1 8D3, 1:4000; mouse-anti-human-TMEM16A monoclonal antibody C-5, 1:1000; mouse-anti-actin monoclonal antibody C4, 1:5000) in blocking buffer were incubated on the membrane for 15 min. Following three washes with PBS-TWEEN, secondary antibodies (goat-anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate 1:5000) in blocking buffer were applied for 15 min. After three PBS-TWEEN washes, signal was detected using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Developed films were scanned and converted to 8-bit tiff files. Protein bands were processed equally and the pixel intensities were quantified with ImageJ 1.48 (<a href=\"http://imagej.nih.gov/ij\">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</a>)."
