Motor proteins generate forces inside cells by \u2018walking\u2019 along filaments of a protein called actin, and these forces are used to contract muscles, to traffic cargo within the cells or to segregate chromosomes during cell division. These activities subject the myosin proteins to physical stress that, together with the extremes of pH and temperature found in the cell, can lead to the motor proteins losing their shape. Misfolding can also result from genetic mutations, with extremely serious consequences for health: about one-third of cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u2014a genetically inherited heart disease that affects 1 in 500 people worldwide (<a href=\"#bib1\">Maron et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Maron, 2002</a>)\u2014are caused by mutations in a component of cardiac \u03b2-myosin.

Further, it has been previously reported that the inotropic effects of EMD 57033 were the result of increases in the sensitivity of myosin to calcium ions (which enter into muscle cells when they need to contract; <a href=\"#bib4\">Solaro et al., 1993</a>).

They also show that the presence of EMD 57033 increases the rate of ATP binding, and that the resulting increase in energy release leads to higher force production. The binding of EMD 57033 to myosin also increases its ability to withstand high temperatures and, remarkably, mediates the refolding of at least some stress-induced misfolded proteins\u2014akin to bringing these proteins \u2018back from the dead\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

After binding to a filament of actin (shown in green), the motor protein then uses this energy to \u2018walk\u2019 along the filament. Repeating this cycle generates a pulling force that can cause a muscle cell to contract\u2014however, this effort, as well as other stresses within the muscle cell, can promote misfolding and a loss of motor function. The accumulation of misfolded \u2018dead\u2019 myosin can lead to the formation of protein aggregates, which can have potentially toxic effects. Radke, Taft et al. show that when EMD 57033 (not shown) binds to cardiac \u03b2-myosin it increases the rate of ATP binding and energy release (blue circular arrow), which accelerates the motor proteins progression along the actin filament. Remarkably, EMD 57033 can also refold some forms of misfolded myosin back to a properly folded and functional state (purple arrow)\u2014an activity that has not been observed before for similar small molecules."

The team\u2019s findings also represent the first demonstration of a pharmacological chaperone-induced protein refolding with subsequent restoration of the protein\u2019s function. A better understanding of EMD 57033 could lead to additional studies in at least three areas: the study of force generation mechanisms; the development of improved biosensors; and the interpretation of the clinical effects observed in trials of other myosin activators (such as Omecamtiv Mecarbil). A better understanding of if and how EMD 57033 can improve the function of mutant forms of myosin might also lead to improvements in the design of clinical trials by identifying those patients who are predicted to benefit the most from treatment with a specific inotropic agent."
