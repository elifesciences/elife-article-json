The Arf1/COPI protein machinery, known for its role in vesicle trafficking, regulates LD morphology, targeting of specific proteins to LDs and lipolysis through unclear mechanisms. Recent evidence shows that Arf1/COPI can bud nano-LDs (\u223c60 nm diameter) from phospholipid-covered oil/water interfaces in vitro. We show that Arf1/COPI proteins localize to cellular LDs, are sufficient to bud nano-LDs from cellular LDs, and are required for targeting specific TG-synthesis enzymes to LD surfaces. Cells lacking Arf1/COPI function have increased amounts of phospholipids on LDs, resulting in decreased LD surface tension and impairment to form bridges to the ER. Our findings uncover a function for Arf1/COPI proteins at LDs and suggest a model in which Arf1/COPI machinery acts to control ER-LD connections for localization of key enzymes of TG storage and catabolism."

The Arf1/COPI protein machinery, known for its role in vesicle trafficking, regulates LD morphology, targeting of specific proteins to LDs and lipolysis through unclear mechanisms. Recent evidence shows that Arf1/COPI can bud nano-LDs (\u223c60 nm diameter) from phospholipid-covered oil/water interfaces in vitro. We show that Arf1/COPI proteins localize to cellular LDs, are sufficient to bud nano-LDs from cellular LDs, and are required for targeting specific TG-synthesis enzymes to LD surfaces. Cells lacking Arf1/COPI function have increased amounts of phospholipids on LDs, resulting in decreased LD surface tension and impairment to form bridges to the ER. Our findings uncover a function for Arf1/COPI proteins at LDs and suggest a model in which Arf1/COPI machinery acts to control ER-LD connections for localization of key enzymes of TG storage and catabolism."

LDs also store lipid precursors for membrane synthesis (e.g., cholesterol and glycerophospholipids) needed, for example, when cells exit quiescence and expand membranes for cell division (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kurat et al., 2009</a>). Due to their function in lipid storage, LDs are central to the development of pathologies associated with excess lipid accumulation, ranging from atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease to obesity and metabolic syndrome (<a href=\"#bib39\">Krahmer et al., 2013</a>)."

In this sense, LDs constitute the dispersed phase of a cellular emulsion, with the phospholipid monolayer acting as a surfactant at the interface of the oil core with the aqueous cytosol (for review, see <a href=\"#bib31\">Thiam et al., 2013b</a>). Proteins specifically located at the LD surface execute many of the reactions of lipid storage or mobilization. For example, enzymes mediating TG synthesis and hydrolysis localize to LDs, where they mediate LD expansion and shrinkage, respectively (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kuerschner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Schweiger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Stone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Murugesan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>).

Specifically, members of the Arf1/COPI machinery, but not other proteins involved in secretory trafficking (e.g., COPII or clathrin), are necessary for normal LD morphology and for the targeting of some proteins to LDs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Guo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Soni et al., 2009</a>).

Although one possibility is that Arf1/COPI proteins target proteins to LDs via bilayer vesicles, a variety of studies suggest a function directly at LDs. First, Arf1 and its GEF, GBF1, as well as other members of the COPI machinery, have been found on LDs in proteomic and cell biological studies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nakamura et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ellong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bouvet et al., 2013</a>). Second, the expression of dominant-negative Arf1T31N, which binds its exchange factor tightly, localizes to LDs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guo et al., 2008</a>). Third, Arf1Q71L that cannot hydrolyze GTP (and hence acts as a dominant-negative mutant in vesicular trafficking) activates lipolysis from LDs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guo et al., 2008</a>). Most recently, GTP-bound Arf1 and COPI proteins were shown to bud nano-LDs of \u223c60 nm diameter from a phospholipid covered oil-water interface in vitro (<a href=\"#bib30\">Thiam et al., 2013a</a>), indicating that this machinery can interact with monolayer interfaces such as what is found at LD surfaces. Collectively, these data suggest an alternative, so far untested model, in which Arf1/COPI proteins function in cells directly at LDs in a way that enables protein targeting."

For example, at least one isoenzyme catalyzing each step of de novo TG synthesis from glycerol-3-phosphate (e.g., GPAT4, AGPAT3, and DGAT2) localizes to a subset of LDs. Each of these enzymes contains two hydrophobic segments likely forming a hairpin in the ER membrane or the LD monolayer (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>). LD localization of these enzymes enables LDs to synthesize TG locally and expand their neutral lipid cores under conditions of excess energy (fatty acid) availability. Recent evidence indicates that these enzymes re-localize to a subset of LDs from the ER via abundant membrane bridges that form between the organelles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Thiam et al., 2013a</a>). Intriguingly, this targeting reaction can occur rapidly at a particular LD, from which TG synthesis enzymes were absent for a long time (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>).

We found that depletion of Arf79F, <i>garz</i>, or any of the coatomer subunits, with the exception of \u03b5COP, impaired the LD localization of GPAT4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Similarly, depletion of Arf79F or \u03b2COP compromised LD targeting of the triglyceride-synthesis enzyme DGAT2 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Defective GPAT4 localization to LDs with Arf1/COPI depletion was also evident in subcellular fractionation experiments, where the amount of GPAT4 in the LD fraction was greatly diminished in the absence of \u03b2COP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Soni et al., 2009</a>), we found that <i>brummer</i> was also missing from LDs in Arf1/COPI-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The targeting defect was apparently specific to proteins targeting LDs from bilayer membranes, as at least some proteins that localize to LDs from the cytoplasm, such as the <i>Drosophila</i> perilipin Lsd1, were not affected by Arf1/COPI depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The absence of TG synthesis enzymes likely explains the absence of large LDs, and the defect in lipase targeting and the associated defect in lipolysis, likely contribute to the increase in size of small LDs to an intermediate size."

Similar to findings in <i>Drosophila</i> cells, some signal from each protein localized in foci to LDs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Also in this case, LD colocalization of the coatomer protein \u03b2COP was overrepresented, compared with the expectation for a random pattern. Moreover, \u03b2COP and \u03b2\u2032COP were localized to the same foci (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). In contrast, clathrin or KDEL receptor were either underrepresented or only occasionally showed a focus on LDs, consistent with a randomly distributed pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). In NRK cells, the colocalizing foci completely overlapped with the LD marker perilipin3 in confocal and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) images (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>), but were distinct from signals marking the Golgi apparatus (GM130, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>).

This inhibition by brefeldin A leads to the formation of a stable, abortive complex of the compound with Arf1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Walker et al., 2011</a>).

We isolated LDs from <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells and incubated them with purified Arf1/COPI proteins. Electron microscopy revealed that specifically in the presence of the Arf1/COPI machinery and a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue (GTP\u03b3S), abundant protein-covered nano-LDs were formed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The nano-LDs had an average diameter of 65 nm \u00b1 10 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), consistent with the size range of COPI-coated vesicles (<a href=\"#bib26\">Simon et al., 1996</a>) or the size of COPI-coated nano-LDs formed at artificial oil-water interfaces (<a href=\"#bib30\">Thiam et al., 2013a</a>). For vesicle formation by COPI, dimerization of Arf1 is required (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2008</a>).

Importantly, adding cholesterol to cells was sufficient to restore targeting of GPAT4 to LDs in Arf1/COPI-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and the number of GPAT4-positive LDs depended on the ratio of cholesterol and PC added to cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To test whether the effect is due to cholesterol\u2019s physical properties, or alternatively, to some physiological change in the cells induced by cholesterol, we repeated these experiments with SR59230A and stearylamine. Both of these agents are surface active, amphiphilic molecules that normally do not occur in cells, but which induce LD destabilization in vivo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Murphy et al., 2010</a>), likely by increasing LD surface tension or by decreasing line tension of coalescence intermediates. In agreement with the findings with added cholesterol, adding SR59230A or stearylamine efficiently restored GPAT4 targeting to Arf1/COPI-depleted LDs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

We introduced microsomes harboring GFP-GPAT4 into buffer-in-oil micro-reactors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Mixing the content of the micro-reactors by flow through zig-zagging micro-channels led to localization of some GPAT4 to the monolayer delimiting the TG phase. The amount of GFP-GPAT4 at the monolayer depended on its composition and varied according to the surface tension. Similar to the situation in cells, monolayers rich in cholesterol and having higher surface tension, bound GFP-GPAT4 more efficiently than control monolayers of PC and PE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Budding of nano-LDs in turn, increases surface tension of the donor LD and allows membrane bridges to be established between this LD and the ER. These membrane bridges provide a pathway for the localization of membrane-associated proteins, such as ATGL and GPAT4, and it allows them to diffuse to the LD surface where they perform key steps in TG metabolism. Without functional Arf1/COPI, TG synthesis enzymes fail to target LDs, which as a consequence cannot expand to form large LDs. In addition, as reported (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Soni et al., 2009</a>), ATGL fails to target LDs leading to a defect in lipolysis and a mild increase in the size of small LDs. Consistent with this model, incubation of cells depleted for components the Arf1/COPI machinery with chemicals that increase LD surface tension, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or SR59320A is sufficient to restore GPAT4 targeting. Various proteomic, biochemical, and cell biological studies showing that components of the Arf1/COPI machinery are present on LDs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nakamura et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Guo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ellong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bouvet et al., 2013</a>) are also consistent with this model."

Thus, Arf1/COPI activity that results in the budding of nano-LDs will cause a significant change in the surface properties of existing LDs, and these changes are required to enable interactions of the LD monolayer surface with bilayer membranes. Specifically, we posit that the increase in the surface tension of LDs allows for the formation of bridges with the ER, whereas the densely packed phospholipid shell on LDs with low surface tension, where Arf1/COPI have not acted, are refractive to forming a bridge with the ER."

It is unclear how cargo that migrates from the ER to LDs is selected. Intriguingly, the Arf1/COPI mechanism appears to operate specifically for proteins that are embedded in the membrane, such as GPAT4 and ATGL, which behaves similarly to GPAT4 as an integral membrane protein (<a href=\"#bib27\">Soni et al., 2009</a>, and FW, MJO, RVF, and TCW, unpublished observations).

It is unknown if the Arf1/COPI machinery is constitutively active stochastically on some LDs or if is regulated. Interestingly, data from in vitro budding reactions from oil-water interfaces indicate that Arf1/COPI can act only on membranes sufficiently covered by phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib30\">Thiam et al., 2013a</a>). Therefore, Arf1/COPI might be part of a system that detects LDs that are sufficiently coated by PC (i.e., have reached a sufficiently low surface tension) and thus are suitable for further expansion. It is also unclear how Arf1/COPI-mediated protein targeting is affected by lipolysis. Generation of surface-active lipids during lipolysis, such as fatty acids or diacylglycerol, might increase LD surface tension and subsequently augment the triggering of ER-LD bridge formation, thereby allowing more lipases to migrate to LDs. Also unclear is how the specificity of membrane bridge formation of LDs to the ER is controlled. Finally, it will be of interest to determine the fate of the nano-LDs formed by Arf1/COPI actions. Nano-LDs are similar in size to typical COPI vesicles. However, in contrast to vesicles, they are made up of a small oil core that is likely coated with a monolayer of phospholipids and may contain specific proteins."

Through the actions of the Arf1/COPI machinery, the surface properties of LDs can be altered such that proteins are able to access them. Among all coat complexes known to function in vesicular trafficking, the Arf1/COPI system has unique properties that make it ideally suited to function in this process. All other vesicular coat complexes require exchange factors that contain trans-membrane spanning protein segments, which are unlikely to be found on LDs. Arf1/COPI does not require such a factor. By this unique mechanism, cells can alter the surface properties of LD emulsions and enable them to interact with membranes, so that specific enzymes can gain access to LDs and facilitate dynamic changes in lipid storage or utilization. Our findings additionally provide evidence for a previously unrecognized cellular mechanism by which Arf1/COPI proteins can control protein trafficking."

                                "text": "STED microscopy (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hell and Wichmann, 1994</a>) was performed on a custom-built system featuring an 80 MHz mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) tuned to either 760 nm or 770 nm as the depletion beam. The 140 fs pulses output from this laser were stretched to several hundred picoseconds using a glass block and a 100 m polarization-maintaining optical fiber (Thorlabs) to prevent multiphoton excitation of the fluorophores. A spatial light modulator in the depletion beam path allowed phase modulation for generating a toroidal depletion focus in the sample and for correction of system induced optical aberrations (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gould et al., 2012</a>). For fluorescence excitation, 510 nm and 640 nm pulsed diode lasers (PicoQuant) were electronically synchronized to the depletion beam and an electronic delay (Colby Instruments) allowed adjustment of the relative arrival time of the laser pulses at the sample. Excitation and STED beams were combined using dichroic mirrors and focused into the sample through a 100\u00d7/1.4NA oil immersion objective lens (UPLSAPO 100XO/PSF, Olympus). Imaging was preformed via beam scanning. A 16 kHz resonant scanner and a galvanometer mirror (EOPC) were placed in the beam path and imaged into the pupil plane of the objective lens to scan the beams through the sample. Fluorescence from the sample was collected by the objective lens, de-scanned by the scan mirrors, separated from laser light using dichroic mirrors, bandpass filtered (FF01-685/40 for ATTO647N or FF01-593/46 for STAR470SX; both from Semrock), and focused onto 105 \u03bcm core diameter (ATTO647N: \u223c0.7 Airy units; STAR470SX: \u223c0.8 Airy units) multimode fibers (Thorlabs) connected to single-photon counting avalanche photodiodes (APD; ARQ-13-FC, Perkin Elmer). APD counts were acquired using a FPGA-based data collection board (PCIe-7852R, National Instruments) and custom acquisition software programmed in LabView (National Instruments). Recorded pixel values were linearized (on the DAQ card) to account for the sinusoidal velocity profile of the resonant mirror and normalized according to the pixel dwell times such that the center pixel was divided by unity. Dual-color imaging of ATTO647N and STAR470SX were performed using sequential frame acquistions similar to previously published reports using a long Stoke\u2019s shift fluorophore as the second color channel (<a href=\"#bib24\">Schmidt et al., 2008</a>). Laser powers (measured at the objective back aperture) were \u223c16 \u03bcW of 510 nm excitation light and \u223c130 mW of 760 nm STED light for STAR470SX and \u223c17 \u03bcW of 640 nm excitation light and \u223c130 mW of 770 nm STED light for ATTO647N. Images were acquired with a 20 nm pixel size in a 1024 by 1024 image format with 500 accumulations per line, resulting in a frame rate of 0.032 Hz."

A wafer mold was made by lithography with a negative resin (SU8-2035). The device was made of a poly-dimethylsiloxane polymer, used to replicate the pattern on the mold and stuck on a glass cover slip. The height of the device is 58 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m. A buffer and oil stream was generated using a syringe pump. By flow focusing, defined buffer drops were generated in the oil stream. These buffer micro-reactors contained GFP-GPAT4 microsomes. The oil used was a mixture of TG with phospholipids and/or cholesterol (PC/PE each 0.25% (wt/wt); PC/PE/cholesterol 1/1/4 with 2% (wt/wt) cholesterol; cholesterol 0.5% (wt/wt); indicated lipid concentrations are compared to TG). To ensure the same frequency of interaction of the microsomes with the monolayer interface, the flow rate of the buffer and oil stream (150 and 30 \u00b5l/hr) was kept constant for all experiments."

These are buried in the Methods, which is fine, but if the authors were hoping to convey some information through this figure they have failed. Also, it is unclear how the expected number of ER-LD connections (5-9) is arrived at from the Figure or the legend. Perhaps a bit more information in the figure legend would be helpful to explain the model in simple terms to the reviewers (and like most readers of eLife, we presume) who are not mathematicians</i>."
