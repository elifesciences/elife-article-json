                    "text": "Enduring memories of sensory cues associated with drug intake drive addiction. It is well known that stressful experiences increase addiction vulnerability. However, it is not clear how repeated stress promotes learning of cue-drug associations, as repeated stress generally impairs learning and memory processes unrelated to stressful experiences. Here, we show that repeated social defeat stress in rats causes persistent enhancement of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Protein kinase A-dependent increase in the potency of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling underlies LTP facilitation. Notably, defeated rats display enhanced learning of contextual cues paired with cocaine experience assessed using a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Enhancement of LTP in the VTA and cocaine CPP in behaving rats both require glucocorticoid receptor activation during defeat episodes. These findings suggest that enhanced glutamatergic plasticity in the VTA may contribute, at least partially, to increased addiction vulnerability following repeated stressful experiences."

However, it is not clear how repeated stress promotes learning of cue-drug associations, as repeated stress generally impairs learning and memory processes unrelated to stressful experiences. Here, we show that repeated social defeat stress in rats causes persistent enhancement of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Protein kinase A-dependent increase in the potency of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling underlies LTP facilitation. Notably, defeated rats display enhanced learning of contextual cues paired with cocaine experience assessed using a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Enhancement of LTP in the VTA and cocaine CPP in behaving rats both require glucocorticoid receptor activation during defeat episodes. These findings suggest that enhanced glutamatergic plasticity in the VTA may contribute, at least partially, to increased addiction vulnerability following repeated stressful experiences."

Stelly et al. found that these stressed rats formed stronger associations between the drug cocaine and the place where they were given the drug (the cue).

Adverse experience recruits the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response, culminating in release of glucocorticoids that enables the body to cope with insults to homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Munck et al., 1984</a>). In rodent models, repeated activation of the stress response typically disrupts learning and cognition [e.g., spatial learning (<a href=\"#bib20\">Conrad et al., 1996</a>), working memory (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mizoguchi et al., 2000</a>), and cognitive flexibility (<a href=\"#bib47\">Liston et al., 2006</a>)]. In contrast to these deficits, prior stress enhances the learning of Pavlovian cue-outcome associations driven by rewarding stimuli, assessed with conditioned place preference (CPP) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kreibich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Burke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chuang et al., 2011</a>), or aversive/stressful stimuli, assessed with fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib21\">Conrad et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sandi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Suvrathan et al., 2014</a>). These effects of stress may have arisen from evolutionary pressure to rapidly acquire information predicting food, shelter, and predator threat during periods of duress. Augmented Pavlovian reward learning mechanisms in stressed individuals may also heighten susceptibility to addiction, as acquisition of cue-drug associations is a crucial early step in drug use, and powerful, enduring memories of drug-associated cues trigger craving and relapse as recreational use progresses to addiction (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hyman et al., 2006</a>). However, it is not clear how repeated stressful experience promotes the learning of cue-drug/reward associations, as repeated stress is generally detrimental to synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory unrelated to stressful events (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kim and Diamond, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Joels et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schwabe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chattarji et al., 2015</a>)."

These dopamine neuron responses are hypothesized to drive the learning of Pavlovian cue-reward associations (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Darvas et al., 2014</a>). Intriguingly, over the course of repeated cue-reward pairing, dopamine neurons acquire a conditioned burst response to reward-predictive cues, which is thought to encode the positive motivational valence of those cues and to invigorate reward-seeking behavior (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schultz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berridge et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>)."

Indeed, NMDAR-mediated transmission undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP) when cue-like glutamatergic input stimulation is repeatedly paired with reward-like bursting in dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harnett et al., 2009</a>). LTP induction requires amplification of burst-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by preceding activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs; more specifically mGluR1) coupled to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>). Here, IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) detect the coincidence of IP<sub>3</sub> generated by glutamatergic input activating mGluRs and burst-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. IP<sub>3</sub> enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs by promoting access to the stimulatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites, thereby promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores (<a href=\"#bib65\">Taylor and Laude, 2002</a>). In this study, we demonstrate that repeated social defeat stress (1) enhances NMDAR LTP in the VTA via an increase in IP<sub>3</sub> sensitivity of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and (2) promotes acquisition of cocaine CPP in behaving rats, and both of these effects require glucocorticoid action during defeat stress."

Application of a low concentration of IP<sub>3</sub> preceding APs can effectively facilitate I<sub>K(Ca)</sub> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cui et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ahn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bernier et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the LTP induction protocol consisted of applying a low concentration of IP<sub>3</sub> (250 \u00b5M\u00b7\u00b5J) 50 ms prior to simultaneous pairing of a burst with a brief train of synaptic stimuli (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), the latter being necessary to activate NMDARs at stimulated synapses at the time of burst for LTP induction (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harnett et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Whitaker et al., 2013</a>). This induction protocol produced little LTP in control animals, while large LTP was induced in defeated animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). IP<sub>3</sub> application, which caused little I<sub>IP3</sub> by itself, caused facilitation of burst I<sub>K(Ca)</sub> (assessed immediately before LTP induction), which was significantly larger in cells from defeated animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Furthermore, the magnitude of LTP was positively correlated with that of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced facilitation of I<sub>K(Ca)</sub> across neurons from both groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Robust LTP was induced in control rats when a higher IP<sub>3</sub> concentration (500 \u00b5M\u00b7\u00b5J), which produced larger I<sub>K(Ca)</sub> facilitation, was used during induction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Thus, we sought to determine whether corticosterone, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, is involved in the increase in IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitivity with repeated stress. Corticosterone activates both glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs); however, MRs are typically saturated by circadian fluctuations in corticosterone, while lower-affinity GRs are activated by levels attained with stress (<a href=\"#bib38\">Joels and de Kloet, 1994</a>). Therefore, the role of GRs was examined by treating rats with the antagonist mifepristone (40 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle 30\u2009min prior to each defeat session. The DHPG effect on burst I<sub>K(Ca)</sub> was significantly enhanced by repeated defeat in the vehicle-treated group, while there was no effect of stress in the mifepristone-treated group (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Thus, blockade of GRs during defeat sessions prevented IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitization. Next, rats were treated with corticosterone (2.5, 5, or 15 mg/kg, i.p.; at the end of the dark cycle) for 5 days (no social defeat). The lowest dose (2.5 mg/kg) produces elevation in blood corticosterone concentration comparable to that evoked by a moderate stressor (<a href=\"#bib31\">Graf et al., 2013</a>), while higher doses (\u226510 mg/kg) have been used to simulate severe stress levels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akirav et al., 2004</a>). None of the tested doses significantly altered the DHPG effect on burst I<sub>K(Ca)</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

Acquisition of psychostimulant CPP is inhibited by mGluR1 or NMDAR antagonist in the VTA, while CPP expression is attenuated by NMDAR antagonist, but not by mGluR1 antagonist, in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib75\">Whitaker et al., 2013</a>), supporting the potential role of NMDAR LTP in driving CPP. Rats underwent stress or control procedures for 5 days, then underwent 1-day CPP conditioning with cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). It should be noted that a single psychostimulant treatment does not cause IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Whitaker et al., 2013</a>). Stressed rats displayed robust preference for the cocaine-paired side after 1-day conditioning, while unhandled and handled controls showed small preference (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The 1-day CPP score was significantly larger in stressed rats compared to unhandled and handled controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Control rats developed significant cocaine CPP comparable to that observed in stressed rats after 3-day conditioning with the same dose of cocaine (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Bursting also releases dopamine locally from the soma and dendrites, activating somatodendritic D2 autoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beckstead et al., 2004</a>). Chronic stimulation of G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors, such as D2 receptors, is known to upregulate the cAMP-PKA pathway (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hyman et al., 2006</a>), which may contribute to stress-induced IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitization.

Stress-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system is regulated by glucocorticoids (<a href=\"#bib50\">Marinelli and Piazza, 2002</a>). Recent evidence implicates GRs expressed in projection areas, not in the VTA, in long-term glucocorticoid regulation of dopamine neuron activity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ambroggi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Butts et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barik et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, glucocorticoids can also enhance synthesis of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a major stress-related neuropeptide, and activation of CRF neurons in brain areas providing major CRF inputs to the VTA (<a href=\"#bib48\">Makino et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rodaros et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kolber et al., 2008</a>). GR blockade may therefore attenuate CRF-induced excitation of dopamine neurons during stress (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kalivas et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ungless et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wanat et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Holly et al., 2015</a>). We found that GR activation alone is not sufficient for IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitization. Thus, the potential GR mechanisms described above may act to amplify glutamatergic input-driven bursting activity during stress episodes, likely further enhanced by stress-induced activation of noradrenergic inputs stimulating dopamine neurons via \u03b1<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Grenhoff et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Paladini et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Morilak et al., 2005</a>), thereby enabling large local dopamine release in the VTA. In this regard, it is interesting that repeated cocaine treatment was capable of causing similar enhancement of mGluR/IP<sub>3</sub> action in a GR-independent manner. Dopamine levels in the VTA caused by cocaine alone are likely sufficient to induce D2-mediated upregulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway."

Blockade of the critical components regulating NMDAR LTP induction (i.e., NMDARs, group I mGluRs, PKA, or LTCCs) in the VTA during conditioning has been shown to suppress CPP acquisition (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harnett et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ahn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Whitaker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Degoulet et al., 2015</a>). In the present study, systemic GR blockade during defeat episodes prevented both the enhancement of the LTP induction mechanism and that of cocaine CPP acquisition, consistent with the potential role of NMDAR plasticity in this form of Pavlovian learning. However, enhanced CPP acquisition observed in defeated rats may well be caused by an increase in the primary rewarding action of cocaine itself. The relative contribution of these two possibilities, i.e., enhanced learning mechanism vs. enhanced cocaine reward, remains to be determined."

LTP is similarly impaired in the prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib30\">Goldwater et al., 2009</a>). By contrast, repeated stress leads to enhancement of AMPAR LTP in the lateral amygdala, which underlies Pavlovian fear conditioning driven by stressful/aversive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rodriguez Manzanares et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Suvrathan et al., 2014</a>). Alterations in the function/expression of NMDARs are implicated in these forms of metaplasticity, as NMDARs play a key role in AMPAR LTP induction (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kim and Diamond, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chattarji et al., 2015</a>). Here, we described a distinct form of stress-induced metaplasticity in the VTA, i.e., enhancement of mGluR/IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent NMDAR LTP, which may, at least in part, contribute to the enhanced drug reward-based Pavlovian learning. This may illuminate a key mechanism by which stressful experience increases vulnerability to addiction, a chronic relapsing disorder perpetuated by memories of drug-associated stimuli."

Specifically, the current protocol (1 day conditioning with 5mg/kg cocaine) does not induce CPP robustly in control animals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A, B</a>). This may be because the dose of cocaine used, together with the other experimental conditions, is not rewarding at all, or because conditioning was not enough. Depending on these possibilities, the interpretation of the result can be very different. If the authors claim that social defeat stress enhanced learning, the authors should show that this dose of cocaine is rewarding, and extended conditioning actually causes CPP in control mice. Thus, we would like to see the data indicating that positive CPP can be observed in control animals with the same dose of cocaine."

In contrast, this study sees no changes in DA VTA firing, which might imply that these were highly resilient rats. It would be important to provide additional data on the post-stress behaviors of the rats used, e.g. reduced social approach and/or anhedonia that have been associated with altered in vivo and vitro firing pattern of DA VTA \u2013 enhanced mean frequencies and increased bursting. Interestingly, the molecular mechanism identified here would be a very good candidate for inducing these activity pattern in DA VTA neurons of non-resilient post-defeat animals.
