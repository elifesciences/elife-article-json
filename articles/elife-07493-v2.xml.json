For a few animals, central neurons responsive to earth-strength magnetic fields have been identified; however, magnetosensory neurons have yet to be identified in any animal. We show that the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> orients to the earth's magnetic field during vertical burrowing migrations. Well-fed worms migrated up, while starved worms migrated down. Populations isolated from around the world, migrated at angles to the magnetic vector that would optimize vertical translation in their native soil, with northern- and southern-hemisphere worms displaying opposite migratory preferences. Magnetic orientation and vertical migrations required the TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel in the AFD sensory neuron pair. Calcium imaging showed that these neurons respond to magnetic fields even without synaptic input. <i>C. elegans</i> may have adapted magnetic orientation to simplify their vertical burrowing migration by reducing the orientation task from three dimensions to one."

Comparisons appear in the order that they were introduced in the text. Two-tailed <i>t</i>-tests were performed between normally distributed groups that had equal variance to test the difference between the populations' means. The Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between variables. To test difference between means belonging to non-normally distributed samples we used the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney ranked sum test. All statistic measures are from comparisons with the group shaded in grey immediately above. Index refers to the mean (magnetic or burrowing) index for each population (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). (<b>B</b>). Summary of the magnetic coil system results for wild-type animals from three different locations around the world and internal physiological status. Statistical tests were performed using the Circular Statistic toolbox for Matlab (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berens, 2009</a>). Comparisons between different parameters are shown within boxes. (<b>C</b>). Summary of local magnetic field properties and magnet assay results for wild-type worms from twelve different locations around the world (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The exact isolation location for the LKC34 (Madagascar) strain is not known. We chose the northernmost location (Antisiranana) for the field properties, although choosing the southernmost location (Toliara) would not have yielded significantly different results. (<b>D</b>). Summary of the magnet-assay results for strains genetically modified to ablate (or to rescue gene function) in selected neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). (<b>E</b>).

For a few animals, central neurons responsive to earth-strength magnetic fields have been identified; however, magnetosensory neurons have yet to be identified in any animal. We show that the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> orients to the earth's magnetic field during vertical burrowing migrations. Well-fed worms migrated up, while starved worms migrated down. Populations isolated from around the world, migrated at angles to the magnetic vector that would optimize vertical translation in their native soil, with northern- and southern-hemisphere worms displaying opposite migratory preferences. Magnetic orientation and vertical migrations required the TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel in the AFD sensory neuron pair. Calcium imaging showed that these neurons respond to magnetic fields even without synaptic input. <i>C. elegans</i> may have adapted magnetic orientation to simplify their vertical burrowing migration by reducing the orientation task from three dimensions to one."

The AFD sensory neurons respond to earth-strength magnetic fields as observed by calcium imaging, and are necessary for magnetic orientation, and for vertical migrations. Expression of the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel, TAX-4, in AFD neurons is necessary for worms to engage in vertical migrations, to orient to artificial magnetic fields, and for the AFD neurons to activate in response to an earth-strength magnetic stimuli."

Because worms are known to orient to a variety of sensory stimuli that vary with depth in their native soil niches (<a href=\"#bib10\">Braakhekke et al., 2013</a>), we hypothesized that burrowing worms engage in vertical migrations like magnetotactic bacteria. To test this, we placed worms in the center of 20-cm long, agar-filled cylinders. Three layers of aluminum foil and a Faraday cage blocked light and electric fields respectively from penetrating the cylinders. Pipettes were then aligned horizontally in the \u2018north-south\u2019 or the \u2018east-west\u2019 directions, or vertically in the \u2018up-down\u2019 direction in the absence of artificial magnetic fields (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Directional preference during burrowing was quantified with a burrowing index computed as the difference between the number of worms reaching either side divided by the total number of worms reaching both sides. We found that when starved, the wild-type lab strain, N2, originally from Bristol, England (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dougherty and Calhoun, 1948</a>) preferentially migrated down in vertically oriented cylinders, but did not show a burrowing preference when cylinders were arranged horizontally (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

The system generates magnetic and electric fields. To prevent electric fields from affecting our experiments we built a Faraday cage around the experimental volume (iv). Dedicated DC power supplies for each coil (v) allowed us to control the orientation and the magnitude of the net magnetic field within the coil system. Assay plates (vi) were then placed inside the coil system for testing. We empirically calibrated the field within the coil system with the aid of a milligausmeter (vii) from AlphaLab Inc. (Utah, USA). (<b>B</b>) In each magnetic coil system experiment, the north direction of the imposed magnetic field is signified by the 0\u00b0 on the top of the circular plot.

The solid circular histograms represent the heading of the tested populations in a circle where the radius equals 10% of the entire population. Well-fed animals are represented by the black contour, while starved worms are represented by the grey contour. Circular plots had 18 bins (20\u00b0 each). Similarly, the black and grey arrows represent the mean heading vector for the well-fed and starved populations respectively. The length of the vector is 0 if the population of animals migrated at random, and it is 1 if all animals migrate to a single point.

Alternatively, magnetotactic bacteria have been shown to use the earth's magnetic field to migrate up or down within the water column (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blakemore, 1975</a>). To help distinguish magnetotactic <i>vs</i> gravitactic mechanisms we built a magnetic coil system capable of producing homogeneous magnetic fields of any desired 3D orientation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our magnetic coil system is comprised of three independently-powered, orthogonal Merritt coil systems that allow the generation of magnetic fields of up to 3\u00d7 earth strength (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">Merritt et al., 1983</a>). Within the 1-m<sup>3</sup> coil system, a smaller 20-cm<sup>2</sup> Faraday cage, made with copper fabric, protects the test volume from the electric field that is concomitantly created alongside the magnetic field. Though often ignored in studies on animal magnetic orientation, this precaution was necessary because <i>C. elegans</i> and other animals exhibit strong behavioral responses to electric fields (<a href=\"#bib25a\">Gabel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mani\u00e8re et al., 2011</a>). We repeated our vertical burrowing assay with an artificial magnetic field of earth-strength oriented opposite to the local earth's magnetic field (i.e., magnetic north pointing up rather than the natural orientation where magnetic north points down, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Under these conditions, we expected that worms responding to gravitational cues would continue to migrate down, while worms responding to magnetic cues would reverse their direction and now migrate up. Consistent with magnetic stimuli dictating vertical migration we found that starved N2 strain worms reversed their burrowing behavior and migrated up (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> red bar)."

                                "text": "First, as a control, we asked how worms respond when the earth's magnetic field is cancelled. We accomplished this within the test volume of the magnetic coil system using a magnetic field of equal strength and orientation to the field of the earth, but with opposite direction. Worms in this regiment experienced a net magnetic field of 0.000 Gauss in three dimensions. Under this condition animals migrated randomly, distributing evenly around the circumference of the assay plate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We next produced a homogeneous magnetic field of 0.325 Gauss (corresponding to half of earth's maximum field intensity) directed across the assay plate. Worms assayed this way showed a biased distribution directed \u223c120\u00b0 to the imposed magnetic vector (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Increasing the field strength to match the earth's maximum field strength (0.650 Gauss) resulted in worms migrating approximately the same direction (132\u00b0) to the imposed vector (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Surprisingly, if worms were allowed to starve for just 30 min, they reversed their migratory distribution by \u223c180\u00b0, now migrating at\u00a0305\u00b0 relative to the field vector (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). These results demonstrate that <i>C. elegans</i> does not migrate simply toward magnetic north like magnetotactic bacteria (<a href=\"#bib25\">Frankel et al., 2006</a>); rather, they display a preference to migrate at particular angles relative to magnetic north that depend on feeding state. Similar plasticity for opposite migration preferences in <i>C. elegans</i> has been documented for other sensory modalities (e.g. <a href=\"#bib12\">Bretscher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Russell et al., 2014</a>)."

As mentioned earlier, the standard wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> lab strain (N2) was originally isolated in Bristol, England and cryogenically preserved there for distribution and study around the world. We turned to available geomagnetic data from NOAA to determine whether these migratory angles related to the earth's magnetic field in England (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maus et al., 2009</a>). In Bristol, the earth's magnetic vector enters the ground (north pointing down) at approximately 66\u00b0 of inclination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Thus, in Bristol, to optimally orient upward, a worm would need to migrate 156\u00b0 to the magnetic field penetrating the earth (green arc in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,G</a>); to optimally orient downward, a worm would need to migrate 336\u00b0 to the magnetic field (brown arc in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). To determine whether the preferred migratory angles of starved and well-fed worms in our magnetic coil system assay matched these directions we performed a V test (<a href=\"#bib5\">Batschelet, 1981</a>). We found that the mean heading of fed worms (132\u00b0, N = 1268 animals) did not differ significantly from the upward direction for England (156.3\u00b0). Likewise, the mean heading of starved worms (304.6\u00b0, N = 1079 animals) did not differ significantly from the downward direction for England (336.3\u00b0).

To test this hypothesis, we placed well-fed or starved worms in vertically arranged agar-filled pipettes away from artificial magnetic and electric fields as before. We found that, consistent with this idea, starved worms preferentially migrated down while well-fed worms migrated up (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). These results are parsimonious with <i>C. elegans</i> directing its vertical burrowing behavior by using the earth's geomagnetic field. Soil nematodes feed on bacteria associated with rotting fruit on the soil surface (<a href=\"#bib23\">F\u00e9lix and Braendle, 2010</a>) and on root rhizobacteria deep in the soil (<a href=\"#bib29\">Horiuchi et al., 2005</a>).

Magnetotactic bacteria from different hemispheres migrate in opposite directions to the field vector. Bacteria that inhabit the northern hemisphere (where magnetic north points down) are termed north-seeking magnetotactic bacteria, while those inhabiting the southern hemisphere (where magnetic south points down) are termed south-seeking magnetotactic bacteria (<a href=\"#bib25\">Frankel et al., 2006</a>). The distribution of different wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> isolates from around the world with distinct magnetic environments affords us a valuable opportunity to investigate how animals in magnetically distinct environments respond to magnetic fields. We therefore repeated our magnetic coil system and burrowing assays with wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> worms isolated from Adelaide (Australia) where the magnetic field of the earth is similar in strength and angle to that in England but differs in the key respect of having the opposite polarity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Unlike British worms, we found that Australian worms placed in a plate within our magnetic coil system migrated to an earth-strength field at 302.5\u00b0 if fed, and 117.4\u00b0 if starved. While oriented oppositely in preference from the angles displayed by the British N2 strain, these angles were similar in that they would also result in upward translation in Australia for fed animals and downward translation for starved ones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a> respectively). To test if this response to an imposed artificial magnetic field reflected the migratory burrowing preference of worm in a natural magnetic field, we compared the burrowing behavior of Australian worms to that of the British strain. Paralleling our magnetic coil system results, we found that in our lab (located in Texas, USA) Australian worms migrated down when well-fed, and they migrated up when starved in the burrowing assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Identical results were found for Hawaiian worms which migrated at angles that would optimally orient them up and down when satiated and starved in Hawaiian (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Overall, these results suggest that unlike magnetotactic bacteria, which follow magnetic field lines during their migrations, worms migrate at angles to the imposed field that would result in optimal vertical translation in their native locations."

Unfortunately these experiments are limited to a few assays at the time, preventing their use in larger-scale behavioral screens. To mitigate this shortcoming, we developed a new assay using strong rare-earth magnets to quickly assess the ability of different strains to respond to imposed magnetic fields (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This assay allowed us to run many assays at the same time. Briefly, worms were placed at the center of an assay plate and allowed to migrate freely (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A magnet was then placed above one of two equidistant \u2018goal\u2019 areas. Magnetotactic performance was quantified with a magnetotaxis index computed as the difference between the number of worms reaching either goal divided by the number of worms reaching both goals. We found that when no magnet was present, worms distributed evenly between these two goals. However, if the magnet was present, worms preferentially migrated toward it (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). To ensure the presence of the magnet did not introduce an unwanted thermal gradient, we recorded the temperature difference between goals in the presence and absence of a magnet and found that the two treatments did not significantly differ from each other (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>).

If <i>C. elegans</i> uses the magnetic field for vertical migrations, what happens near the equator where the vertical component of the earth's field is weakest? The global heterogeneity in field characteristics made us wonder if selection pressure for magnetosensation ability may drop off nearest the equator where the vertical component of the magnetic field is at its weakest. To test this, we used our magnet assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) on wild-type populations isolated from ten locations across the planet where the local magnetic field varies in inclination and vertical strength (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">Maus et al., 2009</a>). We found that the ability of different worm populations to orient to an artificial magnetic field was strongly correlated with the inclination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>) and vertical strength (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>) of the magnetic field at their native sites. The horizontal component of the field, however, was a poor predictor of this magnetotactic ability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The strong correlation between magnetotaxis performance, local field inclination, and vertical strength allowed us to successfully predict the magnetotaxis index of an additional wild-type isolate from California, USA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> red circle in panels B-E, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). Wild-type isolates from equatorial locations where the magnitude of the vertical component was close (or below) 0.2 Gauss, were either unable or barely able to magnetotax (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). These results are consistent with local adaptations to global magnetic field variations, and could perhaps be used to model how other species may respond to temporal field variations (such as magnetic polar drift or field reversals, <a href=\"#bib16\">Cox et al., 1964</a>). We conclude from these results that like many animals (<a href=\"#bib32\">Johnsen and Lohmann, 2005</a>) <i>C. elegans</i> can use the magnetic field's polarity and inclination to guide its migrations. Having determined that <i>C. elegans</i> orients to magnetic fields, we turned our magnet assay to next investigate the cellular and molecular underpinnings of this fascinating behavior."

One advantage of this technique is that only a fraction of individual worms will inherit the artificial chromosome carrying the transgene. This allowed us to compare the performance of sister worms grown and tested together under identical conditions and only differing in having or not said transgene. After each assay, individual worms with genetically ablated neurons were distinguished from their unaffected sisters by the co-expression of a fluorescent transgene reporter. We found that worms lacking the AFD sensory neurons failed to orient to an artificial magnetic field, while their unaffected sisters oriented normally (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). This could not be explained by non-specific defects, because these worms could move and orient normally to olfactory stimuli (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly ablating nearby sensory neuron pairs ASE and AWC had no effect on magnetotaxis. The sensory ending of the AFD neurons consists of dozens of villi arranged anterior-to-posterior (in an antenna-like formation) imbedded inside glial cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Perkins et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Doroquez et al., 2014</a>). Genetic ablation of the glia surrounding these structures, results in worms with viable AFD neurons but lacking villi (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bacaj et al., 2008</a>). These worms were unable to orient to artificial magnetic fields (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This supports the idea that the villi may be the site of magneto-transduction (and/or that the glia themselves contribute to this sense).

We observed a transient increase in the average brightness of the AFD neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Successive stimuli consistently produced a reduced response (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We observed a similar response when the magnetic stimulus was decreased to 10\u00d7 and 1\u00d7 earth stimuli (6.5 and 0.65 Gauss respectively, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). To help determine if the AFD neurons themselves are magnetosensitive, and not just synaptically downstream from \u2018real\u2019 magnetoreceptive neuron(s), we measured AFD calcium responses in worms impaired in rapid and dense-core synaptic transmission (<i>unc-13</i> and <i>unc-31</i> mutant strains, <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ann et al., 1997</a>). In the absence of chemical synaptic or neuromodulatory inputs, the AFD neurons continued to respond to magnetic fields (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). Qualitatively similar results (but higher in amplitude) were observed for worms that were partially restrained (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Magnetic-induced calcium responses in AFD were not observed in a <i>tax-4</i> mutant background, suggesting that this requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the TAX-4 cGMP-gated ion channel (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Responses were also not observed in an adjacent sensory neuron pair AWC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To quantitatively compare the magnetosensory response of AFD for different conditions and mutant backgrounds, we plotted the average GCamp3.0 intensity during the final 4 s of the magnetic stimulus relative to a 4-s baseline before presentation of the stimulus (for the no-stimulus control we used the same time window as for the other recordings). We found that the change in brightness was significantly greater than control for all test conditions except in the case of <i>tax-4</i> mutant background (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>). Our imaging results provide physiological evidence that the AFD sensory neurons respond to magnetosensory stimuli relevant to geomagnetic orientation."

Nematodes unexpectedly appear to use the AFD neurons to orient to earth-strength magnetic fields. <i>C. elegans</i> guides its vertical migrations using the geomagnetic field and adjusts preference for up or down depending on their satiation state. Population variability in magnetotactic ability correlates with global field properties: with worms from locations where the field is strong and vertical outperforming those where the field is weak and more horizontal. The AFD sensory neuron pair is necessary for magnetic orientation and for vertical migrations. Similarly, a cGMP-gated ion channel in the AFD neurons, TAX-4, is also necessary and sufficient for these behaviors. The role of the AFD sensory neurons in magneto-transduction is supported by their ability to respond to magnetic fields even in the absence of synaptic inputs."

All of these parameters vary with depth in the soil (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jassal et al., 2005</a>) supporting the role of the AFD neurons in vertical burrowing migrations. Because <i>C. elegans</i> performs magnetotaxis in darkness (assays were wrapped in 3-layers of foil), it is possible that it detects fields with nano-scale compasses made of biological magnetic material previously described in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cranfield et al., 2004</a>), rather than by a light-dependent mechanism, although this study did not investigate this possibility. However, based on our behavioral, mutant, transgenic, and physiological analyses we hypothesize magnetic particles, perhaps such as those found in magnetotactic bacteria (<a href=\"#bib25\">Frankel et al., 2006</a>) and previously reported in <i>C. elegans</i>, may (either directly or indirectly) be associated with the anterior and posterior-directed microvilli of the AFD neurons. Magnetic stimulation of these structures could lead to activation of unspecified guanylyl cyclases (such as GCY-8, GCY-18, or GCY-23), in turn activating the TAX-4 channel and resulting in Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and cell depolarization. These findings could represent an intriguing lead into the putative magnetotransduction mechanism of the AFD neurons. It will be intriguing to investigate whether the diverse range of other magnetotactic animals employ magnetosensitive neurons with analogous morphology and transduction mechanisms as the AFD neurons."

Our finding that vertical migrations by an animal may also be guided by this sensory modality opens a new niche for the study of magnetic navigation. Magnetotactic bacteria passively migrate along field lines: with south-seeking bacteria swimming down, and north-seeking bacteria swimming up in the southern and northern hemispheres respectively (<a href=\"#bib25\">Frankel et al., 2006</a>). Unlike bacteria, <i>C. elegans</i> does not follow the field vector but rather migrates at an angle that appears to maximize its vertical translation.

Studies on paramecia suggest that the relative density of the organism against its media is instrumental in gravitaxis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kuroda and Kamiya, 1989</a>). For terrestrial and marine animals, the relative density of their media (air and water respectively) is largely constant.

Unlike bacteria which migrate along the dip line at an angle relative to the vertical direction, however, <i>C. elegans</i> appears to align motion at an angle to the magnetic field that would enable a more vertical trajectory in its native environment.

However, our experiments did not provide evidence to answer why fed worms migrate up and starved worms migrate down. One possibility concerns the vertical stratification of food sources. <i>C. elegans</i> eats bacteria growing on rotting fruit on the soil's surface (<a href=\"#bib23\">F\u00e9lix and Braendle, 2010</a>), and also root rhizobacteria deep in the soil (<a href=\"#bib29\">Horiuchi et al., 2005</a>). Vertical migrations may direct travel between these segregated food sources following the marginal value theorem (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carnov, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Milward et al., 2011</a>). Rotting fruit on the surface represents an extremely rich, but transient, food supply. By contrast, rhizobacteria represent a low-quality but stable source of food. Surface populations likely grow exponentially until they exhaust their resources. For a starved worm on the surface, burrowing down would be adaptive because it leads to rhizobacteria in the plant roots. Rhizobacteria, however, represent a lower quality food source. From here, fed worms may venture to emerge in search of better and more plentiful food. Worms on poor diets have been shown to be more likely to abandon the relative safety of their food patch in an attempt to find a higher quality source (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</a>). For these worms, an adaptive locomotor strategy would be to burrow up in search of higher quality food sources, as burrowing down would not be likely to result in finding a higher quality food patch. Future experimental studies will distinguish between these and other possibilities by mimicking specific soil conditions."

To test worms in comparable satiation states, worms tested under the \u2018fed\u2019 status were assayed within 10 min of being extracted from their bacterial lawn. To test worms in the \u2018starved\u2019 state, we allowed worms to remain suspended in liquid Nematode Growth Media (NGM) for 30 min prior to beginning their run. Incubation temperature was between 19\u201321\u00b0C in standard NGM agar plates seeded with <i>Escherichia coli</i> (OP50) lawns (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brenner, 1974</a>). Artificial magnetic fields were removed from the vicinity of the worms, and the local field surrounding the worms was determined to be of earth strength and direction with a DC Milligauss Meter Model MGM magnetometer (AlphaLab, Utah, USA). To minimize novel background mutations, all strains were tested within 3 months of thawing from cryopreserved stocks, with additional re-thaws of fresh samples at 3-month intervals."

We used the AFD-specific promoter (<i>Pgcy-8</i>) to target the AFD neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Inada et al., 2006</a>). To genetically ablate these neurons, we constructed plasmids containing the human caspase gene <i>ICE</i> (gift from V Maricq) and transformed N2 wild-type worms to generate strains JPS264 <i>vxEx264[Pgcy-8::ICE]</i>. Identical results were found for two independently derived strains, JPS265 and JPS271, in a N2 background. AFD neurons were also killed in the Australian wild-type isolate AB1 to generate strain JPS545 and JPS546. The ability of this transgene to kill the AFD neurons was assessed by comparing GFP expression in the AFD neurons of worms carrying the ICE construct, with that of worms not carrying it (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To measure intracellular calcium levels in AFD neurons in vivo we expressed GCaMP3 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tian et al., 2009</a>; gift from L Looger) <i>vxEx316[Pgcy-8::GCaMP3]</i> in <i>lite-1(ce314)</i> worms to generate the strain JPS316. Identical results were found for three independently derived strains, JPS275, JPS294, and JPS315. All of these strains were capable of magnetosensation. We rescued <i>tax-4</i> specifically in AFD by constructing plasmid with a wild-type copy of the <i>tax-4</i> cDNA (gift from Dr Ikue Mori) expressed in AFDs as described above to generate the strain JPS458 <i>tax-4(ks11) vxEx458[Pgcy-8::tax-4(+)]</i>. Identical results were found for the independently derived strain, JPS459. We also rescued with fosmid VRM069cE04 containing genomic region of <i>tax-4</i> with its promoter, UTR and endogenous regulatory elements <i>vxEx458[VRM069cE04]</i> with strain JPS458. <i>unc-13</i> or <i>unc-31</i> mutants were crossed with JPS316 males and F<sub>2</sub> worms were selected that exhibited GCaMP3 fluorescence and an uncoordinated phenotype to generate strains JPS496 and JPS495 respectively.

We used the latter to clean the worms off bacteria, and to transfer worms to the center of a 1-day old, 10-cm diameter, chemotaxis-agar assay plate. Equidistant from the worms, we drew 3.5-cm circles on either side and placed 1-\u03bcl drops of 1-M NaN<sub>3</sub> at the center of these circles to immobilize and count any worm that reached the area (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). A N42 Neodymium 3.5-cm diameter magnet (K&amp;J; Magnetics Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) was placed above one of the circles so that the assay plate was now traversed by a vertical magnetic field gradient that became stronger toward the magnet and weaker away from it. (Note that more commonly found weaker strength magnets produced qualitatively the same behavioral results.) Worms were released from the liquid NGM droplet by wicking excess liquid with filter paper. The total manipulation time (from bacterial lawn to the beginning of the assay) was kept under 10 min to avoid inadvertently starving the worms. Worms released from the liquid NGM became able to freely migrate around the plate. After 30 min we counted the number of worms NaN<sub>3</sub>-paralyzed in each circle and calculated the magnetic orientation index (MI) as: MI = (M \u2212 C)/(M + C). Where M is the number of worms paralyzed within the magnet's circle, C is the number of worms paralyzed within the control circle. We repeated the test a minimum of 10 times for each population (please refer to <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A,C\u2013E</a> for the number of assays and worms used in each experiment). The absence of artificial magnetic fields and temperature gradients were empirically determined before each assay with DC Milligauss Meter Model MGM magnetometer (AlphaLab, Utah, USA) and two high accuracy Fisher thermometers accurate to 1/100 of a degree (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>).

In this configuration, the magnetic field on the plate surface ranged between 40 and 2900 Gauss (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

A 22 cm<sup>3</sup>, copper fabric, Faraday cage around the test volume prevented electric fields from interfering with our assays. Each of the three coil systems was orthogonal to the other two (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and was independently powered by Maxtra Adjustable 30V 5A DC power supplies. We used a DC Milligauss Meter Model MGM from Alphalab Inc. (Utah, USA) to measure the magnetic field inside the coil system before and after each experiment. Before the start of each experiment, the system was used to neutralize the magnetic field of the earth within the coil system by creating a field of equal strength and opposite orientation. A single 10-cm diameter, agar-filled plate (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ward, 1973</a>), with \u223c50 worms in its center, was placed in the center of the coil system (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To immobilize and count the worms that reached the plate's edge, we placed a 10-\u03bcl ring of 0.1-M NaN<sub>3</sub> anesthetic in the agar around circumference of the plate. We next closed the Faraday cage and allowed the worms to migrate freely within the plate with a homogeneous earth-strength (0.325 and 0.650 Gauss) magnetic field aligned with the plane of the assay plate. Alternatively, we allowed worms to migrate in plates when the effective magnetic field inside the coil system was 0.000 Gauss (earth-neutralized). After an hour, the angle at which each worm had migrated with respect to the imposed field vector was recorded. To ensure that the worms were responding to the generated magnetic field, and not to some unknown gradient in the room, all assays were run in darkness with the direction of the imposed magnetic field, and also the orientation of the magnetic coil system was varied between trials with respect to the room and the earth's magnetic north. All experiments were conducted blind with experimenter unaware of strain genotype."

The intensity of the stimulus was calibrated with a DC Milligauss Meter Model MGM magnetometer (AlphaLab, Utah, USA). The putative role of the magnetic sensor in the worm is to detect the direction of the magnetic field. It therefore follows that the cell must have an optimal stimulation angle between its sensor and the surrounding field. Because we could not infer what this optimal alignment angle may be, we decided to rotate the stimulus vector throughout 360\u00b0 to ensure that each worm was stimulated with its presumably optimal angle. We did this by rotating the magnet along the xy plane followed by the xz plane at a rate of 2 Hz.

Comparisons between different experimental groups were performed by planned, two-tailed paired or unpaired <i>t</i>-tests to compare different groups that were normally distributed. Differences between non-normally distributed groups (or groups that failed the test of equal variance) were evaluated using the Mann\u2013Whitney Ranked Sum Test, and two way repeated measures ANOVA (Temperature experiments). Correlations between parameters were determined using linear regressions and assessed using Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficients. Circular statistical analyses (descriptive and comparative) were performed using a circular statistics toolbox for Matlab 2013b (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berens, 2009</a>). We tested the significance of mean directions using Rayleigh tests, and for difference between vertical \u2018up\u2019 or \u2018down\u2019 direction and the mean direction of the population using V tests (<a href=\"#bib5\">Batschelet, 1981</a>).

The data presented here convincingly show that <i>C. elegans</i> can use the Earth's magnetic field for its vertical \u201cmigrations\u201d and that those migrations are influenced by satiation state; the movements are random when the field is cancelled and are clearly responsive to changes in inclination angle and intensity.
