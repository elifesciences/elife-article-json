Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate a topographical representation of amplitude modulation rate in the auditory cortex of awake macaques. The representation of this temporal dimension is organized in approximately concentric bands of equal rates across the superior temporal plane in both hemispheres, progressing from high rates in the posterior core to low rates in the anterior core and lateral belt cortex. In A1 the resulting gradient of modulation rate runs approximately perpendicular to the axis of the tonotopic gradient, suggesting an orthogonal organisation of spectral and temporal sound dimensions. In auditory belt areas this relationship is more complex. The data suggest a continuous representation of modulation rate across several physiological areas, in contradistinction to a separate representation of frequency within each area."

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate a topographical representation of amplitude modulation rate in the auditory cortex of awake macaques. The representation of this temporal dimension is organized in approximately concentric bands of equal rates across the superior temporal plane in both hemispheres, progressing from high rates in the posterior core to low rates in the anterior core and lateral belt cortex. In A1 the resulting gradient of modulation rate runs approximately perpendicular to the axis of the tonotopic gradient, suggesting an orthogonal organisation of spectral and temporal sound dimensions. In auditory belt areas this relationship is more complex. The data suggest a continuous representation of modulation rate across several physiological areas, in contradistinction to a separate representation of frequency within each area."

The topographical representation of frequency (tonotopy) is a well-established organisational principle of the auditory system. In mammals, tonotopy is established in the receptor organ, the cochlea, and maintained as a systematic spatial separation of different frequencies in different areas of the ascending auditory pathway, and in the auditory cortex. While temporal modulation is recognised as an essential perceptual component of communication sounds such as human speech and animal vocalisations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rosen, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Drullman et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shannon et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wang, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Elliott and Theunissen, 2009</a>), its representation in the auditory system is poorly understood. In contrast to sound frequency, amplitude modulation rate is not spatially organised in the cochlea but represented in the temporal dynamics of neuronal firing patterns. However, a considerable proportion of neurons in the auditory brainstem and cortex show tuning to amplitude modulation rates (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib20\">Joris et al., 2004</a>). It has been proposed that temporal information in sound is extracted by amplitude modulation filter banks (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dau et al., 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">1997b</a>) that are physiologically instantiated in the midbrain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rees and Langner, 2005</a>). Studies in rodents (<a href=\"#bib22\">Langner et al., 2002</a>), cats (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schreiner and Langner, 1988</a>) and primates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumann et al., 2011</a>) have shown that at the stage of the inferior colliculus amplitude modulation rate and frequency of sound are represented in approximately orthogonal topographical maps."

Data from gerbils (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schulze et al., 2002</a>) and cats (<a href=\"#bib23\">Langner et al., 2009</a>) suggest a topographical map for temporal modulation rates in the auditory cortex. In cats, orthogonal gradients for modulation rate and frequency have been shown, similar to those in the inferior colliculus. However, it is not clear how such an organisation might be preserved across the multiple auditory fields of primate cortex where different fields show different orientations of the tonotopic gradient. While earlier fMRI studies in humans (<a href=\"#bib14\">Giraud et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schonwiesner and Zatorre, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Overath et al., 2012</a>) reported robust responses to a range of amplitude-modulated sounds, but no systematic organisation of rate, two more recent studies suggested an orthogonal relationship of frequency and rate in areas homologous to non-human primate auditory core (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herdener et al., 2013</a>) and beyond (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barton et al., 2012</a>). Electrophysiology studies in non-human primates have shown tuning of individual neurons to different modulation rates and suggest a tendency for neurons in primary fields to prefer faster rates than neurons in field higher up the hierarchy (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bieser and Muller-Preuss, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liang et al., 2002</a>): see also (<a href=\"#bib20\">Joris et al., 2004</a>).

This range of modulation rates covers preferred rates for cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Joris et al., 2004</a>). We investigated whether the preference for specific amplitude modulation rates in neuronal ensembles is systematically represented in the auditory cortex and, if so, how such an organisation is arranged relative to the tonotopic gradients across auditory fields."

We generated two different maps to reveal the spatial organisation of modulation rate by projecting the data of the acquired volumes onto the cortical surface derived from the anatomical scans. In a first map (contrast map) we contrasted the response strength of the lower rate bands vs the higher rate bands to reveal the gradual change of preference for higher to lower modulation rates across the auditory cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, top panels). The data corresponding to the two highest rates (512 Hz, 128 Hz) and lowest rates (2 Hz, 0.5 Hz) were combined before contrasting, while the intermediate rates were ignored (see also <a href=\"#bib3\">Baumann et al., 2011</a>). In a second map (best-rate map), for each position in the auditory cortex, we represented the rate band that showed the strongest response. For the best-rate maps, all six individual rates were mapped (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, bottom panels). The contrast maps reveal a topography for different amplitude modulation rates with preferences for high rates consistently clustered in the postero-medial auditory cortex with the maxima at the medial border of the primary field A1 in both hemispheres of all tested animals. Preferences for low rates were located lateral, anterior and to some degree posterior to the high-rate clusters. In the areas with the maximal preference for low or high rates, the contrast between low and high rates was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) in all animals and hemispheres, corrected for multiple comparisons with family-wise error (FWE) correction over the recorded volume. The best-modulation-rate maps for the six tested rates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, bottom) confirmed the systematic organisation of the response pattern with a topographic representation of rate arranged in approximately concentric frequency bands starting with high rates in the postero-medial auditory cortex (at least a few voxels showed a best modulation rate of 128 Hz postero-medially in 5 of 6 hemispheres) and progressing anterior, lateral and in some cases posterior to lower rates (see also the schemata in Figure 4). The highest rate (512 Hz) was hardly represented in the best-rate maps."

The anterior-posterior low to high gradient that defines the auditory core field A1 is particularly clear in the contrast maps (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, top panels). In line with previous studies in macaques, this gradient has generally a lateral-to-medial component in addition to the main anterior-posterior direction (<a href=\"#bib27\">Morel et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kosaki et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baumann et al., 2010</a>). Similar to the situation in humans, the low frequency area that defines the border between fields A1 and R is typically wider on the lateral side compared to the medial side. The anterior high frequency area, which forms the border between the auditory fields R and RT, is typically located on the medial side of the superior temporal plane, in the depth of the circular sulcus (see also <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2013</a>). The resulting anterio-medial direction of the main frequency gradient in R forms, in combination with gradient direction in A1, an inward inflection in the gradient axis across A1 and R, which has previously been reported in <a href=\"#bib27\">Morel et al. (1993)</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Kosaki et al. (1997)</a> in macaques, <a href=\"#bib5\">Bendor and Wang (2008)</a> in marmosets and described in (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jones, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hackett, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2013</a>). This directional change of the frequency gradient axis across the core fields, which is also obvious from the different mean angles of the gradients in A1 and R (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), is of particular relevance for the relationship of temporal and spectral gradients in these fields (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

If this organization is overlaid with the spectral pattern derived from experiment 2, we notice that in the auditory core areas (A1, R) the gradients for modulation rate and frequency lie approximately orthogonal to one another (illustrated in schemata of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This arrangement is most obvious in A1 in individual animals, but the relationship generally holds for R and the adjacent lateral belt fields as well. This occurs as a consequence of the change in the direction of the tonotopic axis between A1 and R such that the tonotopic gradient follows approximately the iso- amplitude-modulation rate lines. In other words, the tonotopic axis runs anteriorly and medially in area R whilst the rate gradient runs anteriorly and laterally to preserve the orthogonal relationship. In this arrangement, the frequency reversals form spokes in the concentric organisation of the amplitude modulation rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2, 4</a> left). However, rostral of R and caudal of A1 the orthogonality of spectral and temporal features breaks down and the gradients become more collinear and less obvious (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2, 4</a> right)."

We can only speculate why such an organisation has not been reported in these previous studies. Electrophysiology studies in other primate species have highlighted a tendency for differential responses across different auditory fields with more primary areas preferring faster rates or showing shorter latencies and areas higher up the hierarchy preferring lower rates or showing longer latencies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bieser and Muller-Preuss, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bendor and Wang, 2008</a>). These results have been interpreted in terms of a posterior-to-anterior high-to-low rate gradient (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bendor and Wang, 2008</a>) or a core-to-belt high-to-low rate gradient (<a href=\"#bib7\">Camalier et al., 2012</a>). Given our results, both schemes have some merit, but they do not capture the full complexity of the organisation for temporal rates in concentric bands. Furthermore, the maps for amplitude-modulation rate reported in this study (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) indicate that in addition to differential responses between fields a clear gradient can be observed within the fields, particularly in the auditory core."

Furthermore, both studies reported an orthogonal relationship of temporal rate and frequency in some auditory areas. The representation of modulation rates reported in <a href=\"#bib1\">Barton et al. (2012)</a> in the human auditory cortex resembles the data from the current study with a maximal preference of high rates in the postero-medial cortex surrounded by areas with a preference for lower rates. However, the interpretation of the topographical pattern of this study differs to ours, in proposing a concentric organisation for frequency representation overlapping with an angular representation of modulation rate in contrast to our interpretation of a concentric organisation for modulation rate and an angular representation of frequency in core areas. An important result of this difference is that <a href=\"#bib1\">Barton et al. (2012)</a> suggest an orthogonal relationship of frequency and modulation rate representation in the entire auditory cortex while in our case we find such a relationship mainly in the core areas. Furthermore, the study of Barton et al. suggested that each field contained a separate complete amplitude modulation rate gradient in addition to a separate and complete frequency gradient whilst the scheme that we demonstrate in macaques suggests that amplitude modulation rate is represented across multiple areas, none of which contain a complete map. However, a detailed comparison between the two studies is complicated by <a href=\"#bib1\">Barton et al.

Finally, a further recent study in humans tested the representation of temporal and spectral features (<a href=\"#bib33\">Santoro et al., 2014</a>). The chosen approach differed from our and previous studies in that a computational analysis was applied to test different models of stimulus feature representation. Thus, the emphasis was not on mapping individual rates and frequencies or identifying stimulus gradients. Furthermore, combined spectro-temporal modulations where used as stimuli in addition to pure temporal and spectral modulations. Nevertheless, the study identified an area in postero-medial auditory cortex, just posterior of the medial Heschl's gyrus, with a preference for fast temporal rates. Regions anterior and lateral of this area showed a preference for low temporal rates (summarised in Figure 7 of <a href=\"#bib33\">Santoro et al., 2014</a>). Based on anatomical relationships in the auditory cortex between human and non-human primates as suggested in <a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al.

(2004)</a>. The rate code is a measure of the average number of spikes fired over a defined period of time to the different modulation rates, and the temporal code is a measure of how well the neuron's firing synchronises with the amplitude envelope of the stimulus at different modulation rates. The average response of neurons in the cortex shows slightly different best rates for the two measures and some neurons are properly tuned to only one of the two measures (<a href=\"#bib20\">Joris et al., 2004</a>). Different neurons in the auditory cortex of non-human primates have been reported with tuning to modulation rates between 2\u2013120 Hz, measured by temporal response and between 1\u2013250 Hz measured by rate response (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bieser and Muller-Preuss, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liang et al., 2002</a>), see also (<a href=\"#bib20\">Joris et al., 2004</a>). However, neurons responding with a synchronised temporal response are rarely tuned to rates above 64 Hz and are preferentially located in primary areas. Neurons demonstrating rate tuning make up the majority of neurons that respond to modulated sounds in-non primary auditory areas and are frequently tuned to rates at 64 Hz and above."

While an increased average firing rate of a local sample of neurons to a certain modulation rate would certainly lead to an increased BOLD response, an increased synchronisation within the same sample of neurons would probably have a similar effect. This is supported by a simulation study which suggested that both types of firing patterns would influence the BOLD response in similar way (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chawla et al., 1999</a>). In our study, the range of amplitude-modulation rates represented in the BOLD response and the pattern of areas that respond to specific rates is better matched by response properties reported for single neurons responding with a rate code in non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bieser and Muller-Preuss, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bendor and Wang, 2008</a>).

The superposition of maps of modulation rate and frequency also occurs in the inferior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumann et al., 2011</a>) where some higher modulation rates are represented than in the cortex, whilst in the cortex the modulation rates mapped decrease with greater distance from A1. The mapping of distinct dimensions of sound, amplitude-modulation rate and frequency, as distinct vectors in an anatomical space, is analogous to the mapping of polar angle and eccentricity that occurs at all processing levels of the visual system. Representation in the auditory cortex differs, however, in that a complete mapping of modulation rate does not occur within each cortical area, in contrast to the multiple and complete representations of spectral frequency that these areas contain."

Stimuli for characterising the BOLD response to spectral frequencies were based on a random-phase noise carrier with three different pass-bands, 0.5\u20131 kHz, 2\u20134 kHz and 8\u201316 kHz resulting in three different stimuli that encompassed different spectral ranges. The carriers were amplitude modulated with a sinusoidal envelope of 90% depth at 10 Hz to achieve a robust response in the auditory system. The stimuli for characterising the temporal rates in the amplitude modulation experiment were also based on random-phase noise carrier but had a flat broad-band spectrum from 25 Hz to 16 kHz. This carrier was amplitude modulated at six different rates, 0.5 Hz, 2 Hz, 8 Hz, 32 Hz, 128 Hz and 512 Hz resulting in six different stimuli that covered a broad range of temporal rates identical to the data previously reported from the inferior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumann et al., 2011</a>). The duration of all the stimuli was 6 s which included at least three cycles of the modulation in the case of the lowest temporal frequency. This duration is also sufficient for the BOLD response in the auditory cortex of macaques to reach a plateau (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baumann et al., 2010</a>). The on- and off-set of the stimulus were smoothed by a linear ramp of 50 ms."

Each volume acquisition was separated by a 9 s gap to avoid recording the BOLD response to the gradient noise of the previous scan (\u2018sparse design\u2019). In combination with the TA of 1 s this results in a repetition time (TR) of 10 s. The stimuli were presented during the last 6 s of the silent gap. The detailed timing was based on a previous BOLD response time course characterisation in the auditory system of macaques (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baumann et al., 2010</a>). Before every other volume acquisition stimuli were omitted to obtain data for a silent baseline. For the frequency experiment a total 720 vol were acquired per session. This resulted in 120 vol per stimulus per session (half of the volumes served for the baseline) or 360 vol per stimulus in total for the three sessions. For the amplitude modulation experiment 540 vol per session were acquired resulting in 45 vol per stimulus per session and 315 vol per stimulus for the combined seven sessions."

Functional times series consisted of a continuous acquisition of 343 vol with 20 axial slices acquired with parallel imaging with twofold GRAPPA acceleration using 8-channel array receive coil. The RF transmission was done with the Bruker birdcage volume coil in transmit mode. From the scanner, a TTL pulse signal was triggered at the start of every volume and sent out to PrimatePy via the LabJack for synchronization purposes. In total, a number of 15 runs were acquired (M1:8, M2:7) which represents 15 \u00d7 343 = 5145 vol."

The T2w images consisted of a 2D Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE) sequence with TR = 6500 ms, TE = 14 ms, RARE factor 8. The geometry was the same for both T1w and T2w images: matrix 166 \u00d7 166, FOV 100 mm \u00d7 100 mm, slices thickness 0.6 mm, and 54 axial slices. Because of time constraints, those anatomical scans were acquired during separate scanning sessions but with the same visual fixation task to minimise body motion and stress and to control the animal's behaviour."

The filtered times series of each voxel was then normalised as percentage of signal change relative to the mean signal of that voxel. For each voxel, cross-correlation between time-series from both run types was computed and time delay between the two signals (argument of the maximum correlation) revealed the preferred frequency. Volumetric preferred frequency maps were then projected onto the 3D cortical surface."

Here the results of Baumann et al. suggest that amplitude modulation rate (varied from 0.5 to 512 Hz) is progressively mapped out over the superior temporal plane, with higher frequencies (\u223c128 or 32) typically evoking more activation in caudomedial cortex, with responses to progressively lower AM rates extending systematically out anteriorally and laterally. Not only are these results important for understanding non\u2013human primate cortical auditory organization, with the first demonstration of 'amplitude\u2013o\u2013topy' in monkey but they also provide a vital cross\u2013species link with, and confirmation of, a handful of very recent and somewhat controversial results in the human fMRI literature showing a similar spatial representation of AM. The tonotopic maps from the phase\u2013encoded tonotopy experiment (resampled onto a reconstructed cortical surface) are also of extremely high quality, and extend our knowledge of the range of tonotopic mapping in macaques, and how it might relate to human maps similarly obtained."

For instance, the medial 'high' AM rate patch in M1 and M2 in the high minus low map has a more anterior center of gravity than in the 6\u2013frequency map (which includes all of the data). This is particular pronounced in M1, where it considerably more anterior and lateral in the left hemisphere."

In looking at the figures, I suspect even slight changes to the shape and size of the borders would change the direction quite a lot. Also, it is not clear that the mean gradient is necessarily reflective of the local one if the isofrequency lines are highly curved, which they seem to be in several cases."

Even when mapping requires well controlled unidimensional variables, as in this paper, amplitude modulation rate might not necessarily be a mechanism for vocal communication. A proof of this is the fact that this cortical map was found without using complex sounds.\u201d"

For instance, the medial 'high' AM rate patch in M1 and M2 in the high minus low map has a more anterior center of gravity than in the 6\u2013frequency map (which includes all of the data).

These maps provide additional, and to some degree complementary, information on the local preference to the mapped stimulus features compared to contrast maps. Furthermore, the \u201cbest frequency\u201d approach is common in previous literature, and is the best approach to demonstrate tonotopic mapping in neurons with narrow tuning similar to that in the ascending pathway. For these reasons we provided both types of maps in the previously submitted version of the article and we are happy to provide an additional gradient analysis for the best frequency/rate approach in the current manuscript. As we highlighted in the modified text of the manuscript (last paragraph in the Results section), the results of this additional analysis generally agrees with the previous analysis based on contrast maps (see also <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

In fact, our own experience, supported by increasing evidence from independent studies, suggests the opposite when the response of neuronal mass activity is mapped as in the case of the BOLD effect. Data from tonotopy studies show that at the level of MRI voxels containing 100,000 neurons the tuning curve is relatively broad and the peak response difference for distinct frequencies, particularly in the area of the middle frequencies, is small while the differences in the slopes of the tuning curves in more extreme frequency values is preserved (see also Langers et al., 2014). The reason for this effect is probably the heterogeneity of local frequency tuning of neighbouring neurons, which is particularly pronounced in middle frequencies (see Aschauer et al., 2014 for work in rodent: although a different species the basic phenomenon of tonotopic mapping is remarkably preserved across mammalian species and a similar organisation would explain data such as those of Langers). In the previously submitted iteration of this manuscript to <i>eLife</i> we have shown that the response to amplitude modulation rate shows similarly broad tuning curves. Thus, the contrast maps for frequency and amplitude modulation rate are more robust and show less inter-individual variability than the best frequency responses."

While the contrast response provides a continuous distribution of preference values, the best frequency/rate maps only contain six discreet values. Hence, a regression analysis is inherently less precise, particularly in areas, such as the belt, where the response is dominated by a single frequency/rate. This leads to lower correlation and less significance of the individual gradients and higher variability across subjects. For these reasons we decided to provide the results for the best frequency/rate gradient analysis in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and not in the main section of the manuscript. However, the main gradients for A1 are displayed on the best frequency/rate maps in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 2</a> similar to the gradients for the contrast maps."

The resulting relative angles are also similar with means closer to 110\u00b0 in core areas (108.5 \u00b1 42.1\u00b0 for A1, 112.0 \u00b1 55.1\u00b0 for R). However, the correlation values (r2), p values and the variance across animals and hemispheres are clearly worse, which can be attributed to the sparse nature of the data.

In looking at the figures, I suspect even slight changes to the shape and size of the borders would change the direction quite a lot.

Furthermore, we are currently preparing a manuscript that is describing the response to more salient pitch stimuli with similar rates in the auditory cortex of macaques. Interestingly, the response pattern is considerably different in that case, providing further evidence that the pattern described here is not due to pitch. The response to periodic stimuli with rates above the lower limit of pitch (\u223c30 HZ) occurs in a region abutting but outside of A1 (see also Griffiths and Hall, J Neurosci, 2012 for case of regular interval noise\u2014we have examined harmonic stimuli since), which is a different pattern to the one here where high rates are represented within A1."
