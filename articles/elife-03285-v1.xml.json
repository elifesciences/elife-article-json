Climbing fibres arise from a region of the brainstem called the inferior olive. The inputs from parallel fibres (integrated with other inputs, not shown) lead to high-frequency simple spikes (SS, blue) in the Purkinje cell. The climbing fibre produces infrequent complex spikes (CS, red). Purkinje cells inhibit neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), which in turn inhibit neurons in the inferior olive. Zhou, Lin et al. found that both simple and complex spike firing frequency of Purkinje cells throughout the cerebellar cortex was decreased in zebrin-positive zones (shown on the left) when compared to zebrin-negative zones (shown on the right)."

To test this idea, Zhou, Lin et al. performed an additional, technically challenging, imaging experiment in living mice that were genetically engineered to express a green fluorescent protein in a zebrin-like pattern. Even when recordings were taken from adjacent Z+ and Z\u2212 Purkinje cells in individual experiments, the Z\u2212 cells still fired more frequently than the neighbouring Z+ cells.

Zhou, Lin et al. ruled out a direct role for the enzymatic activity of zebrin. They also provided evidence that the differences could result from properties intrinsic to Purkinje cells themselves, rather than the inputs that Purkinje cells receive from different nerve fibres. Zhou, Lin et al. found that manipulating TRPC3\u2014an ion channel that works with other proteins that are expressed in zebrin-negative bands\u2014did alter some of the physiological properties that differed between Z+ and Z\u2212 Purkinje cells. TRPC3 itself, however, does not appear to be expressed in a striped pattern, and direct links between zebrin, TRPC3, and simple and complex spikes remain speculative."

Many other molecules exhibit striped expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hawkes, 2014</a>). Some share boundaries with zebrin stripes, but others form their own patterns, sometimes subdividing Z+ areas. Intriguingly, Zhou, Lin et al. observed that, beyond the zebrin-dependent differences, the physiological properties of Z+ Purkinje cells vary systematically across cerebellar regions. This suggests that something besides the zebrin map might influence these neurons\u2019 physiological properties."

Taken together with the presence of tightly regulated loops between Purkinje cells and their inputs and outputs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the potential implications are far-reaching. For instance, specific behaviours could be governed by independent, functionally distinct modules. If borne out by future studies, this could imply a dizzying complexity of functional diversity for a circuit that is so often touted as being \u2018simple and well-understood\u2019. Finally, it is an important reminder that the function of even seemingly identical neural circuits can be modulated by differences in their intrinsic properties that change their capability to process information (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</a>)."
