Mouse IFIT1 selectively inhibits viruses that lack 2'O-methylation of their mRNA 5' caps. Surprisingly, human IFIT1 does not share this antiviral specificity. Here, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that human and mouse IFIT1 have evolved distinct functions using a combination of evolutionary, genetic and virological analyses. First, we show that human <i>IFIT1</i> and mouse <i>IFIT1</i> (renamed <i>IFIT1B</i>) are not orthologs, but are paralogs that diverged &gt;100 mya. Second, using a yeast genetic assay, we show that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins differ in their ability to be suppressed by a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. Finally, we demonstrate that IFIT1 and IFIT1B have divergent antiviral specificities, including the discovery that only IFIT1 proteins inhibit a virus encoding a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. These functional data, combined with widespread turnover of mammalian <i>IFIT</i> genes, reveal dramatic species-specific differences in IFIT-mediated antiviral repertoires."

Mouse IFIT1 selectively inhibits viruses that lack 2'O-methylation of their mRNA 5' caps. Surprisingly, human IFIT1 does not share this antiviral specificity. Here, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that human and mouse IFIT1 have evolved distinct functions using a combination of evolutionary, genetic and virological analyses. First, we show that human <i>IFIT1</i> and mouse <i>IFIT1</i> (renamed <i>IFIT1B</i>) are not orthologs, but are paralogs that diverged &gt;100 mya. Second, using a yeast genetic assay, we show that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins differ in their ability to be suppressed by a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. Finally, we demonstrate that IFIT1 and IFIT1B have divergent antiviral specificities, including the discovery that only IFIT1 proteins inhibit a virus encoding a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. These functional data, combined with widespread turnover of mammalian <i>IFIT</i> genes, reveal dramatic species-specific differences in IFIT-mediated antiviral repertoires."

One important arm of the immune system is innate, or cell intrinsic, antiviral immunity, which establishes an antiviral state in cells by signaling through the cytokine interferon (IFN) and subsequent upregulation of hundreds of genes known collectively as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs serve as the first line of defense against viruses and typically function to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or directly restrict virus replication (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schoggins, 2014</a>)."

Upon IFN-stimulation or viral infection, the mRNA levels of <i>IFITs</i> increase 100- to 1000-fold, and IFIT proteins have been implicated in inhibition of a broad range of viruses (<a href=\"#bib16\">Diamond and Farzan, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fensterl and Sen, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vladimer et al., 2014</a>). However, the number and identity of <i>IFIT</i> genes can vary substantially between species. For instance, while humans have five intact <i>IFIT</i> genes (<i>IFIT1, 1B, 2, 3</i> and <i>5</i>), rats have four (<i>IFIT1, 1b, 2</i> and <i>3</i>) and mice have six (<i>IFIT1, 1b, 1c, 2, 3</i> and <i>3b</i>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fensterl and Sen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). The functional consequences of <i>IFIT</i> family evolution are unknown, in part because the antiviral functions and specificities of IFITs are incompletely characterized. Initial studies with IFIT1 and IFIT2 from humans and mice indicated that these proteins might mediate their antiviral activity by inhibiting mRNA translation through interactions with the translation initiation factor eIF3 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guo et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hui et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Terenzi et al., 2005</a>). In this way, IFITs appeared to function similarly to another critical mediator of the innate immune system, Protein Kinase R (PKR), by globally inhibiting mRNA translation. In the case of PKR, the recognition of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA, a by-product of viral replication, triggers its activity and the global repression of protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dever et al., 2007</a>). Such a 'self versus non-self' molecular pattern has been more enigmatic for IFIT proteins, and it has been challenging to determine how IFITs discriminate viral from host RNAs to repress viral replication specifically."

                        "text": "An elegant means by which one IFIT protein distinguishes 'self versus non-self' mRNAs was revealed by recent studies on mouse IFIT1. During mammalian mRNA processing, the 5' cap region is 2'O-methylated from a cap0-structure (7mGpppN, where 7mG is the 7-methyl guanosine, ppp is the triphosphate linkage, and N is any nucleotide) to a cap1-structure (7mGpppNm) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee, 1980</a>). This reaction is catalyzed in the host nucleus by a dedicated 2'O-methyltransferase, known as a cap1-methyltransferase (hCMTR1 in humans) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belanger et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, many viruses have evolved ways to mimic host cap1-structures (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Decroly et al., 2012</a>). For several viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, such as poxviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and rhabdoviruses, 2'O-methylation of the cap is catalyzed by a virally-encoded cap1-methyltransferase. For other viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses, the effect is achieved by \u2018cap-snatching\u2019, in which a segment of cap1-modified host mRNA is appended to viral mRNAs. Either strategy results in methylated (cap1-) mRNAs, suggesting that unmethylated (cap0-) mRNAs could be recognized as a 'non-self' pattern that elicits host immunity. Indeed, mouse IFIT1 was discovered to inhibit replication of numerous viruses naturally lacking or mutated to lack 2'O-methylation by directly binding and inhibiting translation of cap0-mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daffis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hyde et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Menachery et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Szretter et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zust et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Habjan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kimura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kumar et al., 2014</a>). In this way, mouse IFIT1 selectively inhibits viruses that translate proteins from 'non-self' cap0-mRNAs, while the host protects itself via 'self' cap1-structures on its mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Diamond, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hyde and Diamond, 2015</a>)."

Surprisingly, studies on human IFIT1 have belied this expectation. For instance, human IFIT1 was shown to inhibit mRNA translation and replication of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), despite the fact that PIV5 encodes a cap1-methyltransferase and PIV5 mRNAs are 2'O-methylated on their caps (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrejeva et al., 2013</a>).

However, one implicit assumption underlying the expectation that human and mouse IFIT1 should function similarly is that mouse and human <i>IFIT1</i> represent orthologous genes. Here, we show that this is not the case. Using detailed phylogenetic analyses of <i>IFIT</i> genes in vertebrates, made possible by deconvolving the confounding effects of recurrent gene conversion, we show that human <i>IFIT1</i> and mouse <i>IFIT1</i> are two distinct paralogous genes that diverged early in mammalian evolution. Mouse genomes only have representatives of one of these paralogous genes (which we rename <i>IFIT1B</i>), whereas several primates have lost <i>IFITB</i> but retained <i>IFIT1</i>. We further show that these two divergent <i>IFIT1</i> paralogs have distinct specificities. Using a genetic assay we developed in budding yeast (which exploits yeast's inherent lack of a cap1-methyltransferase), we show that mouse and other IFIT1B proteins, but not IFIT1 proteins, discriminate cap0- from cap1-mRNA methylation by selectively inhibiting growth only when a cap1-methyltransferase is missing. Consistent with this activity, we show that only IFIT1B proteins can inhibit replication of a virus that lacks functional cap1-methylation. In contrast, we find that human and other IFIT1 proteins can inhibit the growth of yeast or of a virus that encodes a cap1-methyltransferase. Our findings thus resolve the apparent mystery of IFIT1\u2019s altered antiviral discrimination mechanism in mouse and human and delineate an important role for human IFIT1 in restriction of viruses including those that produce cap1-mRNAs. Our analyses also reveal a high degree of dynamism and alternate retention of <i>IFIT1</i> or <i>IFIT1B</i> paralogs in mammalian genomes. This <i>IFIT</i> gene turnover might profoundly impact the spectrum of viruses that different mammalian species are capable of restricting."

First, there have been extensive changes to the number and identity of <i>IFIT</i> genes between humans and mice ([<a href=\"#bib19\">Fensterl and Sen, 2011</a>;<a href=\"#bib20\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2013</a>] and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

We found the <i>IFIT</i> locus organization is similar in many other mammalian genomes including African green monkeys, rabbits, cats, ferrets, and armadillos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

In this alternative, <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes duplicated early in mammalian evolution but have recurrently recombined with each other. Resulting gene conversion would scramble the phylogenetic relatedness of the two genes without altering their genomic locations. Such gene conversion has been shown to contribute to the evolution of several multigene families including mammalian interferon alpha genes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benovoy and Drouin, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hurles, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Petronella and Drouin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Santoyo and Romero, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Song et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Woelk et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yasukochi and Satta, 2015</a>). To address this possibility, we compared the sequences of <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes within species and between species to look for evidence of gene conversion. We found strong characteristic signatures of gene conversion frequently occurring between the 5' portions of <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes. For example, the sequences of <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes in cats are 86% identical at the whole gene level. However, these two genes are 97% identical in the 5' ends of the genes (nucleotides 1\u2013948 in cat <i>IFIT1</i>) but only 63% identical in the 3' ends of the genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This dichotomy is apparent even if we restrict the analysis to just synonymous substitutions, where we observe a much higher rate of synonymous substitutions in the 3' region of the alignment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Such an uneven distribution of sequence differences strongly suggests that the 5' ends of <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> underwent gene conversion recently in the evolution of the cat <i>IFIT</i> locus, leading to sequence homogenization of the first two-thirds of the gene. In contrast, comparing orthologous genes between species (e.g. <i>IFIT1B</i> between cat and ferret) reveals an even distribution of differences across the gene sequences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) indicating that both the 5' and 3' regions have diverged to the expected degree between species. Moreover, this pattern of gene conversion is seen in pairwise alignments of many <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes. For instance, between ferret <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i>, the 5' ends are 98% identical, but 3' ends are only 62% identical (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A similar dichotomy is evident in a comparison between rabbit <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> and between armadillo <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, all of these gene conversion events have a similar recurrent breakpoint approximately two-thirds of the way through the gene sequence (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that maps to a 'pivot' point between subdomains in the homologous IFIT5 structure (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbas et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In all cases, the 5' ends of the <i>IFIT1</i> genes are largely homogenized, whereas the 3' ends appear to be consistently diverging. Thus, our findings suggest that recurrent gene conversion has confounded the phylogenetic relationships of the 5\u2019 segment of IFIT1 and IFIT1B, which likely do not accurately represent the actual ancestry of these genes."

In contrast to the analyses using the full-length <i>IFIT</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) or the 5' end of the <i>IFIT</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), we now discern clear separation of <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes. Both <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes form distinct monophyletic clades that diverge according to mammalian species evolution, similar to other <i>IFIT</i> genes. Based on this phylogenetic concordance, as well as the agreement with synteny data, we infer that this phylogeny reflects the actual ancestry of <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes in mammals. Importantly, these data indicate that <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> duplicated early in mammalian evolution. Following this duplication, the 3' ends of the two genes have been diverging according to speciation events, whereas the 5' ends have recurrently recombined. These data also reveal that all three mouse <i>IFIT1</i> paralogs (previously named mouse <i>IFIT1, IFIT1b</i> and <i>IFIT1c</i>) and both rat paralogs (previously named rat <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1b</i>) unambiguously group within the <i>IFIT1B</i> gene family. We, therefore, infer that mouse and rat have lost all copies of IFIT1, likely through a deletion of both IFIT1 and the neighboring IFIT5. Instead, mouse and rat genomes now bear recently duplicated copies of <i>IFIT1B</i>. As a result of our phylogenetic analyses, we henceforth refer to these genes as mouse/rat <i>IFIT1B</i> (previously mouse/rat <i>IFIT1), IFIT1B2</i> (previously mouse/rat <i>IFIT1b</i>) and <i>IFIT1B3</i> (previously mouse <i>IFIT1c</i>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This recombination-aware phylogenetic approach thus reveals substantial changes in the <i>IFIT</i> gene repertoire even within this limited number of mammalian species."

We found that most placental mammals contain members of the <i>IFIT1, 1B, 2, 3</i> and <i>5</i> gene families (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In contrast, marsupials encode a more limited set of <i>IFIT</i> genes including a single gene that predates the <i>IFIT2/IFIT3</i> duplication and a single gene that predates <i>IFIT1/IFIT1B</i> divergence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Indeed, construction of a phylogenetic tree of this non-recombining region of vertebrate <i>IFITs</i> shows that <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes cluster into distinct monophyletic clades (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">supplement 3</a>).

For instance, in primates, we found that <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> genes have diverged as expected based on primate phylogeny and that all primates encode an intact <i>IFIT1</i>. In contrast, we found that <i>IFIT1B</i> has been pseudogenized at least twice in the primate lineage as the result of the introduction of nonsense codons and frameshift mutations, once in chimpanzees and again in both sequenced New World monkeys (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and supplement 4). Extending our surveys across all 51 sampled vertebrate species, we found numerous instances of <i>IFIT</i> gene birth, gene loss and gene recombination (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In total, we found evidence for at least seven independent instances of <i>IFIT1B</i> loss, two separate instances of <i>IFIT1</i> loss, and at least 13 independent instances of <i>IFIT1/1B</i> gene conversion. Interestingly, it appears that most changes in the gene repertoire of <i>IFITs</i> across mammalian species are focused on <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i>, although there are also instances of lineage-specific gene births and loss in other IFIT genes as well. For example, <i>IFIT3</i> has duplicated in mice, whereas <i>IFIT5</i> has been lost in several rodents (which may have occurred coincident with <i>IFIT1</i> loss). These changes have led to a significant evolutionary turnover in the IFIT gene repertoire of different mammalian lineages, prompting us to investigate next the functional consequences of this evolutionary turnover of <i>IFIT1/ IFIT1B</i> paralogs in mammals."

To this end, we turned to the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, whose mRNAs only have cap0-structures (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee, 1980</a>) due to a lack of a cap1-methyltransferase. Based on this absence of a cap1-methyltransferase, we hypothesized that expression of mouse IFIT1B in budding yeast might inhibit yeast growth just as IFIT1B inhibits replication of viruses with cap0-mRNAs. Indeed, using a galactose-induced IFIT1B expression system, we found that expression of mouse IFIT1B potently inhibits yeast growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Importantly, this growth inhibition occurs in the absence of any other IFIT or component of the innate immune system, indicating that mouse IFIT1B does not require any other mammalian-specific cofactor to perform this function. We next hypothesized that introducing the human cap1-methyltransferase hCRMT1 to yeast would rescue yeast growth by blocking the activity of IFIT1B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Strikingly, we observed nearly complete rescue of yeast growth when we co-expressed the human cap1-methyltransferase (hCMTR1), but not a catalytic mutant of hCMTR1 (K239A) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belanger et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We, therefore, conclude that the mouse IFIT1B-mediated growth inhibition of budding yeast is specifically due to the lack of a functional cap1-methyltransferase in yeast, accurately recapitulating the known antiviral molecular specificity of IFIT1B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we expressed IFIT1B from several primate species with or without co-expression of hCMTR1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Consistent with our phylogenetic prediction, we observed robust growth inhibition as a result of expression of gibbon and African green monkey (AGM) IFIT1B that could be rescued by expression of hCMTR1. Thus, despite the long divergence separating mouse and primate <i>IFIT1B</i> genes, they share molecular discrimination properties. Surprisingly, we observed no growth inhibition by human IFIT1B. This lack of activity even upon equivalent expression in yeast (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is unusual among intact primate IFIT1Bs, suggesting that human IFIT1B lacks function.

We, therefore, asked whether differences in the C-terminal end of the IFIT1 and IFIT1B were responsible for changes in their molecular specificity, as suggested by our phylogenetic analyses. Our initial chimeras between mouse IFIT1B and human IFIT1, or gibbon IFIT1 and IFIT1B, were unable to recapitulate the yeast growth inhibition. However, this result may be expected, as each of these proteins has diverged without gene conversion for &gt;30 million years and may have acquired epistatic interactions between the N-terminus and the C-terminus."

Upon overexpression in yeast, both cat IFIT1 and IFIT1B were capable of causing growth inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). However, only inhibition by cat IFIT1B was rescued by hCMTR1, suggesting that the C-terminus of the IFIT1 paralogs is critical for the differences in the molecular specificity of these two proteins. We, therefore, conclude that <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> gene families perform distinct molecular functions in the species in which they are found and that recurrent gene conversion of the N-termini of <i>IFIT1/IFIT1B</i> genes in mammals has not led to a loss of their separate functions."

Next, we hypothesized that they have non-overlapping antiviral activities. To test this hypothesis, we created cell lines that constitutively overexpress different <i>IFIT1</i> or <i>IFIT1B</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), circumventing the need to stimulate <i>IFIT</i> expression with interferon and allowing us to evaluate different <i>IFIT1</i> or <i>IFIT1B</i> gene functions in an isogenic background. We then tested whether either human IFIT1 or mouse IFIT1B can specifically inhibit replication of a virus lacking a functional cap1-methyltransferase. For these experiments, we compared replication of a wildtype (cap1-mRNA expressing) vaccinia virus to replication of a vaccinia virus that has a catalytic mutation in its cap1-methyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib34\">Latner et al., 2002</a>). This assay allowed us to test whether cap1-methyltransferase could enable a virus to block IFIT-mediated antiviral activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Consistent with previous studies with these same viruses (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daffis et al., 2010</a>), we found that expression of mouse IFIT1B can potently inhibit replication of a mutant vaccinia virus that lacks cap1-methyltransferase activity, but was unable to inhibit replication of wildtype vaccinia virus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). While the previous mouse knockout experiment had demonstrated that mouse IFIT1B is necessary for inhibition of viruses encoding cap0-mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daffis et al., 2010</a>), our findings show that singular overexpression of mouse IFIT1B is also sufficient for such inhibition. We next extended our analyses to other members of the <i>IFIT1</i> and <i>IFIT1B</i> gene families to determine if cap0-mRNA dependence was a conserved feature of their antiviral activity. Consistent with our yeast assay data, we found that gibbon and AGM IFIT1B proteins function similarly to mouse IFIT1B, and can specifically inhibit the replication of a virus expressing cap0-mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Also consistent with our analyses of IFIT1B in yeast (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), human IFIT1B lacks antiviral activity despite being expressed in these cell lines. These results suggest that most IFIT1B proteins (except for the putatively non-functional human IFIT1B) share cap0-mRNA recognition as a discriminant of their antiviral function."

We, therefore, infected our cell lines expressing either human IFIT1 or mouse IFIT1B with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus known to express mRNAs with a cap1-structure (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee, 1980</a>). As expected, we found that mouse IFIT1B had no effect on either virally-encoded GFP expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) or viral titers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). VSV viral titers were also unaffected by other IFIT1B genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In contrast, we observed a substantial decrease in both viral-GFP expression and viral titer in cells expressing human IFIT1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). This inhibitory activity was also conserved in other primate IFIT1 proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), suggesting that multiple IFIT1 proteins are insensitive to cap1-methyltransferase and share the property of inhibiting VSV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Together with our vaccinia virus data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), these data support the conclusion that IFIT1B and IFIT1 encode non-redundant antiviral specificities that together expand the antiviral range of the IFIT gene repertoire in mammals."

Immunity proteins are driven to innovate continually to maintain effective defenses against an evolving barrage of pathogens (<a href=\"#bib12\">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</a>). One common genetic mechanism of innovation employed by host genomes is gene duplication, which enables hosts to either escape viral antagonism or evolve new inhibitory mechanisms through subfunctionalization. Indeed, many antiviral genes expressed as part of the interferon response represent members of multigene families, whose lineage-specific expansions and contractions have shaped contemporary repertoires of antivirals in mammalian genomes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brunette et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Munk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tareen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>).

These findings are consistent with mRNA translation control being a major axis of regulation of viral replication (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the finding that mouse IFIT1B represses the translation of mRNAs lacking Cap1-structures appeared to resolve the conundrum of how at least this IFIT protein discriminates between 'self' and 'non-self' (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daffis et al., 2010</a>). However, the broad application of this result for IFIT1 function was complicated by apparently contradictory findings that mouse and human representatives of IFIT1 have different antiviral specificities (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrejeva et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Daffis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pichlmair et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pinto et al., 2015</a>).

Consistent with this prediction, our data indicate that only IFIT1B proteins distinguish 'self from non-self' mRNAs by recognizing an unmethylated (cap0-) mRNA structure, a molecular pattern that is absent on 2'O-methylated (cap1-) host mRNAs. However, the general antiviral effectiveness of IFIT1B proteins is limited due to the fact that every mammalian virus family, except alphaviruses, has evolved a way to produce cap1-mRNAs. Viral cap1-mRNAs are produced either by nuclear transcription and use of the host nuclear capping machinery (e.g., retroviruses and many DNA viruses), or cap-snatching (e.g., orthomyxoviruses), or virally encoding cap1-methyltransferases (e.g., poxviruses and rhabdoviruses) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Decroly et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hyde and Diamond, 2015</a>). Even in the case of alphaviruses, which produce cap0-mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee, 1980</a>) and are therefore predicted to be susceptible to IFIT1B-mediated inhibition, secondary structure changes at the 5' end of alphaviral mRNAs can blunt IFIT1B antiviral action (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hyde et al., 2014</a>). Given all of these viral counter-strategies, it might appear that IFIT1B is on the losing side of the arms race between host and most viruses. These counter-strategies may partially explain why we find that <i>IFIT1B</i> has been deleted or pseudogenized at least seven separate times in mammalian evolution. Even in humans, which encode a full-length <i>IFIT1B</i> ORF, IFIT1B activity appears to have been lost both due to lack of interferon-inducibility (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fensterl and Sen, 2011</a>) as well as loss of protein function (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6D</a>)."

IFIT1 mechanism and antiviral specificity have been enigmatic in part due to incorrect comparisons with mouse IFIT1B. By experimentally separating the functions of IFIT1 and IFIT1B from the rest of the innate immune system, we now show that IFIT1 has evolved a molecular specificity that differs from IFIT1B and is not blocked by cap1-methyltransferase. For example, using a yeast genetic assay, we show that IFIT1, unlike IFIT1B, potently inhibits yeast growth independent of whether human cap1-methyltransferase is co-expressed. Moreover, IFIT1, but not IFIT1B, inhibits replication of VSV, a virus encoding a cap1-methyltransferase. These results establish that these two paralogous immunity factors have distinct molecular function and highlight a significant role for IFIT1 in specific antiviral defense that is distinct from IFIT1B."

While several possibilities exist for how IFIT1-mediated translational repression might be controlled, we favor the possibility that IFIT1, like its paralog IFIT1B, distinguishes a 'self versus non-self' pattern on mRNA to selectively inhibit viral replication. Supporting this model is the fact that in addition to IFIT1B, IFIT2 and IFIT5 have been reported to have sequence- or structure-specific binding to RNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Habjan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Katibah et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that numerous IFITs may restrict viral replication through recognition of distinct viral RNA patterns. Although the presumed molecular pattern that IFIT1 recognizes remains unknown, our data suggest that mammalian hosts, as well as vaccinia virus, possess a 'self' molecular pattern to prevent IFIT1-mediated inhibition whereas yeast and VSV display a 'non-self' molecular pattern that cannot block IFIT1 action. One previous proposal suggested that human IFIT1 antiviral activity resulted from direct binding and sequestration of 5' triphosphate ends of viral replication intermediates, thus interfering with replication rather than directly inhibiting translation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pichlmair et al., 2011</a>). We instead favor a model in which IFIT1 recognizes a distinct 'self versus non-self' pattern to inhibit mRNA translation directly, similar to IFIT1B. Biochemical data suggests that IFIT1, like IFIT1B, binds to cap-proximal RNA and prevents binding of mRNAs by the translation initiation factor eIF4F (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kumar et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, human IFIT1 was shown to not just inhibit replication of PIV5, but to inhibit translation of PIV5 2'O-methylated mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrejeva et al., 2013</a>). Finally, our observation that IFIT1 expression also inhibits yeast growth suggests that it is not a viral replication intermediate, but rather a 'non-self' pattern, which is recognized by IFIT1, similar to the lack of mRNA 2'O-methylation for IFIT1B. While the methylation state of the first transcribed nucleotide (cap0-structure versus cap1-structure) is not the determinant of IFIT1 specificity, other chemical modifications near the cap, or mRNA sequence determinants, may allow IFIT1 to distinguish 'self' from 'non-self' to selectivity inhibit viral replication."

For instance, two cat IFIT proteins, which are practically identical in their N-terminal two-thirds, but divergent in their C-terminus, fully recapitulate the expected properties of IFIT1 and IFIT1B in our yeast assay. Use of other such \u2018natural\u2019 chimeras can help guide the biochemical dissection of what provides IFIT1B with its unique cap0-mRNA recognition properties and provide insight into how IFIT1 has evolved its distinct specificity. The naturally occurring recombination breakpoint in the IFIT1/1B gene conversion tracts also suggests features of IFITs that are critical for a common aspect of IFIT1/1B activity versus those that promote their distinct molecular specificity. In the structures of IFIT5 bound to the 5' triphosphate containing end of RNA, three 'subdomains' surround the RNA (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbas et al., 2013</a>). The recombination breakpoint we observed falls within the 'pivot' region separating the second and third subdomain (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting the first two subdomains may be important for a common conserved function of IFIT1 and IFIT1B whereas the third subdomain might confer changes to the molecular specificity. We also note that the breakpoint occurs just outside of the homooligomerization domain in the structure of IFIT2 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). As some IFITs are thought to oligomerize for function (<a href=\"#bib23\">Habjan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pichlmair et al., 2011</a>), the homogenization of the region corresponding to the oligomerization domain in IFIT2 suggests that IFIT1 and IFIT1B might also need to hetero-oligomerize in species in which both are present."

For instance, the duplication of <i>IFIT1B</i> genes in rodents might have been driven by pressure from alphaviruses or other undiscovered cap0-mRNA expressing viruses, and may augment the defenses of rodent hosts against such viruses. In contrast, the loss of <i>IFIT1</i> in many rodents might leave them more susceptible to infection by viruses inhibited by IFIT1, such as VSV. Similarly, loss of IFIT1B function in a broad range of species, including humans, may result in greater ability of cap0-mRNA expressing viruses to replicate in those species. In that regard, rodents may be better prepared than humans, chimpanzees, New World monkeys and several other species to defend against cap0-mRNA expressing viruses such as alphaviruses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Thus, <i>IFIT</i> gene duplication may be the host's response to the evolutionary arms race where viruses are continually masking their RNAs with 'self' features. On the other hand, when the selective pressure from viruses displaying a given 'non-self' feature (e.g. Cap0-mRNAs) has been relaxed, the specific <i>IFIT</i> gene that restricts those viruses may be pseudogenized or lost permanently. Although compensatory mechanisms may have evolved that mitigate the consequences of loss of a single IFIT, our results indicate that lineage-specific loss of <i>IFIT</i> genes eliminates an elegant means to discriminate \u2018self versus non-self\u2019 RNAs from the host's armament. We predict that the dynamic evolution of IFIT genes across mammals will have important consequences for species-specific antiviral immunity."

However, we now lay out a clear rationale for why we parsimoniously favor the model that IFIT1 recognizes a novel mRNA pattern to inhibit translation: \u201cOur study does not elucidate the molecular means by which human IFIT1 inhibits viral replication. While several possibilities exist for how IFIT1-mediated translational repression might be controlled, we favor the possibility that IFIT1, like its paralog IFIT1B, distinguishes a 'self versus non-self' pattern on mRNA to selectively inhibit viral replication. Supporting this model is the fact that in addition to IFIT1B, IFIT2 and IFIT5 have been reported to have sequence- or structure-specific binding to RNA (Habjan et al., 2013; Katibah et al., 2013; Katibah et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2012), suggesting that numerous IFITs may restrict viral replication through recognition of distinct viral RNA patterns. Although the presumed molecular pattern that IFIT1 recognizes remains unknown, our data suggest that mammalian hosts, as well as vaccinia virus, possess a 'self' molecular pattern to prevent IFIT1-mediated inhibition whereas yeast and VSV display a 'non-self' molecular pattern that cannot block IFIT action.\u201d"
