                    "text": "Elucidating cardiac evolution has been frustrated by lack of fossils. One celebrated enigma in cardiac evolution involves the transition from a cardiac outflow tract dominated by a multi-valved conus arteriosus in basal actinopterygians, to an outflow tract commanded by the non-valved, elastic, bulbus arteriosus in higher actinopterygians. We demonstrate that cardiac preservation is possible in the extinct fish <i>Rhacolepis buccalis</i> from the Brazilian Cretaceous. Using X-ray synchrotron microtomography, we show that <i>Rhacolepis</i> fossils display hearts with a conus arteriosus containing at least five valve rows. This represents a transitional morphology between the primitive, multivalvar, conal condition and the derived, monovalvar, bulbar state of the outflow tract in modern actinopterygians. Our data rescue a long-lost cardiac phenotype (119-113 Ma) and suggest that outflow tract simplification in actinopterygians is compatible with a gradual, rather than a drastic saltation event. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of studying cardiac evolution in fossils."

One celebrated enigma in cardiac evolution involves the transition from a cardiac outflow tract dominated by a multi-valved conus arteriosus in basal actinopterygians, to an outflow tract commanded by the non-valved, elastic, bulbus arteriosus in higher actinopterygians. We demonstrate that cardiac preservation is possible in the extinct fish <i>Rhacolepis buccalis</i> from the Brazilian Cretaceous. Using X-ray synchrotron microtomography, we show that <i>Rhacolepis</i> fossils display hearts with a conus arteriosus containing at least five valve rows. This represents a transitional morphology between the primitive, multivalvar, conal condition and the derived, monovalvar, bulbar state of the outflow tract in modern actinopterygians. Our data rescue a long-lost cardiac phenotype (119-113 Ma) and suggest that outflow tract simplification in actinopterygians is compatible with a gradual, rather than a drastic saltation event. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of studying cardiac evolution in fossils."

The conus arteriosus displays multiple fibrous valve rows, a character state that represents the general gnathostome condition, primitively retained in basal actinopterygian groups (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dur\u00e1n et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boas, 1880</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boas, 1901</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Schib et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Xavier-Neto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Parsons, 1929</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Icardo et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dur\u00e1n et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Icardo et al., 2002b</a>). The multiple conal valve rows of basal actinopterygians prevent backflow and protect the delicate gill vessels from the elevated pulsations generated by the ventricle (<a href=\"#bib41\">Satchell and Jones, 1967</a>). In contrast, in derived actinopterygians such as the teleost zebrafish, the valveless bulbus arteriosus protects the gills through its prominent elastic properties (i.e. functioning as a windkessel [<a href=\"#bib19\">Farrell, 1979</a>]). Thus, teleost hearts display only one valve row at the bulbo-ventricular transition, which is now regarded as an evolutionary remnant of the conus arteriosus (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grimes et al., 2006</a>)."

The emphasis on the bulbus arteriosus, rather than on the conus arteriosus in teleosts, and the concurrent reduction in the number of outflow valve rows are presently almost completely unconstrained in evolutionary and developmental times. We know that the primitive actinopterygian <i>Polypterus</i> diverged from other actinopterygian lineages (including the zebrafish) by about 390 Mya (<a href=\"#bib48\">Takeuchi et al., 2009</a>) and that the elastic bulbus arteriosus of teleosts represents a very late ontogenetic addition, being added to the heart only after cardiac chambers are formed (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grimes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grimes and Kirby, 2009</a>). With such limited information, it is impossible to answer whether outflow tract simplification in teleosts represented another case of phyletic gradualism, or resulted from drastic developmental effects. Significant morphological changes are sometimes associated with major genetic changes, such as large-scale gene duplications and/or changes in the function of genes with major developmental effects, both known to have taken place in teleost evolution (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shapiro et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shubin et al., 1997</a>). Knowledge of morphological transitions between character states is critical to the construction of any evolutionary hypothesis.

Part of the problem is that the heart is formed by soft tissues, which fossilize only under special conditions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martill, 1988</a>). However, other soft organs have been described in the Cretaceous of Araripe, Brazil (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martill, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pradel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brito et al., 2010</a>) and even in Paleozoic fishes (380 million-years old) from the Gogo Formation in Australia (<a href=\"#bib51\">Trinajstic et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Long et al., 2008</a>) and Antarctica (<a href=\"#bib54\">Young et al., 2010</a>), which suggests that the difficulty lies not with cardiac preservation, but with the lack of a systematic search."

However, an unequivocal association of evolution with complexity is not a requirement of evolutionary theory (<a href=\"#bib15\">Darwin and Wallace, 1858</a>).

Indeed, cases of morphological simplification reported in the literature most likely represent only a fraction of the examples that falsify the notion that evolution must lead to increased complexity. Many other examples of simplification are found in the evolution of animal circulatory systems (<a href=\"#bib53\">Xavier-Neto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brusca and Brusca, 2003</a>).

However, this does not prevent informed speculation that may set parameters for investigation in extant species with longer, or shorter, divergence times from the exuberantly valved <i>Polypterus</i>. In this sense, it is useful to observe that valve reductions in acipenseriforms and amiiforms are uncoupled from the teleost extra round of large-scale genome duplication that may, or may not, have affected <i>R. buccalis</i>. This suggests the possibility that slow, smaller scale, mutational events produced incremental phenotypic changes, which may have been gradually selected for outflow tract simplification in teleosts (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shapiro et al., 2004</a>)."

Although we deal here with outflow composition and number of valve rows as independent characters, it is possible that these traits are not completely independent, and that the relevant parameter is simply the relative extent of outflow tract occupied by the conus arteriosus and its valves, or by the bulbus arteriosus and its valveless, elastic, character (<a href=\"#bib36\">Munoz-Chapuli et al., 1997</a>). Outflow tract variability among actinopterygians was modeled according to Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion paradigm (<a href=\"#bib36\">Munoz-Chapuli et al., 1997</a>). The major conclusion of this exercise was that the various rows of valves distributed across the cranio-caudal extent of the conus arteriosus and the interspersed valveless spaces can be described as an ensemble of multiple positive and negative domains of endothelial to mesenchymal transformation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Runyan and Markwald, 1983</a>) set up by the interaction between diffusible molecules playing activator and inhibitor roles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Munoz-Chapuli et al., 1997</a>)."

For all samples, we set a propagation phase contrast microtomography protocol with a sample/detector distance of about 10\u2009m. On ID17, we had a monochromatic beam (double-bended Laue crystals) of 150 keV. On ID19, we used a filtered pink beam (Wiggler W150 with a gap of 28\u2009mm, filters: Al, 2.8\u2009mm; Cu, 8\u2009mm; W, 1\u2009mm) with a total integrated energy of 210 keV. Two optic systems were utilized depending on the size of the nodules: a 0.5x magnification system with a FreLoN-2K camera resulting in a recorded isotropic pixel size of about 28 \u00b5m and a 0.3x magnification system with a FreLoN-2K camera resulting in a recorded isotropic pixel size of about 47 \u00b5m. The tomographies were computed based on 4998 projections over 360 degrees (pixel in horizontal x vertical: 1740x300 on ID19; 1800x130 on ID17). The exposure time per projection was 0.2\u2009s on ID17 and 0.07\u2009s on ID19. As the vertical field of view could not cover the full height of a nodule, multiple scans were necessary for each specimen, with a minimum overlap of 30% between each scan to correct the vertical profile of the X-ray beam. The reconstructed volumes were stitched together to visualize whole nodules and by optimizing the overall contrast (i.e. stretching the range of grey values from the 32 bit raw data into a 16 bit full range of values, avoiding too high levels of saturation)."

It is difficult to argue for phyletic gradualism over punctuated equilibrium (Discussion, seventh paragraph) with just one data point as the rates of evolution are determined either by dating a series of fossils and their morphological changes over time (Eldridge and Gould 19742 original paper) or by using software like BEAST (e.g. see Lee et al. Science 2014, 345: 562) using 'super' character matrices incorporating autapomorphies into the mix (not done here). Whilst one can infer this is a likely evolutionary scenario, it is largely based on evidence from living actinopterygians. Accordingly, the discussion needs to be more critical with stating that this is a speculation about rates of evolution of the actinopterygian heart (rather than presenting new evidence based on a series of data, not just one point)."

The current hypothesis put forward in the manuscript is not fully compatible with the known morphology of the outflow tract in extant species. This needs to be deeply revised as it is basic to advance any further evolutionary hypothesis. The second major point concerns the limitations in the interpretation that can be inferred from a single specimen in time. It is difficult to argue for phyletic gradualism over punctuated equilibrium (Discussion, seventh paragraph) with just one data point as the rates of evolution are determined either by dating a series of fossils and their morphological changes over time (Eldridge and Gould 19742 original paper) or by using software like BEAST (e.g. see Lee et al. Science 2014, 345: 562) using 'super' character matrices incorporating autapomorphies into the mix (not done here). Whilst one can infer this is a likely evolutionary scenario, it is largely based on evidence from living actinopterygians. Accordingly, the discussion needs to be more critical with stating that this is a speculation about rates of evolution of the actinopterygian heart (rather than presenting new evidence based on a series of data, not just one point).</i>"

We acknowledge that there is not enough data to prove that the phyletic hypothesis. However, the case for the competing hypothesis (i.e. a saltation event) is even less likely because, collectively, data from extant species seem to contradict it in at least three instances, as we refer in the text. This is because the process of outflow tract simplification involved at least three major transitions. One transition at the base of the teleost radiation (around 284 Ma (Betancur et al., 2013, Broughton et al., 2013)) from dozens of valves to five valves (e.g. from <i>Polypterus</i>, to <i>R. buccalis</i>); another transition from five to two valves (e.g. from <i>R. buccalis</i> to living elopomorphs \u2013 except <i>Elops</i>); and yet another transition to the single outflow valve retained in all other teleosts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It seems to us that these three transitions alluded above fit much better into the model of phyletic gradualism, than into the alternative hypothesis of saltation."
