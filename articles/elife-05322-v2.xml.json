However, only a few lysine deacetylases (KDACs) have been identified in prokaryotes, perhaps in part due to their limited sequence homology. Herein, we developed a \u2018clip-chip\u2019 strategy to enable unbiased, activity-based discovery of novel KDACs in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> proteome. In-depth biochemical characterization confirmed that YcgC is a serine hydrolase involving Ser200 as the catalytic nucleophile for lysine deacetylation and does not use NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> like other established KDACs. Further, in vivo characterization demonstrated that YcgC regulates transcription by catalyzing deacetylation of Lys52 and Lys62 of a transcriptional repressor RutR. Importantly, YcgC targets a distinct set of substrates from the only known <i>E. coli</i> KDAC CobB. Analysis of YcgC\u2019s bacterial homologs confirmed that they also exhibit KDAC activity. YcgC thus represents a novel family of prokaryotic KDACs."

However, only a few lysine deacetylases (KDACs) have been identified in prokaryotes, perhaps in part due to their limited sequence homology. Herein, we developed a \u2018clip-chip\u2019 strategy to enable unbiased, activity-based discovery of novel KDACs in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> proteome. In-depth biochemical characterization confirmed that YcgC is a serine hydrolase involving Ser200 as the catalytic nucleophile for lysine deacetylation and does not use NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> like other established KDACs. Further, in vivo characterization demonstrated that YcgC regulates transcription by catalyzing deacetylation of Lys52 and Lys62 of a transcriptional repressor RutR. Importantly, YcgC targets a distinct set of substrates from the only known <i>E. coli</i> KDAC CobB. Analysis of YcgC\u2019s bacterial homologs confirmed that they also exhibit KDAC activity. YcgC thus represents a novel family of prokaryotic KDACs."

Recent mass spectrometry (MS) efforts have revealed that many proteins are acetylated in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, although only a single <i>E. coli</i> lysine deacetylase (KDAC), CobB, has been identified so far (<a href=\"#bib3\">Choudhary et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Henriksen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Zhang et al., 2013a</a>). The fact that induction of CobB only had a limited impact on reducing the global protein acetylation level suggests that additional KDACs may exist. However, homolog searching has failed to reveal any additional KDACs in <i>E. coli</i>, presumably because these enzymes emerged via convergent evolution. In contrast to bioinformatics methods, biochemical approaches have proven effective for identifying new enzymes resulting from convergent evolution (<a href=\"#bib22\">Tsukada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Yamane et al., 2006</a>), though their laborious, time-consuming nature has limited their applications to high-throughput, proteome-wide screens. Herein, we established a \u2018clip-chip\u2019 approach to enable a proteome-wide, activity-based search for novel KDACs in <i>E. coli</i>."

The substrate slide is created by immobilizing a substrate of interest onto a nitrocellulose-coated slide. After thousands of purified proteins are spotted on a plain glass slide, it is then \u2018clipped\u2019 onto the substrate slide in a face-to-face manner, resulting in the delivery of the proteins onto the substrate slide. Owing to the highly porous nature of nitrocellulose and the tiny volume of the protein droplets (0.3\u20130.5 nL), the delivered protein droplets are immediately absorbed and kept locally in the nitrocellulose, preventing cross-contamination. To determine which transferred proteins possess the enzymatic activity in question, the \u2018clipped\u2019 substrate slide is then incubated with an appropriate reaction buffer, followed by signal detection."

Next, we created a quintuple Ser-to-Ala mutant (i.e., 5SA) in YcgC and tested its ability to deacetylate RutR in vitro. As compared with the WT YcgC, the 5SA mutant appeared devoid of RutR deacetylase activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). To determine which of the five Ser residues was likely to be the catalytic nucleophile for hydrolase activity, we incubated WT YcgC with hydrolase inhibitor AEBSF and the following MS/MS analysis revealed that Ser200 was the only conserved residue that was covalently labeled with AEBSF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). To confirm its importance, a Ser200-to-Ala (S200A) mutant was created and tested in the same in vitro assay.

This behavior was also observed with deacetylation by the sirtuin family member CobB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). This phenomenon is not typically associated with protein deacetylation and we considered the possibility that proteolytic degradation of deacetylated RutR was occurring. N-terminal Edman sequencing of RutR after YcgC treatment showed N-terminal truncation with loss of 14 residues (N-MTQGAVKTTGKRSR) or 11 residues (N-MTQGAVKTTGK). RutR without YcgC treatment was also sequenced, no N-terminal truncation was observed. We considered the possibility that YcgC might show protease activity in addition to its unambiguous deacetylase activity. However, we believe this is unlikely since treatment of RutR with the sirtuin CobB, mechanistically and structurally unrelated to YcgC, induces a similar N-terminal truncation in RutR, visualized by SDS-PAGE and detected by N-terminal sequencing with loss of 14 residues. We suspect that this N-terminal cleavage of RutR results from autoproteolysis. To explore this possibility, intact RutR proteins were first heat-denatured and then incubated with either YcgC or CobB under the same deacetylation conditions. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, heat-denatured RutR could be partially deacetylated by both YcgC and CobB, but did not show a downshifting on SDS-PAGE. These results are consistent with the possibility that deacetylation of native acetylated RutR sparks autoproteolysis but denaturation inhibits this autoproteolytic activity."

Although YcgC shows limited homology to components of the phosphotransferase system\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Punta et al., 2012</a>), no statistically significant homologs were identified in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Molin et al., 2003</a>). However, many prokaryotic homologs with high similarity were readily identified. Other than homologs from <i>Escherichia</i> strains, the closet homolog is the DhaM protein from <i>Shigella</i> sp. (str. 2457T), and statistically significant homologs were also identified in more remotely related bacterial species. Therefore, we selected five homologs, representing a wide range of homology, for closer scrutiny (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Sequence alignment of the five representative homologs with YcgC showed that the N-terminal regions (i.e., amino acids 1\u20132501\u2013250) of these proteins are more conserved than the C-terminal regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). To determine whether these YcgC homologs possess protein deacetylase activity, the five selected genes were synthesized, subcloned into the same IPTG-inducible expression vector as that of <i>E. coli</i> YcgC, and transformed into <i>E. coli</i>. After a 4 hr induction of each YcgC homolog, changes in global acetylation profiles were determined with two pan \u03b1-AcK antibodies and compared with that for WT cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>). Results clearly showed that induction of each of the five YcgC homologs gave rise to a unique protein deacetylation signature that is different from that of the WT and <i>YcgC</i>-induced strains. For example, overexpression of the <i>Klebsiella</i> homolog significantly reduced the acetylation levels of proteins at ~55 kDa (red box; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). As another example, overexpression of the <i>Pantoea</i> homolog substantially reduced the acetylation levels of proteins around 60 and 43 kDa compared with the WT strain (wide and narrow red boxes; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that all five YcgC homologs possess readily detectable KDAC activity with different substrate preferences. Because YcgC and its homologs share little similarity with all the known KDACs identified so far, and because its activity does not require NAD<sup>+</sup>\u00a0or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, these results strongly suggest that this group represents a novel prokaryotic KDAC family."

A surprising observation was that, after deacetylated by either YcgC or CobB, the RutR showed a significant downshift on SDS-PAGE, suggesting possible proteolytic activity. Further biochemical analysis established that this is likely autoproteolysis of RutR that is stimulated by deacetylation of K62. Our data suggest that acetylation of RutR may enhance its stability. Indeed, endogenous RutR purified from cells grown under standard conditions is heavily acetylated.

It has been puzzling until now how RutR represses target gene transcription by its previously reported binding to coding regions of <i>pmrD</i> and <i>gcd</i>, as the binding sites are located hundreds of base pairs downstream of the start codons, and deletion of <i>rutR</i> does not enhance their expression levels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Umezawa et al., 2008</a>). Based on the results of this study, we propose that YcgC deacetylates RutR leading in turn to the recruitment of additional cofactors that enhance silencing of target gene expression. As PmrD has been demonstrated to serve as a connector between multiple two-component signal-transduction systems in <i>Salmonella enterica, E. coli</i>, and other bacteria, our study also suggests the possibility of crosstalk between protein acetylation and phosphorylation in <i>E. coli</i>, a prevalent regulatory mechanism found in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Eguchi and Utsumi, 2005</a>)."

First, as an activity-based screen, this method can be readily adopted to search for many other types of enzyme activities. Second, the clip-chip approach does not require any prior knowledge of the enzymes of interest as long as a robust biochemical assay is available. Third, it is a proteome-wide, high-throughput screen that does not require further deconvolution (e.g., in MS/MS) of the positive signals because of the use of a protein microarray on which each protein is physically addressable. Finally, the clip-chip approach is capable of functional annotation of enzymes using both gain- and loss-of-signal reactions. We envision that the \u2018clip-chip\u2019 strategy will proved to be of wide application for the de novo discovery of enzyme activity in biology."

To demonstrate that the down-shifted RutR was <i>not</i> caused by protease activity of YcgC, we repeated the MS/MS analysis several more times against the down-shifted RutR bands recovered from PAGE gels. (Please also see our response to Point 3 below.) To our satisfaction, we obtained a peptide-coverage for up to 95% and with both the N- and C- terminal of the full-length RutR, indicating that the down-shifted RutR was very unlikely to be caused by protease cleavage. Moreover, we observed that CobB-deacetylated RutR protein also appeared as a similar down-shifted band on SDS-PAGE, providing further confirmation of our interpretation of the data. Taken together, these additional results help establish that YcgC is a bona fide deacetylase and not a protease.

It is evident that the endogenous level of YcgC is very low as shown in the control lane in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>.

The FLAG tag may also affect the mobility, as well as other PTMs."

Precisely because of this, it is important to make sure as much as possible that observations reported are not due to a contaminating protease activity. The MS data showing 95% sequence coverage of RutR sequence cannot prove that there is no proteolysis. The fact that YcgC does not work on a synthetic peptide is another reason for concern. There are a couple of simple things that could be done to address this concern: 1) In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, include a negative control with CobB but without NAD<sup>+.</sup>If there is a protease contamination, it is likely an endogenous E. coli protein that is present in both the YcgC and CobB prep.

The major concern was the observation of the 5-kDa downshift of RutR after the treatment of either YcgC or CobB, as it raised the possibility that YcgC might act as a protease that cleaved off the acetylated lysines of RutR. To explicitly address this concern, we have performed a series of assays. First, we recovered the downshifted RutR after YcgC treatment (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and performed N-terminal Edman sequencing. We identified two versions of cleaved RutR: the major species involves deletion of 14-aa (N-MTQGAVKTTGKRSR), and the minor species involves deletion of 11 aa (N-MTQGAVKTTGK) from the N-terminus of RutR. Because the identified acetylated K52 and K62 are quite distant from the N-terminus, this N-terminal cleavage cannot account for YcgC\u2019s KDAC activity, although it still did not rule out YcgC\u2019s protease activity. Second, we sequenced the downshifted RutR after CobB treatment and found the same cleaved RutR missing the 14-aa at the N-terminus. Since CobB is a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent Class III sirtuin without any known protease activity, these results suggest that the RutR cleavage is intrinsic to RutR autoproteolysis. Third, to test whether RutR carries any protease activity, intact RutR proteins were heat-denatured and then incubated with either YcgC or CobB under the same deacetylation conditions. It became clear that denatured RutR could no longer downshift, while YcgC and CobB could still significantly deacetylate denatured RutR as compared with the untreated RutR. Finally, we examined the role of specific lysines in RutR\u2019s proteolytic activity. As suggested by the reviewers, we created K52R, K62R and K52/62R mutants in RutR and tested them together with all the K-to-Q mutants in YcgC deacetylation reactions. On the basis of the ratios of cleaved/intact RutR in each reaction, we observed that when K62 was deacetylated in either K52Q or K52R, the proteolytic activity of these mutated RutR was almost as strong as WT RutR. In contrast, K62Q, K62R, and the two double mutants showed significantly lower proteolytic activities. Taken together, the above results confirmed YcgC\u2019s KDAC activity and revealed that the autoproteolytic activity of RutR is dependent on deacetylation of K52/62 with K62 playing a major role. Because these new results are both important and interesting, we added a new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and supplemental figures (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</a>) to fully describe our new observations."
