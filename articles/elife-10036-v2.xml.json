However, the differentiation steps between epicardial cells and caSMCs are unknown as are the final maturation signals at coronary arteries. Here, we use clonal analysis and lineage tracing to show that caSMCs derive from pericytes, mural cells associated with microvessels, and that these cells are present in adults. During development following the onset of blood flow, pericytes at arterial remodeling sites upregulate Notch3 while endothelial cells express Jagged-1. Deletion of Notch3 disrupts caSMC differentiation. Our data support a model wherein epicardial-derived pericytes populate the entire coronary microvasculature, but differentiate into caSMCs at arterial remodeling zones in response to Notch signaling. Our data are the first demonstration that pericytes are progenitors for smooth muscle, and their presence in adult hearts reveals a new potential cell type for targeting during cardiovascular disease."

However, the differentiation steps between epicardial cells and caSMCs are unknown as are the final maturation signals at coronary arteries. Here, we use clonal analysis and lineage tracing to show that caSMCs derive from pericytes, mural cells associated with microvessels, and that these cells are present in adults. During development following the onset of blood flow, pericytes at arterial remodeling sites upregulate Notch3 while endothelial cells express Jagged-1. Deletion of Notch3 disrupts caSMC differentiation. Our data support a model wherein epicardial-derived pericytes populate the entire coronary microvasculature, but differentiate into caSMCs at arterial remodeling zones in response to Notch signaling. Our data are the first demonstration that pericytes are progenitors for smooth muscle, and their presence in adult hearts reveals a new potential cell type for targeting during cardiovascular disease."

Upon further investigation, Volz et al. found that these cells were so-called pericytes, which otherwise support small blood vessels throughout the body. Furthermore, the pericytes that did not develop into SMCs remained near the coronary arteries and were still present in adult hearts. Lastly, experiments showed that a protein called Notch-3 is expressed on pericytes and interacts with another protein called Jagged-1 on endothelial cells to prompt the conversion of pericytes into SMCs."

CAs are the vessels that supply blood to ventricular heart muscle and are composed of an inner endothelial cell lining wrapped by a smooth muscle covering. Coronary artery smooth muscle cells (caSMC) are particularly important due to their role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. However, caSMC development, both normally during embryogenesis and ectopically during coronary artery disease, is a poorly understood process."

In the murine heart, coronary endothelial cells derived primarily from the sinus venosus and endocardial cells that sprout onto the heart to form an early vascular plexus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kattan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Red-Horse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). A subset of the plexus vessels differentiates into arteries once the network attaches to the aorta and begins receiving blood flow (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al, 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hood et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Peeters et al., 1997</a>). Although ultimately adjacent to CA endothelial cells, the source of caSMCs is different. These cells arise from the mesothelial covering of the heart called the epicardium (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mikawa and Gourdie, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wilm et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). In rodents, caSMCs reside deep within the myocardium while epicardial cells are located on the outermost layer of the heart. During embryonic development, many epicardial cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate into the deeper layers of the myocardium to form the stromal cells of the heart, including cardiac fibroblasts and caSMCs. Inhibition of epicardial migration from the surface by deletion of Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) diminishes caSMC development\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Mellgren, et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2011</a>). However, the migrating epicardial-derived cell type fated to become caSMCs has not been discovered, and the mechanisms that trigger this intermediate progenitor to differentiate into caSMCs are unknown."

Mesothelial to vascular smooth muscle differentiation occurred almost exclusively during developmental and early postnatal stages, but, similar to the heart, the cellular pathway bridging the surface to internal arteries has not been identified. Epicardial mesothelium of the heart also has a developmental restriction. Most migrating caSMC progenitors leave the heart surface before embryonic day 12.5 and are no longer able to migrate into the adult heart, either normally or following myocardial infarction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wei et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). However, since this time point is long before caSMCs appear, it is unclear what cell type resides in the heart to eventually receive signals to become new smooth muscle around forming arteries and whether this cell type persists in the adult. The discovery of such an intermediate progenitor could identify a cell type that could aid collateral artery formation during disease."

Pericytes are mural cells that wrap microvascular blood vessels and regulate their development and function (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armulik et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cappellari et al., 2013</a>). Pericytes share features with smooth muscle cells including close apposition to the vessel and some molecular markers, but differ in their contractile protein expression, cell shape, location on capillaries instead of large vessels, and discontinuous covering of the endothelium. Since their identification in 1873 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rouget, 1873</a>), biologists have wondered whether pericytes and smooth muscle differentiate into each other, but direct evidence has been lacking (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armulik et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cappellari et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Majesky, 2011</a>). We provide evidence that pericytes lining the coronary vascular plexus respond to Notch3 signaling at arterial remodeling zones to become mature caSMCs during embryonic development. We also observed caSMC related pericytes in the adult heart presenting the possibility that the Notch3 pathway could be manipulated in these cells to participate in CA regeneration."

At embryonic day (e) 13.5, the plexus vessels attach to the aorta and begin to receive blood flow (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2014a</a>). Subsequently, vascular remodeling, or fusion and enlargement of plexus vessels, is observed directly downstream of the aortic attachment site where future arteries will form (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2014a</a>). SM-MHC protein expression was first observed at e14.5 in plexus vessels that had begun to remodel into arteries (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013B\u2019\u201d</a>). At e14.5 smooth muscle coverage was patchy and consisted of cells with both low and high SM-MHC (SM-MHC<sup>low</sup> or SM-MHC<sup>high</sup>) protein expression (fluorescence measured from single confocal z-planes)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u201d\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As this initial remodeling zone transitioned into recognizable arterial vessels at e15.5, caSMC coverage increased and most cells were SM-MHC<sup>high</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013C\u201d\u2019</a>). Remodeling zones with patchy SM-MHC<sup>low</sup> cells were now just distal to the more mature vessels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u201d\u2019</a>). These distal remodeling zones eventually transformed into mature vessels in the next developmental stage at e16.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013D\u201d\u2019</a>). These data identify when and where SM-MHC<sup>+</sup> caSMCs differentiate within the context of the whole heart at single-cell resolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Epicardial-driven Cre-expressing mice for lineage tracing exist; however, these constructs label all the other epicardial-derived stromal cells in the heart in addition to caSMCs. We needed to study the smooth muscle lineage in isolation, which is done most accurately using clonal level labeling where single cells and all their progeny are genetically marked with a fluorescent tag (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buckingham and Meilhac, 2011</a>). Our approach was to identify caSMC progenitors by analyzing fluorescently labeled sister cells within clonal clusters that also contain caSMCs. To produce clones, epicardial cells were sparsely labeled using T-box 18 (Tbx18)-Cre (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2008b</a>) coupled with the Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) Cre reporter system (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zong et al., 2005</a>). Tbx18-Cre was selected because, in control experiments with other Cre reporters, recombination was induced in the large majority of epicardial cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The MADM system fluorescently labels Cre-expressing cells through a rare interchromosomal recombination event such that, when coupled with Tbx18-Cre, hearts contained isolated clusters of fluorescently labeled cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We analyzed tightly associated clusters (at least 100 \u00b5m from any other labeled cell) that contained epicardium, caSMCs, and other clonally related cells, the latter of which could be the progenitor population."

This was in contrast to sister cells from clones that were adjacent to, but did not incorporate into, the caSMC layer, which were mostly located in the space between vessels instead of wrapping around them (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The morphology of the caSMC-associated sister cells was characteristic of vascular pericytes, which are mural cells that tightly associate with small blood vessels and regulate their development and function (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armulik et al., 2011</a>). To investigate the presence of pericytes in caSMC clones, we validated the use of a set of markers that would allow us to identify pericytes and caSMCs in the developing heart.

CaSMCs were positive for SM-MHC and PDGFR\u03b2 and were around mature and developing arteries (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, PDGFR\u03b2 perivascular cells around microvessels were SM-MHC negative (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We also analyzed the expression of two additional smooth muscle markers, Smooth Muscle Alpha Actin (SM\u03b1 and Calponin 1 (CNN1)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Majesky, 2011</a>). Aside from a low level in some cardiomyocytes, SM\u03b1 immunolabeling was only in larger, more proximal CAs, and not in PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup> cells around plexus capillaries (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) or in SM-MHC<sup>+</sup> cells in smaller vessels and remodeling zones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, in the coronary system, SM\u03b1 appeared to be induced later than SM-MHC since its expression domain was less extensive and only in more mature arteries. CNN1 was highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, but did not appear in intervening PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u00a0cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Around large coronary arteries a subset of caSMCs expressed CNN1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Whole mount immunohistochemistry showed that PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u00a0cells surrounding plexus capillaries in the free walls of the developing heart ventricles were always closely apposed to endothelial cells in contrast to PDGFR\u03b1<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts, which were dispersed between the endothelium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup> cells were also embedded within a Collagen IV-containing basement membrane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>).

PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u00a0cells were observed on the earliest coronary sprouts when the vessels first migrate directly beneath the epicardium and surrounded the entire plexus endothelium as it developed (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Later, at the arterial remodeling zone where caSMCs first differentiate, 98 \u00b1 % of PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u00a0cells were Tbx18-Cre lineage labeled consistent with most arising from the epicardium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). In addition, PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u00a0cells were the most numerous Tbx18-Cre traced cell type in this location (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). The remaining 28% were predominately fibroblasts as defined by their expression of PDGFR\u03b1 and variable proximity to the vessels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). At time points after arteries are formed, much of the coronary smooth muscle was also lineage labeled with Tbx18-Cre (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M</a>) in line with other studies showing an epicardial origin for these cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wilm et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). The epicardium is not thought to give rise to cells of the hematopoietic lineage, and, accordingly, PDGFR\u03b2 cells did not overlap with CD45 staining (data not shown). It must be noted that although eight criteria (PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>Notch3<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>\u2212</sup>SM\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup>PDGFR\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup>,\u00a0wrapping microvessels, embedded within basement membrane) suggested that PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u00a0perivascular cells are pericytes, we cannot exclude the possibility that the discovery of different markers will reveal this population to be a mix of pericytes and pericyte-like cells with different functions. However, based on current knowledge, the above described cell type will be referred to as pericytes below. In summary, given their marker expression, localization within the tissue, and cellular morphology, we defined PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u00a0cells to be cardiac pericytes of the developing coronary vasculature. We also show that they are the most common epicardially-derived cell type at the arterial remodeling zone making them a prime candidate for caSMC progenitors."

For the estimated clone generation rate, we then calculated the fraction of simulated clusters that were truly clonal (not comprised of more than one overlapping clones) to evaluate the likelihood that the observed clusters are indeed clonal. This analysis revealed that \u223c82% of the observed clusters were likely to derive from a single labeling event (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This same clonality rate was maintained when considered for hearts having a range of 1\u20136 clusters each (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which was the range observed in our e13.5 data set (mean value of 3.3 \u00b1 1.6).

At e13.5 before caSMCs are present, we obtained clones consisting of just epicardial cells and pericytes, the latter of which were always located directly beneath epicardial sister cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D-e13.5, E</a>). At e15.5, clones with caSMCs always contained pericytes that filled the region of the myocardium between the epicardium and smooth muscle and were continuous with, and often touching, related caSMCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D-e15.5, E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>,<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>).

Strikingly, adult Tbx18-Cre, MADM hearts frequently contained tightly packed clusters of lineage labeled cells consisting of pericytes and caSMCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>-adult)\u00a0(n = 20). Pericytes at this stage exhibited even longer, thinner processes that tracked along the vessels for greater than 5\u201310 times the length of their cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>-adult and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). The fact that these cells were not dispersed, even five weeks after labeling, shows that pericytes and caSMCs do not migrate significantly once their positions are established during development. In addition, our analysis indicates that pericytes around capillaries that are clonally related to caSMCs remain and function as cardiac pericytes in the adult heart (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Within established adult clones, the ratio between the number of pericytes and caSMCs was comparable to ratios calculated for total mural cells from three different regions of the heart (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This is the expected result if the epicardial to pericyte pathway is a prominent source of caSMCs. In total, our clonal analysis suggests that epicardial-derived pericytes surround the entire coronary plexus during embryonic development, but that these cells differentiate into caSMCs if located around vessels that enlarge to become arteries during remodeling. These pericytes also surround capillaries in the adult heart and could potentially become new caSMC if arterial remodeling were induced at this stage."

However, direct lineage tracing of pericytes is required to confirm this sequence of events. NG2 and Notch3 are well-established pericyte markers in other tissues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armulik et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kofler et al., 2011</a>). In the myocardium of the developing ventricle free walls, NG2- and Notch3-positive cells on the microvasculature always expressed PDGFR\u03b2 and wrapped vessels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013K</a>), which identified them as cardiac pericytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). NG2 and Notch3 also completely overlapped (n = 185 cells counted, data not shown). To test if pericytes differentiate into smooth muscle, we performed lineage tracing using two independent mouse lines, NG2-CreER (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>) and Notch3-CreER (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fre et al., 2011</a>). In embryos containing either the NG2-CreER or Notch3-CreER allele coupled with the fluorescent Cre reporter gene Rosa<sup>tdtomato</sup>, pericytes, but not caSMCs, were labeled by injecting tamoxifen at either e10.5\u00a0or e11.5. This restricts Cre activity to a time point after pericytes had formed but before caSMCs appear (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). If caSMCs arise from pericytes, this strategy should result in lineage labeled caSMCs, i.e. tdtomato\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

Quantifying the proportion of lineage labeled pericytes in the compact myocardium indicated that Cre recombination efficiency in PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>-</sup> perivascular cells (pericytes) was 21% and 38% with NG2-CreER and Notch3-CreER, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Similar percentages of labeling were seen in pericytes and caSMC (quantified in the compact myocardium) consistent with low recombination efficiencies in pericytes accounting for the incomplete caSMC tracing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, our analysis does not exclude the possibility of an additional source, particularly in regions not analyzed, i.e. the ventricular septum. One potential confounding factor is that both transgenes exhibited sporadic labeling in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ozerdem et al., 2001</a>), which was more rare in Notch3-CreER (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,G</a>). However, control experiments using Myh6-CreER showed that cardiomyocyte lineage tracing never labeled caSMCs (data not shown). Finally, NG2 and Notch3 were expressed in PDGFR\u03b2 perivascular cells that were characterized as cardiac pericytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), but, as stated above, we cannot exclude the possibility that these experiments traced pericyte-like SMC progenitors sharing attributes with traditional pericytes, specifically PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>Notch3<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>\u2212</sup>SM\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup>PDGFR\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup>,\u00a0wrapping microvessels, and embedded within the basement membrane. In summary, lineage tracing data from two independent Cre lines support a model where pericytes differentiate into caSMCs."

                                "text": "To identify molecular regulators of the pericyte to caSMC differentiation step, we characterized the expression of mural cell markers at the arterial remodeling zone. Among those investigated, Notch3 was upregulated in pericytes at the region where SM-MHC protein expression was initiated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). In fact, the arterial remodeling zone can be identified based on Notch3 staining intensity without visualizing vessel structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This pattern was in contrast to PDGFR\u03b2, which was uniformly expressed in mural cells throughout the vasculature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Jagged-1 has been shown to be a major ligand for Notch3 in other organs, where it is expressed in arterial endothelium and stimulates smooth muscle differentiation including inducing the expression of SM-MHC (<a href=\"#bib4\">Briot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Doi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">High et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hofmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kofler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Manderfield et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yang and Proweller, 2011</a>). We found high levels of Jagged-1 to be specifically expressed at arterial remodeling zones where SM-MHC<sup>+</sup> cells were developing and in CAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given that Jagged-1 has previously been identified as a shear stress-induced molecule in vitro (<a href=\"#bib29\">McCormick et al., 2001</a>), we investigated whether it could be regulated by blood flow in the heart. Coronary vessels are initially unperfused, but begin to receive blood flow after they attach to the aorta at e13.5 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2014a</a>). This time point correlated with the onset of robust Jagged-1 expression in endothelial cells of vessels directly downstream of the attachment site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013WT</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We analyzed a model of delayed CA stem attachment to the aorta, Isl1 heterozygosity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2008a</a>), which postpones the initiation of blood flow (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2014a</a>). Immunostaining Isl1 mutant hearts revealed that Jagged-1 was only upregulated in arterial remodeling zones of e13.5 hearts that had formed CA stems on the aorta to receive blood flow (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Isl1 mutant hearts also failed to upregulate Notch3 in pericytes suggesting that this change also requires signals downstream of blood flow (n = 9, data not shown). In summary, Notch3 is upregulated in pericytes at the arterial remodeling zone while its ligand Jagged-1 is induced in endothelial cells in the same region following the initiation of blood flow suggesting that this receptor-ligand pair could trigger caSMC differentiation in coronary pericytes."

Previous identification of the epicardial-derived caSMC progenitor had been hampered by the fact that multiple developmental pathways occur downstream of epicardial differentiation. We have overcome this hurdle by using clonal analysis to label differentiation steps downstream of a single epicardial cell. This single cell tracing analyzes whether cells are clonally related eliminating one caveat of population level Cre labeling experiments where a mistake in the cell types expressing Cre can produce misleading results. Our clonal analysis of epicardial-derived cells identified cells with the molecular marker and morphological profile of vascular pericytes as being lineage related to caSMCs. The temporal presence and position of pericytes in epicardial-derived clones suggested that pericytes were the intermediate differentiation step between the epicardium and smooth muscle. This sequence of events was confirmed by direct pericyte lineage tracing using two independent pericyte Cre lines. In addition, pericytes were the most numerous epicardial-derived cell type at the CA remodeling zone where they wrapped developing arteries, a location that would allow them to respond to arterial maturation signals. Thus, we used complimentary lineage analysis experiments consisting of clonal and population-based tracing to show that pericytes (or pericyte-like cells) travel along blood vessels as they enter the myocardium and function as progenitors for caSMCs."

                        "text": "Since pericytes wrap all small coronary vessels, we explored the signals that trigger their differentiation into caSMCs specifically at CA remodeling zones. We found that upon attachment to the aorta and establishment of blood flow, coronary endothelial cells downstream of the attachment site, which presumably receive the strongest blood flow, induce Jagged-1. Jagged-1 was not robustly expressed in a model of delayed aortic attachment and delayed initiation of blood flow. The Jagged-1 ligand Notch3 was upregulated in pericytes at the arterial remodeling zone, and caSMCs failed to differentiate in Notch3-null hearts. A delay in smooth muscle differentiation in the absence of Notch3 and Jagged-1 has been observed in other organ systems (<a href=\"#bib4\">Briot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Doi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">High et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hofmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Manderfield et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yang and Proweller, 2011</a>), however nothing is known about their roles in caSMC differentiation. Furthermore, due to the previous lack of knowledge of the lineage relationship between pericytes and smooth muscle cells, we are the first to show the importance of Notch3 signaling in stimulating the pericyte to smooth muscle transition. Jagged-1 and Notch signaling has been reported to be upregulated by sheer stress in vitro(<a href=\"#bib29\">McCormick et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Theodoris et al., 2015</a>), and we provide evidence that this occurs in vivo following coronary plexus attachment to the aorta. Together, our data support a working model (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) where epicardial cells differentiate into Notch3<sup>low</sup> pericytes that cover the entire coronary plexus as it populates the myocardium. Then, the pericytes located on plexus vessels that receive blood flow-induced Jagged-1 upregulate Notch3 and differentiate into caSMCs. Thus, blood flow initiation is correlated with molecular changes that mark the site of arterial development in the coronary vascular plexus and may stimulate vessel remodeling and pericyte differentiation into smooth muscle."

Studies dissecting the role of PDGFRs, TCF21, and Myocardin-Related Transcription Factors have provided evidence that the decision to differentiate into either the cardiac fibroblast or caSMC lineage occurs in epicardial cells at the heart\u2019s surface (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acharya et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Braitsch et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib30\">Mellgren, et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Trembley et al., 2015</a>). In addition, progression down the caSMC lineage occurs early in development, mostly between e10.5 and 12.5 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wei et al., 2015</a>). We show that endothelial cells migrating directly beneath the epicardium at this time point acquire pericytes and pericytes within caSMC containing clones are usually located near the heart\u2019s surface as well as deeper layers. Thus, migrating coronary vessels could trigger adjacent epicardial cells to differentiate into pericytes at the surface and support their movement into the myocardium along with invading endothelial cells. Then, the subset of these pericytes that traveled to arterializing vessels receives signals to become caSMCs. Clones also generally segregated between those containing pericytes/caSMCs and those with other cell types not positive for our cell type specific markers, likely fibroblasts, the latter of which did not integrate into the smooth muscle layer even when directly adjacent to the artery. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that two different epicardial derived pathways diverge at the surface of the heart where the pericyte/caSMC lineage travels along vessels as they invade the myocardium to provide the different mural cells of the coronary vasculature."

Labeled cells in the adult heart were found in surprisingly tight clusters. This suggests that embryonic pericytes within caSMC clones were not merely an intermediate cell type that is depleted during development, but that cells not differentiating remain and function as cardiac pericytes throughout life. The tight clustering in adult hearts also indicate that pericytes travel very little along a vessel once they establish their location during development, at least in this organ. Thus, the embryonic heart appears to have developed an efficient method of distributing smooth muscle progenitors, cells that our data suggests maintain their cell-type specific function as pericytes at vessels that do not receive arterial blood flow and differentiation signals."

Because a large number of caSMCs arise from the epicardium, we characterized epicardial-derived cells at the coronary artery remodeling zone. These were found to be almost exclusively either PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>Notch3<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>PDGFR\u03b1<sup>-</sup> (pericytes) or PDGFR\u03b2<sup>-</sup>Notch3<sup>-</sup>PDGFR\u03b1<sup>+</sup> (fibroblasts) suggesting less heterogeneity in the epicardial-derived cellular compartment at this age. This could be due to development being an early and protected stage in the animal\u2019s life or that the cellular milieu is more complex in the adult when immunity is active. Additional complexity is likely induced in tissue injury models. Although lineage tracing shows that pericytes are a large source, our data does not exclude other pathways to caSMC development. In fact, developmental studies have show that an unidentified compensatory progenitor can provide caSMC if the epicardium is inhibited, although this source predisposes the arteries to disease (<a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wei et al., 2015</a>). Regardless, the description of pericytes as progenitors and their presence in the adult identifies the possibility that they could be utilized to produce new caSMCs during CA regeneration. Identifying the cellular pathway between the epicardium and smooth muscle is therefore important, particularly since it is known that epicardial cells do not enter the adult heart, even after myocardial infarction (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). Our data showing that pericytes are coronary artery smooth muscle progenitors and that they persist in the adult present the possibility that pericytes could be targeted without relying on the original progenitors (epicardial cells) being transported to form new collateral arteries."

If so, it will be important to ascertain whether collateral formation can be made more efficient by stimulating Notch activity. Our data suggest a similar pericyte to smooth muscle pathway in the kidney. However, it will be important to investigate whether smooth muscle in all mesothelial covered abdominal and thoracic organs and other tissues pass through a similar pericyte intermediate as it differentiates into organ-specific smooth muscle (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rinkevich et al., 2012</a>)."

The surface area of the heart was approximated as that of a sphere with a radius of 315 \u00b5m, yielding a value of 1,246,898 square \u00b5m (A = 4\u03c0r<sup>2</sup>). We then modeled regions representing each half of the heart as square tiles with an equivalent surface area (height x width = 623,449 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) and a depth of 97.5 \u00b5m, corresponding to the estimated distance from the epicardium to the endocardium. Groups of clonally related labeled cells were modeled as spheres with a radius of 54 \u00b5m, based on the average dimensions of the e13.5 clones. We then defined a discrimination cutoff of 50 \u00b5m (based on a conservative analysis of the maximum intra-clone distance between any labeled cell and its nearest neighbor within the same clone) as the minimum distance required between any cells from two different groups of clones such that those clones were considered to be distinct entities. Using these empirically determined parameters, we then performed simulations to estimate the underlying clone generation rate (and its corresponding clonality rate) that best fit the observed data as follows. First, we tested a range of suitable values (from 0.5 to 10.0) for the clone generation rate (m), which specifies the average number of clones that are stochastically generated in each simulated half heart. For any given value of the generation rate, we randomly simulated 10,000 half hearts, with the number of clones (X) assigned to each heart randomly determined according to the Poisson distribution (Prob (X = k) = e<sup>-m</sup> m<sup>k</sup> / k!). The centroids of each clone were then randomly assigned with uniform probability to locations within the volume of the simulated region, and any clones that were located closer than the allowed discrimination distance of each other were merged together to form a single \u2018cluster\u2019. Then, the mean number of observed \u2018clusters\u2019 (clusters may either consist of a single clone or a set of neighboring merged clones) was calculated as a function of the clone generation rate. The underlying clone generation rate that best matched the experimental data with an average of 3.3 clusters per region was then chosen as the estimated true generation rate, and its associated clonality rate, defined as the fraction of observed clusters that are comprised of individual clones, was computed from the results of 10,000 simulations. The calculated clonality rates represent the likelihood that any individual cluster of labeled cells is indeed clonal, based on the results of this simulation analysis. Finally, we repeated the entire modeling process with different settings for the discrimination distance, in order to assess the robustness of the estimated clonality rate to different values for this parameter (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

However, one of the reviewers raised substantial concerns about the lineage tracing specificity and the markers used to identify the two phenotypes. Although the other reviewers have only minor issues, relatively easy to address, it is important that in the revised version the concerns of the first reviewer are fully addressed."

We strongly suggest that additional smooth muscle markers are used to distinguish immature caSMCs from pericytes. In general, the conclusions of the work should be toned down, outlining the complexity of the problem and how this work offers a possible answer, not the definitive one."

Using clonal analysis of rare recombination events and genetic lineage tracking studies in mice, they propose that the intermediate progenitor is the pericyte. They also identify the role of PDGFRb and Notch3 for epicardium to pericyte and pericyte to caSMC transitions respectively. They then use lineage tracing and present a more limited dataset in which they propose that renal VSMC also originate from pericytes."

The authors use expression of NG2, PDGFRb and Notch3 to identify pericytes. However, each of these markers including NG2 can also be expressed by SMC (for example Murfee et al. Microcirculation; 2005: 151-160. doi: 10.1080/10739680590904955). Indeed a major challenge in the field of mural cells is the lack of genetic markers that unequivocally distinguish pericytes from smooth muscle cells as the authors own cited reference makes clear (Armulik et al. Dev Cell 2011). Given this constraint, it is difficult to be sure whether caSMC come from genuine pericytes or indeed whether the 'pericyte-like' cells actually represent an alternative SMC progenitor or immature SMCs. This is a major problem in the field and studies identifying unique pericyte markers are urgently required."

We realise that this is a catch 22 situation, since \"really specific\" markers for pericytes do not exist, as correctly pointed out in the text; thus absence of a late marker (SMyHC) as only tool to distinguish caSMc from pericytes may be misleading.

The authors use expression of NG2, PDGFRb and Notch3 to identify pericytes. However, each of these markers including NG2 can also be expressed by SMC (for example Murfee et al. Microcirculation; 2005: 151-160. doi: 10.1080/10739680590904955). Indeed a major challenge in the field of mural cells is the lack of genetic markers that unequivocally distinguish pericytes from smooth muscle cells as the authors own cited reference makes clear (Armulik et al. Dev Cell 2011). Given this constraint, it is difficult to be sure whether caSMC come from genuine pericytes or indeed whether the 'pericyte-like' cells actually represent an alternative SMC progenitor or immature SMCs. This is a major problem in the field and studies identifying unique pericyte markers are urgently required.</i> The perivascular cells in our study were termed pericytes because we found no evidence that a subset of these were distinct pericyte-like caSMC progenitors. The point that our studies cannot distinguish between a pericyte as we have defined it (Notch3<sup>+</sup>PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>-</sup>SM\u03b1\u2013PDGFR\u03b1<sup>-</sup>, wrapping small blood vessels, and within the basement membrane) and a\u201dpericyte-like\u201d SMC progenitor with these exact same attributes is correct. However, by eight criteria (additional markers added in revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D, E</a>, and K and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which includes a morphology and tissue localization that is not shared with SMCs, they appear to be pericytes. Given our extensive marker analysis, we believe our data supports the model that genuine pericytes are themselves SMC progenitors. Even if future research with additional markers showed that there is a \u201cpericyte-like\u201d SMC progenitor different from, but intermixed with, traditional pericytes, we believe our study would remain an important scientific advance in that it is the first to identify the cellular pathway from the epicardium to coronary artery. Specifically, epicardial derived pericytes or \u201cpericyte-like\u201d cells travel along blood vessels to find coronary arteries, which is critical information when searching for localized signals guiding caSMC development. We have added new text to address this point, including discussing that we cannot distinguish a \u201cpericyte-like\u201d progenitor from a traditional pericyte is they both display the following profile: Notch3<sup>+</sup>PDGFR\u03b2<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>-</sup>SM\u03b1\u2013PDGFR\u03b1<sup>-</sup>, extended processes around small blood vessels, and exist within the basement membrane.

Furthermore, we defined pericytes as closely wrapping small blood vessels, and being embedded within the basement membrane. These points were highlighted throughout the text. Pericytes associate with capillaries as soon as they differentiate from the epicardium at the cell surface and have long processes that travel along the vessels. They also do not form a continuous covering of the endothelium as SMCs do. When differentiating into vSMCs, pericytes acquire SMC contractile proteins (SM-MHC and SM\u03b1) and change their morphology (no longer exhibit long skinny processes and orient radially to form a continuous covering around large vessels)."
