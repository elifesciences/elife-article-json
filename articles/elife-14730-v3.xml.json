Here we report a new mechanism by which premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA) of RNA can produce an oncogenic protein. We identify a pPA event at a cryptic intronic poly(A) signal in <i>MAGI3</i>, occurring in the absence of local exonic and intronic mutations. The altered mRNA isoform, called <i>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></i>, produces a truncated protein that acts in a dominant-negative manner to prevent full-length MAGI3 from interacting with the YAP oncoprotein, thereby relieving YAP inhibition and promoting malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. We additionally find evidence for recurrent expression of <i>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> </i>in primary human breast tumors but not in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Our results provide an example of how pPA contributes to cancer by generating a truncated mRNA isoform that encodes an oncogenic, gain-of-function protein."

Here we report a new mechanism by which premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA) of RNA can produce an oncogenic protein. We identify a pPA event at a cryptic intronic poly(A) signal in <i>MAGI3</i>, occurring in the absence of local exonic and intronic mutations. The altered mRNA isoform, called <i>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></i>, produces a truncated protein that acts in a dominant-negative manner to prevent full-length MAGI3 from interacting with the YAP oncoprotein, thereby relieving YAP inhibition and promoting malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. We additionally find evidence for recurrent expression of <i>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> </i>in primary human breast tumors but not in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Our results provide an example of how pPA contributes to cancer by generating a truncated mRNA isoform that encodes an oncogenic, gain-of-function protein."

Normal cells can become cancerous if they acquire genetic mutations that allow them to divide more rapidly and ignore certain growth-halting signals from other cells in the body. Therefore, researchers are studying and cataloguing all the genetic changes found in cancers with the hope that this information will provide a clearer understanding of how they start to develop. Some types of mutations are well studied and easily identified by current technologies. However, some tumors contain few of these well-known mutations, which suggests that other types of mutations may be involved."

This, in turn, led to the discovery of a type of mutation \u2013 called premature polyadenylation \u2013 affecting the gene that encodes MAGI3. Next, Ni and Kuperwasser used biochemical techniques to show that the shortened MAGI3 protein inappropriately switches on another protein called YAP, which causes cells to grow more quickly."

Frequent alteration of a gene by one or more of these mechanisms represents <i>prima facie</i> evidence for its role as a <i>driver</i> \u2013 a gene whose alterations are causative in cancer. As such, within the last decade, tremendous efforts have focused on the systematic, genome-wide surveys for these events in cancer. Interestingly, results from these analyses indicate that many tumors harbor alterations in only 1\u20132 known drivers, and ~15% of tumors lack alterations in even a single known driver (<a href=\"#bib16\">Imielinski et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Garraway and Lander, 2013</a>). Since solid tumors arise due to oncogenic cooperation between alterations in multiple drivers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</a>), a significant number of cancer-relevant genes are currently being missed by genomic analyses because so many genes are ostensibly altered at frequencies below the threshold for driver detection (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lawrence et al., 2014</a>)."

In fact, as new mechanisms of alteration relevant to cancer are discovered, a number of 'infrequently altered' genes are reclassified as frequently altered. For example, the discovery of promoter mutations in the gene encoding telomerase has resulted in the reclassification of <i>TERT</i> as a frequently altered melanoma driver (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Horn et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, identifying cancer-specific alterations generated by previously unappreciated mechanisms represents a fundamentally important prerequisite for driver gene identification."

Despite being functionally implicated in tumorigenesis, some of these candidate drivers were rarely mutated, amplified or deleted in human cancer. This incongruence led us to hypothesize that some of these candidate drivers may appear to be infrequently altered because their driver alterations may be caused by mechanisms that are not regularly interrogated. Here, we report that one of these candidate drivers, <i>MAGI3</i>, is indeed recurrently altered in breast cancer by premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA), a mechanism not widely appreciated for its involvement in cancer, and the resulting truncation of the <i>MAGI3</i> gene products functionally contributes to malignant transformation."

When gone awry, any of these mechanisms could alter cancer-relevant genes or their gene products. To investigate our hypothesis that some candidate drivers may be altered by underlying mechanisms not widely thought to be involved cancer, we considered strategies capable of broadly capturing many types of alteration events. While there is no standard strategy for this purpose, we reasoned that changes in genetic information, in most cases, must ultimately manifest at the protein level in order to contribute to cancer. Thus, our strategy focused on identifying novel, unannotated protein products of a limited number of genes that we suspected to be involved in cancer due to their previous identification by a forward genetics screen for tumorigenesis in mice (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ni et al., 2013</a>). We focused specifically on products exhibiting detectable size differences from wild-type protein isoforms since these may be more likely to cause significant functional effects. Once such a product was identified, we would determine whether the altered protein is generated by a genetic mutation in the coding regions of the corresponding gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). If not due to coding region genetic mutation, we would attempt to identify the alteration mechanism, establish recurrence for the specific alteration event in cancer and investigate its functional importance in malignant transformation."

Alteration events caused by mechanisms not\u00a0widely appreciated in cancer were subsequently investigated for tumor-specific recurrence and functional relevance.

We found that one of these bands, faintly appearing in most of the cell lines, was non-specific to MAGI3 since it could not be depleted by multiple shRNA targeting <i>MAGI3</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, a strong band of lower molecular weight was observed and could be specifically depleted by RNAi (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>).

Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the immunoprecipitated truncation mapped many peptides corresponding to the N-terminal half of MAGI3, but detected no peptides from the PDZ domains 3\u20136 that consist of the C-terminal half of MAGI3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). To identify the genetic alteration responsible for this truncation, we sequenced all 22 exons and flanking intron sequences of <i>MAGI3</i> but found no mutations. This indicated that the truncation is not generated by DNA mutation of the <i>MAGI3</i> coding sequence or splice sites. We subsequently used 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to isolate the transcript responsible for the truncated MAGI3 protein. This yielded a truncated <i>MAGI3</i> mRNA isoform corresponding to the size and mapped regions of the truncated protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Sequencing the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA revealed a cleavage and polyadenylation event involving a cryptic poly(A) signal (PAS) located in <i>MAGI3</i> intron 10 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Intriguingly, the loss of MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> impaired the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells on soft agar compared to non-silencing Scr control, as shown by the reduced size and number of colonies (p=1.1 x 10<sup>\u20134</sup> and 3.4 x 10<sup>\u20135</sup> for shMAGI3.4 and shMAGI3.5, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). These data suggest that the <i>MAGI3</i> intron 10 pPA event may have been positively selected by MDA-MB-231 cells during the process of malignant transformation, and thus implicate pPA as a mechanism of alteration capable of contributing to breast cancer."

The YAP oncoprotein \u2013 a transcription co-activator that functions as a major effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway \u2013 was identified to be top candidate interactor with MAGI3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). SERPINB5, also known as the mammary tumor suppressor Maspin, was also identified as a likely MAGI3 interactor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, several tight junction and cellular adhesion molecules were identified by this analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), validating the AP-MS approach since MAGI3 has been observed to localize to cell junctions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adamsky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Funke et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, the subcellular localization of MAGI3 in human breast epithelium is consistent with these previous reports, with tight junction localization in luminal cells and cytoplasmic localization in basal/myoepithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Indeed, we found that YAP co-immunoprecipitated with MAGI3 and likewise, MAGI3 co-immunoprecipitated with YAP from MCF10A cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We next determined the critical domains necessary for interaction between MAGI3 and YAP by ectopically expressing various epitope-tagged full-length and deletion mutants of MAGI3 and YAP in HEK293T cells. To determine whether this interaction required PDZ domain-binding, we performed co-IP experiments with V5-tagged MAGI3 and either Flag-tagged full-length YAP or a YAP mutant lacking the PDZ-binding motif (YAP\u0394C) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Oka et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with the endogenous co-IP results, Flag-tagged full-length YAP co-immunoprecipitated with V5-tagged MAGI3 in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, Flag-YAP\u0394C and MAGI3-V5 could not be co-immunoprecipitated by either anti-Flag or anti-V5 IP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), indicating that the PDZ-binding motif of YAP is necessary for the physical interaction between the two proteins. To further confirm that the interaction between YAP and MAGI3 requires PDZ domain-binding, we first utilized a computational predictor to map the PDZ-binding peptide of YAP against all human PDZ domains (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hui and Bader, 2010</a>) and found that the sixth PDZ domain (PDZ6) of MAGI3 was the highest-scoring interactor on the list (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). We thus expressed a Flag-tagged <i>MAGI3</i> construct lacking PDZ6 (MAGI3\u0394PDZ6) in HEK293T cells and performed co-IP experiments for YAP to determine the necessity of PDZ6 for MAGI3 and YAP interaction. Deletion of PDZ6 curtailed MAGI3 interaction with YAP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PDZ-binding motif of YAP and the PDZ6 domain of MAGI3 are necessary for protein-protein interaction."

YAP functions as a transcriptional coactivator, and the regulation of its subcellular localization is a major determinant of protein activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zhao et al., 2007</a>). In HEK293T cells, YAP activity exhibits highly robust responses to serum deprivation, which promotes cytoplasmic accumulation of YAP, and subsequent serum stimulation, which rapidly induces YAP nuclear translocation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yu et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we examined the subcellular localization of YAP in cells transfected with either truncated or full-length MAGI3. Consistent with the <i>MAGI3</i> loss-of-function data, overexpression of full-length MAGI3 led to YAP cytoplasmic accumulation despite serum stimulated cell culture, whereas nuclear translocation of YAP was induced in untransfected control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). By contrast, the expression of truncated MAGI3 caused the opposite effect by increasing nuclear YAP localization in cells even under the serum deprived conditions that normally preclude YAP from the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>). The increased nuclear YAP localization was indicative of heightened YAP activation, since the amount of phosphorylated/inactive YAP was reduced in lysates from cells expressing MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> and MAGI3\u0394C-GFP compared to GFP control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Thus, in contrast to the inhibitory effect of full-length MAGI3 on YAP, these data demonstrate that truncated MAGI3 is positively associated with YAP activation. We further asked whether the transformed phenotype caused by expression of truncated MAGI3 is YAP-dependent. Indeed, knockdown of YAP in MCF10A-SV40 cells expressing MAGI3\u0394C-GFP resulted in a significant reduction of colony formation on soft agar (p=7.4 x 10<sup>\u20135</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F and G</a>), suggesting that the increase in YAP activity caused by truncated MAGI3 is functionally important for transformation."

Transformation caused by an independent MAGI3 truncation, also found in breast cancer, provides additional functional evidence for the cancer relevance of MAGI3 truncations. Moreover, the ability of these truncations to function as dominant-negative proteins and prevent the inhibition of YAP by full-length MAGI3 suggests that the generation of truncated <i>MAGI3</i> products by pPA or chromosomal rearrangement may more potently deregulate YAP activity and drive transformation compared to the mutation or loss of a single <i>MAGI3</i> allele.

Nevertheless, the truncations dominantly suppressed interactions between full-length MAGI3 and YAP, resulting in YAP activation and malignant transformation. We further determined that MAGI3 truncations can physically associate with full-length MAGI3 proteins, and thus posit that this aberrant complex interferes with the interaction between full-length MAGI3 and YAP. Our results underscore the importance of the MAGI3/YAP interaction in suppressing malignant transformation and implicate MAGI3 as a new potential component involved in the regulation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway.

In these tumors, the production of shorter, prematurely polyadenylated cyclin D1 mRNA isoforms, which exhibit dramatically extended half-lives, drive the overexpression of cyclin D1 oncoproteins (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wiestner et al., 2007</a>). In addition, a number of studies on genes with tandem PAS arrangements in the 3\u2032 UTR have shown that shorter 3\u2032 UTRs utilizing the gene-proximal PAS are favored by cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sandberg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Singh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Xia et al., 2014</a>).

While alternative 3\u2032 UTR PAS selection does not alter the mRNA coding potential, pPA can cause gene-truncating alterations that produce pre-mRNAs with potential to encode constitutively active or dominant-negative proteins. Such pre-mRNAs are naturally able to evade post-transcriptional quality-control surveillance mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. By producing constitutively active or dominant-negative proteins, pPA transcripts may cause significant functional and phenotypic consequences even if expressed at lower levels than wild-type mRNA isoforms. Determining whether pPA events in cancer occur in other genes beside <i>MAGI3,</i> and whether pPA is triggered widely throughout the transcriptome or focally restricted to susceptible intronic PAS, are important future directions but beyond the scope of the current study. However, pPA truncation of other cancer-relevant genes is a strong possibility considering the previous studies that have identified dominant-negative proteins arising from pPA events. Prominent examples of these pPA-generated dominant-negative proteins include an EPRS isoform in peripheral blood monocytes that blocks translational repression by full-length EPRS following \u03b3-interferon activation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Yao et al., 2012</a>), and a VEGFR2 truncation that inhibits HUVEC tube formation in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Vorlov\u00e1 et al., 2011</a>). Given these precedents, it will be important to conduct transcriptome-scale studies to identify other genes affected by premature polyadenylation in cancer.

For example, how do pPA events arise independently of local, cis-acting genetic mutations? Previous work has shown that, under certain conditions, pPA events can be induced in cells. For example, U1 snRNP function is essential for protecting pre-mRNAs from pPA at cryptic intronic PAS (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaida et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Almada et al., 2013</a>), and experimental depletion of U1 snRNP levels can lead to the production of novel, pPA-truncated isoforms that encode dominant-negative proteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vorlov\u00e1 et al., 2011</a>). Overexpression of polyadenylation factors has also been shown to mediate alternative intronic PAS usage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Takagaki et al., 1996</a>). These findings raise the possibility that alteration of a <i>trans</i>-acting factor in cancer cells could result in either focal or transcriptome-wide pPA. Moreover, because the relative abundance of U1 snRNP to nuclear pre-mRNAs is a critical factor for determining whether global pPA events occur (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg et al., 2012</a>), alterations that drive global transcriptional amplification, a phenomenon frequently observed in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nie et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cunningham et al., 2014</a>), might also induce pPA. In addition, whether broad pPA induction enables cancer cells to sample and select specific pPA events that confer functional growth advantages \u2013 such as <i>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></i> \u2013 and how pPA events at the functionally relevant loci are passed from mother cell to daughter cells, are outstanding questions that will require further investigation into the phenomenon of pPA in cancer."

The identifiers for the SRA and GEO datasets are SRP042620 and GSE58135 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Varley et al., 2014</a>). To evaluate sequencing depth for <i>MAGI3</i> in primary tumor and tumor-adjacent normal tissues of the two datasets, we compared upper quartile-normalized TPM (transcripts per million) or FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) values for <i>MAGI3.</i> To identify putative pPA events, we calculated the genome coverage of total mappable reads for each sample by using the BEDtools <i>genomecov</i> script and converted the output to BEDGRAPH files for subsequent analyses using the UCSC genome browser. Next, we inspected each sample for evidence of read coverage across <i>MAGI3</i> intron 10, allowing us to group samples into two categories: (1) samples with no intronic reads or only a few, isolated intronic reads; (2) samples with sustained stretches of overlapping intronic reads. The intronic read distributions of samples in Group 2 were further analyzed by a \u03c7<sup>2</sup> goodness-of-fit test to evaluate the null hypothesis\u2014namely, that the observed distribution of sequencing reads occurs due to intron retention. This was performed by splitting <i>MAGI3</i> intron 10 into two regions: (A) the pPA-specific region from the start of the intron to the cryptic PAS; (B) the intronic region downstream of the cryptic PAS. A p&lt;0.05 was considered a significant deviation from the expected read distribution and therefore a rejection of the null hypothesis. Samples with p&lt;0.05 were further analyzed for continuity of read coverage throughout Region A. To account for non-uniformity biases inherent in RNA-Seq read distributions, we set a threshold for continuity defined by overlapping read coverage with fewer than 5 small (&lt;75 nt) gaps. Samples passing all the above criteria were considered to express the pPA-truncated <i>MAGI3</i> isoform, and relative expression levels of <i>MAGI3<sup>pPA\u00a0</sup></i>versus either of the full-length isoforms (<i>MAGI3\u03b1</i> and <i>MAGI3\u03b2</i>) were measured by counting the number of reads mapping uniquely to each isoform and dividing the length-corrected reads mapping to the pPA isoform by those mapping to each full-length isoform."

For these calculations, we assumed a difference between means of 30 and 50 along with standard deviations of 10 and 20 for transformation assays and tumor xenograft experiments, respectively. Data were analyzed and compared between groups using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests. A p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant."

Interestingly, the novel form of MAGI3 results from translation of a product of premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA) of the transcript at a cryptic intronic poly(A) signal. The truncated form of MAGI3 acts as a dominant-negative to inhibit a newly-discovered function of MAGI3 as an inhibitor of YAP. The paper is interesting both for this example of the role of pPA in cancer and for the new insights into YAP regulation. However, the reviewers have raised several major concerns. Substantial new data will be needed to address the reviewers' comments. Since the new data will mostly come from further in-depth analysis of sequencing data, together with a few new experiments, we are offering you the opportunity to modify the paper and resubmit.

The discovery of premature polyadenylation in cancer is not new. The novelty is in the specific molecular mechanism of YAP regulation, not in pPA. The title is also too strong. Stating that a gene product is a \"driver\" of cancer typically means that it is sufficient transform cells in vivo, which the authors have not shown. One solution may be to substitute \"dominantly-acting oncogene\" for \"driver\" in the title, and replace the second sentence of the abstract with \"Here we report a new mechanism by which premature polyadenylation can produce an oncogenic protein.\"</i> "
