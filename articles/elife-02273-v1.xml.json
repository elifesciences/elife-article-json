Promoting interactions between these \u2018distant\u2019 delegates is challenging but such interactions could lead to novel interdisciplinary collaborations and unexpected breakthroughs. We have developed a network-based \u2018speed dating\u2019 approach that allows us to initiate such distant interactions by pairing every delegate with another delegate who might be of interest to them, but whom they might never have encountered otherwise. Here we describe our approach and its algorithmic implementation."

Promoting interactions between these \u2018distant\u2019 delegates is challenging but such interactions could lead to novel interdisciplinary collaborations and unexpected breakthroughs. We have developed a network-based \u2018speed dating\u2019 approach that allows us to initiate such distant interactions by pairing every delegate with another delegate who might be of interest to them, but whom they might never have encountered otherwise. Here we describe our approach and its algorithmic implementation."

Since the meeting was about cell polarity, the attendees consisted of a heterogeneous group of biophysicists, mathematical modellers, biochemists, in vivo researchers, and bioinformatics researchers. The combination of wide-ranging interests among the delegates, as well as the relatively small number of people attending, made this meeting an excellent test bed for our unorthodox conference approach."

In other words, we wanted to form pairs of delegates who were far away from each other in the network and who had minimal overlap in their knowledge. This means that we were looking for 20 deep blue squares in the matrices in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, subject to the constraint that we had to select one square (i.e., one delegate) from each column and from each row per round. This is a well-known problem in combinatorial optimization, and is called the Maximum-Weight Perfect Matching Problem (<a href=\"#bib5\">Edmonds, 1965</a>); several polynomial-time exact algorithms exist for solving this problem (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gabow and Tarjan, 1991</a>). Interestingly, the number of one-way collaborations (where one delegate reports a collaboration but the other does not) was significantly correlated with the number of methods known (r = 0.38, p-value = 0.015)."

Importantly, for each round we were solving for the optimal pairs which simultaneously maximized new knowledge gained for all scientists. This was a greedy strategy: choices made in early rounds introduced constraints (by reducing the number of possible pairs), which may prevent the algorithm from finding a best solution for later rounds. Hence a future improvement of this approach could be to modify the above implementation to maximise the sum of the distances across all rounds, instead of finding the optimal match on a per-round basis. In this manner, the solution would not need to decay through successive selection rounds."

Therefore, in the second round we sought to match delegates who were expert in particular methods with delegates wanting to learn about those methods (based on the data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We did this by computing a \u2018matching knowledge distance\u2019, which quantified how much the methods known by one participant resembled the methods sought by another and vice-versa. We then summed the inverse of the \u2018matching knowledge distance\u2019 with the \u2018acquaintances distance\u2019, again weighted by a parameter \u03b1, and sought to maximise this sum. This was a popular approach, with a large proportion (&gt;50%) of the people who responded to the post-meeting questionaire indicating that this part of the meeting led to the establishment of new collaborations."

Trying to improve scientific conferences, we sought to engineer a better way for scientists to become exposed to new ideas and unlikely conversation partners, meet potential collaborators, and learn more about specific methods they fancied. While our approach was decidedly unorthodox, our first attempt to implement it turned out much better than we expected: of the 24 delegates who commented on it in the post-meeting questionnaire, 21 (87.5%) were very enthusiastic and complimentary, and 12 mentioned that potential new collaborations were emerging from discussions at the meeting."

For example, quite a few of the delegates at our meeting were lab heads, so at larger meetings attended by a lot of junior scientists it would be interesting to use \u2018scientific seniority\u2019 as an additional criterion when calculating the distance between delegates with a view to pairing these junior scientists with senior figures in the field. Alternatively, everyone attending the meeting could be asked what they hope to get out of the meeting (e.g., to meet new people, to learn more about various methods, to meet lab heads who are recruiting, and so on), and then one could attempt to match everyone according to their own stated aims. We are eager to explore these and other applications of our approach in the future."
