We now explored the cargo-spectrum of CRM1 in depth and identified surprisingly large numbers, namely &gt;700 export substrates from the yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, \u22481000 from <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes and &gt;1050 from human cells. In addition, we quantified the partitioning of \u22485000 unique proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm of <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. The data suggest new CRM1 functions in spatial control of vesicle coat-assembly, centrosomes, autophagy, peroxisome biogenesis, cytoskeleton, ribosome maturation, translation, mRNA degradation, and more generally in precluding a potentially detrimental action of cytoplasmic pathways within the nuclear interior. There are also numerous new instances where CRM1 appears to act in regulatory circuits. Altogether, our dataset allows unprecedented insights into the nucleocytoplasmic organisation of eukaryotic cells, into the contributions of an exceedingly promiscuous exportin and it provides a new basis for NES prediction."

We now explored the cargo-spectrum of CRM1 in depth and identified surprisingly large numbers, namely &gt;700 export substrates from the yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, \u22481000 from <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes and &gt;1050 from human cells. In addition, we quantified the partitioning of \u22485000 unique proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm of <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. The data suggest new CRM1 functions in spatial control of vesicle coat-assembly, centrosomes, autophagy, peroxisome biogenesis, cytoskeleton, ribosome maturation, translation, mRNA degradation, and more generally in precluding a potentially detrimental action of cytoplasmic pathways within the nuclear interior. There are also numerous new instances where CRM1 appears to act in regulatory circuits. Altogether, our dataset allows unprecedented insights into the nucleocytoplasmic organisation of eukaryotic cells, into the contributions of an exceedingly promiscuous exportin and it provides a new basis for NES prediction."

Such a census helps to predict where a given protein works and where it might cause problems. Further experiments also used proteomics to identify which proteins are carried by an exportin called CRM1. This revealed that a remarkably large number of different proteins (around 1,000) are exported by CRM1 from either yeast, human or frog cell nuclei. Most of these \u201ccargo\u201d proteins were previously thought to never leave the cytoplasm. It now seems, however, that these proteins can leak into the nucleus, but CRM1 recognizes them as cytoplasmic proteins and expels them from the nucleus."

The NPC permeability barrier controls this exchange. It grants small molecules a free passage, but becomes increasingly restrictive as the size of the mobile species approaches or exceeds a diameter of \u2248 5 nm (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mohr et al., 2009</a>). Shuttling nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) are not bound by this restriction (for review see: <a href=\"#bib44\">Kimura and Imamoto, 2014</a>).

In addition, it requires an input of metabolic energy, typically by the RanGTPase system. The corresponding duty cycles include not only a switch of Ran between its GDP- and GTP-bound states, but also one round of Ran-shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm. The energetic coupling occurs through a primary RanGTP-gradient, which is generated through NTF2-mediated import of RanGDP, nucleotide exchange by the nuclear RanGEF (RCC1) and cytoplasmic RanGTP-depletion by RanGAP and RanBP1/RanBP2. This gradient then directly fuels importin- and exportin-mediated transport cycles."

We tested a subset of cargo candidates for CRM1-dependent nuclear export in cultured human cells and thereby validated a majority of them as true cargoes. For a subset, we also confirmed direct CRM1-interaction and mapped the corresponding NESs, some of which turned out to have unusual features. The majority of identified CRM1 cargoes are proteins and protein complexes with a very strong bias towards a cytoplasmic localisation, suggesting that their active back-sorting from the nucleus is a major cellular activity. This applies to nearly all translation factors (including the largest translation factor complexes like eIF2B), to factors involved in final ribosomal maturation steps, which might prevent ribosomes from acquiring translation competence already in the nuclear compartment, as well as to regulatory proteins, autophagy-linked factors, peroxisome biogenesis factors and to centrosomal proteins, in both, humans and frogs. Another major functional group of CRM1 cargoes with perfect nuclear exclusion is represented by vesicle coat proteins, which points to a strong evolutionary pressure to preclude the budding of vesicles from the inner nuclear membrane. We also identified numerous new instances, where CRM1 appears to act in regulatory circuits. More generally, these data represent a very rich resource for other researchers seeking information about nucleocytoplasmic distribution and CRM1-controlled localisation."

In order to tackle this question, we applied a deep proteome analysis to the isolated compartments. A problem for such endeavour is that standard cell fractionation procedures rely on shearing forces, often combined with hypotonic lysis or even treatment with detergents (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib7\">Blobel and Potter, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dignam et al., 1983</a>). All these treatments compromise the integrity of the NE.

These cells measure \u22481.3 mm in diameter and have nuclei of \u2248450 \u00b5m. Such very large dimensions allow for a manual oocyte dissection into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions with exceptionally little cross-contamination (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib18\">De Robertis et al., 1978</a>). These oocyte nuclei are also special with their volume being 100,000 times larger than that of average-sized cells with a G2 DNA contents. The chromatin should therefore make no more than a negligible contribution to nuclear retention of proteins. Instead, the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of a given protein or protein complex in these cells should be solely determined by its passive diffusion properties and by their potential to access active nuclear import and/or export pathways. In addition, oocytes are very long-lived cells that grow over months to their final size, which implies that even slow partitioning processes are likely to have reached a steady state."

We first prepared cellular extracts, used immobilised CRM1 as an affinity matrix and asked which proteins and protein complexes would bind in a RanGTP-dependent manner. As detailed below, CRM1 has many interaction partners of widely different abundance and affinity, which implies that the majority of them bind to the immobilized exportin in a highly sub-stoichiometric manner. The challenge thus is to cleanly distinguish such highly sub-stoichiometric bands from non-specific interactors. To this end, we optimised several parameters, such as the way of immobilisation, the exportin:extract ratios (to minimise competition between cargoes), buffer conditions, incubation time, etc., in order to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio of the affinity chromatography (for details see Materials and methods)."

These thresholds had been adjusted to best match the behaviour of proteins, whose specific CRM1-interaction is already established beyond doubt, as well as of proteins that are known not to interact with the exportin (see Materials and methods). CRM1-binders of the category A1 not only had to pass the most stringent thresholds in terms of RanGTP-stimulation of CRM1-binding (\u2265500-fold in the case of <i>Xenopus</i>) and enrichment from the input extract (\u22653-fold), but also belong to the most abundant proteins in the \u2018CRM1+RanGTP\u2019-bound fraction (Note that the threshold of a 500 times stronger signal than in the negative (minus RanGTP) control is far more stringent than the standard of \u20182-fold\u2019, which is used in most proteomics studies).

Next, we also confirmed a far lower scoring \u2018category B\u2019 candidate, namely the 1b subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, as a directly-binding, <i>bona fide</i> CRM1 export cargo with an NES at its extreme C-terminus. In the light of the rather weak CRM1-binding of Arp2/3-1b (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), its NES turned out to be surprisingly strong. When fused to GFP, it behaved like a supraphysiological NES (<a href=\"#bib22\">Engelsma et al., 2004</a>) and produced pronounced transport intermediates at NPCs (best visible in weakly expressing cells). This difference is, however, plausible in the context of the Arp2/3 complex structure (pdb 1K8K; <a href=\"#bib78\">Robinson et al., 2001</a>), which shows this NES packing against the rest of the chain. The rather loose packing and high local B-factor suggest, however, that this NES region is sufficiently mobile to get transiently exposed for subsequent CRM1-binding."

This proposal was based on the observations that blocking aminoacylation in yeast results in nuclear accumulation of tRNA and that a similar treatment in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes prevents tRNAs, which had been injected into the nucleus, from reaching an exclusively cytoplasmic steady state distribution. There are, however, also arguments against this scenario, foremost that a loss of cytoplasmic retention of tRNA by translation elongation factor eEF1A (which binds only aminoacylated tRNA) would explain the phenotypes as well. Furthermore, a structural and functional analysis of tRNA\u2022Xpo-t\u2022Ran export complexes revealed that this exportin proof-reads a correct 3'-CCA end (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arts et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lipowsky et al., 1999</a>), but cannot sense aminoacylation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cook et al., 2009</a>).

A first line of defence against such incidents is a trapping of peroxisomal proteins by dedicated targeting receptors.

The new cargoes include heavily studied kinases such as protein kinase A, the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, the pro-apoptotic serine/ threonine kinase 3, the tank-binding kinase 1, Raf-1, and several isoforms of casein kinase I and II. In addition, we identified numerous kinase regulators as new CRM1 cargoes, examples being the already mentioned regulatory subunit of PKA (PRKAr2a; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) or the TSC1\u2022TSC2 complex (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), which is a key component of the mTOR signalling pathway (<a href=\"#bib53\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2009</a>).

First, many published NESs turned out to be incorrect (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib106\">Xu et al., 2012b</a> and discussion therein). NES prediction will therefore remain unreliable and produce frequent false-positive hits as long as it is based on an unreliable list of positive cases.

To address this issue, we analysed seven of these conflicting cases and tested the behaviour of the corresponding GFP fusions in the HeLa cell transfection assay (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All of them showed a considerable nuclear signal already in untreated cells and this nuclear signal did not further increase upon blocking CRM1 by leptomycin B.

PHAX, the export adapter for U snRNAs, on the other hand, requires phosphorylation for an efficient interaction with CRM1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kitao et al., 2008</a>). Given these examples, it will now be very interesting to obtain a global view on how phosphorylation impacts individual cargo-CRM1 interactions, for example, by testing in how far CRM1 selects for or against the corresponding phosphoforms."

Such incidents not only require a repair of the NE, but also a rapid unmixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents by active import as well as by active export. Thus, the barriers of the NE alone cannot maintain the compartment identities.

After 24 hr, cells were incubated with either 10 nM Leptomycin B (LMB, dissolved in DMSO) or DMSO alone for 3 hr. They were then fixed for 30 min with 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and the aldehydes were quenched with 1 mg/ml NaBH<sub>4</sub>. Fluorescence signals were recorded on an SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica), using sequential scans with excitations at 488 and 561 nm."

Both reviewers felt that this report provides important novel insight on the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of proteins in eukaryotic cells and represents a valuable resource not only to the nuclear transport field, but also to the broad field of cell biology. Furthermore, this study reports several unexpected findings. For example, that a subset of protein kinases is excluded from the nucleus by CRM1 is most likely to ensure compartment-specific phosphorylation. Interestingly, in addition to protein kinases, a broad range of cytoplasmic proteins contain NESs and are bona fide CRM1 cargoes, indicating that eukaryotic cells have evolved a mechanism to maintain these proteins in the cytoplasmic compartment and that the accumulation of these factors in the nuclear compartment can be detrimental."

Specifically, we tested seven (out of the eleven) cases of clearly conflicting data, namely human proteins that are listed as CRM1 cargoes in the NESdb, but appeared negative according to our proteomics data (the seven were the ones, where cloning from HeLa cDNA worked at the first trial). Four of them showed an exclusively nuclear signal already as plain GFP fusions. The other three were equally distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm, and their nuclear signal did not increase upon blocking CRM1 by leptomycin B. These seven re-tested candidates thus behaved as predicted from their classification as CRM1 non-binders, at least for the tested protein isoforms (cloned from HeLa cell cDNA), for the tested cell type (human HeLa cells) and under standard cell culture conditions."
