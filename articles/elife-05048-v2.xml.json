Here we use the pyro-sequencing of PCR amplicons derived from both nonribosomal peptide adenylation domains and polyketide ketosynthase domains to compare biosynthetic diversity in soil microbiomes from around the globe. We see large differences in domain populations from all except the most proximal and biome-similar samples, suggesting that most microbiomes will encode largely distinct collections of bacterial secondary metabolites. Our data indicate a correlation between two factors, geographic distance and biome-type, and the biosynthetic diversity found in soil environments. By assigning reads to known gene clusters we identify hotspots of biomedically relevant biosynthetic diversity. These observations not only provide new insights into the natural world, they also provide a road map for guiding future natural products discovery efforts."

Here we use the pyro-sequencing of PCR amplicons derived from both nonribosomal peptide adenylation domains and polyketide ketosynthase domains to compare biosynthetic diversity in soil microbiomes from around the globe. We see large differences in domain populations from all except the most proximal and biome-similar samples, suggesting that most microbiomes will encode largely distinct collections of bacterial secondary metabolites. Our data indicate a correlation between two factors, geographic distance and biome-type, and the biosynthetic diversity found in soil environments. By assigning reads to known gene clusters we identify hotspots of biomedically relevant biosynthetic diversity. These observations not only provide new insights into the natural world, they also provide a road map for guiding future natural products discovery efforts."

The traditional approach for characterizing the biosynthetic potential of environmental bacteria has been to examine metabolites produced by bacteria grown in monoculture in the lab. However, it is now clear that this simple approach has provided access to only a small fraction of the global microbiome's biosynthetic potential (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rappe and Giovannoni, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gilbert and Dupont, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Rajendhran and Gunasekaran, 2011</a>). In most environments uncultured bacteria outnumber their cultured counterparts by more than two orders of magnitude, and among the small fraction of bacteria that has been cultured (<a href=\"#bib28\">Torsvik et al., 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1998</a>), only a small subset of gene clusters found in these organisms is generally expressed in common fermentation broths (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bentley et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ikeda et al., 2003</a>). The direct extraction and subsequent sequencing of DNA from environmental samples using metagenomic methods provides a means of seeing this \u2018biosynthetic dark matter\u2019 for the first time. Unfortunately, the genomic complexity of most metagenomes limits the use of the shotgun-sequencing and assembly approaches (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iverson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Howe et al., 2014</a>) that are now routinely used to study individual microbial genomes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Donadio et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cimermancic et al., 2014</a>). Although bacterial natural products represent an amazing diversity of chemical structures, the majority of bacterial secondary metabolites, including most clinically useful microbial metabolites, arise from a very small number of common biosynthetic themes (e.g., polyketides, ribosomal peptides, non-ribosomal peptides, terpenes, etc) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dewick, 2002</a>). Because of the functional conservation of enzymes used by these common systems, degenerate primers targeting the most common biosynthetic domains provide a means to broadly study gene cluster diversity in the uncultured majority in a way similar to what is now regularly done for bacterial species diversity using 16S rRNA gene sequences. Here we use this approach to conduct the first global examination of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) adenylation domain (AD) and polyketide synthase (PKS) ketosynthase (KS) domain biosynthetic diversity in soil environments. We chose to explore NRPS and PKS biosynthesis because the highly modular nature of these biosynthetic systems has provided a template for the production of a wide variety of gene clusters that give rise to a correspondingly diverse chemical repertoire, including many of the most clinically useful microbial metabolites (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cragg and Newman, 2013</a>)."

Samples were chosen on the basis of DNA quality and biome diversity; raw sequence reads from these samples were combined with existing amplicon datasets derived from other biomes using the same DNA isolation, PCR and sequencing protocols (<a href=\"#bib6\">Charlop-Powers et al., 2014</a>). The entire dataset representing 185 biomes was clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a sequence distance of 5%.

To do this we calculated the pairwise Jaccard distances between AD/KS sequence sets derived from each sampling site and used these metrics to compare samples. The Jaccard distance, a widely used metric for comparing the fraction of shared OTUs between samples, was chosen over alternative metrics due to its simplicity and to the lack of a comprehensive reference phylogenetic tree for AD and KS domains as exists for 16S analyses. Most Jaccard distances were found to be quite small (&lt;3%), indicating large differences in secondary metabolite gene sequence composition between almost all sample collection sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). Although the OTU overlap between our individual experimental samples is generally small, these relationships allow us to begin to develop a picture of how biosynthetic diversity varies globally. On a global level, the strongest biosynthetic sequence composition relationships are seen between samples collected in close physical proximity to one another (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D,E,F</a>) as opposed to between samples from similar biomes in different geographic locations. For example, at a cutoff of even as low as 3% shared KS or AD OTUs, essentially all inter-sample relationships are observed between immediate geographic neighbors and not similar biomes in different global locations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). This likely explains the limited inter-sample relationships we observe between samples from the Eastern hemisphere as most samples from this part of the world were collected from sites at a significant geographic distance from one another. The only exception is the set of soil samples from South Africa, of which a number were collected in relatively close geographic proximity. These samples exhibit similar pairwise Jaccard metrics to those observed between geographically proximal samples collected in the Western hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>)."

For example, at a cutoff of 3% shared OTUs, essentially all inter-sample relationships are observed between immediate geographic neighbors; when this is raised to 10% shared OTUs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>), relationships are only seen between nearby samples belonging to the same biome. This phenomenon is highlighted by the two examples shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>. In the first example, Brazilian soils were collected from Atlantic rainforest, saline or cerrado (savanna-like) sites located only a few miles from one another. Our AD and KS data show these sample are (i) distinct from other globally distributed samples, (ii) most strongly related to the samples from the same Brazilian biome and (iii) only distantly related to the samples from other Brazilian biomes. In the second example, a sample collected from a New Mexican hot spring where the soil is heated continuously by subterranean water is compared with samples derived from the dry soils of the surrounding environment. Once again our amplicon data show that these samples are (i) distinct from other globally distributed samples, (ii) most strongly related to other samples from the same biome and (iii) only distantly related to samples from other nearby biomes. Although it is possible that at a much greater sampling depth all AD and KS domains will be found at all sites as predicted by Baas-Becking's \u2018everything is everywhere but the environment selects\u2019 hypothesis of global microbial distribution (<a href=\"#bib21\">O'Malley, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Wit and Bouvier, 2006</a>), our PCR-based data suggest that both geography and ecology play a role in determining the major biosynthetic components of a microbiome."

However, in cases where eDNA sequence tags show high sequence similarity to domains found in functionally characterized gene clusters, this information can be used to predict the presence of specific gene cluster families within a specific microbiome. This type of phylogenetic analysis is the basis of the recently developed eSNaPD program, a BLAST-based algorithm for classifying the gene cluster families that are associated with eDNA-derived sequence tags (<a href=\"#bib22\">Owen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Reddy et al., 2014</a>). When an eDNA sequence tag clades with, but is not identical to, a reference sequence in an eSNaPD-type analysis, it is considered to be indicative of the presence of a gene cluster that encodes a congener (i.e., a derivative) of the metabolite encoded by the reference cluster."

These include \u2018specific gene cluster hotspots\u2019 and \u2018gene cluster family hotspots\u2019. Metagenomes from \u2018specific gene cluster hotspots\u2019 are predicted to be enriched for a gene cluster that encodes a congener of the target natural product, while metagenomes from \u2018gene cluster family hotspots\u2019 are predicted to encode multiple congeners related to the target natural product. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows several of the strongest examples of \u2018specific gene cluster hotspots\u2019 where reads falling into an OTU related to a specific biomedically relevant gene cluster or gene cluster family are disproportionately represented in the sequence data from individual microbiomes. These examples highlight the different enrichment patterns that we observe in the environment\u2014hotspots are either local in nature, consisting of only one or two samples containing sequence reads mapping to the target (epoxomycin, oocydin); regional (tiacumicinB); or global with punctuated increases in diversity (glycopeptides). We would predict \u2018specific gene cluster hotspots\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) are naturally enriched for bacteria that encode congeners of the biomedically relevant target metabolites, thereby potentially simplifying the discovery of new congeners. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows examples of \u2018gene cluster family hotspots\u2019, where metagenomes having a disproportionately high number of OTUs mapping to a specific biomedically relevant target molecule family (e.g., nocardicin, rifamycin, bleomycin, and daptomycin families are shown) are highlighted.

Our analyses of 100s of distinct soil microbiomes suggests that geographic distance and local environment play important roles in the sample-to-sample differences we detected in biosynthetic gene populations. As variations in biosynthetic gene content are expected to correlate with variations in the small-molecule producing capabilities of a microbiome, the broader implication of these observations from a drug discovery perspective is that the dominant biosynthetic systems of geographically distinct soil microbiomes are expected to encode orthogonal, largely unexplored collections of natural products. Taken together, our biosynthetic domain hotspot and OTU diversity analyses represent a starting point in the creation of a global natural products atlas that will use sequence data to guide natural product discovery in the future. Based on the historical success of natural products as therapeutics, microbial \u2018biosynthetic dark matter\u2019 is likely to hold enormous biomedical potential. The key will be learning how to harvest molecules encoded by the biosynthetic diversity we are now able to find through sequencing."

USEARCH (version 7), which implements the improved UPARSE clustering algorithm (<a href=\"#bib12\">Edgar, 2013</a>), was used to remove Chimeric sequences with the default 1.9 value of the de novo chimera detection tool. UPARSE clustering requires all sequences to be of the same length. In an effort to balance read quality and abundance with the ability to phylogenetically discriminate gene clusters we used 419 bp as our read length cutoff. The trimmed fasta file was then clustered to 5% to compensate for sequencing error and natural polymorphism that is often observed in gene clusters found in natural bacterial populations. Clustering proceeded as per the USEARCH manual by clustering at a distance of 3% and using representative sequences from each cluster to cluster again at 5%.

The comprehensive overview of sequenced genomes that was recently published in Cell, \u201cInsights into Secondary Metabolism from a Global Analysis of Prokaryotic Biosynthetic Gene Clusters,\u201d shows that there are a handful of biosynthetic systems that are repeatedly found in the genomes of known bacteria that the authors characterize as follows: Saccharide, Other, NRPS, PKS/Fatty Acid, Hybrid (NRPS/PKS), Ribosomal Peptides, and Terpenes. These cluster families are the usual suspects of secondary metabolism. Although the paper highlights the existence of bacterial gene cluster families whose natural products are not known, the dominant players seen in this data analysis remain these well characterized gene cluster families. These same trends are seen in an extensive gene cluster analysis recently published by Bill Metcalf\u2019s group in Nature Chemical Biology entitled \u201cA roadmap for natural product discovery based on large-scale genomics and metabolomics\u201d. The large set of saccharide-encoding gene clusters reported in one survey paper likely significantly overestimates the role of sugar metabolism in natural product biosynthesis by including saccharides with functions with a structural rather than signaling/defensive role (cellulose, O-antigens, Capsular polysaccharides, etc.). Therefore, we believe all recently reported gene cluster surveys essentially confirm the principle upon which our study is based, namely, NP diversity is dominated by a small group of conserved families and that examination of these families is likely to be the most informative avenue for studying chemical diversity in the environment. We have chosen NRPS/PKS as they are largest of these dominant biosynthetic systems although it will be a natural extension of this work for our lab and others to extend it to other families as well."

Currently, there is no easy way to assemble a heterogeneous population of soil-derived genomes using shotgun methods despite the many groups spending a lot of time and money trying to develop algorithms or technical solutions to the problem. Contemporary state-of-the-art metagenome assemblies from complex microbiomes result in incomplete assembly and short contigs. The scale of sequencing required for generating even very low quality information from complex microbiomes makes it impractical to employ this technique for screening large numbers of unique microbiomes. Because of the shortcomings of shotgun-methods in soil metagenomes, we have championed the use of sequence tags to bypass these technical problems. Unlike whole genome sequencing methodologies, this approach does not rely on the analysis of complete biosynthetic clusters. Instead, it uses individual next-generation sequencing reads from PCR amplicons of conserved biosynthetic domain gene sequences (termed Natural Product Sequence Tags, NPSTs) to predict gene content and chemical output of NP gene clusters, in a fashion analogous to reconstructing the phylogeny of entire organisms using 16S rRNA sequences. Although shotgun-sequencing approaches have been useful for guiding the identification of clusters in individual genomes and small, endosymbiont metagenomes, their application to more complex metagenomes has been very limited. In fact, in a direct comparison of biosynthetic domain detection from metagenomic samples, this PCR-based method was shown to be 10 to 100 times more sensitive than shotgun sequencing in identifying unique sequences."

Additional non-United States samples represent eDNA samples originally collected in earlier international collaborative studies. In addition to our collection methods being of a collaborative nature with international scientists, our sample handling methods are designed to ensure that neither live bacteria nor cloneable eDNA is ever collected or available at the end of the experiment. It is therefore not possible to recover commercializable material (e.g., bacterial gene clusters, live bacteria or small molecules) from any foreign sample processed in this study. As no archiveable material was collected for this work, the gene fragments sequenced in this study are only useful for conducting comparative ecological studies like those outlined here, and they do not permit the recovery of any functional genetic material that might be of commercial value."
