Here, signals, mediators, and biological effects of terrein production were studied in the fungus <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> to elucidate the contribution of terrein to ecological competition. Terrein causes fruit surface lesions and inhibits plant seed germination. Additionally, terrein is moderately antifungal and reduces ferric iron, thereby supporting growth of <i>A. terreus</i> under iron starvation. In accordance, the lack of nitrogen or iron or elevated methionine levels induced terrein production and was dependent on either the nitrogen response regulators AreA and AtfA or the iron response regulator HapX. Independent signal transduction allows complex sensing of the environment and, combined with its broad spectrum of biological activities, terrein provides a prominent example of adapted secondary metabolite production in response to environmental competition."

Here, signals, mediators, and biological effects of terrein production were studied in the fungus <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> to elucidate the contribution of terrein to ecological competition. Terrein causes fruit surface lesions and inhibits plant seed germination. Additionally, terrein is moderately antifungal and reduces ferric iron, thereby supporting growth of <i>A. terreus</i> under iron starvation. In accordance, the lack of nitrogen or iron or elevated methionine levels induced terrein production and was dependent on either the nitrogen response regulators AreA and AtfA or the iron response regulator HapX. Independent signal transduction allows complex sensing of the environment and, combined with its broad spectrum of biological activities, terrein provides a prominent example of adapted secondary metabolite production in response to environmental competition."

Therefore, we aimed to investigate environmental signals that result in <i>terR</i> expression and, eventually, the production of terrein.

Two global transcription factors sense the quality and availability of nitrogen sources and specifically respond to the plant and fruit environment.

In contrast, and in agreement with previous observations, a 200\u2013500 fold induction was observed on PDB medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Similarly, on Sabouraud and yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium, induction levels reached 10\u201330% compared with PDB. However, potato broth or casamino acids did not induce the cluster without the addition of glucose, indicating that glucose appears to be required for terrein production rather than repressing gene cluster induction as shown for other SM gene clusters (<a href=\"#bib64\">Theilgaard et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9a\">Brakhage et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gressler et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, when glucose medium was supplemented with 1% casamino acids as the nitrogen source, a 20\u201330 fold activation was detected. Since terrein can cause lesions on fruit surfaces and inhibits plant seed germination (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kamata et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zaehle et al., 2014</a>), we assumed that sugar-rich fruit and root juices might have a strong stimulatory capacity. Therefore, we cultivated the reporter strain on banana, carrot, peach, and apple juice. \u03b2-Galactosidase activities from these media exceeded the activity of the already strong inducing PDB medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) by a factor of at least five. Additionally, in subsequent LC analyses of culture extracts, a distinct ultraviolet signal for terrein was detected (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). This led us to infect fresh bananas with the <i>A. terreus</i> \u0394<i>akuB</i> strain (the parental strain for gene deletions; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gressler et al., 2011</a>), a \u0394<i>terR</i> mutant lacking the transcriptional activator, and a \u0394<i>terA</i> deletion mutant that lacks the key polyketide synthase from the cluster."

This suggested that additional or alternative inducing signals might exist. Fruit juices are rich in sugars and the C:N ratio in fruits is very high, which could result in severe nitrogen limitation at a later growth state. Therefore, another set of experiments was performed in which the total concentration of amino acids was either high (50 mM) or low (10 mM) and P<i>terA</i> induction from the <i>lacZ</i> reporter strain was determined at different time points (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). While high concentrations of amino acids or inorganic nitrogen sources such as nitrate or ammonia did not induce the cluster, low nitrogen contents resulted in a time-dependent 40\u2013400 fold induction. To correlate gene expression with nitrogen exhaustion, the nitrogen consumption from a medium supplemented with 10 mM ammonium chloride was monitored and cluster induction was simultaneously analysed. Indeed, as soon as nitrogen levels reached the detection limit, cluster expression was strongly induced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

In agreement, when ammonium chloride was added to banana juice, \u03b2-galactosidase activity was strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similarly, the P<i>terA:lacZ</i> reporter strain displayed high \u03b2-galactosidase activity when bananas were directly infected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). When bananas were supplemented with ammonium chloride prior to infection with the wild-type, ethyl acetate extracts of the bananas revealed a 50% reduction in terrein content compared with bananas without nitrogen supplementation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This finding clearly indicates that nitrogen limitation is a major inducer for terrein production under natural conditions. However, it should be mentioned that the presence of sugars was always required, since especially hexoses from mono- and disaccharides provoked strong expression under nitrogen-limited conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), which is in direct contrast to the production of dihydroisoflavipucine in <i>A. terreus</i> that belongs to the class of fruit and root rot toxins. This metabolite is only produced in the strict absence of sugars and requires preferred nitrogen sources such as glutamine or asparagine for induction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gressler et al., 2011</a>)."

The global nitrogen regulator AreA (ATEG_07264) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arst and Cove, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hynes, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Davis et al., 2005</a>), the cross pathway control regulator CpcA (ATEG_03131) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoffmann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Krappmann et al., 2004</a>), the stress response bZIP transcription factor AtfA (ATEG_04664) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balazs et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lara-Rojas et al., 2011</a>), and the nitrogen starvation-induced ras-protein RhbA (ATEG_09480) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Panepinto et al., 2002</a>) were selected for gene deletions. All mutants were tested for their growth properties in the presence of proteinogenic amino acids or ornithine, citrulline, urea, and casamino acids, all of which were used as the sole nitrogen source.

However, among all the mutants tested, the <i>areA</i> mutant revealed the most severe growth defects. This mutant grew like the wild-type on glutamine and displayed some reduced growth on the nitrogen-rich amino acids asparagine, aspartate, and histidine as well as on urea and ammonium chloride. However, the \u0394<i>areA</i> strain was unable to use any other proteinogenic amino acid. As described for other <i>Aspergillus</i> species (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hunter et al., 2014</a>), these results confirm an essential role of AreA in nitrogen sensing and utilisation in <i>A. terreus</i>. In contrast, the <i>atfA</i> mutant was only impaired in growth at high aspartate concentrations (50 mM). However, conidia of this mutant lacked the typical yellow-brown pigmentation. Additionally, the <i>atfA</i> mutant completely lacked the typical red colouration of the medium in the presence of methionine, which has previously been demonstrated to be associated with terrein production (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zaehle et al., 2014</a>). This implied a regulatory role of <i>atfA</i> on SM production in <i>A. terreus</i>. On the contrary, the <i>atfA</i> mutant did not show increased sensitivity against oxidative or osmotic stress as described for other <i>Aspergillus</i> species (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balazs et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lara-Rojas et al., 2011</a>). Finally, a double deletion of the <i>areA</i> and <i>atfA</i> genes was generated (\u0394<i>areA</i>\u0394<i>atfA</i>) resembling the growth phenotypes of both single mutants, since it was only able to grow on the media that supported growth of the <i>areA</i> mutant where it formed white conidia, as observed for the \u0394<i>atfA</i> strain."

The wild-type, the \u0394<i>cpcA</i>, and the \u0394<i>rhbA</i> mutant revealed low terrein production in the presence of nitrogen, but high terrein titers when nitrogen was omitted. This indicates that <i>cpcA</i> and <i>rhbA</i> are dispensable for terrein production. In contrast, both the \u0394<i>areA</i> and the \u0394<i>atfA</i> mutant only produced marginal amounts of terrein under nitrogen-limited conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and this effect was completely cured in the complemented mutants <i>areA</i><sup><i>c</i></sup> and <i>atfA</i><sup><i>c</i></sup>. No terrein was detected in a \u0394<i>areA</i>\u0394<i>atfA</i> double mutant. Therefore, both <i>areA</i> and <i>atfA</i> appear essential for terrein production under nitrogen limitation.

                                "text": "In the wild-type the regulators <i>areA</i> and <i>atfA</i> showed a time-dependent increase in gene expression. While the regulator <i>terR</i> was most strongly upregulated after 12 hr, expression of the TerR-controlled terrein biosynthesis genes <i>terA</i> and <i>terB</i> continued to increase after 12 hr and reached 13.3 and 3.2 times the expression level of the actin control gene at 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). On the contrary, while complemented mutants behaved like the wild-type, the <i>areA</i> and <i>atfA</i> deletions strongly reduced activation of <i>terR</i> and, in turn, the expression of <i>terA</i> and <i>terB</i>. Results from qRT-PCR perfectly coincided with the substantially reduced terrein production rates under nitrogen limitation in these mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). AreA recognises the DNA-binding motif HGATAR, and two adjacent binding sites are generally required for transcriptional activation due to dimer formation of AreA monomers (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ravagnani et al., 1997</a>). In this respect, the <i>terR</i> promoter contains two putative AreA binding sites that match the HGATAR consensus (BS1and BS2; positions \u221259 and \u221272 relative to the translational start point). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses with the <i>A</i>spergillus <i>nidulans</i> AreA DNA-binding domain, which is 91% identical to the respective <i>A. terreus</i> AreA domain, showed that BS1 and BS2 are recognised with high affinity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This strengthens the model of a direct involvement of AreA in the activation of <i>terR</i> expression. However, the reduction of <i>terR</i> expression was less pronounced in the \u0394<i>areA</i> than in the \u0394<i>atfA</i> background (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which indicates that AreA is not the only activator acting on the <i>terR</i> promoter. Therefore, we additionally searched for putative palindromic AtfA/Sko1 binding sites (5\u2032-TKACGTMA-3\u2032) in the promoter regions of the cluster (<a href=\"#bib50\">Proft et al., 2005</a>). Only one hit (TGACGTCA) was identified in the promoter of the structural gene <i>terC</i>. However, if one mismatch is allowed, there is a putative binding site at position \u2212731 relative to the ATG start codon of <i>terR</i> (5\u00b4-TGGCGTCA-3\u00b4), but it remains speculative whether this binding site is recognised by <i>A. terreus</i> AtfA. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that even a single half site of the suggested motif could promote transcription factor binding and promoter induction (<a href=\"#bib50\">Proft et al., 2005</a>). We therefore conclude that, although direct evidence for AtfA binding at the <i>terR</i> promoter is lacking, both transcription factors seem to regulate <i>terR</i> expression. In agreement, <i>terR</i>, <i>terA</i>, and <i>terB</i> expression and terrein production showed the strongest decrease in the \u0394<i>areA</i>\u0394<i>atfA</i> double knock-out mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, a constitutive expression of <i>atfA</i> by the <i>gpdA</i> promoter led to increased terrein production (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This supports our hypothesis of direct involvement of AtfA in terrein cluster regulation."

A BLASTp search for orthologous genes in the genome of <i>A. terreus</i> NIH2624 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) revealed that all genes required for a reductive iron assimilation (RIA) system (<i>fetC</i>, <i>freB</i>, <i>ftrA</i>), siderophore biosynthesis (<i>sid</i> genes, except <i>sidG</i>), siderophore transport (<i>mirA-D</i>, <i>sitA</i>), and regulators of iron homeostasis (<i>srbA</i>, <i>sreA</i>, and <i>hapX</i>) are well conserved in the <i>A. terreus</i> genome. When tested under iron limitation, qRT-PCR analyses confirmed a strong induction of genes from siderophore biosynthesis, siderophore transport, and the RIA pathway (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To confirm siderophore production by <i>A. terreus</i>, we cultivated the wild-type strain under iron-rich (200 \u00b5M FeCl<sub>3</sub>) and iron-limited conditions (no or 20 \u00b5M FeCl<sub>3</sub>) and identified ferrichrysin (<b>2</b>) and coprogen (<b>3</b>) only under iron limitation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1, 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Z\u00e4hner et al., 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bertrand et al., 2010</a>). Coprogen revealed a higher stability than ferrichrysin. Subsequent analyses involving siderophores were therefore based only on coprogen.

The strong antioxidant ascorbic acid (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elmagirbi et al., 2012</a>) served as control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Although ascorbic acid showed a much higher reducing potential, terrein was also able to convert ferric to ferrous iron in a concentration-dependent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) and pH-dependent (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) manner with a pH optimum of 3\u20134. In this respect, we noticed a significant fall in the culture pH under iron limitation from 6.5 to about 3.5, which agrees with the optimum pH for terrein-mediated iron reduction. Thus, since terrein is produced during growth under iron limitation, the combination with a fall in pH could indeed increase iron availability."

The structure of the oxidation product implies that oxidation took place at the two hydroxylated carbon atoms of terrein, leading to a cleavage of the pentenone ring system as proposed by <a href=\"#bib67\">Trabolsy et al. (2014</a>). In contrast, conversion of terrein to PMA was not observed during incubation with Fe<sup>2+</sup>, confirming that iron reduction was the cause of PMA formation. No conversion of terrein was observed with oxidised copper ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), indicating a limited reductive potential which is sufficient for iron but not for copper (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

In <i>A. fumigatus</i>, growth and virulence defects caused by the interruption of the reductive iron assimilation pathway are only observed when the siderophore-based system is also inactivated (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blatzer et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, to elucidate a positive effect of terrein on iron acquisition, we deleted the <i>sidA</i> gene in <i>A. terreus</i> that encodes the <span class=\"small-caps\">L</span>-ornithine-<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-monooxygenase, a key enzyme in hydroxamate siderophore biosynthesis<i>.</i> Coprogen production was confirmed in the wild-type and a complemented mutant, but was completely lacking from the \u0394<i>sidA</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When analysed for growth phenotypes on solid media, all complemented mutants and the \u0394<i>terA</i> strain behaved like the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The <i>hapX</i> mutant showed a reduced growth rate without iron supplementation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), which is in agreement with reduced coprogen production as shown above (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, severe iron limitation from the addition of the iron chelator bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS) completely repressed growth of the <i>hapX</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The \u0394<i>sidA</i> mutant displayed the most severe phenotype: while \u0394<i>sidA</i> showed normal growth with slightly reduced conidiation in the presence of high to moderate iron concentrations (100 or 20 \u00b5M FeCl<sub>3</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), growth was strongly retarded when the iron concentration was reduced to 2 \u00b5M FeCl<sub>3</sub>. No growth was observed even after prolonged incubation when iron was omitted (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). These phenotypes were cured when purified coprogen was externally added (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, growth of the \u0394<i>sidA</i> strain was also partially restored in the presence of ascorbic acid and, although to a lesser extent, by the addition of terrein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This result is supported by previous studies on an <i>A. nidulans</i> \u0394<i>sidA</i> mutant which was able to grow under iron limitation in the presence of ascorbic acid (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eisendle et al., 2003</a>). Unexpectedly, terrein supplementation inhibited growth of an <i>A. fumigatus sidA</i> mutant, which was also true for an <i>A. fumigatus</i> wild-type strain (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Subsequent analyses showed that growth of the phytopathogen <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> was also inhibited by terrein-containing culture extracts from <i>A. terreus</i> (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating some antifungal properties of terrein against environmental competitors."

While growth of mycelium from the \u0394<i>akuB</i> strain looked identical to that from conidia, the \u0394<i>sidA</i> mutant started to form small colonies even in the absence of iron, whereas the \u0394<i>terA</i>\u0394<i>sidA</i> mutant showed some weak growth only at 2 \u00b5M FeCl<sub>3</sub> but not in the absence of external iron supplementation. Terrein production was analysed from extracted agar plugs, which confirmed that the wild-type and \u0394<i>sidA</i> mutant produced substantial amounts of terrein under iron-limited conditions whereas terrein production was fully abrogated in the \u0394<i>terA</i>\u0394<i>sidA</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results indicate that terrein production supports iron acquisition, although the siderophore system is the dominant iron acquisition system."

However, extracellular siderophores show a high affinity for ferric iron but not for ferrous iron (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hider and Kong, 2010</a>). Thus, the reduction of ferric iron could reduce the efficiency of iron chelation by xenosiderophores secreted from competing microorganisms. A similar strategy for iron acquisition has previously been described for the human pathogenic fungus <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">Timmerman and Woods, 1999</a>). <i>H. capsulatum</i> secretes glutathione accompanied by the \u03b3-glutamyltransferase Ggt1.

Interestingly, in <i>A. terreus</i> the interaction between AtfA and SakA has not been solved in detail.

Although one environmental signal is sufficient to induce the gene cluster, a combination of different signals provides an environmental image of higher resolution and allows an adequate adaptation to the ecological niche. The phytotoxic and antifungal potential of terrein combined with its iron reductive properties enables <i>A. terreus</i> to acquire nutrients that might otherwise be consumed by competitors. Notably, similar to terrein, the mycotoxin production in <i>Fusarium</i> species is generally associated with sensing of nitrogen availability. Although AreA plays an important regulatory function, involvement of AtfA as an additional regulator and methionine as a second inducer in these species needs to be tested. However, from our results on the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster, we propose that manifold regulation of SM gene clusters and the interplay of different global transcriptional activators might depict a general mechanism to regulate the flexibility of gene cluster activation in fungi."

In brief, an equal volume of ethyl acetate was added and collected after defined shaking of the mixture. The procedure was repeated once. After evaporation of the solvent, residues were taken up in 1 ml methanol each and filtered. Standard extract analyses were performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC-DAD system coupled with a MSD trap (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) operating in alternating ionisation mode. Terrein quantification was carried out from 50 ml cultures as described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zaehle et al., 2014</a>). For quantification of the siderophore coprogen, the complete 50 ml culture supernatants were filtered and lyophilised to dryness. The remaining solids were extracted three times with 10 ml MeOH. The solvent from the combined organic extracts was removed under reduced pressure and residues were re-dissolved in 2 ml MeOH. The resulting slurries were filtered and the filtrates analysed by HPLC measurements. HPLC analyses were carried out on an Agilent 1260 device equipped with a quaternary pump and a UV/Vis detector (Agilent Technologies; Column: Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8, 5 \u00b5m, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm; flow rate 1 ml/min; eluent A: H<sub>2</sub>O/0.1% HCOOH, eluent B: MeOH). The gradient started with 10% B and reached 30% B after 4 min, increased to 55% B within 10 min and reached 100% B after 2 min, where it was retained for an additional 4 min. Quantification of coprogen was performed from a calibration curve of known coprogen concentrations. For correlation of coprogen to the fungal biomass, mycelia from the cultures were dried for 48 hr at 37\u00b0C and balanced and coprogen concentrations per gram dried mycelium were calculated. All quantifications were carried out in biological triplicates and technical duplicates. Isolation of coprogen for generation of the calibration curve was performed by semi-preparative HPLC from culture supernatants of the \u0394<i>akuB</i> and \u0394<i>akuB</i>\u0394<i>terA</i> strains and fractions were collected by automatic fraction collection. Separation was carried out on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8, 5 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm with a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min using H<sub>2</sub>O as eluent A and MeOH as eluent B. The gradient started with 10% B, reached 30% B after 6.5 min, increased to 55% B within 16.5 min, reached 100% B after 2 min, and was retained at 100% B for an additional 6 min. For isolation of 2-((<i>E</i>)-prop-1-en-1-yl)maleic acid, the crude product from upscaled terrein reduction assays (see below) was subjected to semi-preparative HPLC using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8, 5 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm with a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min, eluent A: H<sub>2</sub>O/0.1% HCOOH, eluent B: acetonitrile. The gradient started with 5% B and was held for 14 min, increased to 10% B within 9 min, increased to 100% B within 2 min where it was retained for an additional 7 min. Fractions from the new metabolite formed from ferric iron reduction were collected and evaporated resulting in a white solid which revealed a <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> value of 150.0495 [M + H<sup>+</sup>] by HRESI-MS that perfectly matched a calculated molecular formula of C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub> containing four double-bond equivalents. <sup>13</sup>C-NMR measurements (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) revealed the presence of two carbonyl groups, one terminal methyl group, and four carbons being part of a conjugated system. Two-dimensional NMR data (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) and analysis of all proton coupling constants from the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) finally confirmed the structure of 2-((<i>E</i>)-prop-1-en-1-yl)maleic acid.

Reduction of ferric to ferrous iron was followed by determination of the change in absorbance at 590 nm for up to 10 hr using a FLOUstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech). For determination of the pH optimum of the terrein mediated reduction, reagent A was adjusted to pH values of 3.5\u20136.0. Reductive activity was normalised against the activity determined from ascorbic acid, which was set as 100%. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.

This study employed genetic knockout and complementation studies along with other assays to deconvolute the signaling pathways \u2013 nitrogen, iron, and methionine \u2013 involved in regulating terrein production through AreA, AtfA, and Hap X transcription factors. The released terrein reduces environmental Fe3<sup>+</sup> (ferric ion) to Fe2<sup>+</sup> (ferrous ion) to both allow it to be imported by the producing fungus and make it unavailable to microbial competitors relying on siderophores. The conclusions illustrate how terrein production and function allow its producer to thrive in rhizosphere."

Interestingly, in <i>A. terreus</i> the interaction between AtfA and SakA has not been solved in detail. While a <i>sakA</i> deletion does not affect terrein production levels under nitrogen limitation, it allows terrein production in the presence of some nitrogen sources, indicating that it may possess a repressor function under some conditions. In addition, a \u0394<i>sakA</i> strain still produces pigmented conidia (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) and the <i>sakA</i> mutant, but not the \u0394<i>atfA</i> strain showed some increased osmosensitivity (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), which agrees to recent data on \u0394<i>atfA</i> and \u0394<i>sakA</i> mutants of <i>Penicillium marneffei</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nimmanee et al., 2014</a>).

Therefore, we conclude that, although direct evidence for AtfA binding at the <i>terR</i> promoter is lacking, both transcription factors seem to regulate <i>terR</i> expression.\u201d"

Interestingly, terrein production is only under positive HapX control, but not under negative SreA feedback-control, which is in agreement with a lack of SreA binding sites in the <i>terR</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schrettl et al., 2008</a>), whereas a CCAAT box required for binding of the CCAAT-binding complex (CBC) and its subsequent CBC interaction with HapX (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hortschansky et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gsaller et al., 2014</a>) is present. In the HapX target promoter regions of <i>cycA</i>, <i>sreA</i>, <i>acoA</i> and <i>lysF</i> from <i>Aspergilli</i> a bipartite CBC-HapX-DNA binding motif with consensus 5\u2032-C(C/A)AATCAN<sub>11-12</sub>GAT-3\u2032 is present, of which CCAAT is recognised by the CBC complex, while the GAT sequence is bound by HapX (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hortschansky et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly these are all types of promoters that are repressed under iron limitation. In contrast, the <i>cccA</i> promoter, which encodes for a vacuolar iron transporter, is the only known HapX induced promoter known so far with a confirmed in vitro HapX binding site (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gsaller et al., 2014</a>). HapX binds to the GAT motif of a 5\u2032-CCAATN<sub>16</sub>GATC-3\u2032 sequence, which is also present in the <i>cccA</i> promoter of <i>A. terreus</i> and \u2013 with one mismatch \u2013 in the <i>terR</i> promoter (position \u2212215).
