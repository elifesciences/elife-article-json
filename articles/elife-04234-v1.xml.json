The mechanism by which the passenger domain is secreted is poorly understood. Here we show that a conserved OM protein insertase (the Bam complex) and a molecular chaperone (SurA) are both necessary and sufficient to promote the complete assembly of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 autotransporter EspP in vitro. Our results indicate that the membrane integration of the \u03b2 domain is the rate-limiting step in autotransporter assembly and that passenger domain translocation does not require the input of external energy. Furthermore, experiments using nanodiscs strongly suggest that autotransporter assembly is catalyzed by a single copy of the Bam complex. Finally, we describe a method to purify a highly active form of the Bam complex that should facilitate the elucidation of its function."
