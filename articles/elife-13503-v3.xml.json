Each cell type expresses a unique set of genes, and recapitulating expression of marker genes by BAC transgenesis or knock-in has generated useful transgenic mouse lines. However, since genes are often expressed in many cell types, many of these lines have relatively broad expression patterns. We report an alternative transgenic approach capturing distal enhancers for more focused expression. We identified an enhancer trap probe often producing restricted reporter expression and developed efficient enhancer trap screening with the PiggyBac transposon. We established more than 200 lines and found many lines that label small subsets of neurons in brain substructures, including known and novel cell types. Images and other information about each line are available online (<a href=\"http://enhancertrap.bio.brandeis.edu/\">enhancertrap.bio.brandeis.edu</a>)."

Each cell type expresses a unique set of genes, and recapitulating expression of marker genes by BAC transgenesis or knock-in has generated useful transgenic mouse lines. However, since genes are often expressed in many cell types, many of these lines have relatively broad expression patterns. We report an alternative transgenic approach capturing distal enhancers for more focused expression. We identified an enhancer trap probe often producing restricted reporter expression and developed efficient enhancer trap screening with the PiggyBac transposon. We established more than 200 lines and found many lines that label small subsets of neurons in brain substructures, including known and novel cell types. Images and other information about each line are available online (<a href=\"http://enhancertrap.bio.brandeis.edu/\">enhancertrap.bio.brandeis.edu</a>)."

Some of the types of brain cells uncovered by these experiments are new, and the labelling of specific brain cells and brain areas in different strains makes these mice a useful resource for future work. Furthermore, it will be relatively straightforward to produce many more strains of these mice, because it would simply involve crossbreeding mice.

The ability to distinguish these cell types and to understand their roles in circuit activity and behavior is enhanced by an increasing variety of new genetic technologies in mice. Conditional transgenes like fluorescent reporters or alleles that sense or modify neuronal activity can be turned on in cells of interest through the use of 'driver' strains selectively expressing Cre recombinase or the tet transactivator (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang and Zeng, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Luo et al., 2008</a>). Most techniques for producing these driver strains rely on recapitulating endogenous patterns of gene expression. However, selective expression patterns often depend both on elements within the proximal promoter, and on enhancers and other regulatory elements that can be located quite distally (<a href=\"#bib71\">Visel et al., 2009</a>). Recapitulating endogenous expression requires either a knock-in approach (<a href=\"#bib65\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>), or making transgenics from very large genomic fragments containing both the promoter and distal control elements (e.g. BAC transgenics (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yang et al., 1997</a>)."

For example, the Pvalb-cre driver strain (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</a>) can be used to target Pvalb-positive fast-spiking interneurons in the neocortex; however, Pvalb is also expressed in cerebellum (Purkinje cells), dorsal root ganglia, thalamus, and many other brain structures, as well as in skeletal muscle. Even in the neocortex, Pvalb-positive cells consist of at least two distinct interneuron subtypes (basket cells and chandelier cells) and some layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Limitations on cell type specificity are common, since most genes are expressed in many different cell types throughout many different brain regions and tissues. Although combinatorial approaches can enhance specificity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Madisen et al., 2015</a>), this comes at the cost of increasing the number of alleles that must be created and bred. Furthermore, this approach requires initial knowledge about co-expression patterns that may be lacking for some cell types."

This approach, termed enhancer detection or enhancer trapping, has a long history in <i>Drosophila</i> where it has been pursued primarily using the Gal4-UAS system (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellen et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>). More recently, this system and others have been used for enhancer trapping in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balciunas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Scott et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Urasaki et al., 2008</a>), but the approach has been less widely used in mice (though see <a href=\"#bib23\">Gossler et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kothary et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Soininen et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Stanford et al., 2001</a>). A large-scale enhancer trap screen was performed using the SleepingBeauty transposon system (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ruf et al., 2011</a>) but was focused on enhancers active during embryonic development, rather than those that regulate cell-type-specific expression in the adult. Kelsch et al. (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kelsch et al., 2012</a>) conducted a mouse enhancer trap screen for transgenic animals with specific patterns of neural expression. Their lentiviral enhancer probe successfully generated transgenic lines with expression in neuronal subsets, however, the number of lines generated was small and most lines had expression in many cell types. Thus, this approach, while promising, has not yet reached its full potential, both in terms of specificity and in terms of the efficiency with which new lines can be generated."

First, using lentiviral transgenesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lois et al., 2002</a>), we discovered a tet-transactivator-dependent enhancer probe capable of generating transgenic lines with highly restricted expression patterns. Next, we incorporated this tet-enhancer probe into the PiggyBac transposon system and developed a simple and efficient system for producing mouse lines with different PiggyBac insertion sites. The majority of these lines have brain expression and many have highly restricted expression patterns in known or novel neuronal cell types. Finally, a critical consideration in using the enhancer trap approach in the CNS of any species is the question of whether trapped neurons represent specific cell types or more random subsets of largely unrelated cells. To address this, we performed more detailed anatomical and physiological characterization in a subset of lines. These experiments revealed that the neuronal populations are not random assortments of unrelated cells, but represent highly specific, previously recognized, as well as novel, neuronal cell types. In addition, quantitative comparison with a recently annotated collection of knock-in and BAC-cre driver strains revealed that expression is, on average, far more restricted in the enhancer trap lines. Hence enhancer trapping is a viable strategy for producing driver strains that complement those generated through other genetic approaches. This resource provides a platform for genetic control of a wide variety of neuronal cell types, as well as for discovering new subtypes of known neuronal cell types."

Tracking and segregating multiple alleles in order to identify the allele responsible for reporter expression in the case of founders having multiple insertions was especially time consuming. Moreover, we found four lines in which expression in the founder and early progeny was lost in later generations, implying possible silencing of lentiviral transgenes over generations (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hofmann et al., 2006</a>).

Unlike the SleepingBeauty transposon, PiggyBac has a weaker tendency to undergo local hops (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liang et al., 2009</a>, but see supplemental note), making it more suitable for screens that target the whole genome. To simplify the process of establishing and tracking new transgenic alleles, we established lines of animals carrying a single-copy PB integration and additional lines expressing the PiggyBac transposase (PBase). PB hops only in animals with both the PB and PBase alleles, allowing us to generate transgenic animals with different PB insertion sites simply by mating wild type and PB;PBase animals (see the mating scheme in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We used the same tTA-reporter system used in the lentiviral probes (PB tet, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Lines generated by local hop of PB (within ~100\u00a0Kb) had similar expression patterns to that of the original line (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), probably because shared local enhancers regulated expression of the reporter. In most of lines, we did not find clear resemblance between reporter expression patterns and those of genes near insertion sites (see supplemental note). Some lines had dominant expression in a single anatomical structure, such as deep entorhinal cortex (P038, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), subiculum (P141, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), retrosplenial cortex (P099, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), or dorsal hindbrain (P108, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Many lines had expression in multiple regions but with unique cell types in each area. For example, P008 has broad expression in striatum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E1</a>) but has restricted expression in the most medial part of the hippocampus (fasciola cinereum, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E2</a>). P057 had cortical layer 5 expression and restricted expression in anterior-lateral caudate putamen (CP; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Interestingly, the mCitrine-positive CP cells appeared to be part of the direct pathway; the cells projected axons to a limited area in substantia nigra pars reticulata (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H2</a> inset) but not to the globus pallidus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H1</a> arrow; compare the GP projection of P008 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E1</a>). Lines with broad expression, (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>), those labeling few cells, and those closely resembling existing lines were terminated (48 lines).

Many lines showed different reporter expression patterns at different ages, likely reflecting the developmental dynamics of the trapped enhancers. Screening was primarily carried out in young adults (P20-30). We examined adult (P50 or later) expression in 34 lines. Mature expression was reduced in 12 of these lines, but was retained in the remaining 22 lines. Some lines showed complex spatiotemporal expression patterns. For example, young postnatal animals (P10-12) from line P162 had expression in primary sensory cortices, the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus and pontine grey, but more mature (3 weeks or older) animals lost thalamic and pontine expression and gained subiculum expression (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting the probe trapped enhancer(s) activated in different structures at different developmental stages. Unlike some lentiviral lines, silencing of PB transgenes over generations was not observed; even lines losing expression late in adulthood had pups that regained reporter expression."

TRE promoters are known to have weak, tTA-independent ('leak') expression that can be substantial when many copies of the TRE-Cre constructs are delivered virally (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mizuno et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhu et al., 2007</a>). We injected adenoassociated virus (AAV) encoding TRE-driven transgenes into multiple areas in different lines (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>. See <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a> for counts). We found mCherry reporter was expressed specifically expressed in mCitrine-positive cells in most of cases. For example, three lines with expression in different layers of retrosplenial cortex had specific virus expression in different layers (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). Infection efficiency varied from 36.5% (CA1 pyramidal cells in P066, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>) to nearly 100% (layer 6 pyramidal cells in 56L, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10R and T</a>), probably due to AAV serotype preference. In some lines, as reported (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choy, 2015</a>), we found a few viral reporter-positive but mCitrine-negative cells in the same layer/positions with those of mCitrine-positive cells (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E and F</a>; 0.7% +/- 0.7% of infected cells, n=6 injections in 5 strains), but never in ectopic positions lacking mCitrine positive cells. We speculate this 'off-target' expression might be a result of competition over tTA proteins between single copy TRE of mCitrine in the genome and many copies of TRE from virus. Myristoylated mCherry driven by a second-generation TRE (TREtight-myrmCherry-HA) was expressed only in mCitrine-positive cells and could be used to map their axonal projections (see below). Similarly, tet-dependent channelrhodopsin virus (TREtight-ChR2H134R-mCherry) had specific expression only in mCitrine-positive cells and could drive action potentials upon blue light stimulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choy, 2015</a>)."

Nearly all these attempts were unsuccessful (see <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">5</a>) due first to low level leak of all versions of the TRE promoter tried, combined with the high sensitivity of cre-dependent recombination. Expression of Cre from the enhancer probe may have suffered from this problem in some cases as well as the additional problem of more widespread developmental expression. We were able to obtain specific Cre-reporter expression restricted to mCitrine-positive cells, using an implementation of the GFP nanobody-split Cre virus (developed independently from <a href=\"#bib64\">Tang et al., 2015</a>). The GFP nanobody-split Cre also had specific reporter expression from Ai14 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>) TdTomato Cre reporter allele (supplemental note, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">5</a>)."

Many (92) lines have expression in subregions of the hippocampal formation. CA1 is one of major input source of the subiculum, which sends axons to the entorhinal cortex through the presubiculum (PRE) and parasubiculum (PAR). Labeled cells proximal to CA1 in three lines, P162 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), P139 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), and P141 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), do not project to PRE but the distal subiculum population labeled in P157 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) does. P066, which has expression in the whole subiculum, also has PRE projections (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). P162, P139, and P141 have expression in adjacent positions (cells in P162 and P139 are in nearly the same positions and P141 cells are located posterior to them, (see distal ends of CA1 marked by arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>) but have different axonal projections. P162 has dense mCitrine-positive axons in the reuniens nucleus (RE) and dorsal and ventral submedial nucleus (SMT) but there are few axons in the corresponding areas in P139 and P141 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). Injection of tet \u2013dependent virus (AAV-Tre3G-myristylated mCherry-HA) into the subiculum in P162 confirmed that axons in RE and SMT were coming from the subiculum (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I</a>). P160 has expression in PRE and PAR and dense axonal projections to entorhinal cortex, medial part (ENTm, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). P149 has expression in ENTm layer 5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). P084 also has expression in the same region, but the expression is restricted to the most medial part of ENTm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). 56L had broad expression in deep layer 6 of neocortex, but its expression in ENTm was observed in upper layer 6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). P038 occupied ENTm deep layer 6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>).

Two broad categories of layer II glutamatergic neurons have previously been described; semilunar (SL) cells, which lack well-defined basal dendrites and are located in the upper sublayer of layer II, and superficial pyramidal (SP) cells, which, like most pyramids, possess distinct basal and apical dendrites and are located deeper in layer II (<a href=\"#bib60\">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">2011</a>). 48L cells were recently shown to be a subset of SL cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choy, 2015</a>).

Like SP cells, they responded to depolarizing current with an initial high frequency burst of action potentials (<a href=\"#bib60\">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006</a>) as did nearby non-labeled cells (arrows in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8G</a>). However, labeled cells (but not unlabeled cells) differed from the previously described SP neurons in that they exhibit a stuttering firing pattern and their firing inactivates at higher currents (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>). Labeled and non-labeled neurons also differ in their afterhyperpolarizations (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E and G</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9J</a>). While the labeled neurons could not sustain prolonged firing at high-current injections, their instantaneous firing frequency was higher in the beginning of spike train (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E and G</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K</a>). Morphologically, the non-labeled neurons resemble previously described SP cells since they possessed distinct basal and apical dendrites (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a>). Labeled neurons also possessed basal dendrites (unlike SL cells) but do not have a distinct apical dendrite (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Taken together, our anatomical and physiological results suggest that 52L cells are a distinct subset of SP cells that differ phenotypically from other, unlabeled SP cells."

Single cell tracing has shown that there are two types of L6 CT projecting pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib66\">Thomson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang and Deschenes, 1997</a>); primary sensory CT pyramidal neurons send axons to primary sensory thalamic nuclei (ex. ventro-posterior medial:VPm, lateral geniculate dorsal nucleus: LGd). Non-primary CT neurons send weaker projections to primary sensory nuclei, but also project to secondary sensory nuclei; for\u00a0example, in primary somatosensory cortex, they send axons to VPM, posterior thalamic nuclei (Po), and intralaminar thalamic nucleus. Primary CT neurons are located in upper layer 6 and non-primary CT neurons in lower layer 6. Primary CT neurons also project to the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN), whereas non-primary CT neurons do not. Primary CT neurons and non-primary CT neurons also have different morphologies. Primary CT neurons extend apical dendrites to layer 4 while dendrites of non-primary CT neurons do not reach to layer 4. Layer 6 also contains corticocortical pyramidal cells, which have long collateral projections within layer 6."

Ntsr1-Cre labels virtually all primary CT neurons in layer 6 and also has projection to RTN (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bortone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Olsen et al., 2012</a>). Clustering samples by correlations between gene expression vectors revealed two main clusters: those from 56L and all others (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Samples from P162 and P139 are intermingled in the cluster, implying they have quite similar RNA expression profiles. Analysis of differentially expressed genes also showed clear differences between the two main groups. There were 1869 genes differentially expressed among all sample groups (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01), and most differentially expressed genes showed bimodal patterns; high expressions in one group and low expressions in the other (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B and C</a>). We also examined the expression of previously identified layer 6 marker genes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Molyneaux et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zeisel et al., 2015</a>) and of genes used to generate BAC-Cre lines having layer 6 expression (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harris et al., 2014</a>). Most of these known layer 6 markers are expressed both in the Ntsr1-cre group and in 56L (including the Ntsr1 gene itself) or were present only in the Ntsr1-cre lines. None were reliable markers for the 56L population (see <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and supplemental Note). We also examined expression profile of entorhinal cortical layer 6 cells from P038 in addition to isocortical layer 6 cells.

The enhancer trap approach produces more focused labeling than commonly used approaches that attempt to recapitulate known patterns of endogenous gene expression. Using this approach, we have identified dozens of new subtypes of previously identified neuronal cell types and have clarified the classification of pyramidal neurons within the piriform cortex and within layer 6 of neocortex. The approach is readily scalable since new lines can be generated simply by additional rounds of breeding. We also develop the enhancer trap line web browser to search lines of interests and to share images and detailed information about lines. The web site can serve as a useful open resource for wide range of researcher in mouse genetics and neuroscience."

Viral reporter was mostly expressed only in mCitrine-positive cells, and we did not see major ectopic reporter expression, which supports that cell-type specific tTA expression, but not regional TRE silencing, mainly contributes to highly restricted expression patterns. Single genes often have multiple enhancer modules each of which regulates expression in different regional or developmental contexts (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dickel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Visel et al., 2009</a>). By harnessing these distal enhancers, BAC-transgenic (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">2007</a>) and knock-in (<a href=\"#bib65\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>) approaches have been used to generate lines that copy expression patterns of targeted genes with high-fidelity, but many of these are quite broadly expressed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harris et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Madisen et al., 2015</a>). On the other hand, lines with more limited expression patterns have been generated by unintentional positional effects arising from transgene insertion sites. Restricted expression patterns in the series of Thy1 lines (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feng et al., 2000</a>) and CA1-specific Cre mouse with a CamKII-promoter (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tsien et al., 1996</a>) are notable examples. Because of these positional effects, even BAC transgenic lines occasionally have more restricted expression patterns that differ from those of the targeted genes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang and Zeng, 2013</a>). Although positional effects can restrict expression to specific populations, the population targeted is not predictable because the enhancer code that directs expression to specific cell types is not well understood. To circumvent this limitation, a useful enhancer trap requires screening a large number of individual strains. This has previously been done using transposable element mobilization in flies and fish (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balciunas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bellen et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Scott et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Urasaki et al., 2008</a>). However, since pronuclear-injection produces a rather low efficiency of transgenesis, this approach has not frequently been used in mouse genetics."

In fact, since we have made both single copy PB insertion lines and a line carrying PBase in the male germ line freely available, other laboratories can now screen for additional lines of interest without needing to isolate or inject embryos. Our strategy of including a mCitrine reporter on the probe enables fast expression screening without crossing to a separate reporter line, and including tTA enables inducible genetic manipulation in specifically labeled populations."

In addition, lines generated by local hopping have similar expression patterns. These facts support the conclusion that the expression patterns are not generated randomly, but instead are tightly linked to transgenes\u2019 insertion sites. PB translocation sites were widely distributed over the genome and lines with insertions far away from known genes often exhibited specific expression presumably by trapping distal enhancers. Distal enhancers are known to regulate tissue specific expression of genes, especially in the forebrain (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nord et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Visel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">2013</a>)\u00a0and to regulate activity-dependent gene expression (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). Our results suggest that enhancers are also involved in the fine-grained specification of cell types, and that trapping them can cause very restricted expression patterns. Indeed, drivers restricted to major cell types and layers in laminated structures are already available, but drivers that pick out cell types in specific cortical regions, or thalamic nuclei are quite rare with gene-based strategies but were more common with our enhancer trap strategy."

This permits reproducibility but does not define the full set of 'atomic' cell types that comprise the nervous system. Like brain regions, cell types may be arranged hierarchically into tree-like taxonomies. Most operational cell types represent branches or nodes that can be further subdivided. This subdivision occurs when properties such as morphology, physiology, projections and gene expression are found to vary discontinuously. Eventually, those that cannot be further subdivided may be thought as terminal branches or 'atomic cell types'. For a few of the cell types identified in our enhancer trap strains (e.g. subsets of corticothalamic neurons or piriform cortex neurons) further characterization demonstrates functional distinctions between closely related subtypes. In other cases, the trapped neurons correspond to well-characterized subtypes of a larger class (e.g. LGN thalamic projection neurons), while in many other cases additional characterization will be needed to determine how trapped subtypes differ functionally from other cells in the same class. The anatomical distinctiveness of, for example, Purkinje cells restricted to particular folia or granule cells sending their axons to particular sublaminae are suggestive, but whether these neurons differ from other Purkinje cells and granule cells in other aspects of their anatomy, physiology and gene expression remains to be seen. Efforts to enhance the aggregation of such phenotypic data are needed to better refine the definition of cell types within the vertebrate nervous system. Hopefully, additional iterations of our enhancer trap database will benefit from enhanced informatic efforts to improve usability and interoperability with other databases and to make it easier for the community to contribute data that will help parse operational cell types into atomic cell types."

We obtained lines with specific expression more frequently than those of previous enhancer screening with minimal HSP promoter-lacZ and thy1 promoter-Cre lines, although they employed the same random insertion method (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kelsch et al., 2012</a>). Some PB lines with intronic insertions expressed the reporter in neurons in which the inserted genes were strongly expressed. From these facts, we speculate our enhancer probes may require a certain level of transcriptional activity to drive the reporter expression, and this thresholding effect may limit the expression of the reporter. The use of a transactivator system, rather than a recombinase system, may also have contributed to generating specific reporter expression. Cre-dependent reporter expression will be present regardless of whether cre continues to be expressed, or whether it was only expressed in the labeled cells or their progenitors earlier in development (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harris et al., 2014</a>), while tet reporters will be expressed only when tTA protein continues to be expressed."

The two cell types differ in distribution within layer 6 and have distinctive axonal projection patterns in the thalamus. They also have distinct RNA expression profiles identifying marker genes that display almost non-overlapping patterns in layer 6. Genetic labeling of primary CT cells by Ntsrt1-Cre (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gong et al., 2007</a>) has greatly advanced understandings of functions of layer 6 primary CT in cortical (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bortone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Olsen et al., 2012</a>) and thalamic (<a href=\"#bib12\">Crandall et al., 2015</a>) circuits.

We found that 56L cells in SSp had projection to multiple nuclei (VPM, Po and ILM) as originally described by Zhang and Deschenes (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang and Deschenes, 1997</a>). 56L in SSs has strong projections to VPM, which implies there are previously unidentified sources of CT feedback from higher order cortical regions to primary sensory thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sherman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Thomson, 2010</a>). We also found that 56L cells have long collateral projections like those previously described for CC neurons (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang and Deschenes, 1997</a>). Thomson and colleagues found that the most of cells with CC-like morphologies fired phasically (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mercer et al., 2005</a>). We speculate that 56L-like cells are the minor population of layer 6 pyramidal neurons which fire tonically like primary CT neurons but which possess large collateral projections and other morphological features associated with CC cells. Since mCitrine-negative cells in 56L were phasically firing, we speculate that these are CC cells labeled by neither Ntsr1-Cre nor 56L. For example, many of the Bmp3-positive cells not labeled by 56L could be CC-cells lacking a projection to thalamus."

Developments of additional molecular genetic tools, such as optogenetic tools (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choy et al., 2015</a> is an example), voltage- or calcium sensors, and viral vectors targeted to synapses or other subcellular structures,or functionalized for retrograde or transynaptic transport may enhance analysis of the connectivity of trapped cell types. Finally, enhancer trap lines may be useful for analyzing the function of candidate enhancers near the insertion sites in order to better understand how distal enhancers contribute to the specification and maintenance of cell-type-specific gene expression in the mammalian nervous system."

The proportion of insertions into genes (60/167, 35.9% ) was comparable to that expected by chance (33.3% (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liang et al., 2009</a>).

But Rosa-PBase (15:29) and prm-PBase (45:78) had similar gene-intergenic translocation ratios.

Prm-PBase conferred higher transposition rates than Rosa-PBase. In addition, the restriction of PBase to the male germ line meant that more founders could be established from Prm-PBase than from Rosa-PBase. Females of PB;PrmPBase did not have PBase activity and therefore could be founders of new lines whereas both sexes of PB;Rosa-PBase would not be able to transmit PB alleles stably (see differences in efficiency of new line production rate in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We also found that all PB + founders from PBAW/Y;Prm-PBase/+ were females even though PB jumped to many other chromosomes. This showed tight regulation of Prm1 promoter only in meiosis II where sex chromosomes were already segregated. P2 animals with Prm-PBase allele and those without the allele had similar PB transposition efficiency, implying PB translocation occurred in sperm that did not carry the Prm-PBase gene. As suggested for Prm-SleepingBeuty (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ruf et al., 2011</a>), PBase proteins may be supplied from Prm-PBase-positive sperms through cytoplasmic bridges among spermatids."

Reporter driven by a second-generation TRE (TREtight-myrmCherry-HA) was expressed only in mCitrine positive cells and could be used to map their axonal projections (ex, <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Presumably, the lower leak in vivo reflected a lower copy number of the TRE construct than achieved in cell culture. However, attempts to use TRE to drive recombinase expression revealed leak expression not visible with the tet reporter. Leak expression from TREtight-Cre and TRE3G-Cre were both strong enough to drive the Cre reporter, FLEX-mCherry in mCitrine negative cells both in culture (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4E and F</a>) and in vivo, where co-injection of TREtight-Cre and Cre reporter (AAV-Flex-mCherry) had non-specific expression in the brain."

This is mostly because previous efforts have not produced large enough scale, detailed enough characterization of expression patterns, and strong enough expression levels. Here, Shima and colleagues used the powerful tTA/TRE system and tested basal promoter, construct variants, and methods of transgene production, and produced a large collection of tTA enhancer trap lines that are expressed in highly restricted patterns in the brain. The authors have carefully characterized these expression patterns so that they can be immediately useful for many users. The authors have further followed up a few lines that led them to identify a new cell type in the piriform cortex and access a new subpopulation of thalamus-projecting layer 6 cortical neurons. The data are of high quality and the paper is well written. In addition, the authors are to be complimented for describing many technical details-including optimization procedure and failed experiments, which will be very valuable for the field.

We quantified the number of infected cells at the injection sites, the numbers of mCitrine positive neurons at the injection sites, the numbers of double-labeled cells and the number of cells expressing the viral mCherry that did not express mCitrine. The infection rate was 55+/-6% (fraction of mCitrine cells at the site positive for mCherry) and the off target expression rate was 0.7% +/- 0.7% (fraction of mCherry cells negative for mCitrine). The cell counts are provided as supplemental data and described in the first paragraph of the subsection \u201cTransgene expression in tet lines\u201d."

Occasionally, we observed a few cells without visible mCitrine expression but with viral reporter expression (arrows in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E and F</a>). Since those \u201coff-target\u201d expressing cells had similar morphologies and anatomical location to those of mCitrine positive cells, it is possible that this \u201coff-target\u201d expression could result from competition over tTA proteins between a single copy TRE of mCitrine in the genome and many copies of TRE from virus, but low levels of TRE silencing cannot be entirely ruled out."

Lentiviral constructs usually use the 3\u2019 LTR as polyA signal and do not contain additional poly A signals because a poly A signal in the middle of the construct would terminate lentiviral RNA genome transcription and thus lower the yield of virus. We used a unidirectional polyA signal from bGH in hsp-tet3 to encode transcripts in the opposite direction, and the polyA signal did not interfere with virus production. We added an explanation of this strategy to the legend of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>."

In response to this issue, we have tried to clarify our terminology, although we of course fall short of solving this enduring problem. Specifically, we have adopted the term \u201coperational cell type\u201d to refer to a population of neurons that appear to share phenotypic features and that can be defined in terms of the intersection of a transgenic strain and a brain region (see subsection \u201cLentivirus transgenesis\u201d, second paragraph and Discussion, fifth paragraph). We imagine cell types organized in a tree-like taxonomy and note that operational cell types may refer to any node or branch in this tree-like structure. We distinguish this more general term from \u201catomic\u201d cell types lying at the terminal branches (\u201cleaves\u201d) of this tree of cell types, and which are presumed indivisible in terms of their phenotypic properties. For convenience we use the term \u201ccell type\u201d to refer to the broader concept of \u201coperational cell type.\u201d A major point of the paper is to demonstrate a \u201cproof of principle\u201d in the case of Piriform cortex cells and layer 6 corticothalamic projection neurons, that the more specific populations labeled in our enhancer trap lines can, with further characterization, be shown to be at least closer to \u201catomic\u201d cell types than previously appreciated for these populations. However, carrying this program forward is going to be a large and presumably distributed effort involving many laboratories and many approaches."

As noted above, further analyses will be needed to examine if the labeled cells are atomic cell types or can be further subdivided based not only on projections, but also based on morphology, physiology and gene expression. In some cases (e.g. LGd neurons projecting to VISp) retrograde labeling is unlikely to reveal further details, while in many other cases such experiments will help clarify whether one or two or more than two closely related atomic cell types are targeted. We feel that further experiments of this sort are beyond the scope of the current paper but they represent a major goal for future work. We have been sharing our lines with several laboratories and hope these and future collaborations will contribute to further characterization of cell types."
