We reasoned that interactomes of molecules handling metals in neurons should include novel metal homeostasis pathways. We focused on copper and its transporter ATP7A because ATP7A null mutations cause neurodegeneration. We performed ATP7A immunoaffinity chromatography and identified 541 proteins co-isolating with ATP7A. The ATP7A interactome concentrated gene products implicated in neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental disorders, including subunits of the Golgi-localized conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. COG null cells possess altered content and subcellular localization of ATP7A and CTR1 (SLC31A1), the transporter required for copper uptake, as well as decreased total cellular copper, and impaired copper-dependent metabolic responses. Changes in the expression of ATP7A and COG subunits in <i>Drosophila</i> neurons altered synapse development in larvae and copper-induced mortality of adult flies. We conclude that the ATP7A interactome encompasses a novel COG-dependent mechanism to specify neuronal development and survival."
