However, in many cases, the motor response is considered to be a neutral output channel that only reflects the upstream decision. Contrary to this view, we show that perceptual decisions can be recursively influenced by the physical resistance applied to the response. When participants reported the direction of the visual motion by left or right manual reaching movement with different resistances, their reports were biased towards the direction associated with less effortful option. Repeated exposure to such resistance on hand during perceptual judgements also biased subsequent judgements using voice, indicating that effector-dependent motor costs not only biases the report at the stage of motor response, but also changed how the sensory inputs are transformed into decisions. This demonstrates that the cost to act can influence our decisions beyond the context of the specific action."

However, in many cases, the motor response is considered to be a neutral output channel that only reflects the upstream decision. Contrary to this view, we show that perceptual decisions can be recursively influenced by the physical resistance applied to the response. When participants reported the direction of the visual motion by left or right manual reaching movement with different resistances, their reports were biased towards the direction associated with less effortful option. Repeated exposure to such resistance on hand during perceptual judgements also biased subsequent judgements using voice, indicating that effector-dependent motor costs not only biases the report at the stage of motor response, but also changed how the sensory inputs are transformed into decisions. This demonstrates that the cost to act can influence our decisions beyond the context of the specific action."

However, in many of our daily situations, decisions are made in a behavioural context, in which the action that follow our decisions can differ dramatically in terms of required physical effort (or the <i>motor cost</i>). For example, in the orchard, one may aim to pick the reddest-looking apple from the tree. Some of the apples may be hanging high-up on the tree, which will require more effort to pick compared to other fruits hanging on the lower branch. In such situations, does the difference in the motor cost between the options influence the decision of which fruit to pick? If so, is such influence a result of serial integration between the perceptual decision (i.e. decision based on the visual feature) and the motor decision (i.e. decision for action selection to avoid the effortful action) at the output stage, or is the perceptual decision itself is affected by the cost on the downstream action? It has been shown that physical effort is used in motor planning (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Izawa et al., 2008</a>), and the physical effort to obtain a reward can influence behavioural decisions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pr\u00e9vost et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hosokawa et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the uncertainty in perceptual decisions is transmitted to the motor system, influencing the parameters of action control (<a href=\"#bib6\">de Lange et al., 2013</a>). However, it remains unclear whether the motor cost is simply integrated with the perceptual decision to optimise the expected utility (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burk et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cos et al., 2014</a>), or whether the preceding experience of unequal motor costs can recursively influence the perceptual decision itself. Here, we show that manipulating the motor response cost for arm movements during a visual motion discrimination task changes not only the decision when responding with the arm, but also when reporting the perceptual decisions verbally."

Ten right-handed participants observed a moving random-dot stimulus and made decisions about the direction of motion (leftward or rightward) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Britten et al., 1992</a>). Participants held two robotic manipulanda, one in each hand. They indicated their decision by either moving their left hand (indicating leftward decision) or right hand (rightward decision, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In the baseline phase, the resistance for moving the manipulanda was the same for both hands (velocity-dependent resistance: 0.10 Ns/cm). In the subsequent induction phase, the resistance for the left hand increased by a small amount each time the participant moved the left hand (0.0008 Ns/cm; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Because the change was gradual, most of the participants did not report becoming aware of the increased motor cost when asked afterwards, even though their left hand was eventually exposed to 1.8 times greater resistance than the right (0.18 Ns/cm for left, 0.10 Ns/cm for right; see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This procedure was employed to minimise any cognitive strategy participants may use, such as explicitly avoiding the costly hand response regardless of the decision about the visual stimulus. In the test phase, participant then continued to perform the visual discrimination task under the accumulated asymmetry in manual resistance. We plotted the proportion of rightward judgement against different stimulus intensities, and determined the point of subjective equality (PSE, the point at which participants judge 50% of the trials to go rightward) for both the baseline and the test phase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). If the increased physical resistance for expressing leftward judgements was incorporated into the decision, the proportion of \u2018leftward\u2019 judgements should decrease in the test phase compared to the baseline, resulting in the shift of PSE towards the left (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). As expected, the PSE shifted towards the left from baseline to test phase (\u22124.33%, paired t-test (2-tailed): <i>t</i><sub>9</sub> = 2.43, p=0.038, <i>d</i> = 0.76, 8/10 individuals showed the effect) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). This indicates that the participants started to avoid making motion direction decisions in which the response is costly."

The baseline and the test phase involved judging direction of visual dot motion, as in Experiment 1. However, the induction phase was now replaced with a simple reaching movement, in which the participants moved their left or right hand according to a simple leftward or rightward arrow presented in the centre of the screen. As in Experiment 1, the resistance for moving the left hand was gradually increased. The motor cost during the induction phase was not associated with any motion direction judgement; the participants were only exposed to the gradually increasing motor cost differences between the two hands. Again, PSE significantly shifted leftwards in the test phase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>; baseline vs. test; mean \u22124.26%, paired t-test (two-tailed); t<sub>8</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03.91, p=0.005, d\u00a0=\u00a01.3, 8/9 individuals showed the effect). This indicates that the direct association of higher motor cost with a specific decision during the induction phase is not critical for inducing the bias. This may suggest that the (implicit) knowledge about the response costs is sufficient to recursively influence the decision. Alternatively, these results could indicate that the bias is only transiently induced during the test phase itself."

Where in the process of translating a stimulus into a response does this bias arise? A simple model posits that decision-making occurs in three sequential stages (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gold and Ding, 2013</a>). First, features of the sensory input are extracted and encoded as a sensory representation. Second, a categorical decision is made based on this sensory representation (decision layer). Third, the output from the decision layer is transmitted to the relevant effector for the response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). One possibility is that the motor cost only biases the decision layer in the context of the specific response (<a href=\"#bib28\">Oliveira et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In other words, the motor cost only influences decisions when the participant anticipates to perform the action associated with the motor cost, thus, the decision simply takes into account the upcoming motor costs. Alternatively, the repeated exposure to the manual motor cost may affect the perceptual decision about this type of stimulus in general, no matter which effector is used to make a response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bennur and Gold, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Filimon et al., 2013</a>). Finally, the motor cost could also directly bias the sensory representation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), affecting the initial encoding of the information before it is transmitted to the decision layer. Only in the two latter scenarios, should the bias observed during the manual decisions generalise to decisions expressed with a different effector. In Experiment 3, we therefore examined whether a hand-specific motor cost could also influence a visual judgement that used a vocal response. A manual to vocal transfer of the motor cost effect would indicate that the motor cost influences the decision about the visual stimulus itself (i.e. perceptual decision), not the decision coupled with the effector selection (i.e. motor decision)."

To analyse these left and right resistance increase data together, we aligned the data depending on the side of the resistance applied by assigning negative motion coherence level to the motion direction associated with the direction of the resistance. During the manual task, participants moved their left or right hand according to their perceived motion direction. For the vocal task, participants indicated the direction of the motion by vocally responding \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) without moving their hands.

Under this framework, we examined whether the source of the manual decision bias that transferred to the vocal decisions occurred in the sensory representation of the stimulus that is accumulated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; sensory representation) or in the decision bound that is used to make the decision (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; decision layer) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hanks et al., 2006</a>)."

We exclude the possibility that the motor cost made the sensory representation of the preferred direction more accurate (increased gain of the signal only in one direction) as we did not observe the discrimination sensitivity change (JND: just noticeable difference) between the baseline and the test condition across different experiments (t<sub>44</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.26, p=0.77). Rather assumed that the motor cost would shift evidence accumulation towards the easier direction (sensory evidence model; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). With this bias, the decision variable would drift towards the preferred decision even in the absence of any coherent visual motion."

The sensory evidence and starting point models predict qualitatively similar pattern of choice probabilities (i.e. bias towards the direction to avoid the motor cost), but different pattern of decision times for correct trials across different motion intensities (Methods, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). Therefore, by comparing whether which of the two models explains our data better (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hanks et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ding and Gold, 2012</a>) (see Materials and method), we may infer the source of the bias."

The model makes a prediction about the pattern of choice probability and the decision time in respect to the strength of the motion signal (right panel). For the baseline, the starting point of the evidence accumulation is set to 0. (<b>B</b>) When there is more sensory evidence in favour of rightward motion (red line), the drift speed for the rightward decision will increase (left panel), and left would decrease. As a result, a rightward decision becomes more likely (shift of psychometric function) and the decision time pattern generally shifts to the left, showing a tendency to respond faster for the rightward motion (right panel). If the motor cost influences the sensory representation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), we would expect this pattern of results (sensory representation model). (<b>C</b>) A shift in the starting value of the accumulation process induces a prior bias towards a rightward decision, decreasing the required amount of evidence for rightward decision compared to the left (left panel). This will again bias the decision to favour the rightward decision. Instead of shifting the pattern of decision times to the left (as in <b>B</b>), the starting point model predicts an additional offset to the rightward and leftward decision time; shorter for the rightward decision and longer for the leftward decision. In this model, the bias therefore arises from a change in the decision layer transforming the sensory representation into the decision (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), while the sensory evidence itself is not changing."

To further investigate the temporal dynamics of these flexible changes, we examined how the induced bias developed over the course of the 10 (Experiment 3) or 7 (Experiment 4) trials of vocal decisions following a series of manual decision trials (see detail in the Materials and methods). In Experiment 3, on average, PSE shift was slightly stronger for the vocal trials that immediately followed the manual task (mean shift of PSE; \u22123.51% for the first five trials (initial point of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), &gt;\u22123% for the rest, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>), although this time dependence did not reach significance (F<sub>5, 65</sub>=0.60, p=0.75). In Experiment 4, the strength of bias (criterion shift) significantly decayed depending on the number of trials from the manual task, showing a stronger bias in the first 4 out of 7 trials (initial two time points of the curve. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>, <i>F</i><sub>4,44</sub> = 2.70 p=0.042, \u03b7<sup>2</sup>=0.2). These results indicate that the biasing effect may be relatively short-lived. However, the time scale of the retention is comparable to common perceptual adaptations, such as motion aftereffects. Mather et al. (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mather et al., 2008</a>) shows that on maximum, the motion aftereffect lasts for 10 ~ 15 s. A single trial of our task takes at least, 3 ~ 4 s, so our effect lasted for 9 ~ 16 s. Therefore, our results indicate that, in the absence of any further confirmatory evidence of asymmetric response costs for the decision, the brain readapts relatively quickly to the new situation, resembling other examples of spontaneous decay in perceptual and motor adaptation phenomena (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mather et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Webster, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Smith et al., 2006</a>). This shows that while perceptual decisions can be updated relatively quickly and flexibly, they do exhibit a substantial memory of past motor costs."

Here, we demonstrate that motor costs associated with the response can also bias the perceptual decisions, even when the response is made with a completely different effector that is not associated with increased motor cost (here, verbal instead of manual responses). Therefore, our study provides evidence that the cost on the response for perceptual decisions, which has been regarded as downstream output channel of the decision, can <i>recursively</i> influence the decision of the input stimulus itself. In other words, the observed bias not only reflects the <i>serial</i> integration of the transient motor cost into the ongoing decision (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burk et al., 2014</a>), but represents a more global change in the way of transforming the sensory input to the decision, by taking the prior experience of the motor cost into account (<a href=\"#bib23\">Makin et al., 2010</a>)."

The critical contribution of our study is to show that this influence on the decision process is not limited to the judgements involving the asymmetric motor cost, but generalised to judgement using vocal responses without motor cost manipulation. The present study parsimoniously shows that the motor cost influence is not simply due to the bias of decision at the motor preparation/execution stage."

Even though only fitted to the reaction times for correct trials (<a href=\"#bib29\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>), this model also correctly predicted the RT pattern for error trials. These findings are consistent with previous literature that shows that increasing the presentation frequency or amount of reward for one of the choice biases decision in a way that can be best modelled as a starting point shift (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mulder et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, it has been suggested that shifting the starting point of accumulation process is the optimal solution to account for such contextual changes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Simen et al., 2009</a>).

These effects were explained by shifts of the starting point in the DDM framework (or equivalently the decision bounds), thus the change in the decision layer of the perceptual task. Therefore, these brain regions are likely candidate neuronal substrates where the motor cost interacts with the sensory input to bias the perceptual decision. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) code the feature that is relevant for the visual decision, independent of response type (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bennur and Gold, 2011</a>). Experiments 3 and 4 similarly suggested motor-induced changes for the perceptual decision is independent of the effector used for response. The subcortical network in the basal ganglia has been suggested to represent the cost of action or the \u2018vigour\u2019 of movement initiation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mazzoni et al., 2007</a>). Prolonged exposure to altered motor costs during perceptual decisions may similarly change the response properties of these areas, altering how the system judges the sensory evidence from the environment."

One of the recent theories is the intentional framework (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shadlen et al., 2008</a>). This framework posits that decisions and actions are tightly coupled, with each decision maker separately accumulating the sensory evidence until the threshold level for the specific action is reached. In this scenario, any decision bias induced by imposing a motor cost to a specific action would not transfer to a decision performed by a different action, as there is no explicit communication between the multiple decision makers. Thus, our results indicate that perceptual decisions are either made centrally by a high-order process that is common across different actions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Filimon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sun and Landy, 2016</a>), or at least that different local decision makers exhibit a certain degree of mutual dependency, such as a shared cost (value) of the input stimuli (external environment)."

The cost of our own actions, learned through the life-long experience of interacting with the environment, may partly define how we make perceptual decisions of our surroundings."

If both hands moved, the hand with the larger movement amplitude was taken as the participant\u2019s decision (leftward or rightward) on that trial.

Three different models with different delta parameter settings were generated. In the first model (sensory evidence model), the motor cost changed the sensory evidence by changing the motion coherence by <i>dcoh</i>. Thus, the motion strength in the test phase was <i>\u03bc</i>= <i>k</i>\u00d7(Coh+<i>dcoh</i>). Since we know that the effect of motor cost does not change the discrimination sensitivity (just noticeable difference: JND), but changes only the PSE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), change in the sensory evidence is modelled as <i>addition</i> to the input stimulus (+<i>dcoh</i>), rather than as the change in the gain itself (direct change of <i>k</i>). In the second model (starting point model), parameter that indicates the shift of the starting point of the accumulation processes (<i>sp</i>) was added, which will consequently change the amount of evidence required for each decision. Equivalently, we can think of this parameter as a shift in the two decision bounds to [<i>A-sp</i>] and [<i>\u2013B-sp</i>], leaving the distance between the two bounds fixed. In the final model (full model), both coherence level change (<i>dcoh</i>) and the starting point shift (<i>sp</i>) were added as additional parameters."

We assume that this was due to the reduction of the non-decision time induced by the repetition of the reaching movement. To account for this, we added an additional parameter modelling the decrease of the non-decision time across the two hands. Since such reduction of the non-decision time may differ between the left and the right hand, the difference was modelled separately for the right (<i>dTA</i>) and the left (<i>dTB</i>). Therefore, the non-decision time for the test phase was modelled as <i>T01- dTA</i> and <i>T02- dTB</i> for right and left, respectively (same model as ref 17)."

Therefore, this model is sufficient to distinguish between the models of interest \u2013 a change in starting point of evidence accumulation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). A number of extensions to the DDM framework have been proposed to explain the full RT distributions of correct and incorrect trials using trial-by-trial variability of the drift rate (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>) or by incorporating the time-dependent decision bounds (<a href=\"#bib9\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>).

In both models, the leftward judgements is costlier in the test phase.

We fitted the full model (including both the starting point and the evidence accumulation shift), to directly test whether the motor cost induces significant shifts of starting point or of evidence accumulation. The parameter estimates from the individual fits indeed showed that the parameter of the starting points shift was significantly different from zero (i.e. consistent starting point shift across participants), whereas it was not for the evidence accumulation shift. We also retained our model comparison using BIC. For this purpose, we fit the models to the group-average data, as each individual had a limited number of trials, and the noise level was rather high. High noise levels can lead to erratic fits and unstable answers. Using group-average data strongly attenuates this effect (Donchin et al., 2003; Thoroughman and Shadmehr, 2000). To obtain estimates of the reliability of the group-average fit, we resampled the data across all of the participants (with replacement; 10,000 times) and evaluated the difference in fit across different DDMs. The model fit is now evaluated by calculating the BIC weights (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We found that the decision bias by the motor cost was best explained by the model that included the starting point shift. Taken together, our data indicates that the motor cost adds consistent directional bias to the starting point, so as to make the decision output biased towards the non-costly decision.

This framework posits that decisions and actions are tightly coupled, with each decision maker separately accumulating the sensory evidence until the threshold level for a specific action is reached. In this scenario, any decision bias induced by imposing a motor cost to a specific action would not transfer to decisions performed by a different action, as there is no explicit communication between the multiple decision makers. Thus, our results indicate that perceptual decisions are either made centrally by a high-order process that is common across different actions [Filimon et al., 2013], or at least that different local decision makers exhibit a certain degree of mutual dependency, such as a shared cost (value) of the input stimuli.\u201d"

When the accumulated evidence reaches either of the decision bound, i.e. right decision (A) or left decision (\u2013B), the decision is made. RT was defined as sum of the time for the evidence to reach either of the decision bound from the stimulus onset and the time to move the effector (non-decision time; T01 for right hand, T02 for left hand). For the two simulations, we used the parameters estimated from our experimental data using the analytical DDM solution on the correct RT trials only (Palmer et al., 2005) (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> for details)."

As done for the real data, we then calculated the RT difference between the baseline and the test phase for both correct and error trials. Note that, overall drop in RT is caused by a general drop in the non- decision time from the baseline to the test phase. For the correct trials, RTs became shorter for the non-costly (right) motion compared to the costly (left) motion. However, for the error trials, pattern of RT change were different between the starting point model and the sensory evidence model. For the starting point model, RTs for the error trials became longer for the non-costly (right) motion compared to the costly (left) motion (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This is due to the starting point becoming distant from the leftward decision bound (the error direction for the rightward stimulus). In contrast, for the sensory evidence model, error RTs for the non-costly motion became shorter than the costly motion (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This is because, when the leftward (costly) stimulus is presented, the added bias can switch the drift direction, and increase the drift rate for the rightwards (non-costly, error) direction. Therefore, there is a clear qualitative difference in the error RT pattern between the two different types of biases (see also Figure 2 of Mulder et al., 2012)."
