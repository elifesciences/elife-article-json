Globally, nearly 50% of photosynthesis takes place in the Ocean, where single cell cyanobacteria and algae reside together with their viruses. An operon encoding PSI was identified in cyanobacterial marine viruses. We generated a PSI that mimics the salient features of the viral complex, named PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup>. PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is promiscuous for its electron donors and can accept electrons from respiratory cytochromes. We solved the structure of PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> and a monomeric PSI, with subunit composition similar to the viral PSI, providing for the first time a detailed description of the reaction center and antenna system from mesophilic cyanobacteria, including red chlorophylls and cofactors of the electron transport chain. Our finding extends the understanding of PSI structure, function and evolution and suggests a unique function for the viral PSI."

Globally, nearly 50% of photosynthesis takes place in the Ocean, where single cell cyanobacteria and algae reside together with their viruses. An operon encoding PSI was identified in cyanobacterial marine viruses. We generated a PSI that mimics the salient features of the viral complex, named PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup>. PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is promiscuous for its electron donors and can accept electrons from respiratory cytochromes. We solved the structure of PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> and a monomeric PSI, with subunit composition similar to the viral PSI, providing for the first time a detailed description of the reaction center and antenna system from mesophilic cyanobacteria, including red chlorophylls and cofactors of the electron transport chain. Our finding extends the understanding of PSI structure, function and evolution and suggests a unique function for the viral PSI."

Cyanobacterial photosynthetic membranes contain two photosystems, of which PSII mediates the extraction of electrons from water, the initial electron donor, to the plastoquinone pool. PSI mediates electron transfer from cytochrome C553 (or plastocyanin in eukaryotes) to ferredoxin, thereby generating the reducing power needed for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in the form of NADPH.

Hints on this involvement come from the presence of photosynthetic genes in viral genomes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sullivan et al., 2006</a>). Many marine phages encode for either the D1 gene or both D1 and D2 which together make up the reaction center of PSII (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sullivan et al., 2006</a>). In addition, several subunits of the NDH1 complex and soluble cytochromes are also found in the viral metagenome (<a href=\"#bib40\">Philosof et al., 2011</a>). The presence of these genes suggests that marine viruses have the ability to alter the host photosynthesis pathways in ways, which are still not completely understood. Recently, an operon encoding a complete, albeit minimal, PSI complex was found in the genome of several marine cyanophages (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sharon et al., 2009</a>). The viral PSI has a unique gene composition compared to the PSI composition of its hosts. PsaL and PsaI are missing and a unique PsaJ-PsaF (PsaJF) fusion-protein exists."

A common feature of PSI is the presence of low energy chlorophyll molecules called \u2018red chlorophylls\u2019. Red chlorophylls are present in the reaction center of cyanobacteria and in the light-harvesting belt of the plant PSI. In cyanobacteria, red chlorophylls can affect the trapping kinetics of excitation energy as shown by measurements done on PSI from various species (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gobets et al., 2001</a>). The location of the red chlorophylls within the internal antenna of PSI is still a matter of debate, the inter species variability of the red absorption suggests that they are located in a relatively variable region of PSI. Currently, all the calculations of individual pigment energies are based on the high resolution PSI structure from <i>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</i>, which contains a relatively large number of red pigments.

Cyanobacteria employ a multitude of electron transfer reactions in their membrane systems. These systems are at least partially insulated by spatial confinement of the various electron donors and acceptors, but the molecular interactions between these donors and acceptors may also contribute to pathway isolation. To explore the promiscuity of viral PSI complexes, we constructed a phage-mimetic PsaJ-PsaF fusion in the easily cultivable cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis sp.</i> PCC 6803. The borders of <i>PsaJ</i> and <i>PsaF</i> are easily located in the viral gene and the high conservation of the PsaF subunit enabled us to duplicate the salient features of the viral gene into our artificially constructed fusion made from the corresponding <i>Synechocystis</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>Synechocystis</i> strains carrying the fused <i>PsaJF</i> gene as their sole source of PsaF and PsaJ, grow at wild type rates in heterotrophic conditions and without added carbon. After purifying the PSI complex from the photosynthetic membranes of both wild-type and <i>PsaJF</i> strains, we found that the trimer to monomer ratio is similar in both strains, indicating that the assembly and stability of PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is not disturbed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Deleting the N-terminus of PsaF resulted in a flattened plateau on the luminal side of the complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Three chlorophyll molecules and four carotenoids are coordinated by PsaJ and PsaF in the <i>Thermosynechococcus</i> PSI structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

We measured the half-life of PSI reduction by a mammalian respiratory cytochrome c. As seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, P700 in PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is reduced much faster by a respiratory cytochrome c than in the wild-type complex. However, PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is reduced by its native electron donor cytochrome c553 (CytC553) with similar kinetics compared to the wild-type PSI (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This is in contrast to eukaryotic PSI where the N-terminus of PsaF was shown to be important for the electron donation reaction between plastocyanin and PSI (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hippler et al., 1996</a>). The similar electron donation rates observed with CytC553 are in agreement with previously published results obtained from PsaF and PsaJ deleted strains (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 1994a</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">1994b</a>). When the light-dependent oxidation of cytochrome c was followed we obtained similar results. Compared to the wild-type complex, PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> had faster cytochrome oxidation kinetics when respiratory cytochrome was used (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and similar kinetics when native CytC553 was used (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The similarity between the reaction kinetics of PSI reduction together with the similar cellular growth rates of wild-type and PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> strains shows that deleting the N-terminus of PsaF causes no gross perturbation to the interaction between PSI and CytC553, that is, the N-terminus of PsaF does not play any positive role in this interaction in <i>Synechocystis</i>. The N-terminus of PsaF can act as a negative regulator of some electron donation reactions, especially from positively charged donors such as respiratory cytochromes. We suggest that this was the original function of PsaF in a more primitive form of PSI and only later, as PSI evolved, the binding site was refined to its final configuration. In the viral PSI, such promiscuity can be beneficial when the viral reaction center encounters the highly variable cytochromes found in marine cyanobacteria (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mazor et al., 2012</a>) or alternatively to allow PSI to accept electrons from respiratory activities when PSII activity is compromised."

In light of this complete conservation, we were surprised to discover a large rearrangement of the isoprenoid tail of the phylloquinone (Q1<sub>A</sub>) coordinated by PsaA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This movement is accompanied by rearrangement of the phytol tails of chlorophylls A06 and A40 (ligands are named according to Jordan, et al. whenever possible [<a href=\"#bib24\">Jordan et al., 2001</a>]). In spite of these large movements, the positions of the quinone heads and chlorine rings are highly conserved between all known PSI structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and 5A</a>). The movements in Q1<sub>A</sub> and the surrounding chlorophylls appear to originate from two amino acid changes that occurred in the PsaJ subunit between <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Thermosynechococcus</i>. Ala J16 in <i>Thermosynechococcus</i> changed to Met J16 in <i>Synechocystis</i>, making contacts with terminal carbon atoms of Q1<sub>A</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Similar contacts are seen in the <i>Thermosynechococcus</i> Q1<sub>A</sub> terminal carbon atoms, but these contacts are made with Met 19 in PsaJ, which changed to Leu 19 in <i>Synechocystis</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Interestingly, this interaction between the terminal carbon atoms of the isoprenoid tail and methionine is present in a number of cyanobacterial species (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

To summarize, the components of the ETC are extremely conserved over all known PSI structures. However, even small changes in the orientation of components can play a part in fine tuning ET processes. Most of the studies on the ETC are performed in <i>Synechocystis</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Savitsky et al., 2013</a>) and assume that all of the factors involved occupy identical positions as shown in <i>Thermosynechococcus</i> or higher plants, this may lead to somewhat erroneous conclusions.

Based on ring-to-ring distances and dipole orientation <a href=\"#bib24\">Jordan et al. 2001</a> identified one chlorophyll trimer (B31-B32-B33) and three dimers (A32-B7, A38-A37, B37-B38) as candidates for strongly coupled pigments in the reaction center. We find that the ring location and the local environment of dimer A38-A39 remained virtually unchanged between <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Thermosynechococcus</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

The phosphate oxygen atom lays 2.8 \u00c5 from the magnesium atom of B40. This coordination of chlorophylls by lipids is reminiscent of the situation in light-harvesting complex II (LHC-II) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Standfuss et al., 2005</a>). In contrast, CP29, which is highly homologous to LHC-II, does not contain such a configuration and this probably contributes to the different non photochemical quenching properties of both proteins (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pan et al., 2011</a>)."

The fact that the newly discovered chlorophyll trimer in <i>Synechocystis</i> relates to its counterpart by pseudo C2 symmetry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) suggests that this configuration preceded the association of PsaX, which may have been an adaptation to high temperature. Possibly the most important role of PsaX is to protect this lipid at higher temperatures. The occurrence of this chlorophyll trimer suggests that these trimers have a structural role and the appearance of the red absorption results from fine-tuning of their position. It is likely that the pigment environment contributes significantly to its spectral properties."

Aside from the PSI operon, genes for other subunits of the major complexes of the photosynthetic electron transport chain reside in phages including PSII, NDH-I, F-ATPase (<a href=\"#bib40\">Philosof et al., 2011</a>). Small soluble proteins like cytochromes and ferredoxins are also abundant (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sharon et al., 2011</a>). A common property of these genes is that they cluster together as a distinct group when compared to their cyanobacterial counterparts (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zeidner et al., 2005</a>). In some cases, it is possible to suggest that viral subunits modify the flow of electrons in the photosynthetic chain based on the known function of the cyanobacterial counterpart. This is the case with the virally encoded NDH-I subunits, where the function of the native, bacterial complex in cyclic electron flow is established."

It is known that the properties of the small electron donor (either PC or CytC553) largely determine its mode of interaction with PSI (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hervas et al., 2005</a>). Marine cyanobacteria contain an especially diverse set of soluble cytochromes with variable physical properties (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mazor et al., 2012</a>). How this diversity is manifested with respect to cellular respiration and photosynthesis is a matter for future experiments. However, our findings suggest that photosynthesis performed during phage infection and catalyzed (at least partially) by phage proteins (\u2018Viral photosynthesis\u2019) utilize very different cytochromes efficiently and will not be sensitive to the nature of the electron donor. The existence of both NDH-I subunits and a promiscuous PSI operon in a single phage genome suggests that cyclic electron flow is enhanced during phage replication (<a href=\"#bib40\">Philosof et al., 2011</a>). This can be achieved by increasing the flow of electrons into the photosynthetic electron transport chain through the NDH\u2013I complex or by utilizing electrons from respiratory cytochromes or both. It is important to consider the two most common phage photosynthetic proteins, D1 and D2, in that light. The suggested function of virally encoded D1 and D2 is to replenish the rapidly damaged host D1 and D2 proteins during infection (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alperovitch-Lavy et al., 2011</a>). This seems to partially contradict the notion of increased cyclic electron flow in infected cells but it is probable that some basal level of linear electron flow in the cells plays a major part in phage multiplication. Detailed studies performed in phage-infected cells are needed to uncover the facts needed to support these hypotheses."

In this scenario, the formation of the primordial heterodimer allowed for the evolution of the unique properties of the peripheral subunits, trimer formation in the case of PsaL and interaction with electron donors in the case of PsaF. The specificity and complexity of biological machines increases along their evolutionary path and PSI is a prime example of this property. Cyanobacterial PSI is much more complicated and intricate than its ancestral homodimer and the plant PSI adds additional levels of complexity over the cyanobacterial complex. The preservation of simpler forms of PSI is therefore quite unique and stems from the relatively simple life cycle of phages and from the unique evolutionary requirements associated with this life cycle. For example, some marine phages from the <i>Myoviridae</i> family can infect different species of cyanobacteria (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sullivan et al., 2003</a>) and this creates unique requirements on their genes such as utilizing the different chlorophyll species found in <i>Prochlorococcus</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i>. The viral complex preserves some of the properties of the common PSI ancestor, lost from both the cyanobacterial and plant PSI. One of these properties appears to be promiscuity for electron donors as exemplified by the fused PsaJF subunit. The incredible richness uncovered by ocean genomic surveys suggests that further sampling will reveal further examples of ancestral forms of PSI and other unique versions of highly conserved genes."

Cells were harvested using centrifugation, and washed once by STN1 buffer (30 mM Tricine-NaOH pH 8, 15 mM NaCl, 0.4 M sucrose). Finally, cells were resuspended in 50 ml of STN1, and broken by an Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3 (three cycles at 1500 psi). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation in a SS34 rotor for 10 min at 12,000 rpm.

The chlorophyll concentration in the soluble material was adjusted to the desired concentration (typically 3 mg/ml) using the above buffer, and dispensed in 4 \u00b5l drops into 24-well, sitting drop crystallization plates.

Crystals were formed within 1\u20133 days, and grown to their final size by a week. The crystals of the PSI trimer were large and flat with no precipitate in the well. In contrast, the monomeric complex formed multiple crystal forms. Only a small fraction of the crystals, recognized through their overall shape, diffracted to high resolution. The other crystals diffracted to very low resolution or did not diffract at all. Cryo protection was achieved by replacing the mother liquor in the well and in the reservoir with solutions containing progressively increasing PEG3350 concentrations (10%, 15%, 20% and 30%) with a minimum of 2 hr between each solution (usually 24 hr between each step). Finally crystals were placed in 40% PEG3350 solution for a few minutes, mounted on loops and frozen in liquid nitrogen."

Initially a truncated model (with most side chains and phytol tails removed) of PSI from <i>Thermosynechococcus</i> was used for molecular replacement and as a source of external restraints. Refinement was carried out using Refmac5 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Murshudov et al., 2011</a>), using a coarse TLS model including only two groups, one encompassing the entire membrane domain and the other defined as the stromal ridge (PsaC, PsaD and PsaE). The use of external restraints (as well as NCS restraints) was vital to achieving reasonable statistics and ProSMART (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nicholls et al., 2012</a>) was found to be the most effective choice in our case. Multiple rounds of refinements followed by manual building by coot were carried out. PHENIX was used in the final rounds solely for B factor and TLS refinement. The use of the higher resolution <i>Synechocystis</i> monomeric model resulted in a \u223c1.5% reduction in R values (both working and free) and more importantly resulted in better maps. The improvement in map quality allowed us to complete the tracing of PsaK (without side chains), which is very disordered in our monomeric model and was not traced completely even in the high-resolution structure from <i>Thermosynechococcus</i>."

In addition, the soluble domain of PsaF was exchanged with the single TM helix of PsaJ and the final protein is much more hydrophobic than PsaF alone. This is the reason for the unusual migration of this polypeptide. We have verified by sequencing and MS analysis that both the DNA and the expressed protein conform to our design and of course the presence of a correct length fusion protein in the structure provides the final proof in this matter. PsaJ as well as the other small subunits of PSI are not resolved in this particular gel setup."

We are not sure to which chlorophyll molecules this comment refers to. There are three chlorophylls coordinated by PsaL which are missing from the monomeric structure, and three other chlorophylls are missing from the PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> model. We have made a composite image that includes all chlorophylls from the high resolution structure and added to it the PsaL coordinated chlorophylls to give a complete picture of the antenna arrangement. In some cases the superposition is close enough so that the rings occupy essentially the same position, which can be confusing. A single peripheral chlorophyll (in addition to B33) is absent from <i>Synechocystis</i> (numbered M1601 in <i>Thermosynechococcus,</i> in the upper left corner of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Strictly speaking this chlorophyll can be red chlorophyll as well. However, our discussion of red chlorophylls is based on chlorophylls pairs, which, based on their ring to ring distances, may be electronically coupled. In that sense chlorophyll 1601 is distant and cannot be affected by other pigments. Other mechanisms for controlling the excitation energy of chlorophylls, such as their interaction with amino acid side chains, cannot be currently predicted and require experimental verification that is outside the scope of the current work."

Other labs conveyed to us that they were unsuccessful in generating a functional PsaJF strain using the viral gene. We used <i>Synechocystis</i> genes in order to avoid additional problems in the integration of the modified subunit into the PSI complex and address the question of removing the PsaF N terminus in a more precise manner. A similar strategy was employed, for example, when the importance of the positive patch in the PsaF N terminus was addressed using a chimeric gene made of the N terminus of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> PsaF fused to the PsaF gene of <i>Synechococcus</i>."
