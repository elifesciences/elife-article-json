Deficiency in either the RI\u03b2 or the RII\u03b2 subunit results in distinct neuronal phenotypes. Although RI\u03b2 contributes to synaptic plasticity, it is the least studied isoform. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we generated high-resolution large-scale immunohistochemical mosaic images of mouse brain that provided global views of several brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebellum. The isoforms concentrate in discrete brain regions, and we were able to zoom-in to show distinct patterns of subcellular localization. RI\u03b2 is enriched in dendrites and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RII\u03b2 is concentrated in axons. Using correlated light and electron microscopy, we confirmed the mitochondrial and nuclear localization of RI\u03b2 in cultured neurons. To show the functional significance of nuclear localization, we demonstrated that downregulation of RI\u03b2, but not of RII\u03b2, decreased CREB phosphorylation. Our study reveals how PKA isoform specificity is defined by precise localization."

Deficiency in either the RI\u03b2 or the RII\u03b2 subunit results in distinct neuronal phenotypes. Although RI\u03b2 contributes to synaptic plasticity, it is the least studied isoform. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we generated high-resolution large-scale immunohistochemical mosaic images of mouse brain that provided global views of several brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebellum. The isoforms concentrate in discrete brain regions, and we were able to zoom-in to show distinct patterns of subcellular localization. RI\u03b2 is enriched in dendrites and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RII\u03b2 is concentrated in axons. Using correlated light and electron microscopy, we confirmed the mitochondrial and nuclear localization of RI\u03b2 in cultured neurons. To show the functional significance of nuclear localization, we demonstrated that downregulation of RI\u03b2, but not of RII\u03b2, decreased CREB phosphorylation. Our study reveals how PKA isoform specificity is defined by precise localization."

These include learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kandel, 2012</a>) and multiple forms of synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yasuda et al., 2003</a>). Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PKA severely affects the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation and inhibits synaptic plasticity and long-lasting memory (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 1997</a>). A reduction in PKA signaling contributes to the etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dagda and Das Banerjee, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Howells et al., 2000</a>). Phosphorylation mediated by cAMP signaling is critically involved in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, synaptic release of neurotransmitters and gene expression (<a href=\"#bib36\">Skalhegg and Tasken, 2000</a>), and a large part of the functional diversity of this kinase results from isoform diversity. Eukaryotic cells express multiple forms of PKA regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits. PKA holoenzyme consists of an R-subunit dimer bound to two C- subunits (R<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>). The biochemical and functional features of PKA holoenzymes are largely determined by the structure and the biochemical properties of the regulatory subunits (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ilouz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Taylor et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>)."

Each isoform is encoded by a unique gene and preferentially expressed in different cells and tissues. RI\u03b1 and RII\u03b1 are ubiquitously expressed in every cell, whereas RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 expression is more tissue restricted (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</a>). RI\u03b2 is expressed in brain and spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</a>). RII\u03b2 is predominantly expressed in brain, endocrine, fat, liver and reproductive tissues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jahnsen et al., 1986</a>). The four R-subunits are functionally non-redundant. Depletion of either the\u00a0RI\u03b2 or the\u00a0RII\u03b2 gene in mice resulted in specific neuronal defects. RII\u03b2 knockout mice display defects in motor behavior and loss of PKA-mediated neuronal gene expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brandon et al., 1998</a>). Hippocampal slices from RI\u03b2 null mice show a severe deficit in long-term depression and depotentiation at the Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapse. Despite a compensatory increase in the RI\u03b1 protein levels, hippocampal function was not rescued (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brandon et al., 1995</a>)."

Space-restricted kinase activation provides an extra layer of specificity in PKA signaling. PKA is typically targeted at specific intracellular microdomains through interactions with A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). Many AKAPs have been identified together\u00a0with\u00a0their specific requirements for selective binding to regulatory subunits (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sarma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wong and Scott, 2004</a>). This spatio-temporal regulation determines the access of proteins to interacting binding partners. AKAPs provide a control mechanism that directs, integrates and locally attenuates the cAMP-initiated cascade. The hallmark signature motif of the AKAPs is an amphipathic helix that binds tightly to the dimerization and docking (D/D) domain of the R-subunits. Recently, a point mutation in the D/D domain of the RI\u03b2 gene has been associated with a new neurodegenerative disease that\u00a0presents with dementia and Parkinsonism, characterized by specific and abundant accumulation of RI\u03b2 in neuronal inclusions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wong et al., 2014</a>)."

As RI\u03b2 is the least-studied isoform at the protein level, we focused our analyses on brain regions where we expected RI\u03b2 to be predominant on the basis of its mRNA expression profiles and its predicted functional importance from RI\u03b2(\u2013/\u2013) mice. The use of large-scale immunohistochemical brain maps allows us to gain an overview of the RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 protein distributions over large areas and then to\u00a0zoom in to obtain higher-resolution views in order to investigate subcellular features. We found that each regulatory isoform is predominant in distinct brain regions and were able to identify unique and consistent patterns of distribution within the hippocampus and the cerebellum. RI\u03b2 is concentrated in dendrites, and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RII\u03b2 is concentrated in axons. We confirmed the RI\u03b2 subcellular distribution that emerged from the mosaic images using the mini-Singlet Oxygen Generator (miniSOG), a probe that allowed us to do correlated light and electron microscopy. We found RI\u03b2 in the mitochondria, as we predicted earlier, as well as in\u00a0the nucleus, establishing a new paradigm for PKA signaling in the nucleus. To demonstrate a functional distinction between the two isoforms in the nucleus, we selectively downregulated the two isoforms and used CREB phosphorylation as a reporter for a nuclear PKA substrate. Downregulation of RI\u03b2, but not of\u00a0RII\u03b2, decreased pCREB in hippocampal cultures.

Images were acquired using confocal microscopy. Image stacks were then knit together to create high-resolution 2D large-scale brain images. The resulting image mosaics provide detailed views of the\u00a0cellular and subcellular distribution of RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 without losing the context of the tissue. To map the protein distribution of RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2, we stained mouse brain sections with specific RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 antibodies. Although RII\u03b2 antibody is commonly used and its specificity has been previously validated (<a href=\"#bib39\">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</a>), RI\u03b2 immunohistochemical imaging has not been possible previously due to the high cross reactivity of existing antibodies with RI\u03b1. Thus, it was essential to confirm the absolute specificity of the RI\u03b2 antibodies. To achieve high specificity, we removed any RI\u03b1 cross-reacting antibodies with immobilized RI\u03b1 protein as described in the\u00a0Material and methods, and then extensively validated the specificity and selectivity of the RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) Western blots confirmed the specificity of the antibodies for RI\u03b1 vs. RI\u03b2 purified proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, upper left panel), while dot blots of the four purified R-subunit isoforms demonstrated the specificity and selectivity of our RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 antibodies to the proteins in their native conformation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, upper right panel). To confirm specificity in cells, we overexpressed RI\u03b2-MKO2 or RI\u03b1-MKO2 in mouse 10 T1/2 cells; RI\u03b2 antibody detects overexpressed RI\u03b2-MKO2 but not the overexpressed RI\u03b1-MKO2. Similar experiments were also carried\u00a0out for the RII\u03b2 antibody in\u00a0order\u00a0to validate its specificity and selectivity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The antibody did not crossreact with RII\u03b1, its closest homolog. Staining the overexpressed cells with secondary antibodies alone resulted in no signal at similar levels or higher laser power, demonstrating no background from secondary antibodies in our method (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 A4 and C4</a>). For an additional negative control, RI\u03b2 antibody was incubated with purified full-length human RI\u03b2 protein. The pre-absorbed antibody blocked the antibody\u2019s specific binding and no signal was detected when tested on the RI\u03b2-MKO2 overexpressed cells or on\u00a0a brain slice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 A5 and C5</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We find that the overall patterns of RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 distribution are discrete. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, RI\u03b2 is expressed predominantly in the hippocampus, specifically in the CA1\u20133 pyramidal cell layers as well as in the dentate gyrus. RI\u03b2 is also highly expressed at the medial habenular nuclei but not at the lateral habenular nuclei of the forebrain. Strong signals are observed in the allocortex,\u00a0including the piriform cortex and the retrosplenial granular cortex, and much less in the neocortex. RI\u03b2 is observed also in the dorsal endopiriform nucleus. In the hypothalamus, strong cell body labeling is seen in the subincertal nucleus. Comparing RI\u03b2 protein levels to previously reported RI\u03b2 mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</a>), we observe that RI\u03b2 mRNA levels are higher in the pyramidal cell layer than\u00a0in the dentate gyrus but the protein is expressed at similar levels in both regions."

RII\u03b2 is also seen strongly at the choroid plexus and in\u00a0blood vessels. RII\u03b2 strongly labels the mossy fibers of the hippocampus but not the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. Increased labeling within specific nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus was observed. On the basis of comparison with the Franklin and Paxinos mouse brain atlas, we posit that substantial levels of RII\u03b2 are also evident at the reticular thalamic nucleus, rhomboid and reuniens thalamic nucleus. In the hypothalamus, ventromedial nuclear cells are strongly labeled as was the arculate nucleus in the mediobasal hypothalamus."

The problem of relating more magnified views with the lower-scale surveys is eliminated in this method. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows a detailed view of the hippocampus.

The advantage of the high-resolution large-scale mosaic images is that these comprehensive maps make it possible to analyze protein localization at gross structural level while at the same time providing subcellular details, thereby allowing\u00a0the tracing of\u00a0an axonal pathway and at the same time visualizing details such as axon terminals (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We can trace an axonal pathway, in\u00a0which RII\u03b2 is enriched, that emerges from the hilus of the dentate gyrus to the mossy fibers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). RII\u03b2 is abundant in the axons that emerge from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pass through the hilus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). RII\u03b2 is also concentrated in the mossy fiber axon terminals in the CA3-stratum lucidum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This is consistent with in situ hybridization data that show that the granule cells of the dentate gyrus express RII\u03b2 mRNA abundantly (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</a>). RI\u03b2 localization is distinct in these regions as it is concentrated in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer including the dendrites. RII\u03b2 is abundant in the axons of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare layer, which\u00a0contains perforant path fibers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The advantage of the detailed hippocampus map is that we can zoom in into different axons within the subfields, such as the stratum lacunosum-layer or stratum radiatum, in\u00a0order\u00a0to identify synaptic boutons, which helps\u00a0us to assign the staining specifically to axons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). RII\u03b2 is also enriched in the alveus, which is the deepest layer that contains the axons from pyramidal neurons, which\u00a0pass on towards the fimbria/fornix, one of the major outputs of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The parallel path of axonal fibers, immunostained by RII\u03b2, in the alveus is evident (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). RII\u03b2 axonal staining does not co-localize with the RI\u03b2 dendritic staining. RI\u03b2 is excluded from these axons."

We focused on the cerebellum because RI\u03b2, the least-studied PKA isoform, is the most predominant PKA isoform in this region and because\u00a0no immunohistochemical studies had\u00a0been\u00a0published previously on\u00a0this\u00a0isoform. Western blot analysis of the cerebellum fraction showed that RI\u03b2 was expressed in this region (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gr\u00f6nholm et al., 2003</a>) whereas RII\u03b2 expression was not detected (<a href=\"#bib39\">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</a>), probably because\u00a0of its low expression compared to that\u00a0detected\u00a0in other regions. The in situ hybridization data showed much less hybridization of RII\u03b2 compared to RI\u03b2 at the cerebellum, which is consistent with the protein expression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</a>). A detailed comparison of the two isoforms shows distinct localization patterns. RI\u03b2 is highly enriched in the Purkinje cells, including the somata and the dendritic trees (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>). RI\u03b2 is also localized to the granular cell layer and excluded from the white matter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). RII\u03b2 is preferentially expressed at the somata of the Purkinje cells and is detected at lower levels in their dendrites, and mainly in the primary branches. The RII\u03b2 expression is consistent with previous reports as well as with the localization of AKAP150, which is the primary AKAP responsible for targeting PKA to dendritic spines and post-synaptic density (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glantz et al., 1992</a>).

Since RI\u03b2 is concentrated in dendrites and abundantly expressed in the cerebellum compared to RII\u03b2, we performed co-localization experiments with MAP2 in this region. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> shows that in cerebellum slices RI\u03b2 co-localizes with MAP2.

In hippocampal/cortical primary cultured cells, we show that RI\u03b2 co-localizes with MAP2, and consistent with previous reports, RII\u03b2 also partially co-localizes with MAP2 in these cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>).

MiniSOG is a genetically modified flavoprotein, which produces singlet oxygen upon excitation. DAB will then be oxidized to form an insoluble osmium-philic polymer, which gives contrast to the ultrastructure near the tagged fusion protein. RI\u03b2 cDNA was fused to miniSOG and electrophorated into primary hippocampal cells. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, we found that RI\u03b2 is localized to the mitochondria, as we previously showed\u00a0using cell fractionation experiments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ilouz et al., 2012</a>). The resolution allows us to localize RI\u03b2 more specifically\u00a0to the cristae and the inner membrane of the mitochondria. A control untranfected photo-oxidized mitochondrion is shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>. 126 transfected darkened mitochondria and 71 non-transfected light mitochondria were counted. Representative images for a non-transfected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) and a transfected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) mitochondrion are shown. Moreover, we can detect RI\u03b2 localization in the cell nucleus, confirming the fluorescent images of brain sections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A control untransfected photo-oxidized cell nucleus is shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>.

The necessity for PKA activation and a subsequent phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 is well documented for many neuronal signaling pathways, including synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kandel, 2012</a>), but\u00a0the specific physiological functions of PKA regulatory subunits in these signaling complexes are only beginning to be understood. As we found RI\u03b2 in the nucleus, we sought to investigate whether downregulation of RI\u03b2 would result in impairment of CREB phosphorylation, a nuclear PKA substrate, in cultured cells. To accomplish this, we designed lentiviral shRNA vectors containing GFP to knockdown RI\u03b2 or RII\u03b2 subunits. Thus, cells expressing shRNA plasmids can be identified by the presence of GFP. We first confirmed the knockdown efficiency by co-transfecting 293T cells with cDNA encoding either RI\u03b2 or RII\u03b2 genes, together with a scrambled shRNA (shRNA IRR) as a negative control or shRNAs targeting either RI\u03b2 or RII\u03b2. Western blot analysis confirmed the\u00a0knockdown efficiency for RI\u03b2 at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Western blot analysis indicated that an efficient RII\u03b2 knockdown had been achieved using shRNA RII\u03b2 clone #2 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This clone was used in the subsequent experiments to knockdown RII\u03b2. To further validate the knockdown efficiency of these shRNA lentiviruses in primary cultured neurons,we infected the cells with shRNAs targeting either RI\u03b2 or RII\u03b2 and used scrambled shRNA (shRNA SCR) as a negative control. Cells were immunostained with either RI\u03b2- or RII\u03b2-specific antibodies. Infected cells expressing the indicated shRNAs were identified by the presence of GFP. Cells expressing shRNA against RI\u03b2 or RII\u03b2 display a significant reduction in the cell fluorescence intensity produced by their specific antibodies as compared to cells infected with a negative control. The results indicate a significant inhibition of RI\u03b2 or RII\u03b2 expression in cells infected with shRNA against a corresponding gene. Representative cells are shown in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>.

After recovery from infection, cells were stimulated with forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, to increase intracellular levels of cAMP and to\u00a0activate PKA. The physiological consequence of RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 downregulation for nuclear cAMP signaling was evaluated by analysis of CREB phosphorylation at Ser 133. Owing to the robust survival capacity of non-neuronal cells, trace gila present in initial preparations were an unavoidable component of these cultures. Non-infected cells remain as well. To specifically assay CREB phosphorylation in infected cells, the signal was quantified only in cells that\u00a0were\u00a0positively stained for \u03b2III-tubulin (neuronal marker, red)\u00a0and that expressed GFP (the\u00a0marker for lentivirus infection).

While the necessity of proper PKA catalytic activity and the phosphorylation of its downstream substrates are well established in a variety of neuronal functions, the rational and significance for having multiple PKA regulatory isoforms has not been appreciated. In this study, we used highly specific antibodies against RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 to create high-resolution large-scale mosaic images of the brain, and these images revealed distinct patterns of localization. Although RI\u03b2 is expressed at low levels in most cells, it is enriched in the brain, and our images show that RI\u03b2, but not RII\u03b2, is highly expressed in the hippocampus, consistent with tissue fractionations and with many of its predicted roles in neuronal function. In spite of its importance for neuronal function, RI\u03b2 has never been comprehensively imaged before due to the lack of specific antibodies. Furthermore, there has never been a systematic comparison of these two isoforms that are abundantly expressed in the brain. The mouse brain mosaic images presented\u00a0here\u00a0thus provide detailed global comparative views of whole brain sections and also help to explain the functional non-redundancy of RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2. In addition, the maps allow the\u00a0interrogatation\u00a0of subcellular features without losing the context of the brain regions. By zooming in to different brain regions, such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, we consistently find that RI\u03b2 is enriched in dendrites and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RII\u03b2 is more concentrated in axons. In our mosaic maps, RI\u03b2 is also localized to the nucleus within different brain regions. To verify the subcellular localization at higher resolution, we used miniSOG labeling, a technique that allows us to correlate light microscopy with electron microscopy. Consistent with our earlier report, we found RI\u03b2 at the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ilouz et al., 2012</a>), and with the miniSOG labeling, we could further localize RI\u03b2 to the inner membrane and cristae of the mitochondria. In addition, RI\u03b2 was prominently seen in the nucleus and around the nuclear envelope. To demonstrate a functional distinction between the two isoforms at the nucleus, we used primary neuronal cells and specific lenti-viruses to downregulate RI\u03b2 or RII\u03b2 selectively\u00a0and then tracked CREB phosphorylation as a reporter for a PKA nuclear substrate. Downregulation of the RI\u03b2, but not of\u00a0RII\u03b2, decreased CREB phosphorylation, which is consistent with the observed nuclear localization of RI\u03b2."

The distinct subcellular localization of PKA RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 subunits within discrete brain regions emphasizes the importance of mapping the\u00a0spatial localization of proteins in the context of the tissue,\u00a0whereas cultured cells sometimes do not provide an accurate representation of spatial localization. We find that each regulatory subunit is predominant within different brain regions and has a distinct and consistent patterns of cellular and subcellular localization across multiple regions. This isoform-specific localization provides an additional layer of\u00a0control\u00a0for achieving specificity in PKA signaling, and identifies localized pools of PKA signaling complexes in the brain. The specific pattern of distribution of RI\u03b2 in the hippocampus is consistent with its known unique roles in synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brandon et al., 1995</a>). RI\u03b2 but not RII\u03b2 is predominant at the pyramidal neurons in the CA1\u2013CA3 regions of the hippocampus, as well as in the dentate gyrus and hilus neuron (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This localization is consistent with hippocampal slices from RI\u03b2 null mice, which showed a severe deficit in LTD and depotentiation at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. This defect was also evident at the lateral perforant path-dentate granule cell synapse in RI\u03b2 knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brandon et al., 1995</a>). By contrast, and also consistent with previous reports, our maps show that RII\u03b2 is not expressed at the pyramidal neurons but is concentrated in the striatum. In correlation with the RII\u03b2 expression pattern, targeted disruption of the RII\u03b2 gene in mice led to a dramatic downregulation of total PKA activity in the striatum and a partial compensatory increase in RI subunits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brandon et al., 1998</a>)."

A surprising and intriguing finding in this study is that RI\u03b2 is the PKA regulatory subunit that is localized to the nucleus of many cells in different brain regions, and miniSOG labeling of RI\u03b2 confirmed the nuclear localization at a nanoscale resolution by electron microscopy. Induction of cAMP and activation of PKA leads to phosphorylation of specific transcription factors and induction of gene expression and long-term changes in neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Greengard, 2001</a>). Nuclear localization of RI and RII has been reported in hepatocytes by immunogold labeling (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kuettel et al., 1985</a>). There is evidence to\u00a0suggest\u00a0that nuclear RII\u03b2 binds CREB in T cells, implicating nuclear RII\u03b2 as a potential negative regulator of T cell activation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Elliott et al., 2003</a>).

These scaffold proteins determine the spatio-temporal activity of PKA. Over 50 members and splice variants of the AKAP family have been identified (<a href=\"#bib34\">Scott et al., 2013</a>). While most AKAPs were initially identified by their ability to bind RII subunits, several AKAPs, such as D-AKAP1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 1997b</a>) and D-AKAP2 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Huang et al., 1997a</a>), have been shown to bind RI as well, thereby making them dual-specific. Recently, other AKAPs such as smAKAP or GPR161 were shown to be highly specific and selective for RI subunits (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bachmann et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burgers et al., 2012</a>). The first RI\u03b2-specific AKAP, which is the only neuronal binding partner for RI\u03b2 identified to\u00a0date, is the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein merlin (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gr\u00f6nholm et al., 2003</a>). In this study, we provide a comprehensive comparison between the protein localization of RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 in several brain regions, and show that RI\u03b2 co-localizes with MAP2 at the cerebellum. MAP2 was the first AKAP identified to bind RII subunits and tethers PKA with microtubules (<a href=\"#bib38\">Theurkauf and Vallee, 1982</a>). It is only in recent years that we appreciate that some AKAPs can be dual-specific. On the basis of sequence alignment as well as structural alignment, it can be deduced that MAP2 is an AKAP that satisfies the requirement of binding both RI and RII subunits (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sarma et al., 2010</a>). We thus suggest that preferential binding and interactions of either RI or RII with a potential dual-specific AKAP is likely to be cell specific and may be determined by the predominant R subunit that is expressed in a certain location."

These patients also show an increase of RI\u03b2 in neuronal inclusions. This mutation can thus be classified as a targeting defect that can be validated in mouse models and in patient samples where we anticipate that RI\u03b2 localization will be altered. Although the pathophysiological mechanism by which this mutation leads to neurodegenerative disease remains to be investigated, this point mutation further emphasizes the importance of precisely controlled PKA isoform localization. Our mosaic maps, which can be downloaded and queried in great detail,\u00a0represent the endogenous expression and localization of PKA isoforms.

The localization maps permit comparison of the differential localization of each of these two isoforms in cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and lower brain regions. The images have been loaded into the Cell-centered Data Base maintained by the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research."

Identifying broad and subcellular expression is something that's been overlooked for various components of the cAMP pathway for far too long, and this is a welcome and necessary study. The main findings are that RI\u0392 is more highly expressed in the dendrites and soma (around the nucleus), and that RIIB is mainly in the axons."

In this manuscript, Ilouz and colleagues seek to characterize and differentiate the expression patterns of PKA regulatory subunits RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 through high resolution confocal mosaic brain mapping and electron microscopy. The idea is simple and straightforward, to identify differences in broad expression and subcellular expression through multiple imaging modalities, and then begin to probe to see if these differences in expression can result in unique downstream changes in biochemistry and/or behavior. Identifying broad and subcellular expression is something that's been overlooked for various components of the cAMP pathway for far too long, and this is a welcome and necessary study. The main findings are that RI\u03b2 is more highly expressed in the dendrites and soma (around the nucleus), and that RII\u03b2 is mainly in the axons. They then go to show that only down regulation of RI\u03b2 changes pCREB signaling while RII\u03b2 does not, further confirming the differences in compartmentalization between these two subunits. Interestingly, they link this difference in expression to a recently discovered familial disease that results from a mutation in the RI\u03b2 subunit which provides further evidence demonstrating how important this compartmentalization is."

RI\u03b2 is enriched in dendrites and colocalizes with MAP2, whereas RII\u03b2 is concentrated in axons. Using correlated light and electron microscopy the authors confirm mitochondrial and nuclear localization of RI\u03b2 in cultured neurons.

After re-reading the manuscript along with all your helpful comments, as well as discussing this part with one of the identified reviewers, Ted Abel, we agree that it would be best to remove the last experiment (Figure 9) that relates to the RI\u03b2 L50R mutation, found in patients with a neurodegenerative disease. This additional data seems to deflect from the message of the manuscript and provides an impression that two separate studies are presented in this manuscript. As the paper is now structured we present the regional, cellular and subcellular spatial localization of RI\u03b2 and RII\u03b2 that is provided by the high-resolution large-scale mosaic images using isoform-specific antibodies. We then present a few specific and significant examples of localization and functional consequences that emerged from the large data set. One of the examples that we focused on was the nuclear localization of RI\u03b2, the least studied PKA isoform, in different brain regions. We further investigated the subcellular localization of RI\u03b2 using miniSOG labeling that allowed for correlating light and electron microscopy. We find RI\u03b2 at the mitochondria, as we reported earlier, as well as at the nucleus, modifying the existing dogma regarding PKA isoforms in the nucleus. The images suggested a potential functional distinction between the two isoforms in the nucleus. To support this we showed that down-regulation of RI\u03b2, but not RII\u03b2, in hippocampal cultures decreased pCREB, which we use as an example of a nuclear PKA substrate. Taken together, we present a multi-scale approach, going from the global views of whole brain sections, which allow identification of subcellular features, without losing the context of the brain regions, to the validation of the subcellular localization using electron microscopy and correlation of this localization with functional differences of PKA isoforms. Obviously, there are many other ways in which this data, that defines comprehensively the unique enrichment of RI\u03b2 vs. RII\u03b2 across multiple brain regions, can be utilized to drive new hypotheses. We feel that by ending the manuscript here as well as addressing the reviewers\u2019 comments on the functional data (as provided by point-by-point response below) the focus and clarity of the manuscript has significantly improved."

Due to the robust survival capacity of non-neuronal cells, trace gila present in initial preparations were an unavoidable component of these cultures. Non-infected cells remain as well. To specifically assay CREB phosphorylation in infected cells, the signal was quantified only in cells positively stained for \u03b2III-tubulin (neuronal marker, red) that expressed GFP (marker for lentivirus infection). CREB phosphorylation was quantified in the specified cells as a measure of pCREB signal intensity per the area of the nucleus as delineated by DAPI. We have internal controls in each experiment comparing CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 of infected neurons to non-infected neurons. We show statistically significant data of infected neurons with shRNA against RI\u03b2 compared to the scrabbled shRNA (p&lt;0.0001). We show statistically significant data of neurons infected with shRNA against RI\u03b2 compared to RII\u03b2 (p&lt;0.001). 50 neurons were counted in each experiment.
