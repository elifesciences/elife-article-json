Despite discovery of polarity pathways acting concurrently with differentiation, it's unclear how neurons traverse complex polarity transitions or how neuronal progenitors delay polarization during development. We report that zinc finger and homeobox transcription factor-1 (Zeb1), a master regulator of epithelial polarity, controls neuronal differentiation by transcriptionally repressing polarity genes in neuronal progenitors. Necessity-sufficiency testing and functional target screening in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) reveal that Zeb1 inhibits polarization and retains progenitors in their germinal zone (GZ). Zeb1 expression is elevated in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma subgroup originating from GNPs with persistent SHH activation. Restored polarity signaling promotes differentiation and rescues GZ exit, suggesting a model for future differentiative therapies. These results reveal unexpected parallels between neuronal differentiation and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and suggest that active polarity inhibition contributes to altered GZ exit in pediatric brain cancers."

Despite discovery of polarity pathways acting concurrently with differentiation, it's unclear how neurons traverse complex polarity transitions or how neuronal progenitors delay polarization during development. We report that zinc finger and homeobox transcription factor-1 (Zeb1), a master regulator of epithelial polarity, controls neuronal differentiation by transcriptionally repressing polarity genes in neuronal progenitors. Necessity-sufficiency testing and functional target screening in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) reveal that Zeb1 inhibits polarization and retains progenitors in their germinal zone (GZ). Zeb1 expression is elevated in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma subgroup originating from GNPs with persistent SHH activation. Restored polarity signaling promotes differentiation and rescues GZ exit, suggesting a model for future differentiative therapies. These results reveal unexpected parallels between neuronal differentiation and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and suggest that active polarity inhibition contributes to altered GZ exit in pediatric brain cancers."

However, artificially restoring other factors that encourage the cells to polarize caused the neurons to mature normally. Further investigation is now needed to find out whether the activity of the Sonic Hedgehog gene regulates Zeb1 activity, and to discover whether inhibiting Zeb1 could prevent brain tumours from developing."

Proliferating progenitors express Zeb1 in GZs in the developing mouse brain\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Darling et al., 2003</a>). While loss of Zeb1 function in the developing neocortex reduces proliferation in the VZ and SVZ\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2008</a>), it remains unknown how Zeb1 regulates neural progenitor populations. Studies examining Zeb1 regulation of epithelial cell polarity provide insights. Zeb1 activates stemness pathways in immature, unpolarized epithelial cells and their transformed counterparts\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib73\">Spaderna et al., 2008</a>). It also controls transitions in epithelial differentiation and polarity plasticity: high Zeb1 expression inhibits epithelial differentiation and drives cells toward epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while low expression allows mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). During EMT, Zeb1 acts as a transcriptional repressor that silences adherens junction (AJ) and apical-basal polarity genes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Aigner et al., 2007</a>). Thus, Zeb1 simultaneously blocks differentiation, apical-basal polarity, and junction formation of epithelial cells, locking them into the mesenchymal state."

                        "text": "We have known for more than a decade that persistent Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling blocks GNP GZ exit, but the mechanism has remained a mystery. Here we hypothesized that MET-like events control the onset of neuronal differentiation and GZ exit, which involve cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion transitions. By using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we found that Zeb1 is necessary and sufficient to maintain GNPs in an undifferentiated, unpolarized, transiently amplifying state within the EGL and to control the onset of their GZ exit. Zeb1 represses transcription of polarity and cell adhesion genes, such as <i>Pard6a, Pard3a</i> and <i>close homolog of L1 (Chl1</i>). By using a functional screen, we found that restored expression of these genes rescues GNP differentiation, neurite extension, and GZ exit. Finally, we examined the link between morphogens and Zeb1 in controlling this process. We found that SHH, a potent GNP mitogen, maintains Zeb1 expression. Moreover, Zeb1 expression persists in MB tumor cells, the transformed GNP counterpart in which SHH signaling is persistently activated. Zeb1 loss-of-function or restored Zeb1 target expression rescued the GZ exit phenotype in <i>Patched1 (Ptch1</i>)-deficient GNPs, the progenitors of SHH-subgroup MB. Our findings show that CGN differentiation bears a remarkable similarity to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. The balance of EMT-like vs. MET-like processes and of proliferative vs. maturation processes may be a key developmental mechanism that, when disrupted, contributes to the pathological alteration of GZ exit in neurodevelopmental disorders and pediatric cancers."

Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that Zeb1 is the primary EMT factor expressed in GNPs during the early postnatal (P) peak of neurogenesis, and that expression diminishes as GNPs exit the cell cycle to differentiate into CGNs: at P7 <i>Zeb1</i> mRNA was 28-fold higher than the next most abundant transcription factor, <i>Snail1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Zeb1 protein expression confirmed our RNA analysis where it is expressed primarily in the EGL at P7 and greatly reduced at P15 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). At P7, Zeb1 is co-expressed with the proliferation marker Ki67 and two markers of GNP identity Siah2, and Meis1/2, and is greatly reduced in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein p27<sup>Kip1</sup>/Cdkn1b (referred as p27 thereafter)-positive postmitotic CGNs in the inner EGL. We noted a subpopulation of Zeb1 positive cells in deeper layers of the cerebellum at P7. These cells represent a mixture of white matter interneuron or oligodendrocyte precursors as these cells also express Pax2\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Maricich and Herrup, 1999</a>) or Olig2\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In GNPs, Zeb1 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with the expression of the apical-basal polarity genes <i>Pard6a</i> and <i>Prkcz</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Not only did <i>Pard6a</i> mRNA increase as CGN differentiation proceeded, but the promoter of this gene was active in individual GNPs at the border of the GZ, prior to their entry into the inner EGL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>).

We used two independent shRNA vectors to silence <i>Zeb1</i> in P7 EGL (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a> for second shRNA migration data and validation). After 24\u2009hr ex vivo, control EGL cells resided in the GZ and incorporated EdU, not having differentiated into CGNs or begun migrating to the IGL. In contrast, <i>Zeb1</i> silencing increased migration toward the IGL (<math id=\"inf9\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>x</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></math> distance=34 \u00b1 10\u00a0\u03bcm vs 68 \u00b1 18\u2009\u03bcm) and reduced EdU incorporation (22.6 \u00b1 1.0% vs 7.6 \u00b1 1.8% EdU positive), showing that Zeb1 loss-of-function promotes differentiation and migration toward the IGL. We next confirmed that Zeb1 activity inhibited GZ exit, using a gain-of-function approach. P7 EGL was electroporated with an expression vector for Zeb1. After 2 days ex vivo, control CGNs entered the molecular layer and IGL, while Zeb1-expressing CGNs remained within the EGL (<math id=\"inf10\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>x</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></math> distance=75 \u00b1 3\u2009\u03bcm vs 40 \u00b1 6\u2009\u03bcm, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>) and continued to incorporate EdU (3.3 \u00b1 0.4% vs 10.9 \u00b1 0.1% EdU positive). To further examine the role of Zeb1 in GNP differentiation in vivo we scored Tag1 and NeuN expression in the EGL of E18.5 Zeb1 null embryos (a time-point prior perinatal lethality observed in Zeb1 null embryos). Consistent with our ex vivo\u00a0gene silencing results, loss of Zeb1 function in vivo leads to an increase in Tag1 and NeuN differentiation marker gene expression, indicating an increase of neuronal differentiation in the absence of Zeb1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). These observations indicate that Zeb1 inhibits differentiation of GNPs to CGNs and is necessary and sufficient to restrict GNPs to their GZ niche. They also suggest that Zeb1 inhibits GNP polarization, as neurite extension, two-stroke nucleokinesis and GZ exit depend on polarity signaling complexes in CGNs."

                                "text": "Having learned that Zeb1 inhibits GNP differentiation and potentially the downstream events associated with CGN polarization, we next sought to identify Zeb1 targets to determine how sustained Zeb1 expression maintains GNPs. We reasoned that as Zeb1 gain-of-function strongly inhibits GNP differentiation, it would provide a basis to identify potential Zeb1 targets. We prepared RNA from P0, P7 and P15 GNPs and used Affymetrix DNA arrays to compare their transcriptomes of these cells with those of pure, FACS-sorted GNP populations nucleofected with control, Zeb1- or HES1 expression vectors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, ArrayExpress accession number: E-MTAB-3557). We included the transcription factor HES1 because it is a known repressor of GNP differentiation downstream of the Notch2 receptor\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib70\">Solecki et al., 2001</a>). GNPs were selected for our developmental expression analyses as it is well established this transiently amplifying progenitor population expresses early CGN differentiation markers; such as TAG1, L1, NRCAM, NeuroD1 or TIS21 prior to their final cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib52\">Miyata et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Iacopetti et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Xenaki et al., 2011</a>). Zeb1 gain-of-function suppressed a group of genes increasingly expressed between P0 and P15 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with previous observations that Zeb1 acts as a transcriptional repressor. Gene ontology analysis revealed this group of genes to be associated with tissue morphogenesis, epithelial polarization, cell adhesion and control of cell motility. Key members of the apical or basolateral polarity pathways (<i>Pard6a Pard3a, Dlg2 and Lin7a</i>) and <i>Cdh1</i> AJ adhesion molecule were among the Zeb1-repressed genes. In parallel, we analyzed the EMT/MET signature upon Zeb1 gain-of-function in GNPs, using a pathway-focused PCR array. Various genes previously shown to be induced during EMT were enriched in these GNPs, while a class of MET-related genes were repressed (see Tables in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). For further validation we selected a group of genes that included polarity complex genes (<i>Pard6a, Pard3a, Dlg2 and Lin7a</i>), cell adhesion genes (<i>Cdh1 and Chl1</i>), transcription factors associated with cell differentiation (<i>Bhlhe40 and Nfib</i>), and three randomly selected genes (<i>Sorl1, Flt1, and Cdk5r1</i>), most of which were not significantly repressed by HES1. Not only were many of these genes increasingly\u00a0expressed in the normal developmental time course (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and validated as suppressed in Zeb1-expressing GNPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), the protein expression of many of them was mutually exclusive with Zeb1 or Ki67 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). A previous study in our laboratory demonstrated a similar expression profile for Pard3a (<a href=\"#bib24\">Famulski et al., 2010</a>). These results suggest that many of the putative targets identified are bona fide CGN differentiation markers expressed at low levels in early postnatal GNPs. Increased polarity gene expression in differentiated CGNs, their mutually exclusive expression with GNP markers, and their suppression by Zeb1, further suggest a parallel between GNP differentiation and MET."

As a prelude, we first assessed global Zeb1 binding sites in a ChIP-seq data set from NS5 mouse neural stem cells, which, like GNPs, express high levels of Zeb1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, ArrayExpress accession number: E-MTAB-3560). Many of the proximal promoters of key apical-basal polarity genes (<i>Pard6a, Pard6b, Pard3a, Pard6g)</i> and other Zeb1-regulated genes identified in our screen (<i>Chl1, Limk2</i>) showed clear Zeb1 binding peaks, suggesting that they are direct targets (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Computational analyses comparing the genome-wide Zeb1 binding profile to the Zeb1-regulated genes identified by expression profiling showed Zeb1 binding events are highly associated with downregulated genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013c</a>), further pointing to Zeb1 as a transcriptional repressor in neural stem/progenitor cells. We next validated Zeb1 binding to key genes in purified P7 GNPs by ChIP PCR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). No binding was detected at non-functional regions of the genome in the <i>androgen receptor</i> and <i>GAPDH</i> genes. Weak but consistent binding was detected in the proximal upstream regions of <i>Limk2</i> and <i>Lin7a</i>. Strong Zeb1 binding was observed at positive control regions in the <i>Zeb1</i> gene and <i>Cdh1</i> gene, at the proximal upstream sequences of <i>Pard6</i> and <i>Pard3a</i> genes and at an intronic site in the <i>Chl1</i> gene. Overall, these results indicate that Zeb1 directly regulates genes expected to play a role in cell adhesion and apical-basal polarity."

                                "text": "Given the expression profile of Zeb1 targets and the mutually exclusive expression of these genes and <i>Zeb1</i>, we postulated that some of these targets may facilitate CGN differentiation, neurite extension and GZ exit downstream of Zeb1. We individually expressed validated targets in the context of our in vitro (neurite extension, Ki67 or p27 expression status) and ex vivo (GZ exit and EdU incorporation status) Zeb1 gain-of-function assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a, b and d</a>) to determine whether restoring individual target expression would rescue the Zeb1 phenotypes and thus functionally prioritize these targets. For this small functional screen we selected key polarity molecules (Pard6a, Pard3a, Lin7a, Dlg2), adhesion receptors (Cdh1, Chl1, constitutively active JAM-C), genes associated with cell differentiation (<i>Sorl1, Bhlhe40, Nfib</i>) and randomly selected genes (<i>Flt1 VEGF receptor, Cdk5r1</i>). Our laboratory has previously shown that Pard6a and Pard3a are required for CGN migration and GZ exit\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Solecki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Famulski et al., 2010</a>). Chl1 regulates neurite initiation, neuronal migration and neuronal dendrite orientation in the developing neocortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Demyanenko et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Demyanenko et al., 2010</a>). Lin7 and Dlg homologs are components of the apical or basolateral polarity complexes in epithelial cells where Dlg recruits Lin7 to distinct membrane domains\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Bachmann et al., 2004</a>). Nfib regulates CGN differentiation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib80\">Wang et al., 2007</a>), and Cdk5r1 regulates Cdk5 activity during neuronal migration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Gupta et al., 2003</a>). JAM-C is not a Zeb1 target but was included because reduction of Pard3a activity reduces JAM-C adhesion and this constitutively active receptor complements CGN adhesion in the absence of Pard3a function\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Famulski et al., 2010</a>). Prior to the screen, we carefully titrated the quantity of expression vector needed to roughly double each target\u2019s expression in control CGNs to complement Zeb1-mediated target repression (data not shown). We observed diversity in the way individual targets modified the Zeb1 gain-of-function phenotypes in our in vitro and ex vivo assays (Supplemental Figure 5 and 6; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Restored expression of Pard6a, Pard3a, and Chl1 rescued all measured phenotypes to normal levels in CGNs. Individual introduction of each of these downstream Zeb1 targets allowed GNPs to acquire mature CGN status, characterize long neurites, expression of the p27 cell cycle inhibitor, absence of Ki67 labeling or EdU incorporation and GZ exit with subsequent migration to the IGL, even with Zeb1 gain-of-function. Constitutively active Jam-C and the basolateral polarity protein Lin7a did not influence maturation parameters in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>); however, both stimulated cell cycle exit, GZ exit and migration ex vivo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), suggesting that they act non-cell\u2013autonomously in the complex ex vivo environment. Dlg2 stimulated cell cycle exit and p27 expression in all conditions tested but was unable to rescue neurite extension or migration ex vivo. Four genes, <i>Sorl1, Bhlhe40, Nfib, and Cdk5r1</i>, reestablished p27 expression. p27 is known for its cell cycle inhibitory and cytoskeletal regulatory properties; however, p27 expression alone in Sorl1-, Bhlhe40-, Nfib- or Cdk5r1-expressing cells was insufficient to rescue the other features of mature CGNs, such as neurite extension, loss of Ki67 labeling/EdU incorporation, or GZ exit and migration to the IGL. Restored expression of Nfib and Flt1 enhanced neurite extension but failed to rescue the full spectrum of mature CGN features, much like the genes that stimulated p27 expression. Additionally, longer term ex vivo incubations revealed that <i>Cdh1</i>, <i>Cdk5r1</i> and <i>Sorl1</i> were not sufficient to rescue IGL-directed migration of Zeb1 over-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, <i>Bhlhe40</i> expression, a negative regulator of EMT could rescue with a 72\u2009hr ex vivo incubation. Time-lapse imaging revealed of cultured neurons revealed that Pard6a-, Pard3a-, and Chl1-rescue also restored two-stroke nucleokinesis and JAM-C adhesion levels, two cell biological outputs of the PAR complex function in maturing CGNs (<a href=\"#bib71\">Solecki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Famulski et al., 2010</a>) (see <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media12\">12</a>)."

Restored Pard6a and Chl1 expression did not affect the levels at which Zeb1 suppressed its target genes, indicating that Pard6a and Chl1 did not counteract Zeb1 at the transcriptional level or non-specifically reduce Zeb1 target repression in our assay system (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). Moreover in the case of Chl1 protein, restored Pard6a and Pard3 did not rescue Chl1 expression as assayed by immunocytochemistry in dissociated CGNs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Restored Pard6a or Chl1 expression reduced Zeb1-mediated activation of CyclinD1 and CylinD2 mRNA and Atoh1 protein levels, all of which are required to maintain GNPs in the undifferentiated state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b and c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ayrault et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Flora et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Huard et al., 1999</a>). The broad rescue of Zeb1 gain-of-function phenotypes by the Pard6a and Pard3a polarity proteins and the Chl1 adhesion molecule demonstrates that these Zeb1-supressed targets are prerequisites for mature CGN characteristics. These findings also reinforce the parallel between CGN differentiation and polarity regulation in cells of epithelial origin. Not only do Zeb1 and polarity proteins show mutually exclusive expression in GNPs and CGNs, but the functional screen also shows that their functional antagonism regulates the balance between the GNP and CGN states."

As SHH activation led to elevated Zeb1 in normal GNPs, we next examined the expression levels of Zeb1 and its targets in a mouse SHH MB model from <i>Ptch1 +/-, Cdkn2c -/-</i> mice in which SHH signaling is constitutively activated (<a href=\"#bib78\">Uziel et al., 2005</a>).

MBs contain subpopulations of cells that can proceed with neuronal differentiation. Zeb1 expression was complementary with that of class III beta-tubulin/Tuj1, an early neuronal differentiation marker, indicating that Zeb1 expression is extinguished in both normal and tumor-derived cells proceeding toward the differentiated phenotype. We also quantified the RNA expression of Zeb1 and its targets by qRT-PCR in normal GNPs and in mouse SHH MBs. Mouse MBs contained higher levels of <i>Zeb1</i> RNA than GNPs purified at P7, the time of peak Zeb1 expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>).

While there is a firm link between proliferation and delayed differentiation in pre-neoplastic GNPs, it is unknown how deregulated SHH signaling delays GZ exit. Given that Zeb1 controls GNP differentiation and GZ exit and that its expression is linked with elevated SHH signaling, we postulated that Zeb1 function, and its transcriptional repression of polarity genes, may be related to the GZ exit phenotypes of GNPs with an activated SHH pathway. We developed an ex vivo model to examine the GZ exit status of GNPs exposed to chronic SHH stimulation: we electroporated vectors encoding codon-optimized Cre recombinase or its inactive mutant into P7 cerebellar EGL from mice homozygous for <i>Ptch1</i> harboring loxP sites flanking exons 8\u20139 (<i>Ptch1</i> <sup>flox/flox</sup> mice)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Ellis et al., 2003</a>).

GNPs expressing Cre recombinase remained largely within the EGL, but migration was unaltered by a catalytically inactive mutant (<math id=\"inf15\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>x</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></math> distance\u00a0=\u00a041.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u00b5m vs. 71.1 \u00b1 7.8 \u00b5m; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To examine Zeb1 and Zeb1-target function in the GZ exit phenotype of <i>Ptch1</i>-deficient GNPs, we co-electroporated P7 EGL from <i>Ptch1</i> <sup>flox/flox</sup> mice with Cre recombinase and an shRNA silencing Zeb1 or vectors encoding Pard6a, Chl1 and Lin7a, which were expressed at low levels in the mouse Zeb1-expressing MB cells. <i>Zeb1</i> silencing or increased Pard6a, Chl1 and Lin7a expression restored GZ exit and migration to the IGL to near wild-type levels. Taken together, these results show that Zeb1 is functionally required downstream of SHH signaling to control GZ exit. Moreover, the MET-like transition that occurs in CGN differentiation is evident not only during normal development but also in an ex vivo model of pathological GZ exit implicated in cerebellar tumorigenesis."

Conversely, diminished repression of polarity genes or adhesion receptors accompanying Zeb1 downregulation promotes morphological maturation, GZ exit, and IGL-directed migration of CGNs in the developing cerebellum. We found that Zeb1 is downregulated as GNPs begin to exit the EGL niche and that Zeb1 loss-of-function spurs precocious GZ exit and withdrawal of GNPs from the cell cycle. Failure to downregulate Zeb1 delays the onset of key polarity gene or adhesion receptor expression, morphological maturation, GZ exit, and migration to the IGL. Restoration of Pard6a, Pard3a and Chl1 expression alone is sufficient to rescue the CGN fate in the context of Zeb1 gain-of-function. These findings show that polarization is not only triggered by differentiation programs in newborn neurons but is also obstructed in transiently amplifying progenitor cells, much as polarity is regulated in epithelial-mesenchymal and mesenchymal-epithelial transitions (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

While radial glial cells, migrating neurons and neurons elaborating axons or dendrites display a polarized morphology, transiently amplifying progenitors and newly delaminated neurons are temporarily less polarized. Conceptual parallels have been made between epithelial and neuronal polarity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colman, 1999</a>). Recently, Foxp- or Scratch-mediated inhibition of classical cadherins was shown to spur neuronal AJ loss, transition away from radial glial polarity, and delamination from the VZs of the spinal cord and cortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib63\">Rousso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Itoh et al., 2013</a>). The parallel between Foxp- and Scratch-mediated delamination of neurons and EMTs in epithelial cells is incomplete, as both delamination events may occur in postmitotic neuronal progeny. Also, we still have no clear idea how immature neurons or their progenitors transition out of their low polarity states during terminal differentiation. Our work demonstrates that transiently amplifying cerebellar progenitors display mesenchymal characteristics, expressing high levels of Zeb1 and low levels of polarity proteins and adhesion molecules needed for maturation to CGNs."

As illustrated in our model (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), METs are associated with acquisition of a mature, polarized morphology. Zeb1 locks GNPs into an immature morphology, just as it blocks apical-basal polarization in epithelia. Second, a common MET pattern is extensive migration followed by a final integrative positioning event\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib76\">Thiery and Sleeman, 2006</a>). At the population level, GNPs migrate to cover the cerebellar anlage, migrate within the EGL, and finally undergo differentiative migration to the IGL. Our results show that Zeb1 is necessary and sufficient to confine GNPs to their GZ niche, where migration is restricted to the cerebellar surface. Finally, METs involve a changing balance of cell-matrix and cell-cell contacts, in which mesenchymal cells engage in extracellular matrix adhesions and differentiated epithelial cells engage in cell-cell adhesions\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Nelson, 2009</a>). Similarly, early electron microscopy studies showed that GNPs remain largely contiguous with the matrix-rich pial basal lamina until they differentiate\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Hausmann and Sievers, 1985</a>) and develop extensive cell-cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rakic, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Del Cerro and Snider, 1972</a>). Interestingly, we found that promotion of cell-cell contact with constitutively active JAM-C and restored Chl-1 expression rescues Zeb1 gain-of-function phenotypes. One key difference between GNP differentiation and epithelial polarity is the mir200 class of micro RNAs that inhibits Zeb1 expression in epithelial cells are not expressed in CGNs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib77\">Uziel et al., 2009</a>). Overall, CGN differentiation, which is accompanied by downregulation of Zeb1, enhanced Zeb1 target expression, morphological maturation and GZ exit, bears remarkable similarity to the METs of epithelial cells as they incorporate into epithelial tissues. At the moment, it is unclear if additional EMT regulatory transcription factors behave similarly in GNP differentiation. While Zeb1 was clearly the highest expressed EMT regulatory factor relative to 18S RNA, necessity and sufficiency testing was not performed on low abundance genes like <i>Snai1</i> or <i>Snai2</i>."

Our ChIP-seq studies show that Zeb1 occupies the promoters of polarity genes in mouse neural stem cells with telencephalic features, raising the possibility that Zeb1 may regulate the polarity of telencephalon cells. We observed that Zeb1 inhibits GNP expression of the GTPases Rnd1 and Rnd3 (data not shown), which promote VZ delamination, inhibit intermediate progenitor proliferation and enhance multipolar to bipolar transition in the neocortex, much as Zeb1 targets function in GNPs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Heng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pacary et al., 2011</a>)."

Our findings show a new level of regulation of the onset of neuronal polarity in which active gene expression programs in neuronal progenitors cells can delay their competence to polarize.

The best example is the link between SHH signaling, GNP proliferation, and MB tumorigenesis. Humans with activating mutations in the SHH pathway are genetically predisposed to MBs that bear many similarities to GNPs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Raffel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lam et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Taylor et al., 2002</a>). Available mouse models can recapitulate SHH-associated MB\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Goodrich, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Uziel et al., 2005</a>). During cerebellar development, GNPs stream from the rhombic lip to cover the cerebellar anlage, expand clonally in the EGL in response to Purkinje cell-derived SHH, then exit mitosis and their GZ niche and migrate inward to the IGL\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Hatten et al., 1997</a>). When the SHH signaling pathway is deregulated in vivo, cohorts of GNPs fail to exit their GZ niche and continue to proliferate on the cerebellar surface well past the normal interval\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Goodrich, 1997</a>). Although migration from the mitotic niche is proposed to be linked to GNP cell cycle exit\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Choi et al., 2005</a>), the specific downstream GZ exit or migration mechanisms are unknown. Our finding that SHH maintains Zeb1 expression and that Zeb1 target expression is reduced in MB reveals an antagonism between the main GNP mitogen and the polarity required for GZ exit. This antagonism suggests that SHH inhibits the MET-like event we showed to control GNP GZ exit and that pre-neoplastic GNPs or MB cells are inherently polarity-deficient. The possibility that Zeb1 controls an active program to block polarization is particularly relevant to MB. These tumor cells express high levels of the FOXO and NeuroD transcription factors that promote CGN polarization, but they are insufficient to induce polarization of transformed GNPs. Thus, Zeb1 is a candidate factor that may act downstream of SHH in MB to counteract the polarization program. Finally, our results suggest future studies to determine whether restoring the polarity balance in MB will yield therapeutic benefit as a complement to existing first line- or targeted therapies."

How do the targets, such as the PAR complex and Chl1, promote these events? In the context of Zeb1 gain-of-function, Pard6a and Chl1 expression reduced Zeb1 activation of CyclinD1, CyclinD2, and Atoh1, each of which is essential to maintain GNP proliferation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ayrault et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Flora et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Huard et al., 1999</a>). Thus, Pard6a and Chl1 appear to cell-intrinsically promote CGN differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, Pard6a and Chl1 gain-of-function in normal GNPs spurs precocious germinal zone exit (data not shown). In preliminary time-lapse imaging studies, Pard6a, Pard3a and Chl1 also rescued two-stroke motility and JAM-C adhesion levels (see <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media12\">12</a>). While it is intriguing that PAR complex and Chl1 behave similarly in our functional genomics screen, further studies are necessary to clarify their potential functional interactions. Finally, an additional area of further investigation is the cooperation between transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms for polarity regulation. While Pard3a is clearly transcriptionally repressed by Zeb1, it\u2019s mRNA does not display the same elevation displayed by other targets after Zeb1 expression diminishes. Interestingly, Pard3a protein expression levels is controlled by the Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, thus regulation of Pard3a expression may be due to a complex interplay between transcriptional and post-translation mechanisms. In conclusion, further examination of Zeb1 function in neural progenitors and its relation to other GZ exit pathways and the MET-like conceptual model may be useful not only in understanding how normal GNPs transition to the CGN state, but also in understanding the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers linked to defective GZ exit."

Formaldehyde crosslinking was then reversed by adding 8\u2009\u03bcL of 5\u2009mol/L NaCl and incubating at 65\u00baC overnight.

The results were normalised against the input control. Normalised data of three independent experiments were averaged and are presented using fold change/enrichment of each promoter region expressed as a ratio of PCR signal of samples to that of input. For example, fold increase of promoter binding is defined as the ratio of Zeb1 binding DNA compared to DNA precipitated with the IgG control antibody (set as a fixed value of 1.0)."

The reviewers also recommend that CGN and GNP-specific genes be identified by FACS of GFP+/- cells from pard6-EGFP GENSAT BAC transgenic mice. It would be informative to see whether expression levels of the Zeb1 target genes isolated in this study indeed increase during GNP differentiation into CGNs. Also, in other figures, it is often unclear whether RNA was isolated from purified GNPs or whole cerebellum, which would greatly affect interpretation of the data."

Our laboratory and others have noted random CGN motility either when immature cells are assayed or when CGNs are arrested in an early stage of differentiation (e.g. Yamasaki et al. 2001 Development 128: 3133-44, Yacubova and Komuro 2002 J. Neuroscience 22(14):5966-81, Tarnok et al. 2005 J. Neurobiology65(2): 135-45, Famulski et al. 2010Science330(6012):1834-8). Asthe reviewers note, other potential explanations could account for the random migration phenotype. To satisfy reviewer concerns and clarify this issue in the text we now note in the manuscript there is at least two potential explanations for randomized motility 1) a disturbed intrinsic polarity program or 2) perturbed glial binding."
