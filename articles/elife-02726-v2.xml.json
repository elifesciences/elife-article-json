Using in vivo two-photon population Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in awake mice, this study investigated how neural representation of visual input to PFC neurons is regulated by dopamine. Phasic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) evoked prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, lasting \u223c30 s in layer 2/3 neurons of the PFC, which are regulated by a dopamine D1 receptor-dependent pathway. Furthermore, only a conditioning protocol with visual sensory input applied 0.5 s before the VTA dopaminergic input could evoke enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and increased pattern similarity (or establish a neural representation) of PFC neurons to the same sensory input. By increasing both the level of neuronal response and pattern similarity, dopaminergic input may establish robust and reliable cortical representation."

This form of learning\u2014now known as associative learning\u2014has since been demonstrated in species from honeybees to humans."

This process takes place in part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, but the mechanism by which it occurs is largely unclear."

This second region, called the ventral tegmental area, is part of the brain's reward circuit: it becomes active whenever an animal experiences a desirable event, such as receiving food, and supplies a neurotransmitter called dopamine to its target areas, which include the prefrontal cortex."

Short-lived increases in calcium levels were seen in the prefrontal cortex, raising the possibility that these \u2018calcium transients\u2019 are the signal that enables the brain to link two events. Moreover, blocking proteins called dopamine D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex reduced the calcium transients, which is consistent with existing evidence that dopamine from the ventral tegmental area is required for associative learning."

Dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is crucial for PFC function (<a href=\"#bib21\">Schultz, 2007</a>). In primates, sensory cues, which are used in associative learning tasks, create specific temporal activity patterns in PFC neurons and a neural representation of the sensory cue (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jacob et al., 2013</a>). However, how dopamine contributes to form neural representations at the neuronal network level is largely unknown. One potential mechanism is that dopaminergic (DA) neurons target dopamine over a number of inhibitory and excitatory neurons via their widespread axonal arborizations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Matsuda et al., 2009</a>). Thus, investigating modification of neuronal activity at the population level will reveal the role of dopamine signaling in the formation of neural representation. Therefore, utilizing in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in awake mice, this study investigated how neural representation in PFC neurons is developed under regulation by dopamine, in response to visual sensory input."

Both stimulation frequencies only evoked short Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in PFC neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Input from the VTA, especially through high frequency, phasic stimulation can therefore induce a specific signal required to evoke long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in PFC neurons. Phasic stimulation of the VTA is known to facilitate DA release from its terminals (<a href=\"#bib28\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Lavin et al., 2005</a>), therefore, it was hypothesized that DA receptors are involved in induction of the long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. DA receptors are members of the G-protein coupled receptor family and are composed of two groups: D1 and D2, which have opposing effects on intracellular signaling (<a href=\"#bib22\">Seamans and Yang, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Soltani et al., 2013</a>). Selective DA receptor antagonists for each family were administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.). Treatment with the D1 antagonist SCH23390 (1 mg/kg) reduced the long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients by 50% and the decay time constant by 60%. In contrast, no detectable attenuation was observed in mice treated with the D2 antagonist eticlopride (0.5 mg/kg) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In addition, the short Ca<sup>2+</sup> response evoked by a 5 Hz VTA stimulation was not affected by the D1 or D2 antagonist (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). However, this short Ca<sup>2+</sup> response was reduced by NMDA and AMPA antagonists (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). In the VTA, up to 65% of the neurons are dopaminergic and the others are GABAergic or glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib16\">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Gorelova et al., 2012</a>), and some DA neurons co-release glutamate (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hnasko et al., 2010</a>). However, glutamatergic terminals are dominant in the mesocortical pathway (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gorelova et al., 2012</a>). Inhibition of the short Ca<sup>2+</sup> response by glutamate receptor antagonists suggests that glutamatergic neurons contribute to the 5 Hz responses. Initial experiments implicated the D1 receptors for the long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. To exclude a potential role of glutamatergic neurons in initiating the long calcium transients, a cocktail of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists was used. However, the long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were not affected by NMDA and AMPA antagonists (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). This result further suggests that the long-sustained increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is not mediated by glutamatergic local recurrent networks. Over all, pharmacological experiments clearly suggest D1 receptors are mainly involved in the long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in PFC neurons."

Two-way repeated measures ANOVA on the temporal changes of the mean cosine similarities in each conditioning paradigm revealed significant differences in the temporal factor (<i>F</i>(3, 84) = 7.676, p = 0.0001) and the time \u00d7 condition paradigm interaction (<i>F</i>(9, 84) = 2.483, p = 0.0145; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Post hoc tests also showed that the cosine similarity in T1 was significantly increased in \u20182 hr after\u2019 compared with \u2018before\u2019 (Ryan's test, p &lt; 0.01; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This increase in cosine similarity in T1 conditioning is not simply due to an increased number of high dF/F neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), because \u20181 hr after\u2019 in T1 conditioning had a significantly increased cosine similarity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) but its population probability distribution was not significantly different from that of VTA only (2 hr after) or T2 (2 hr after) (two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, p = 0.5128 and p = 0.1418, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This suggests that the increase in cosine similarity in T1 conditioning was not due to an increased number of high dF/F neurons. In addition, the increased cosine similarity was not due to increased reliability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occurrence in response to three repetitive V2L stimulations, because the reliability calculated by Cronbach's alpha did not change between \u2018before\u2019 and \u20182 hr after\u2019 in any of the conditioning groups, including T1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results indicate that only T1 conditioning improved the pattern similarity in PFC neurons, and the increase in pattern similarity could be the result of circuit (network) modification, and not simply the result of increased reliability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occurrence or an increased number of high responding dF/F neurons."

By increasing both dF/F and pattern similarity, DA input may enhance PFC activity and establish cortical representation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Xue et al., 2010</a>). In fact, it is known that DA release plays a major role in dynamic cortical remodeling in the auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2001</a>), suggesting that the phenomenon observed here in the T1 conditioning paradigm may represent the neurophysiological basis for dynamic neural events. Besides network modification in PFC, it has also been demonstrated that PFC neurons show long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that depend on the D1 receptor pathway. This newly identified physiological phenomenon might have an important function in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of neuronal processes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berridge, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brenowitz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Roussel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bardo et al., 2006</a>). For example, association learning is only successful if the cue signal is less than 20\u201330 s before the reward signal. Long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients may be tightly associated with this time window in association learning. Taken together, the long-lasting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients reported here could be a key phenomenon required to explain the dynamics of the dopaminergic neural network and its role in PFC cognitive functions."

To remove motion artifacts from in vivo calcium imaging, the ImageJ plugin TurboReg for image alignment (<a href=\"#bib27\">Th\u00e9venaz et al., 1998</a>) was used. Individual cells were semi-automatically detected (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). SR101-stained astrocytes were excluded from data analysis. For each cell, fluorescence change was defined as dF/F = (F1 \u2212 F0)/F0, where F1 is fluorescence at any time point, and F0 is the baseline fluorescence, defined as the median of fluorescence values measured within 40 s before and after the time point of F1 (for responses to VTA stimulation), or within 2.5 s before and after the time point of F1 (for responses to V2L stimulation). To calculate the decay time constant (tau) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>), the following equation was used for fitting the time course of dF/F during the decay period: dF/F(t) = dF/F<sub>max</sub> \u00d7 e<sup>\u2212t/tau</sup>, where dF/F<sub>max</sub> is the peak dF/F value and t is elapsed time after dF/F peaks. To calculate the population average of dF/F shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the averages across cells from the three V2L stimulations were averaged. Pattern similarity in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> was measured using cosine similarity (cosine of the angle between two vectors) in each pair of vectors, which are composed of the N-dimension of dF/F values of each neuronal response, where N is the total number of neurons. For the three repetitions of V2L stimulation at each time point, three cosine similarities were measured between the first and second, second and third, and first and third V2L stimulations, and then these three cosine similarities were averaged to show the pattern similarity of the time points. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, the result of post hoc tests revealed that dF/F values were significantly different in many of the comparisons between the time points in each conditioning paradigm (Ryan's test, p &lt; 0.05). In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, to simplify, the values of dF/F at 2 hr after conditioning were compared, and standardized by subtracting the \u2018before\u2019 values from \u20182 hr after\u2019 among the different conditioning groups (dF/F<sub>(2 hr\u2212before)</sub>)."

The author reported long-lasting (\u223c30sec) calcium transients in the PFC evoked by high-frequency electrical stimulation of the VTA, which depends on D1 receptors. In addition, the author showed that simultaneous activation of the VTA and V2L can cause long-term (\u223c2h) increases of calcium transients in the PFC to V2L inputs. This study is interesting and novel both in its approach and findings, and should make a significant contribution to the field. Several issues need to be addressed before publication."

First, overall this is true for the VTA but the mesocortical projection which is what is being studied, is mainly glutamatergic not DAergic (See papers by Morales or Gorelova).
