Here we report that viewing the delivery of food to an unvisited portion of an environment leads to off-line pre-activation of place cells sequences corresponding to that space. Such \u2018<i>preplay</i>\u2019 was not observed for an unrewarded but otherwise similar portion of the environment. These results suggest that a hippocampal representation of a visible, yet unexplored environment can be formed if the environment is of motivational relevance to the animal. We hypothesise such goal-biased preplay may support preparation for future experiences in novel environments."

Here we report that viewing the delivery of food to an unvisited portion of an environment leads to off-line pre-activation of place cells sequences corresponding to that space. Such \u2018<i>preplay</i>\u2019 was not observed for an unrewarded but otherwise similar portion of the environment. These results suggest that a hippocampal representation of a visible, yet unexplored environment can be formed if the environment is of motivational relevance to the animal. We hypothesise such goal-biased preplay may support preparation for future experiences in novel environments."

When the animal is in one location, a few neurons called \u2018place cells\u2019 will fire. If the animal moves to a new spot, other place cells fire instead. Each time the animal returns to that spot, the same place cells will fire. Thus, as the animal moves, a place-specific pattern of firing emerges that scientists can view by recording the cells' activity and which can be used to reconstruct the animal's position."

In the experiments, rats were allowed to run up to the junction in a T-shaped track. The animals could see into each of the arms, but not enter them. Food was then placed in one of the inaccessible arms. \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, Barry et al. recorded the firing of place cells in the brain of the animals when they were on the track and during a rest period afterwards. The rats were then allowed onto the inaccessible arms, and again their brain activity was recorded."

However, the place cell pattern that would become the mental map of the other inaccessible arm was not activated before the rat explored that area. Therefore, \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, Barry et al. suggest that the perception of reward influences which place cell pattern is simulated during rest. An implication of these findings is that the brain preferentially simulates past or future experiences that are deemed to be functionally significant, such as those associated with reward. A future challenge will be to determine whether this goal-related simulation of unvisited spaces predicts and is needed for behaviour such as successful navigation to a goal."

To this end, we recorded from ensembles of place cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</a>) (4 rats, 37\u201366 place cells each, 212 cells in total) while rats ran along a T-shaped track (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) with visible yet inaccessible arms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)\u2014RUN1. One arm (counter balanced between animals) was subsequently cued with food while the animal remained on the track\u2014GOAL-CUE. During a rest period before RUN1 (REST1) and after GOAL-CUE (REST2), spiking events\u2014periods of 300 ms or less, where at least 15% of cells were active (<a href=\"#bib18\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>)\u2014were analysed. These spiking events were associated with significantly higher power in the ripple spectrum (80\u2013250 Hz) than other comparable periods (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To investigate whether paths on the cued and uncued arms were preplayed we assessed the match between the order in which cells fired during spiking events and during future runs on the arms (RUN2, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Specifically, we computed the rank-order correlations between spiking events and sequences of place cells active on the arms, referred to as templates (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Preplay events were identified as those with either a significant positive or negative correlation\u2014a two-tailed test, each tail tested at the 97.5% level. These preplay events were found to exhibit higher power in the ripple spectrum than non-significant spiking events (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To establish significance at the population level, the proportion of preplay events measured was compared to a null distribution generated by calculating correlations between place cell templates and shuffled sequences from events (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>)."

In contrast, prior to goal-cueing, two animals spent more time on the uncued side of the stem (mean bias = 0.10, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for results for individual animals). Moreover, during GOAL-CUE all animals also spent more time looking towards the cued arm than the uncued arm (mean bias = 0.13), again this bias was not observed prior to goal-cueing when only one animal spent more time looking towards the cued arm (mean bias = \u22120.11, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for results of individual animals). Furthermore, during RUN2 when the barrier was first removed and the food cue was no longer present, all four animals initially turned towards the cued arm and spent more time on the cued rather than the uncued arm (mean bias = 0.96, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for results for individual animals)."

Conversely, the uncued arm was not significantly preplayed (4.41% preplay events p = 0.33, vs cued arm: p &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). Similarly significant effects were found when animals were analysed individually (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), although the results for one animal were based on a relatively small sample (number of cued preplay events = 9, R1838), it still showed significant preplay of the cued arm. Moreover, the results were corroborated by a distribution-based analysis; namely, comparing the area under the curve (AUC) of bootstrapped cumulative distributions of absolute correlations for each arm to that of their shuffle distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, cued: p &lt; 0.001, uncued: p = 0.22, cued vs uncued: p = 0.0044, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Preplay events of the cued arm were equally likely to represent paths <i>to</i> and <i>from</i> the cued arm (7.34% vs 7.40% p = 0.49) and to run towards (\u2018forward\u2019) and away (\u2018reverse\u2019) from the ends of the arms (6.93% vs 7.80%, p = 0.18, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Moreover, the amount of preplay exhibited by each animal appeared to be predicted by the interest they displayed for the cued arm during GOAL-CUE (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Importantly, preferential preplay of the cued arm could not be explained by differences in the number of cells with fields on the arms (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>), spike-sorting quality (cells with neighbouring place fields were as well separated in cluster-space as those with distant fields, p = 0.45, 2-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), place field stability on the two arms (cued arm stability r = 0.54 vs uncued arm stability r = 0.49, p = 0.15) or the location of place fields on the cued arm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, p = 0.22 two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test). In sum, we found during rest after goal-cueing, significant and preferential preplay of an unvisited and motivationally relevant portion of the environment."

If so, there should be a greater number of significant pre-play events in REST2 compared to REST1 which was recorded before animals had visited or seen any part of the environment. Preplay of the cued arm was higher in REST2 than REST1 (7.37% vs 4.74%, p &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>), an effect that was seen for all animals (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Indeed, the cued arm was not significantly preplayed during REST1 (4.74%, p = 0.34). Again, the result was corroborated using an AUC analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, we find preplay only occurs during rest periods recorded after goal-cueing. However, it is possible that the frequency of preplay might decrease as a function of the temporal gap between rest and behaviour. As such our failure to detect preplay in REST1 might be due to the greater delay between REST1 and RUN2 than between REST2 and RUN2. To address this we analysed preplay of the stem (i.e., RUN1) during REST1. We did not find preplay of the stem (4.12% preplay events, p = 0.44, AUC analysis p = 0.053, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, RUN1 REST1 vs cued REST2: p &lt; 0.001). Consequently, these results imply that the preplay of the unvisited, yet visible, environment we observed in REST2 was driven by behavioural cueing of that environment."

Plausibly preplay might be initiated immediately when the cued arm is baited (start of GOAL-CUE) and simply persist into the subsequent REST2 period, alternatively the bias may only arise during rest. Due to the short duration of the goal-cueing period (\u223c10 min) a relatively small number of spiking events were recorded for the two arms during this period (172 and 170 for the cued and uncued arm respectively). However, based on a bootstrapped comparison of the AUC for absolute correlations from the cued and uncued arm vs shuffled distributions, we found that the cued but not the uncued arm was preplayed (p = 0.02, p = 0.24 respectively, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A direct comparison of the proportion of preplay events for the cued vs uncued arm was marginally not significant (6.4% vs 4.12%, p = 0.052, see <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a> for results for individual animals). Finally, to validate the results from this smaller dataset we carried out a further, more inclusive, analysis. Specifically, we tracked the temporal evolution of the bias in preplay by comparing the activity of cells from the cued and uncued arms at different points during the experiment. For every spiking event we computed the mean rate for cells that would subsequently have fields on the cued arm compared to those with fields on the uncued arm. During REST1 and RUN1 the future cued and uncued arm cells did not differ in activity, this was true for both the first and second half of these periods (mean cued/uncued rate ratio: REST1 early ratio = 0.96, p = 0.88, REST1 late ratio = 1.04 p = 0.09, RUN1 early ratio = 1.09 p = 0.32, RUN1 late ratio = 1.18 p = 0.22, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). However, during GOAL-CUE cued arm cells were significantly more active than uncued arm cells, an effect that was most pronounced during the first half (5 min) of the cueing period (GOAL-CUE early ratio = 1.78, p = 0.01, late = 1.46, p &lt; 0.01). Finally, the difference between the two groups persisted through the subsequent rest period, albeit attenuating with time (REST2 early ratio = 1.30 p &lt; 0.001, REST2 late ratio = 1.10 p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Importantly, control analyses showed that the bias in sequential preplay is not a mere product of differing activity levels of the cells for the two arms (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013D</a>). Together, these findings indicate that biased pre-activation of future experiences is instantiated at the point when an environment becomes motivationally-relevant."

In contrast to the rank-order method, which utilised only the first spike emitted by each cell, the Bayesian decoding approach used all spikes emitted during an event. The Bayesian decoding approach uses the spiking activity of all simultaneously recorded place cells to calculate the posterior probability of an animal being at any position in the environment, based on a Poisson spiking framework. (See Materials and methods; R1838 was excluded from this analysis due to low cell yield). The Bayesian decoder performed equally well on the cued and uncued arms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, median error for both arms = 10.0 cm). Next, we applied the Bayesian decoding to spiking events during the rest sessions. First, we calculated the posterior probabilities for 5 ms non-overlapping bins, which generated a posterior probability matrix for each event (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). A spiking event that reflects a constant speed run through the environment will show an increased posterior along a line in the decoded posterior matrix. Therefore, for each spiking event we fit a line that accounted for the maximum variance and calculated its goodness of fit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). To assess if that event represented a significant preplay event: we generated 1000 posterior probability matrices by shuffling the identities of cells included in the event, fit lines on all matrices, and calculated their goodness of fits. Events whose goodness of fits exceeded the 95th percentile of the shuffled distributions were labelled as preplay events. Again, during REST2, we found preplay of the cued arm (7.64% of events, p &lt; 0.001, binomial test) but not of the uncued arm (4.78% of events, p = 0.55, vs cued = p &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Moreover, neither the cued nor the uncued arm were significantly preplayed in REST1 (cued = 5.04%, p = 0.43, uncued = 4.69%, p = 0.55, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Thus, this alternative, more powerful, analysis replicates the exact same pattern of results as demonstrated by our main analysis; indicating that goal-triggered pre-activation of future place cell sequences is a robust and reliable phenomenon."

Moreover, these findings agree with previous studies showing <i>replay</i> can be modulated by reward (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheng and Frank, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Singer and Frank, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>) but extend this modulatory influence to preplay of future, goal-oriented routes. In our data, sequences of place cells leading <i>to</i> and <i>away</i> from the goal were preplayed with similar frequency and occurred in both forward and reverse directions (i.e., positive and negative correlations). Replay of sequences leading towards goal locations has previously been linked with the planning of future trajectories (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>). Plausibly the elevated proportion of preplay events we observed leading to the cued goal might also reflect route planning\u2014especially given the animals' subsequent preference for the cued arm. However, preplay of sequences leading from the cued goal towards the stem are less easily explained. On one hand it is possible that these sequences simply reflect planning for a return trip to the familiarity of the stem after retrieval of the food. However, reverse replay has often been characterised as a solution to the temporal credit assignment problem (<a href=\"#bib18\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Foster and Knierim, 2012</a>)\u2014providing a learning mechanism to evaluate a sequence of actions that led to a successful outcome. In the context of preplay, when the cued arm has not been physically visited, an intriguing possibility is that paths towards the goal might be simulated using forwards preplay then evaluated and learnt from during reverse preplay, in a manner similar to that proposed to exist for periods of exploration and post-exploration rest (<a href=\"#bib18\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Buhry et al., 2011</a>)."

We did not observe de novo preplay in the current experiment (no preplay of stem during REST1). Although the origin of this discrepancy is unclear, we note that several other studies also do not find de novo preplay for a completely novel environment (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>). However, it seems likely that other environmental factors present here but absent in the do novo preplay studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2014</a>), such as the barrier, and visible but inaccessible arms, might have ameliorated this phenomenon. Indeed, the AUC analysis comparing spiking events recorded during REST1 against the stem template (RUN1, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) was narrowly not significant (p = 0.053), suggesting that perhaps with more data or a simpler environment we might have found de novo preplay for the stem. In a similar vein one might also have expected to observe a background rate of de novo preplay for the uncued arm during REST2. Again it seems possible that the complexity of the environment worked against such an effect in that the motivationally relevant cued arm was preplayed at the expense of the uncued arm. What remains to be understood is if this bias reflects an active process, simulating trajectories associated with the goal, or if the relevance of the cued arm simply allows it to more effectively capture preconfigured cell assemblies."

Furthermore, although our data does not provide direct support for de novo preplay it also does not argue against it, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the hippocampus supports the construction of novel spatial experiences as suggested by other authors (for example see <a href=\"#bib14\">Dragoi and Tonegawa (2014)</a>). These results are consistent with the notion that place cells form preconfigured assemblies or \u2018charts\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib25\">McNaughton et al., 1996</a>)\u2014an active but unassigned chart being associated with the cued arm during GOAL-CUE, but do not preclude the possibility that place cell firing is driven in a feed-forward manner (e.g., <a href=\"#bib20\">Hartley et al., 2000</a>). We conclude that these findings support the hypothesised role of preplay for preparation for future experiences (<a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Erdem and Hasselmo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Foster and Knierim, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>) but extend it to simulating future experiences in environments yet to be actively explored. It remains to be seen if the ability of the hippocampus to construct future spatial sequences is related to the generation of more abstract temporal associations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kraus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2014</a>)."

Prior to ratemap generation, the last 20 cm (10%) of each arm were removed to exclude areas where the animal groomed, ate etc. Similarly, to avoid non-perambulatory behaviours, position samples where the animal's speed was lower than 3 cm/s were excluded. Animals' paths were linearised and dwell time and spikes binned into 1 cm bins, then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (\u03c3 = 2 cm). Firing rate was calculated for each bin by dividing spike number by dwell time. Templates were generated based on the location of the peak firing rate of each cell (if a cell had more than one place field, the field with the highest firing rate was used). Specifically, four templates were generated, two for each arm\u2014one for runs commencing at the start of the arm (i.e., adjacent to the stem) and concluding at the far end of the arm (TO cued/uncued arm) and vice versa (FROM cued/uncued arm). These templates we refer to as Up Cued Arm (UCA), Down Cued Arm (DCA), Up Uncued Arm (UUA) and Down Uncued Arm (DUA). For example, the Up Cued Arm (UCA) template enumerates the order in which the peaks of firing fields appear on the cued arm for runs towards the end of the arm. So, if cells with IDs 3, 20 and 7 were the first three to have peaks on that arm the UCA template would start 3, 20, 7. Cells whose peak firing rate in the linearised ratemap were below 0.5 Hz, had less than five contiguous bins with rates above the mean firing rate of the cell, or whose spatial correlation between the first and second half of the RUN2 session was less than 0.3 were excluded."

If a single cell fired more than one spike within this period, the first spike was counted and other spikes disregarded. The extent to which templates were represented in the spiking events was assessed using template-matching (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>). Specifically, the temporal sequence of cells in spiking events and the order of their corresponding peaks in the template was compared. If future template sequences are preplayed in rest the order in which cells fire during spiking events would be expected to resemble the order in which they fire on the track. In other words, one would expect the spike sequence in events and in future template sequence to be more correlated than predicted by chance. To determine if each template was being significantly preplayed we compared the proportion of spiking events that individually correlated with that template with the proportion expected by chance (as predicted by a shuffling procedure). Specifically, the Spearman's rank-order correlations between each spiking event and the current template was computed and the number yielding significant correlations (based on a two-tailed test, each tail tested at the 97.5% level) was recorded; these were labelled preplay events. Both positive as well as negative significant correlations were categorised as preplay events, as previous studies have reported that replay can reactivate a place cell sequence in the forward or reverse order (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>). Next, the sequence of spikes in each event was randomly permuted (shuffled) 100 times by randomly re-assigning cell IDs such that spikes from the same cell were never separated. For each permutation the Spearman's rank-order correlation and matching p-value were calculated, again the proportion of significant correlations was recorded; this value represented the proportion of preplay events expected by chance. Finally, the proportion of shuffled events that had a significant correlation with the future template sequence was compared to the number obtained for the unshuffled data using a one sample binomial test. To assess whether the cued arm was preplayed more than the uncued arm we directly compared the total number of events and number of preplay events, again using a binomial test. A similar approach was used for comparing number of preplay events in REST1 and REST2."

Specifically, for each arm and each period, we bootstrapped the population of absolute correlations obtained between templates and spiking events 10,000 times. On each iterations we computed the difference between the AUC of the cumulative distribution of the bootstrapped data vs the AUC of the bootstrapped shuffled data correlations, which had been obtained previously. 95% confidence intervals (2.5% and 97.5% percentiles used, i.e., a two-tailed test) were determined from these difference scores and were used to assess whether the two distributions differed significantly.

Moreover, we repeated this down-sampling process a 100 times, each time removing a random set of 10 cells. We then ran the preplay analysis as before\u2014estimating the number of preplay events for each down-sampled cued and uncued template and comparing them to each other and chance levels. A similar procedure was used to equate activity rates for cued and uncued templates during the two rest periods. Namely, the distribution of events, containing different numbers of cells, were equated for the different templates. For example, if one template had 50 events with 5 cells active and another only had 40 events, we randomly removed 10 events from the former template. This process was then repeated for events of different lengths. As before the entire down sampling procedure was repeated 100 times.

This was done due to the short duration of the RUN1 and GOAL-CUE periods (\u223c10 min), which limited the power of the template-matching approach. As an alternative, we computed the mean rate of future cued and uncued arm cells during spiking events for each half of all experimental periods (i.e., REST1, RUN1, GOAL-CUE and REST2). If a cell was active on both arms we excluded it, unless the rate on one arm was at least twice as high as the rate on the other arm. To assess statistical significance of rate differences we bootstrapped the event rates for the cued and uncued arm cells 10,000 times. We then computed the mean ratio between the cued and uncued arm rates (cued/uncued) for each bootstrap, and estimated the 95% confidence interval. If the interval <i>did not</i> contain 1 then we deemed the rate difference significant."

The portion of the stem within 20 cm of the barrier was notionally divided in two long-ways to yield a cued and uncued side. Time spent on the two sides was determined based on the animals' tracked positions. Finally, to express interest in the cued arm as a single behavioural measure, the difference between the time spent on the cued vs the uncued side was divided by the total time spent on that section of the track. Thus, a value above 0 indicates that an animal spent more time on cued side than the uncued side. As an additional measure of the animals' interest in the cued arm during the goal-cueing period we assessed the amount of time animals spent looking toward the cued arm (while the animals' velocity was at least 5 cm/s, head direction was inferred by tracking a single LED which requires the animal to be moving in order to get accurate head direction estimates). Again, preference for the cued arm was expressed as a single behavioural measure by subtracting the amount of time spent with the head oriented towards the cued arm from the time spent with the head oriented towards the uncued arm and dividing by the total time spent with the head oriented towards either arm. Finally, to assess the animals' preference for the cued arm during the first lap of RUN2, the difference between the time spent on the cued arm vs the uncued arm during the first 3 s following the animals' entry onto the arms was divided by the total time spent on either arm."

There are two main analyses used to determine differences in preplay: first is a comparison of the proportion of significant preplay events. This method is sensitive to how the significance of each individual event is determined. The authors use rank correlation to compare the preplay event sequence to place cell templates in order to determine significance. The significance of each individual event should be determined by comparing to a distribution of correlations obtained by shuffling the cell order in the templates. Also, the significance value needs to be set at the p=0.025 level to control for multiple comparisons due to the two directions (Up and Down) of the run. How does this affect <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and 2E</a>? Further, rat1838 has very few events, and presents as an outlier in this analysis. For the second distribution-based analysis, the authors do not directly compare the Cued and Uncued arm r-value distributions. Also, raw distributions should be shown (not just cumulative distributions), and can be compared using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test."

Wording implying 'desired paths' may be an overstatement. The data do not speak directly to such a broad claim. It is also the case that there was as many forward and reverse sequence events detected. One might expect a preferential bias to forward event sequences if the function was representation of the unexplored path toward the reward. A strong recommendation would be to downplay the statements about constructed desired paths and also discuss the implication of reverse events being found in similar frequency, including alternative accounts like proposed by Foster and Wilson (2006)."

While the lack of preplay of the uncued arm in the current study can be attributed to biasing of preplay towards a more motivationally relevant arm, the lack of preplay of the STEM arm during REST1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>; and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) directly contradicts previous results. The previous interpretation was that pre-existing temporal firing sequences in the hippocampus (cellular assemblies based on functional connectivity) become bound to novel environments as place cell sequences. But the current results force a re-interpretation that preplay of a novel environment only occurs if it is visually observed. This needs to be explicitly addressed in the manuscript, and requires a careful re-examination of the analysis."

There is a concern that the rank correlations-based method may lead to false positive results due to other factor such as the burst propensity differences between cells. The fact that significant preplay events were seen in REST1 in one cued and another uncued arm is still hard to interpret. This may indeed show preplay as in the Dragoi studies but then why don't we see it in all animals? And why don't we see significant preplay of the uncued arms in REST2 too? Of course there is the other interpretation that significant preplay in REST1 may represent false positive detection, which may question how consistently one may see the preferential preplay of the cued arm (in REST2) if the experiments are repeated many times."

In contrast, the correlation method compare the sequence of first spike of each cell during replay, and the relative location of place field centers, and is therefore less effective when only a subset of neurons participate in the replay event. Although the authors mention that they use multiple methods to compare the preplay of the cued arm to the uncued arm, the core method still remains the same, the correlation based template matching. Based on the output of this correlation-based analysis, the authors then evaluate the results using either the comparison of the number of significant events, or the distribution of the r-values. Comparing the distributions is a more powerful evaluation, and the differences between the cued and uncued arm preplays are small. Moreover, the difference in data and shuffle distributions are also small for Cued Arm preplay in Rest 2 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). As a comparison, for previous results in de novo preplay, (Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011, Nature), which the authors mention might be a relatively more subtle phenomenon, the preplay effect was stronger based on the distribution based analysis."

Additionally, despite the smaller n for this animal, we still see a significant bias of preplay for the cued arm vs the uncued arm during REST2. This is an effect that we see both at the population level, where we consider a total of 1628 events from four animals, and also for each of those animals individually. As such the preferential preplay of the cued arm is robust and extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance. Finally, even if R1838 were notionally discounted, which is not warranted, the remaining n=3 would be comparable to previous studies published in this field (e.g. Karlsson and Frank, 2009 (n = 3), Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013, PNAS (n = 3), Diba and Buzsaki, 2007 (n = 3).

These weak effects are only present in these individual animals and are not significant when the four animals are considered together, thus we did not report them beyond inclusion in the table. That said we note that this REST1 preplay is broadly consistent with the phenomenon first reported by Dragoi and Tongewa (2011, Nature) and subsequently reported by Dragoi and Tonegawa (2013, PNAS; 2013, eLife); where de novo preplay of place cell sequences for a novel and unseen environment was found, an effect believed to be driven by preconfigured hippocampal network states. We discuss de novo preplay below in more detail, in brief though: Because de novo preplay is thought to depend upon preconfigured cell assemblies as opposed to networks shaped by direct experience, we believe it to be a more subtle phenomena than replay of a familiar environment. Furthermore, the additional complexity of the environment used in this study, which included two visible but inaccessible arms, compared to those used in studies of de novo preplay, likely ameliorated the phenomenon further. Together these effects explain why we only see de novo preplay in these two animals. Additionally, because de novo preplay occurs before experiences of an environment it is unlikely to be biased by the motivational relevance of particular sections of that environment (e.g. a baited arm). Again this suggests why we saw de novo preplay for the cued as well as uncued arm. By contrast, the main effect we report\u2014preferential preplay of the cued arm during REST2 (which occurs in all animals and only for the cued arm)\u2014is significant when compared to REST1, and is driven by experience of the environment."

Previously we had believed that too few events were emitted during the short GOAL-CUE session to support a robust analysis. However, following the reviewers\u2019 suggestion we analysed events recorded during GOAL-CUE while animals were at the end of the stem closest to the arms and were immobile or moving slowly (&lt;10 cm/s). Although the number of events detected (172 events) was far fewer than during REST2 (1628) we still find significant preplay of the cued arm but not of the uncued arm: area under the curve (AUC) of the cumulative distribution of absolute correlations for spiking events for the cued arm is significantly smaller than that of the shuffled distribution (p = 0.02) but not for the uncued data (p = 0.24). Similarly a direct comparison of the proportion of preplay events emitted for the cued and uncued arm was close to significance (6.4% vs 4.12%, p = 0.052; see Table 4 for results for individual animals). These new analyses support and extend our existing results for the GOAL-CUE period, in which we showed an increased activity of cells with fields on the cued arm relative to cells with fields on the uncued arm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus, three different methods for analysing the GOAL-CUE period all indicate that preferential preplay of the motivationally relevant, cued arm was instantiated by the cueing. We agree with the reviewers that \u2018in this case the claim could be related to preplay in the run session\u2019 and have updated the manuscript and figures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) accordingly. Based on the clarifications and all the new analyses, we feel our claim that there is higher preplay of the cued arm is well justified.

This test is appropriate because both forwards (positive correlation) and reverse (negative correlation) sequences are valid preplay events. Moreover, the reviewers highlight an important statistical concern, relating to the need to use a more stringent significance threshold if one conducts multiple comparisons on the same data (in this instance the reviewer is referring to the templates for UP and DOWN paths on the arms). However, we would like to clarify, the cells and the order in which they appear differs for the templates for the different running directions (i.e. the sequence of place cells for runs in the two directions are different and distinct, mean Spearman rank order correlation between UP and DOWN cued templates r = 0.05). Consequently, we tested across these with a set threshold of p &lt; 0.025 for each tail.

For example, that the bursting dynamics seen in online running will be present in preceding periods of offline preplay. That said, when applied to our data, both approaches reveal the same main effects: in REST2 the cued arm is exclusively preplayed, an effect that is not present in REST1. Furthermore, under the Bayesian analysis, none of the animals individually exhibited significant preplay for either the cued or uncued arm during REST1. Similarly, none exhibited preplay of the uncued arm in REST2. These additional details are completely consistent with the interpretation we had previously placed on our data: that we did not see preplay as reported by Dragoi et al in REST1 because of the complexity of our apparatus and that in REST2 preplay was \u2018captured\u2019 by the cued arm such that preplay of the uncued arm was not seen."

Although the authors mention that they use multiple methods to compare the preplay of the cued arm to the uncued arm, the core method still remains the same, the correlation based template matching. Based on the output of this correlation-based analysis, the authors then evaluate the results using either the comparison of the number of significant events, or the distribution of the r-values.

As stated above, we agree that a Bayesian decoding approach is a powerful tool to complement our existing rank-order analyses. However, as highlighted by this reviewer, it does require a larger number of place cells to be held in parallel in order to generate robust results. Accordingly, as suggested, we applied Bayesian decoding to the spiking events recorded during REST1 and REST2 for the 3 animals with the highest cell yield (R1838 excluded). First, to confirm the validity of the approach and its correct implementation, we applied the same Bayesian framework to online track running (RUN2). The algorithm accurately estimated position (mean cued arm error = 10.0 cm, mean uncued arm error = 10.0 cm, for 1 cm spatial bins, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Subsequently, to score preplay events, we applied a line fitting algorithm and flagged preplay events as those exceeding the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of their own null distribution generated by shuffling the cell identities (following Davidson et al. 2009, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Results from the Bayesian approach were as follows. In REST2 we found significantly more preplay events for the cued arm compared to the uncued arm (Cued = 7.64%, p &lt; 0.001, Uncued = 4.78%, p &lt; 0.55, Cued vs. Uncued, p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, during REST1 neither arm exhibit preplay (Cued = 5.04%, p = 0.43, Uncued = 4.69%, p = 0.55, Cued vs. Uncued, p = 0.30, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure4E, F</a>). Finally the cued arm exhibited significantly elevated preplay in REST2 vs. REST1 (p &lt; 0.001). These results exactly match those obtained with the rank-order analysis described in the earlier version of our manuscript, strongly reinforcing our previous conclusions that during rest the hippocampus preplays reward-related sequences."
