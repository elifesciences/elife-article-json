Monomeric structures of crenactin and actin are similar, although their filament architectures were suggested to be different. Here we report that crenactin forms <i>bona fide</i> double helical filaments that show exceptional similarity to eukaryotic F-actin. With cryo-electron microscopy and helical reconstruction we solved the structure of the crenactin filament to 3.8 \u00c5 resolution. When forming double filaments, the 'hydrophobic plug' loop in crenactin rearranges. Arcadin-2, also encoded by the arcade gene cluster, binds tightly with its C-terminus to the hydrophobic groove of crenactin. Binding is reminiscent of eukaryotic actin modulators such as cofilin and thymosin \u03b24 and arcadin-2 is a depolymeriser of crenactin filaments. Our work further supports the theory of shared ancestry of Eukaryotes and Crenarchaea."

Arcadin-2, also encoded by the arcade gene cluster, binds tightly with its C-terminus to the hydrophobic groove of crenactin. Binding is reminiscent of eukaryotic actin modulators such as cofilin and thymosin \u03b24 and arcadin-2 is a depolymeriser of crenactin filaments. Our work further supports the theory of shared ancestry of Eukaryotes and Crenarchaea."

However, largely due to different contacts between strands, actin-like proteins evolved a wide variety of filament architectures. While actin forms right-handed, parallel and staggered filaments in all Eukaryotes (F-actin) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holmes et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">von der Ecken et al., 2015</a>), actin-like proteins differ in their filament architectures: MamK, required for magnetosome alignment in magnetotactic bacteria, forms right-handed filaments that have juxtaposed, non-staggered subunits (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergeron et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">L\u00f6we et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ozyamak et al., 2013a</a>). ParM, making mitosis-like bipolar spindles during <i>E. coli</i> R1 plasmid segregation, produces left-handed, staggered filaments (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bharat et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gayathri et al., 2012</a>). MreB, essential for cell-shape maintenance in most rod-shaped bacteria, forms the most divergent filaments when compared to F-actin, as it forms apolar, non-staggered and non-helical filaments that bind directly to membranes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Salje et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van den Ent et al., 2014</a>). The selective advantages that led to this diversity are not clear and will require deciphering the precise molecular mechanisms of the processes these filaments engage in."

In order to avoid over-fitting through the presence of very similar overlapping filament segments in the two half datasets, segments were divided into half sets at the filament level. The spherical mask used covered the central 30% volume of the reconstructed map. The mask was softened at the edges with an 8 pixel raised cosine edge. The red curve describes the FSC of a map generated from the refined filament model (six central crenactin subunits) against the postprocessed map (both half maps averaged), cut around the model, but not low-pass filtered. Using the suggested resolution estimates at FSC 0.5 for the model and FSC 0.143 for the two half maps against each other (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>), very similar values of 3.8 \u00c5 were obtained."

A total of 1474 micrographs showing long and highly contrasted filaments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) were collected under low-dose conditions with dose fractionation. From these we extracted 470,396 helical segments and performed reference-free 2D class averaging in RELION 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Scheres, 2012</a>). The resulting classes showed a very regular pattern that was much more similar to the calculated re-projection of double-stranded F-actin (<a href=\"#bib48\">von der Ecken et al., 2015</a>) than to that of single-stranded crenactin filaments from crystallography (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Izor\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lind\u00e5s et al., 2014</a>). To eliminate any bias from enforcing double helical symmetry during reconstruction in RELION (using an implementation of iterative helical real space reconstruction, IHRSR) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Egelman, 2007</a>), we reconstructed the data into 3D using two different procedures. The first reconstruction was calculated using a double-stranded filament as the initial model and with symmetry that averages the two strands together (twist: 198.1\u00b0 [equivalent to \u2212161.9\u00b0], rise: 25.6\u2009\u00c5), whereas the second reconstruction was performed with a single-stranded initial model and helical parameters that symmetrise along one strand only, not averaging the two strands (twist: 36.2\u00b0, rise: 51.3\u2009\u00c5). This way, if the imaged filaments had been single-stranded, then the two reconstructions would have produced different results, one potentially double-stranded (and poor) and one single-stranded. We found that both reconstructions generated very similar double-helical density maps, the one with lower symmetry at slightly lower resolution, as would be expected (3.8\u2009\u00c5 vs 4.2\u2009\u00c5) because of the smaller number of asymmetric units averaged (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), thus unequivocally demonstrating the double-stranded nature of the crenactin filaments."

In crenactin, this loop is longer and encompasses residues 292 to 326 (34 residues) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Izor\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>).

In this new position, the loop interacts extensively with subunits of the opposite strand (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), essentially the same function as the hydrophobic plug has in F-actin. As in F-actin, most of these lateral interactions are of hydrophilic nature in contrast to its name (<a href=\"#bib48\">von der Ecken et al., 2015</a>). In addition to the hydrophobic plug, a hydrophilic interaction between subdomain IIB on one strand and subdomain IA on the opposite strand helps to keep the double filament architecture stable (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Based on the mostly hydrophilic nature of the inter-strand interactions, we believe it is possible that the single-stranded filaments imaged in previous studies were enabled by the high-salt concentrations used (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2015</a>)."

Particularly significant is the well-conserved D-loop (DNase I binding loop) located within subdomain IB. Folded into a small alpha helix, it interacts with the previous subunit via a surface usually referred to as the 'hydrophobic groove' in actin (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dominguez, 2004</a>)."

The similarity in actin and crenactin helical parameters is striking, with only a difference of ~2\u2009\u00c5 in rise and ~4.5\u00b0 in twist (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Furthermore, the ATPase active site is also highly conserved with key residues, such as the nucleophilic water activator Q164 (Q137 in actin) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Iwasa et al., 2008</a>), in the same place in both structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Because crenactin non-polymerising mutants (V339K and E340K) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Izor\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>) were resistant to crystallographic studies, we compared crenactin with one intra-strand contact (hydrophobic groove interacting with subdomain IB/D-loop) impaired by the presence of the arcadin-2 C-terminal peptide (see below) with a crenactin subunit from the double-helical filaments. As has been reported for many actins and actin-like proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fujii et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gayathri et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van den Ent et al., 2014</a>), ATP binding, and more importantly polymerisation, induce inter-domain angle conformational changes, closing the groove between domains IB and IIB and removing a propeller twist of domains I and II against each other upon polymerisation. We also observed this change for crenactin. The rotation flattens the molecule in the polymer, removing the propeller twist between domains I and II (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). This motion is conserved in both eukaryotic actin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fujii et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">von der Ecken et al., 2015</a>) and its prokaryotic homologues MreB (<a href=\"#bib47\">van den Ent et al., 2014</a>) and ParM (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gayathri et al., 2012</a>) and is most likely a pre-requisite of ATPase switching upon longitudinal polymerisation for the entire actin-like protein family."

We investigated the effects of arcadin-2 on crenactin filament assembly by using 90\u00b0 light scattering. Addition of ATP to crenactin resulted in an increase of scattering, most likely because of the formation of filaments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Subsequent addition of arcadin-2 resulted in rapid depolymerisation of the polymers as scattering diminished. Addition of a C-terminally truncated version of arcadin-2 had no effect, suggesting that the conserved C-terminal \u03b1-helix of arcadin-2 was responsible for the depolymerisation of crenactin filaments. To test this, we performed the same experiment using a peptide spanning the last 17 amino acids of arcadin-2 (187\u2013203). Indeed, the peptide triggered depolymerisation of the filaments at a similar rate as full-length arcadin-2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This effect was confirmed by analytical ultra centrifugation, showing that crenactin becomes monomeric upon addition of the C-terminal arcadin-2 peptide (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We conclude that crenactin polymerisation is controlled by arcadin-2 and that arcadin-2's C-terminal helix is essential for this activity."

To gain a better understanding of this interaction, how it triggers depolymerisation and how this might be related to F-actin depolymerisation, we solved the crystal structure of crenactin in complex with arcadin-2 C-terminal peptide. The structure was solved to 1.6\u2009\u00c5 by X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) providing detailed insights into crenactin, binding to ATP and, more importantly, showing how arcadin-2 induced depolymerisation of the filaments. The arcadin-2 peptide was located in the hydrophobic groove on crenactin, a cavity formed between subdomains IA and IIA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dominguez, 2004</a>). In the filament, this hydrophobic groove is occupied by the D-loop of the following subunit in a strand, forming one half of the longitudinal contact (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The nanomolar interaction between arcadin-2 peptide and the hydrophobic pocket is likely due to a tryptophan and other hydrophobic residues, making strong contacts as shown in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>. Additional SPR experiments showed that arcadin-2 C-terminal residues formed the only interacting domain with crenactin (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). Given the high affinity of arcadin-2 for crenactin we propose that arcadin-2 disrupts crenactin filaments by competing with the D-loop for the hydrophobic groove."

Proteins binding to the hydrophobic groove of actin facilitate a variety of functions depending on additional interactions and their affinity, but it seems to us that the high affinity of arcadin-2 and its strong bulk depolymerisation activity makes it a possible functional homologue of actin sequesters such as thymosin \u03b24."

The Vitrobot chamber temperature was set to 4\u00b0C and humidity to 100%. Micrographs of crenactin filaments were collected with an FEI Tecnai G2 Polara microscope operating at 300 kV. Data were acquired on a Falcon III direct electron detector protoype at a calibrated pixel size of 1.34\u2009\u00c5 and a total dose of 40 e-/A\u030a<sup>2</sup> using the automated acquisition software EPU (FEI). Images were collected at 0.8 to 3.0 \u00b5m underfocus and dose-fractionated into 46 movie frames (30 fps). All image processing and helical reconstructions were done using RELION 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Scheres, 2012</a>) that implements single particle real-space helical reconstruction IHRSR (<a href=\"#bib14\">Egelman, 2007</a>). Briefly, this implementation performs single-particle-like processing of helical assemblies in an empirical Bayesian framework, where a marginalised likelihood function is complemented with a prior on the reconstruction that effectively dampens high spatial-frequency terms in the absence of experimental data. A total of 1474 micrographs were collected and drift-corrected using MOTIONCORR (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2013</a>). The contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated by GCTF (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang, 2016</a>). Filament segments were first manually picked on several micrographs, extracted as square boxes of 280 pixels and classified using reference free 2D classification. A subset of six 2D class averages representative of the different filament orientations were low-pass filtered to 20\u2009\u00c5 and used as references to automatically pick the entire dataset with overlapping helical segments 25\u2009\u00c5 apart in 280 pixel boxes. Autopicking accuracy was increased by identifying filaments and their directions and also their bending in RELION. Helical segments were split into two half datasets for gold standard FSC determination by keeping segments from each filament in one of the two half sets, avoiding over-fitting through comparing the same parts of images because of the picking of overlapping segments. After removing bad segments, 470,396 segments remained and were entered into 3D auto-refinement using 30\u2009\u00c5 low-pass filtered initial models, generated from the approximated symmetry of crenactin double filaments or single filaments and crenactin's monomer structure (<a href=\"#bib25\">Izor\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). Beam-induced drift was subsequently corrected for per particle and frame-based dose weighting was applied (<a href=\"#bib42\">Scheres, 2014</a>), leading to particles with increased signal to noise ratio since the final reconstruction and postprocessing produced the highest resolution map at 3.8\u2009\u00c5, as assessed by the gold standard FSC procedure implemented in RELION (0.143 FSC criterion, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>). Postprocessing used a mask covering the central 30% of the map, surrounded with an eight-pixel wide soft raised cosine edge. The FSC procedure was modified such that the two half sets contained particles from complete filaments, each, avoiding over-fitting through the use of very similar particles in the two half sets generated from overlapping filament segments. The electrostatic potential density map was visualised in UCSF Chimera (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goddard et al., 2007</a>) and a model for the double filament consisting of six monomers in two strands (three each) was built by placing crenactin monomers (PDB ID 4CJ7) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Izor\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>) in the density map by molecular replacement with PHASER using phased translation functions (<a href=\"#bib31\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) and the model was manually adjusted and corrected with MAIN (<a href=\"#bib46\">Turk, 2013</a>). Refinement of the model was carried out against density cut out around 6 central monomers as implemented in REFMAC (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 2015</a>). REFMAC, PHENIX.refine in real-space mode (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>) and manual building in MAIN (<a href=\"#bib46\">Turk, 2013</a>) were cycled until the best fit of the model into the original density map was achieved. For statistics of refinement please refer to\u00a0<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> also shows the FSC curve (red) of the refined atomic model against the post processed map cut around the six monomers of the model and not low-pass filtered. An FSC criterion of 0.5 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>) yielded the same resolution of 3.8\u2009\u00c5, together with the reciprocal space R-factor (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) demonstrating the overall correctness of the model.

Sample volumes of 110 \u00b5L with protein concentrations of 49.8, 99.5 and 199 \u00b5M were loaded in 12\u2009mm 6-sector cells and centrifuged at 7800, 11800, and 15,000\u2009rpm until equilibrium was reached at 20\u02daC. At each speed, comparison of several scans was used to judge whether or not equilibrium had been reached. Buffer conditions were in 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA. Data were processed and analysed using UltraSpin software (<a href=\"http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/dbv/ultraspin2/\">http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/dbv/ultraspin2/</a>) and SEDPHAT (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schuck, 2003</a>). Velocity sedimentation of samples of 2 \u00b5M crenactin in the absence and presence of 2 \u00b5M arcadin-2 C-terminal peptide was carried out at 50,000\u2009rpm at 20\u02daC in PBS using 12\u2009mm double sector cells in an An50Ti rotor. The sedimentation coefficient distribution function, c(s), was analysed using the SEDFIT program, version 14.0 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schuck, 2003</a>). The partial-specific volumes (v-bar), solvent density and viscosity were calculated using SEDNTERP (personal communication, Thomas Laue, University of New Hampshire, USA). Data were plotted with the program GUSSI (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brautigam, 2015</a>)."

The structure is remarkable, and has increased interest due to a previous report that detailed a single-stranded architecture for the crenactin filament.

However, very high salt conditions (close to 1M) are routinely used as a step in actin purification to remove binding proteins from F-actin while the filament stays intact. Since the intra- and interfilament interactions are similar in crenactin and actin, high salt concentrations should not affect the filament structure. If the salt concentration does have such a strong effect on the crenactin filaments, this is an important finding that should be buttressed, e.g. by a structure of the high-salt filaments in negative stain."

In the absence of a paper describing helical refinement in Relion, the protocol should be explained at least briefly in the Methods. In particular, the authors segmented their filaments with a distance of 25 \u00c5. Normally, this distance is chosen to be longer that the helix rise. However, the helix rise in this case is 25.8 \u00c5, which raises the question of how the alignment of segments is handled by Relion. This is even more surprising for the reconstruction of a single strand, since the rise in this case is more than twice the distance that was used to segment the filaments. It is also unusual that the helical rotation is ~198\u02da, but by definition it has to be between 180\u02da and -180\u02da. Are the numbers wrong or does the definition of helical rotation in Relion differ from the usual convention, and if so, why? Similarly, the actin twist is given as 193.6\u00ba, different from the commonly used ~167\u00ba. This may be due to a different definition of the coordinate system, in which case it should be explained."

Even if the sequence of arcadin-2 is divergent from known actin-binding proteins, it seems that the mechanism itself (crenactin filament inhibition) is homologous to the one used in eukaryotes and this is what we believe does support the theory of crenarchaeal origin as it makes actin and crenactin more related. It does seem more like convergent evolution on arcadin-2's side and we agree that this point was not made. The Discussion has been modified to include both points: \"Our finding that arcadin-2 shares functional and structural similarities with actin sequesters provides further evidence for the parallel evolution of the crenarchaeal and eukaryotic cytoskeletons (Bernander et al., 2011; Guy and Ettema, 2011).\" has been changed to: \"Our finding that arcadin-2 inhibits crenactin polymerisation in a manner similar to known actin sequesters provides further evidence for the parallel evolution of crenactin and eukaryotic actin since they have both maintained the function of the hydrophobic groove (Bernander et al., 2011; Guy and Ettema, 2011).

However, very high salt conditions (close to 1M) are routinely used as a step in actin purification to remove binding proteins from F-actin while the filament stays intact. Since the intra- and interfilament interactions are similar in crenactin and actin, high salt concentrations should not affect the filament structure. If the salt concentration does have such a strong effect on the crenactin filaments, this is an important finding that should be buttressed, e.g. by a structure of the high-salt filaments in negative stain.</i> "

Actin and crenactin share similar architectures at the filament level. However, many chemical differences exist at the monomer level. One of the most prominent differences is the hydrophobic plug as mentioned in the text and shown in figures, a feature that dominates inter-strand binding in crenactin and that is much smaller in actin. Even if the interactions are of similar nature, we suggest it is probably inappropriate to compare the polymerisation conditions of these two different proteins since their primary sequences differ significantly (only about 20% identity!). As an example, MreB, an endogenous bacterial actin-like protein, requires very different polymerisation conditions depending on the source organism, despite an extremely conserved 3D structure. MreB from <i>C. crescentus</i> does not polymerise at all if salt concentrations above 50 mM are used, whereas other MreB proteins show a different behaviour (Van den Ent 2014 <i>eLife</i>, Salje 2011 MolCELL, Van den Ent 2001 Nature). We cannot be sure entirely that it is the high salt condition that causes the different filament architectures, but the salt is the most striking difference between the conditions used."

In the absence of a paper describing helical refinement in Relion, the protocol should be explained at least briefly in the Methods. In particular, the authors segmented their filaments with a distance of 25 \u00c5. Normally, this distance is chosen to be longer that the helix rise. However, the helix rise in this case is 25.8 \u00c5, which raises the question of how the alignment of segments is handled by Relion. This is even more surprising for the reconstruction of a single strand, since the rise in this case is more than twice the distance that was used to segment the filaments. It is also unusual that the helical rotation is ~198\u02da, but by definition it has to be between 180\u02da and -180\u02da. Are the numbers wrong or does the definition of helical rotation in Relion differ from the usual convention, and if so, why? Similarly, the actin twist is given as 193.6\u00ba, different from the commonly used ~167\u00ba. This may be due to a different definition of the coordinate system, in which case it should be explained.</i> "

Additionally, the procedure keeps segments from individual filaments in the two half datasets for FSC calculations separate, not to introduce bias and adds a powerful automatic picking procedure that tracks along filaments. The Methods section has been slightly amended to explain a bit more but the quality of the map and the agreement with the crenactin crystal structure (and the visible differences such as the hydrophobic plug conformation) speak for themselves we believe.

In the protofilament/single strand of double helical crenactin it is ~36\u00b0. While this is a big change, we concluded that because of the unclear relevance of the single protofilaments that this might not add much and potentially confuse. To make this more relevant, one might want to try to investigate if single filaments become double when conditions are changed from high-salt to low-salt, for example. We have not investigated this or if, as mentioned, double filaments become single when raising the salt concentration.
