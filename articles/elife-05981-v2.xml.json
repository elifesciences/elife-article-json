Timely rhodopsin desensitization depends on phosphorylation and arrestin binding, which quenches G protein activation. Rhodopsin phosphorylation has been measured biochemically at C-terminal serine residues, suggesting that these residues are critical for producing fast, low-noise responses. The role of native threonine residues is unclear. We compared single-photon responses from rhodopsin lacking native serine or threonine phosphorylation sites. Contrary to expectation, serine-only rhodopsin generated prolonged step-like single-photon responses that terminated abruptly and randomly, whereas threonine-only rhodopsin generated responses that were only modestly slower than normal. We show that the step-like responses of serine-only rhodopsin reflect slow and stochastic arrestin binding. Thus, threonine sites play a privileged role in promoting timely arrestin binding and rhodopsin desensitization. Similar coordination of phosphorylation and arrestin binding may more generally permit tight control of the duration of GPCR activity."

Timely rhodopsin desensitization depends on phosphorylation and arrestin binding, which quenches G protein activation. Rhodopsin phosphorylation has been measured biochemically at C-terminal serine residues, suggesting that these residues are critical for producing fast, low-noise responses. The role of native threonine residues is unclear. We compared single-photon responses from rhodopsin lacking native serine or threonine phosphorylation sites. Contrary to expectation, serine-only rhodopsin generated prolonged step-like single-photon responses that terminated abruptly and randomly, whereas threonine-only rhodopsin generated responses that were only modestly slower than normal. We show that the step-like responses of serine-only rhodopsin reflect slow and stochastic arrestin binding. Thus, threonine sites play a privileged role in promoting timely arrestin binding and rhodopsin desensitization. Similar coordination of phosphorylation and arrestin binding may more generally permit tight control of the duration of GPCR activity."

This diversity originates in part from differences in the processes controlling GPCR activity, which influence the duration and extent to which downstream pathways are activated (<a href=\"#bib15\">DeWire et al., 2007</a>). Nonetheless, all but a few GPCRs desensitize through a common set of reactions: phosphorylation by G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) followed by the binding of arrestin. Interestingly, the &gt;800 GPCRs expressed by humans are desensitized by only 7 GRKs and 4 arrestins (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wilden et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lohse et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pitcher et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2004</a>).

The pattern of phosphorylation sites can control the effect of arrestin binding on the receptor, that is, whether arrestin promotes receptor desensitization or internalization (<a href=\"#bib32\">Key et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ren et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Butcher et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nobles et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shukla et al., 2011</a>). The variety of patterns exhibited by different GPCRs has been compared to identification by different bar codes (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tobin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nobles et al., 2011</a>).

Namely, native serine sites are phosphorylated rapidly and begin to lower rhodopsin's catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ohguro et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gibson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mendez et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kennedy et al., 2001</a>), but serine phosphorylation only weakly promotes arrestin binding; native threonine sites are phosphorylated more slowly but are essential to promote rapid arrestin binding. This coordination produces an orderly sequence of desensitization events and contributes to the precise control of rhodopsin's active lifetime. A similar interplay of serine and threonine sites may be an important general mechanism tuning the kinetics of arrestin binding and GPCR desensitization."

Overlaying all SPRs gathered from a rod illustrates the extent of this effect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>); whereas responses elicited by Rho or S \u2192 A rhodopsin follow similar trajectories, the T \u2192 A responses plateau to a common level before terminating at random times. This gives rise to two bands, an upper one that thins over time as responses decay, and a lower one that collects the responses as they terminate. Thus, removal of serine vs threonine sites has quite different effects on SPR variability. Below, we characterize these differences to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms."

The pooled distributions are plotted below. Spread in the measurement is dominated by real variation in response duration across strains, as shown by two measures. First, the distributions are wider than the jitter produced by noise in the algorithm (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>-bottom, gray dots). Second, the distributions of response durations for individual cells of a given strain more closely resemble the pooled distributions for that strain than those of a different strain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

SPRs followed a consistent initial trajectory and then began to diverge near the time at which the mean response peaked. For all rhodopsin types, the variance peaked after the peak of the mean response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). This late peak of the variance reflects the fact that the rising phase and peak amplitude of the response vary little compared to the falling phase. The T \u2192 A mutant is an extreme case of this effect: the peak in the variance of the T \u2192 A responses coincides with the point at which approximately half of the responses have returned to baseline (2.9 s, compare to median duration 2.7 s in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This correspondence between the median response duration and the time at which the variance peaks is expected for a first-order decay process in which response duration is determined by a single stochastic step. Thus, the time course of the variance suggests that a single desensitization step is greatly prolonged for T \u2192 A rhodopsin."

The variance of the areas of the SPRs was corrected for the variance of the failures and then used to compute CV<sub>area</sub> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hamer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doan et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2009</a>).

Blots of both T \u2192 A and S \u2192 A samples showed five bands, corresponding to opsin (0*) and unphosphorylated (0), singly (1), doubly (2), and triply (3) phosphorylated rhodopsin, showing that T \u2192 A and S \u2192 A mutants can be phosphorylated at all sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">Mendez et al., 2000</a>).

Phosphorylation consists of GRK1 binding and phosphate attachment, both of which can contribute to the rate of desensitization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Doan et al., 2009</a>). Arrestin-1 serves both to quench rhodopsin activity and to modify the GRK1-binding rate by competing with GRK1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doan et al., 2009</a>). The long duration of the T \u2192 A responses suggests that GRK1 binding, phosphate attachment, or arrestin-1 binding is substantially slowed and limits the desensitization rate. We distinguished among these possibilities in both T \u2192 A and S \u2192 A rods by lowering separately the GRK1 or arrestin-1 concentration. If GRK1 binding is rate limiting, lowering the GRK1 but not the arrestin-1 concentration should further slow the responses. If arrestin-1 binding is rate limiting, lowering the arrestin-1 but not the GRK1 concentration should slow the responses. If phosphate attachment by bound GRK1 is rate limiting, the responses should be insensitive to lowering GRK1 and arrestin-1 concentrations."

Western blots confirmed reduced concentrations of arrestin-1 and GRK1 (data not shown). Reduced arrestin-1 expression had little or no effect on S \u2192 A SPR kinetics (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, cyan trace) or durations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, cyan crosses). Reduced GRK1 expression similarly did not noticeably change SPR kinetics or durations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). This result differs from reduced GRK1 expression in Rho rods (<i>GRK1</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup>/<i>Rho</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>), which clearly exhibit slowed responses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2010</a>).

This suggests that GRK1 binding is slowed, as predicted by the results of previous experiments with <i>GRK1</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doan et al., 2009</a>). Long responses, and thus the median duration, are little affected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). The sensitivity of T \u2192 A responses to reducing arrestin-1 and the relative insensitivity to reducing GRK1 implicates arrestin-1 binding as the slow step in desensitization of T \u2192 A rhodopsin. This in turn suggests that threonine residues are required for timely rhodopsin desensitization."

In one hypothetical regime, rhodopsin activates a collection of G proteins and then quickly desensitizes. In this case, the kinetics of the response recovery reflects the rate at which the active G protein population decays. In another hypothetical regime, rhodopsin desensitizes slowly compared to the rate of G protein decay such that the kinetics of the response recovery reflects the rate at which rhodopsin desensitizes. More generally, the response recovery kinetics reflect both G protein decay and rhodopsin desensitization. Indeed, the analysis described below indicates that the kinetics of brief SPRs are shaped almost entirely by the transduction cascade, while longer-lasting responses also reflect the kinetics of rhodopsin desensitization."

Nonetheless, we lack a clear understanding of how these mechanisms support the observed diversity in GPCR signaling. Here, we investigated the role of different C-terminus phosphorylation sites in rhodopsin desensitization. We found that phosphorylation of native serines is rapid but ineffective in promoting rapid arrestin-1 binding. Phosphorylation of native threonines is slow but effective in promoting rapid arrestin-1 binding. Together, these properties ensure not only that several phosphorylation steps will complete before arrestin-1 will bind but also that after these steps complete, arrestin-1 will bind rapidly. These results challenge assumptions about the relative importance of serine and threonine sites and show how phosphorylation and arrestin binding can act in concert to tightly control the timing of rhodopsin desensitization."

Several additional lines of evidence show that threonine phosphorylation preferentially promotes arrestin-1 binding. Maximizing the affinity of arrestin-1 binding has been found to require four or more phosphates, suggesting that phosphorylation of at least one threonine is necessary for normal desensitization (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2007</a>). It also appears that regardless of where threonines are located in the C-terminal sequence, their presence leads to comparable degrees of receptor quenching in a cell-free assay (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brannock et al., 1999</a>). Other GPCRs can function in a similar manner: the somatostatin subtype 2A receptor is phosphorylated at serine sites to a greater extent than at threonine sites (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hipkin et al., 1997</a>), but threonine phosphorylation is required for normal desensitization (<a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2008</a>).

Our findings suggest that threonines play a privileged role in these interactions. Arrestins are composed of a C-domain and an N-domain, connected by a 12-residue \u2018hinge\u2019 region. These two domains are normally held fixed by the interaction of the arrestin C-terminus with the N-domain and the polar core, a network of charges paradoxically buried within the protein (<a href=\"#bib22\">Granzin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hirsch et al., 1999</a>). The phosphorylated C-terminus of the GPCR is suspected to disrupt the polar core, freeing the C-terminus and gate loops (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hirsch et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2004</a>). Once free, arrestin's N-domain rotates relative to the C-domain, changing the relative positions of loops that form the receptor-binding interface, and perhaps permitting more dynamic movements (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shukla et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhuang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2014</a>).

A crystal structure of arrestin-2 (\u03b2-arrestin-1) together with a phosphorylated C-terminus peptide from the V2R receptor shows that a critical lysine in the \u2018middle loop\u2019 (139 loop) is coordinated with a phosphate (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shukla et al., 2013</a>). In this model, our data indicate that the arrangement of rhodopsin's C-terminal phosphorylation sites is important for this interaction."

Familiar examples are the charge flowing through an ion channel during a single opening and the time-to-decay of a radioactive particle. In these examples, variability results from stochastic fluctuations in the active lifetime of the molecule responsible. SPRs generated by vertebrate rods vary much less than expected from simple stochastic models for single molecules (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baylor et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Whitlock and Lamb, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Field and Rieke, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doan et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gross et al., 2012</a>).

Rhodopsin's effective lifetime in mouse rods has been a matter of debate: some studies support fast rhodopsin desensitization, such that G protein decay determines the rate of response recovery (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krispel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gross and Burns, 2010</a>). In this case, variability in the timing of rhodopsin desensitization produces variable amplitude SPRs, with less variability in response time course (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gross et al., 2012</a>). Other studies find that the rate of rhodopsin desensitization is sufficiently slow to affect the rate of response recovery (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doan et al., 2009</a>). In this case, the time course of the SPRs will also vary. The different observations across studies appear to be due in part to differences in experimental conditions and the physiological state of the rods (<a href=\"#bib3\">Azevedo and Rieke, 2011</a>). The results of <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> indicate that, under our experimental conditions, rhodopsin activity is occasionally short-lived but often persists sufficiently long to shape the SPRs (see also <a href=\"#bib5\">Baylor et al., 1984</a>). This suggests that on average the kinetics of rhodopsin desensitization are closely matched to the kinetics of the transduction cascade."

Assuming that the transduction cascade acts linearly to convert rhodopsin activity to changes in current, replicating the measured low variability of the response requires 6\u20137 steps (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doan et al., 2006</a>). Non-linearities in the transduction process could reduce the number of steps required (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bisegna et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gross et al., 2012</a>); nonetheless, a shared feature of all current explanations for reproducibility is that multiple events must work in a concerted fashion to control rhodopsin desensitization. In particular, arrestin-1 binding must be coordinated with phosphorylation so that it does not occur too quickly or too slowly."

This model predicts few short-lived rhodopsin activations, since arrestin-1 would rarely bind until most of the C-terminus sites had been phosphorylated. Similarly, the model predicts few long-lived active molecules since arrestin-1 binds rapidly once threonine sites are phosphorylated. Thus, the different roles of C-terminus serine and threonine phosphorylation sites appear to ensure that the first events in vision produce low-noise quantal signals."

Wild-type mice (C57B/6J, called here WT for convenience) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Transgenic mice were created as previously described (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mendez et al., 2000</a>). Briefly, the 11-kB BamHI fragment containing rhodopsin gene and the 6-kb upstream were cloned into the pBII SK(\u2212) plasmid (all restriction enzymes, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The BspEI-PacI fragment including the coding region of the C-terminus was excised and mutagenized by PCR (Qiagen) to encode alanines in place of either all three serines (Tg(Rho<sup>S334A/S338A/S343A</sup>) or S \u2192 A) or all three threonines (Tg(Rho<sup>T336A/T340A/T342A</sup>) or T \u2192 A). In addition, the mutagenized PCR product encoded both the mutation A337V to produce a linear epitope for mAb 3A6, which recognizes the bovine rhodopsin C-teminus and silent EagI sites for genotyping by Southern blot. The A337V mutation is present in transgenic mice with single phosphorylation-site substitutions; these rods have more normal response kinetics, indicating that the A337V substitution does not contribute strongly to the changes described in this paper (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mendez et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doan et al., 2006</a>). The resulting product was sequenced before ligation with the plasmid and verified later. The construct was linearized by digestion with BamHI and purified for oocyte injection (Qiagen). Injection and implantation was carried out by the University of Washington Transgenic Resource Program into F2 hybrid zygotes from C57Bl/6J and DBA/2J F1 mice and yielded 8 viable S \u2192 A founders and 10 viable T \u2192 A founders.

We estimated the response duration using an algorithm developed to measure transition times of single-channel currents (<a href=\"#bib18\">Draber and Schultze, 1994</a>). Briefly, histograms of current values across SPRs in a given cell typically exhibited two peaks, one centered around 0 pA and another at \u223c1 pA where the responses plateau, which approximate a \u2018down state\u2019 and an \u2018up state\u2019, respectively. Transitions from the up to down state were identified based on a transition parameter that depended on the baseline noise. Noise could cause the algorithm to detect multiple transitions, so we required the downstate to persist for at least 300 ms. Transitions were typically detected at a point before the response returned to baseline, so the response was deemed to end when the current dropped below the average of points in a 100-ms window following the identified transition time."

This effect can be measured by adding the average SPR to the time course of trials identified as failures, and measuring the durations, which will vary only as a result of noise (shown as dotted gray line in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>-bottom). Fifty failures from each WT rod make up this distribution in an attempt to represent the full range of baseline noise effects."

Aligning the responses to the end points caused noise in multiple traces to become correlated, confounding our estimate of the recovery time constant. To avoid this effect, we averaged noise trials aligned to concocted end points, identified as above, which suffered the same correlation effect. The noise trace was then subtracted from the aligned singles to eliminate the coherent-noise effect and produce a smooth average falling phase (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This procedure did not inherently produce fast time constants as in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, because when the average SPR was added to noise trials, the falling phase of the end-aligned simulated responses had a time constant of 307 ms, similar to that of the average SPR (data not shown). Singles with lifetimes within 200 ms of the end of their epochs were excluded from this analysis."

If the duration of rhodopsin\u2019s activity is brief compared to the response, then variability in the number of transducins activated will produce variability in the response amplitude; the response time course, on the other hand, will vary little since it will be determined by transducin decay and hence reflect averaging across activated transducins. If the duration of rhodopsin\u2019s activity is comparable to the response, then the resulting dispersion in times at which transducins are activated, together with variability in the number activated, will cause the response to vary in amplitude and in shape."

Indeed, assuming the transduction cascade responds linearly and noiselessly to rhodopsin activity, the CV of the response areas is equal to the CV of the cumulative rhodopsin activity, independent of the relative lifetimes of rhodopsin and transducin. Variability associated with the finite number of transducins activated will only increase response variability and hence cause the CV of the response areas to underestimate reproducibility of rhodopsin itself. We have expanded our discussion of these issues in both the Results (\u201cRemoving serine and threonine sites increases response variability\u201d) and Discussion (\u201cReproducibility of the single-photon response\u201d)."
