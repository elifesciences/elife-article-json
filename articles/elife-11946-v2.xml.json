Establishing the neurocomputational principles underpinning this key metacognitive function is therefore a major imperative. Categorical choices are thought to be made by integrating evidence over time into a decision variable that triggers action upon reaching a criterion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kelly and O'Connell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</a>). Most theoretical models of metacognition propose that the same decision variable makes a key contribution to internal representations of choice accuracy (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Martino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Heath, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Link, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Moran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ratcliff and Starns, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yu et al., 2015</a>).

However, the specification that the decision variable reaches a fixed threshold prior to commitment means that these models cannot account for the fact that human participants can retrospectively categorize certain choices as erroneous even in the absence of external feedback (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rabbitt and Vyas, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rabbitt, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yeung et al., 2004</a>). To take account of this kind of observation, alternative theoretical models have been proposed in which metacognitive judgments can exploit additional evidence that is accumulated after first-order commitment (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). However, a definitive neurophysiological demonstration of post-decisional evidence accumulation has yet to be definitively provided in humans or other animals.

Although post-commitment neural signatures have been described in humans (<a href=\"#bib21\">Falkenstein et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gehring et al., 1993</a>) and other animals (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ito et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Narayanan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pardo-Vazquez et al., 2008</a>) which show clear sensitivity to choice accuracy and, in some cases, to the quality of metacognitive judgments (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boldt and Yeung, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">O'Connell et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Steinhauser and Yeung, 2010</a>), these signals have yet to be conclusively identified with post-decisional evidence integration. In the present study, we exploited the uniquely supramodal nature of a recently characterized build-to-threshold decision variable signal in the human brain (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Twomey et al., 2015</a>) to investigate the influence of post-decisional evidence accumulation on the timing and accuracy of explicit error detection. Through a combination of electrophysiological data analysis and computational modeling, we demonstrate that neural evidence accumulation does persist after commitment to the first-order decision and that its rate determines the probability and timing of error detection. Additionally, we show that the rate of post-decision accumulation is not solely the product of feedforward sensory inputs but is influenced by the output of medial frontal structures implicated in performance monitoring and executive control."

Subjects viewed a serial sequence of color words, each presented for 0.4 s, with the congruency between font color and semantic content varied across trials. The primary task was to execute a right-handed button press as quickly as possible when the semantic content of the word and its font color were incongruent (Go trial), and to withhold this response when either the word presented on the current trial was the same as that presented on the previous trial (\u2018repeat\u2019 No-Go) or when the meaning of the word and its font color matched (\u2018color\u2019 No-Go). Performance on paradigms of this nature can be readily understood in terms of a race-to-threshold between two competing accumulation processes representing the evidence in favor of a \u2018Go\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t Go\u2019 decision (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gomez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Logan and Cowan, 1984</a>)."

This signal exhibits the same decision-predictive dynamics that have been reported in single-unit recordings from a variety of brain areas during perceptual decision formation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</a>), including an evidence-dependent rate of rise and a threshold-crossing relationship with reaction time. Another important feature of this signal is that it represents the evolving decision in a domain-general fashion that is independent of motor requirements and indeed traces the decision even when no overt decision-reporting action is required (<a href=\"#bib45\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>). Here, we observed that the same centro-parietal positivity (CPP) was elicited by Go and No-Go stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In what follows, we demonstrate that this signal encodes consecutive build-to-threshold processes that determine both first-order choices and second-order error detection decisions on our task. Readers familiar with the human ERP literature will note that these two processing stages incorporate stimulus- and response-evoked activity usually attributed to the \u2018P300\u2019 and \u2018Pe\u2019 components, respectively (see <i>Discussion</i>). We persist here with the label \u2018CPP\u2019 because it is less prescriptive about signal latency, eliciting conditions or measurement technique."

Thus, first-order performance on the Go/No-Go task was reliant on the same fundamental neural dynamics as have been reported for conventional perceptual decision-making paradigms (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</a>)."

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (see <i>Materials and methods</i>) conducted in discrete temporal windows along the entire signal time course revealed that second-order performance could be reliably classified as early as 120\u00a0ms prior to error commission (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>)."

However, CPP dynamics during the post-commitment interval were qualitatively distinct from those observed during the first-order decision process. While the positive build-up of the first-order CPP was invariant to trial-type, tracing the emerging decision irrespective of whether the evidence favored a Go or No-Go choice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib33\">Kelly and O\u2019Connell, 2013</a>), the second-order CPP only increased after detected errors and not, on average, after correct Go responses or undetected errors. Similarly, in a recent study that examined the post-commitment \u2018Pe\u2019 signal preceding graded confidence judgments (without interrogating this signal for accumulation-to-bound characteristics), a monotonic relationship between signal amplitude and confidence was observed whereby amplitude was greatest when subjects indicated very <i>low</i> confidence in the primary choice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boldt and Yeung, 2015</a>). Thus, rather than reflecting a continuation of the first-order decision process, these data suggest that error detection decisions were based on the selective accumulation of internal evidence that the previous choice was incorrect. In the following set of analyses, we investigated whether a higher-order neural signal that has known sensitivity to choice accuracy might influence the error detection process."

                                "text": "We quantitatively compared the independent contributions of the FC<i>\u03b8</i> and CPP signals to variation in RT<sub>d</sub> via single-trial, within-subjects robust regressions, leveraging single-trial amplitudes, build-up rates and peak latencies of the signals as predictors in successive models (see <i>Materials and methods</i>; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> for measurement approach). As expected, single-trial FC<i>\u03b8</i> power was strongly negatively related to RT<sub>d</sub> (<i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>=\u00a0\u20137.2, <i>p\u00a0</i>&lt;\u00a01\u00a0x\u00a010<sup>\u22126</sup>). Topographically, this effect was maximal over fronto-central scalp (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). In contrast, the pre-detection amplitude of the second-order CPP did not reliably correlate with RT<sub>d</sub> (<i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>=\u00a0\u22121.9, <i>p\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.08; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>), consistent with the aforementioned observation of a threshold-crossing effect prior to error detection. Statistical comparison of the associated regression weights indicated that FC<i>\u03b8</i> power was a better predictor of RT<sub>d</sub> than CPP amplitude (<i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>=\u00a03.3, <i>p\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.003). The opposite pattern was apparent for the build-up rates and peak latencies of both signals: CPP build-up rate (<i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>= -\u22125.0, <i>p\u00a0</i>&lt;\u00a01\u00a0x\u00a010<sup>\u22124</sup>) and latency (<i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>=\u00a04.9, <i>p\u00a0</i>&lt;\u00a01\u00a0x\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>, derived by permutation testing; see <i>Materials and methods</i>) robustly predicted RT<sub>d</sub> with both effects maximal over centro-parietal scalp (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,c</a>), whereas these features of the FC<i>\u03b8</i> signal did not reliably account for trial-by-trial variance in RT<sub>d</sub> (build-up rate: <i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>= \u20131.9, <i>p\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.07; latency: <i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>=\u00a0\u20130.7, <i>p\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.5; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b,c</a>). Thus, although a relationship between FC<i>\u03b8</i> build-up rate and the timing of error detection was clearly observed in the trial-averaged waveforms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>), single-trial regressions revealed that this effect was only marginally significant when the contribution of CPP build-up rate was accounted for. Formal comparisons of the regression weights confirmed that CPP build-up rate and peak latency were superior predictors of RT<sub>d</sub> compared to the counterpart metrics derived from FC<i>\u03b8</i> (build-up rate: <i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>=\u00a03.0, <i>p</i>=0.006; latency: <i>t</i><sub>27\u00a0</sub>=\u00a04.3, <i>p\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.0002)."

First, FC<i>\u03b8</i> power began to reliably predict the speed of error detection approximately 350 ms before the CPP did (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2d</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3c</a>). Thus, internal fluctuations in FC<i>\u03b8</i> power that were independent of the first-order evidence accumulation process reflected in the CPP were predictive of subsequent error detection behavior. Second, we tested whether the single-trial relationship between FC<i>\u03b8</i> and RT<sub>d</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) was formally mediated by a direct effect of FC<i>\u03b8</i> on the rate of second-order evidence accumulation by constructing a three-variable path model with FC<i>\u03b8</i> power as the predictor, RT<sub>d</sub> as the outcome and CPP build-up rate as the mediator variable (see <i>Materials and methods</i>). FC<i>\u03b8</i> was a reliable predictor of CPP build-up rate in this model (<i>p\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.0007) and the mediation effect was significant (<i>p\u00a0=\u00a0</i>0.0009), indicating that the rate of second-order evidence accumulation partially mediated the observed relationship between medial frontal signaling and the speed of error detection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

Error detection is achieved in the model once the evidence tally passes a threshold (<i>a</i>) whereas the temporal integration process terminates if this threshold is not reached by a time deadline, thereby resulting in an undetected error (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>; <i>Materials and methods</i>). The decision to model second-order performance in isolation was based on the observation that higher-order signals (FC<i>\u03b8</i>) play a prominent role in determining second-order decision-making, thus indicating that the input to the primary decision process is not necessarily the same as the input to the second-order process (see <i>Discussion</i>). For simplicity, we here focused on decomposing error detection behavior in isolation. This approach served to further identify our electrophysiological signals with distinct features of post-commitment evidence accumulation (evidential input, temporal integration) without requiring speculative assumptions about the relationship between first- and second-order decision processes."

Second, we observed no change in signal topography between the pre- and post-choice phases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>).

But the manner in which metacognitive evaluations are probed is likely to have a profound impact on how they are constructed in the brain. Whether participating in a laboratory experiment or everyday activity, human decision-makers are most often required to express or act upon their metacognitive evaluations some time after an initial choice. Our results reveal that if the decision-maker is allowed to report delayed, self-initiated judgments of their own performance, these judgments will incorporate new internal information available after the point of commitment, even in the absence of continued sensory input. This process of post-decision evidence accumulation has already been invoked by several computational models to successfully account for delayed confidence judgments and changes-of-mind (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Resulaj et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yu et al., 2015</a>), while a parallel literature on error detection has long debated the mechanistic basis of post-commitment information processing (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rabbitt and Vyas, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rabbitt, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yeung et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yeung and Summerfield, 2012</a>). Our findings, however, represent the first definitive neurophysiological demonstration of post-decision evidence accumulation. In so doing, we show that the critical neural dynamics that give rise to both first- and second-order decisions are captured by a single brain signal, opening up new avenues for basic and clinical investigations."

                        "text": "Comparison of pre- and post-decisional CPP dynamics highlighted an important qualitative distinction between the first- and second-order decision processes invoked by our paradigm. The first-order task required subjects to discriminate between the two possible stimulus categories (i.e. Go versus No-Go), a process that can be understood in terms of competitive accumulation of evidence in favor of each choice alternative (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gomez et al., 2007</a>). We have previously shown that the CPP builds in response to evidence favoring each of the choice alternatives in such contexts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kelly and O\u2019Connell, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">O\u2019Connell et al., 2012</a>) and accordingly, we observed here that the same signal exhibited a gradual build-up prior to both Go and No-go choices. The second-order task, by contrast, was more comparable to simple signal detection with detected errors translating to hits and undetected errors translating to misses. Evidence accumulation mechanisms have also been invoked to account for signal detection decisions (e.g. <a href=\"#bib16\">Deco et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Donner et al., 2009</a>) but in this case the neural decision variable seems to increase towards a single detection boundary and misses occur when this boundary is not reached (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carnevale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Deco et al., 2007</a>). Again, previous studies have shown that the CPP in such contexts exhibits a clear ramp-up to threshold for hit decisions that is diminished or absent on miss trials (<a href=\"#bib45\">O\u2019Connell et al., 2012</a>), and presently this effect was recapitulated for error detection decisions. Collectively, these findings indicate that human decision-makers are capable of quickly engaging multiple decision processes in succession that, although reliant on the same neural mechanism of evidence integration, are constructed in qualitatively distinct ways."

First, peri-response FC<i>\u03b8</i> power was strongly predictive of subsequent error detection. Second, FC<i>\u03b8</i> power predicted error detection speed from a particularly early latency relative to the CPP. Third, this predictive capacity was formally mediated by the effect of FC<i>\u03b8</i> on the rate of second-order evidence accumulation, as indexed by CPP build-up rate. Fourth, FC<i>\u03b8</i> correlated across-subjects with a model-based estimate of the strength of the evidence that fed into the error detection process. This specification of an important role for pMFC signaling in explicit error detection suggests that metacognitive decisions are not solely based on the accumulation of sensory evidence but are also influenced by internally generated higher-order signals."

One possibility is that pMFC furnishes a distinct source of abstracted \u2018error evidence\u2019 that directly informs second-order judgments. Extensive data suggest that <i>\u03b8</i>-band activity in pMFC signals the degree to which competing action plans are simultaneously activated, commonly known as \u2018conflict\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cavanagh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">2013</a>). Computational models have shown that a post-commitment conflict signal alone would provide a reliable basis for error detection because its magnitude scales with error likelihood and can reliably classify trial-to-trial performance accuracy (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yeung et al., 2004</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib10\">Charles et al., 2014</a>). Such a causal role for pMFC-encoded conflict in second-order decision-making would also provide a mechanistic explanation for the recent finding that manipulating effector-specific premotor activity both before and immediately after perceptual choice has clear effects on subsequent confidence reports (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fleming et al., 2015</a>). Alternatively, second-order decisions on our task may receive their sole or primary evidence from visual short-term memory (<a href=\"#bib63\">Smith and Ratcliff, 2009</a>) and pMFC may serve to modulate this process by strategically tuning processing in a global network of task-relevant regions when conflict is detected (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Danielmeier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dehaene et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shenhav et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with such a non-specific influence on the post-decisional process, we found that the mediation of the FC<i>\u03b8</i>/RT<sub>d</sub> relationship by CPP build-up rate was partial, indicating that pMFC may have also influenced the speed of error detection independently of its effect on the rate of evidence accumulation \u2013 perhaps via effects on other parameters of the decision process like the response threshold (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cavanagh et al., 2011</a>) or motor execution time. The extent to which pMFC signaling directly modulates the second-order evidence accumulation process can be established in future work by examining the impact of pMFC perturbation on CPP dynamics (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hayward et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Reinhart and Woodman, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sela et al., 2012</a>)."

The model thus accommodates suggestions that pMFC, or indeed other neural signals, provide modulatory inputs or additional sources of evidence that are multiplexed in a compound decision variable that determines second-order judgments (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ullsperger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">2010</a>). Of course, a corresponding limitation of our modelling framework is that it does not specify the precise nature of the relationship between the first- and second-order decision processes, and thereby fails to provide explicit accounts of some aspects of our observed data. For example, our selective modelling of error detection behaviour does not provide an explanation for the similarity of the post-response CPP signals on undetected errors and correct Go trials. This similarity could perhaps be due to a common paucity of error evidence on both trial-types. On the other hand, our analysis did reveal a post-response difference in frontal ERP morphology between these trial-types (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) which suggests that they are at least partially dissociable in terms of neural dynamics. Such unresolved questions emphasize that a central goal of future research must be to build a unified model of decision-making that not only accounts for the often complex relationships between first- and second-order behavior (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</a>), but is also constrained by neurophysiological characterizations of the post-decision accumulation process. Moreover, a remaining challenge will be to devise innovative ways to manipulate the evidence that feeds into the second-order process in an effort to test such a model and further corroborate our identification of the CPP with post-decisional accumulation."

However, a consensus regarding the precise functional significance of this signal has never been achieved. Although a series of recent studies have demonstrated that Pe amplitude correlates with confidence in perceptual decisions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boldt and Yeung, 2015</a>) and the criterion that subjects impose on error detection reports (<a href=\"#bib64\">Steinhauser and Yeung, 2010</a>) and have thereby associated this component with the general quality of the metacognitive decision process [see also <a href=\"#bib65\">Steinhauser and Yeung (2012)</a>], these studies could not identify the Pe with a specific neural mechanism. The present study, by contrast, demonstrates that the post-decisional CPP encodes a second-order decision variable that bears precisely the same dynamical properties as have been reported for first-order decision signals in single-unit and population-level neurophysiology, including an RT-predictive build-up rate and a boundary-crossing relationship to response execution \u2013 properties that have never been previously reported for the Pe. Our use of a self-initiated error detection report was a critical design feature in this regard because it facilitated the interrogation of signal dynamics leading up to the moment of error detection; this has not been possible in previous studies of the Pe, which enforced either delayed metacognitive reporting or none at all. Where we have previously demonstrated that the pre-decision build-up of the CPP encompasses activity that has traditionally been associated with the classic P300 or \u2018P3b\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Twomey et al., 2015</a>), an important implication of the present findings is that the post-decision build-up of the CPP corresponds to the activity commonly attributed to the Pe. Thus, our data suggest that the P3b and Pe reflect distinct stages of the same neurophysiological process and point to a unifying mechanistic framework for understanding both signals."

This finding furnishes critical neurophysiological support for theoretical accounts of metacognitive decision-making that have relied on the concept of post-decisional accumulation. Moreover, we have shown that this process is informed by a higher-order neural signal generated in medial frontal cortex, which suggests that metacognitive judgments are not solely based on the feedforward accumulation of sensory evidence but also on representations of conflict or error likelihood. Collectively, these results shed significant new light on the generative mechanisms of metacognition and furnish new evidence that error detection, confidence judgments and their neural substrates can be understood in terms of the same mechanistically principled framework of evidence accumulation."

Next, independent components representing stereotyped artifactual activity such as eye blinks, saccades and individual electrode artifacts were identified by visual inspection and discarded, and the ICA-pruned data were low-pass filtered to 35 Hz.

However, we did not consider the influence of Pe build-up rate on performance, we did not establish functional equivalence between the Pe and CPP and we did not consider the contribution of FC<i>\u03b8</i> to error detection (see below). In fact, in that paper we reported a reliable negative association between RT<sub>d</sub> and Pe amplitude immediately prior to error detection that is inconsistent with the presently reported results and difficult to reconcile with the proposal that the Pe reflects the accumulation of evidence toward a fixed decision bound. Two critical methodological distinctions between Murphy et al. and the present study account for this discrepancy. First, whereas Murphy et al.\u00a0implemented a high-pass temporal filter, the present study did not. High-pass filtering is problematic in the current context because it is likely to attenuate CPP amplitude to a greater degree on trials with long RTs since decision-related neural activity is drawn out over a longer time frame on such trials. Second, the present study used a spatial filter to reduce the overlap with other temporally coincident signals because in recent work we demonstrated that boundary-crossing effects at response can be obscured by spatial overlap of the CPP with anticipatory signals emanating from frontal sites (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Twomey et al., 2015</a>). Addressing these issues enabled us to make a variety of important new observations that extend our previous results in several significant ways: we provide the first demonstration of the critical build-to-threshold relationship between the second-order CPP and RT<sub>d</sub> that is characteristic of an evolving decision variable; we show that this component interacts with a frontal conflict signal to determine the probability and timing of error detection; and, we leverage computational modelling to further identify this component with the second-order evidence accumulation process."

First, EEG data were decomposed into their time-frequency representation via complex Morlet wavelet convolution (between 2 and 12 cycles per wavelet, linearly increasing across 90 linear-spaced frequencies from 1\u00a0to\u00a030 Hz) and the resulting power estimates were normalized by the decibel (dB) transform (dB = 10*log<sub>10</sub>[power/baseline]). The baseline consisted of across-trial average power during the 0.3 s preceding stimulus onset, calculated and applied separately within each trial-type (Go, undetected error, detected error). This approach yielded a condition-averaged time-frequency plot that allowed us to select channels and frequency boundaries for FC<i>\u03b8</i> analysis in a manner that was orthogonal to any potential trial-type effects. Black lines in this plot (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>) enclose regions in which contiguous time-frequency pixels were significantly different from the pre-stimulus baseline at <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, for at least 400 ms and at least 5 consecutive frequency bins. Second, power estimates for all subsequent FC<i>\u03b8</i> analyses were derived by band-pass filtering the EEG data from 2\u00a0to\u00a07 Hz (using the <i>fir1</i> Matlab function to construct a narrow two-way least squares FIR filter kernel), Hilbert-transforming the filtered data to derive the analytic signal, and then converting to power. Compared to wavelet convolution this filter-Hilbert method affords greater control over the frequency characteristics of the filter, though in practice the results from both methods were qualitatively very similar. As for the previous wavelet-based approach, analyses were conducted on power estimates that were dB-normalized using a condition-specific trial-averaged pre-stimulus baseline, thus leaving within-condition trial-by-trial fluctuations in baseline power intact. Complementarily, the reported between-subjects FC<i>\u03b8</i> correlation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>) was conducted on unbaselined power estimates, thus leaving between-<i>individual</i> differences in baseline FC<i>\u03b8</i> power intact. Both within- and between-subjects variation in baseline power emerged to be sources of variance contributing to the respective effects (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3c-e</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We also verified that the main effect of error detection on FC<i>\u03b8</i> remained unchanged when no baseline was applied (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>)."

FC<i>\u03b8</i> was measured as the average power across six fronto-central electrodes, also centered on the topographic maximum (FCz, FC1, FC2, Cz, C1, C2). The relationships between RT and signal build-up rates and amplitudes were examined for the CPP on go trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), the second-order continuation of this signal on detected errors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>), and FC<i>\u03b8</i> on both trial-types (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d,e</a>). Analysis of Go-trial dynamics was restricted to trials with primary RTs &gt; 350 ms (leading to the exclusion of 17.4 \u00b1 12.1% of trials per subject) because the amplitude of the CPP signal was affected by visual-evoked potentials that coincided with the evolution of the decision-related activity on quicker trials (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For each participant, single-trial waveforms were sorted into 3 equal-sized bins according to RT (primary RT for Go trials, RT<sub>d</sub> for detected errors) and averaged. To establish the timing of the relationship between signal build-up rate and RT, we measured the temporal slope of each signal in each subject\u2019s bin-averaged waveforms using a sliding window of 150 ms, covering the entirety of both response- and detection-aligned waveforms. Build-up rate was computed as the slope of a straight line fitted to the signal within each temporal window, and a linear contrast was applied to this metric across RT bins. The centers of windows that were characterized by a significant group-level contrast in the expected direction (linear decrease in build-up rate with increasing RT; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, one-tailed) are marked by a black running line in the associated plots. To establish the timing of the relationship between signal amplitude and RT, we conducted a linear contrast of amplitude as a function of RT bin for each temporal sample. Samples characterized by contrasts that deviated from zero at the group level (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, two-tailed) are marked by a gray line in the associated plots.

For build-up rate and peak latency, two further models were constructed by replacing the predictor variables where appropriate. All coefficients in a given model were estimated simultaneously via type III sum of squares. RT<sub>d</sub> was log-transformed and peak signal latency was square root-transformed to normalize their respective distributions before coefficient estimation. Variance inflation factors for all predictors across all models were &lt;1.8, indicating weak multi-collinearity. For the amplitude and build-up rate metrics, effect sizes of the fitted <i>\u03b2</i> coefficients (effect size <i>t</i> = <i>\u03b2</i>/s.e.m.) were tested for group-level statistical significance via one-sample <i>t</i>-test (<i>H<sub>0</sub></i>: effect size = 0) and contrasted via paired <i>t</i>-test (<i>H<sub>0</sub></i>: effect size<sub>1</sub>\u00a0\u2212\u00a0effect size<sub>2</sub> = 0). For the latency metric, our use of a dynamic measurement window that was determined by single-trial RT<sub>d</sub> ensured an arbitrary positive correlation between single-trial signal latency and RT. To test for effect significance, we thus compared the observed effect sizes derived from the above regression model to the expected values of the same effect size metrics computed in the case in which signal latencies were randomly chosen from anywhere within each trial\u2019s measurement window. This process was repeated 1,000 times per subject to derive subject-specific permuted distributions of the FC<i>\u03b8</i> and CPP latency effects, against which we tested for statistical significance. The above procedures for amplitude, build-up rate and latency effects were also repeated on an electrode-by-electrode basis to construct topographic representations of where these effects were strongest on the scalp (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). For the latency analysis, the trial-by-trial timing of the peak positivity or negativity was extracted for each electrode, depending on whether the trial-averaged amplitude at that electrode in the 0.3 s preceding the error detection report was above or below zero, respectively."

Single-trial values for each measure were <i>z</i>-scored within-subjects and pooled across-subjects. To mitigate the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent in correlating two noisy single-trial electrophysiological metrics, average values for each of FC<i>\u03b8</i>, CPP build-up and RT<sub>d</sub> were computed in bins of 12 trials that were grouped after sorting trials in order of increasing RT<sub>d</sub>. Mediation effects at larger bin sizes were of comparable magnitude (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For CPP build-up rate to be considered a significant mediator, it was required to reach statistical significance in three tests: it must be related to the predictor (FC<i>\u03b8</i>), it must be related to the outcome (RT<sub>d</sub>) while controlling for the predictor, and the mediation effect (evaluating whether some covariance between predictor and outcome can be explained by the mediator) must be significant. Significance of the associated path coefficients was assessed via bias-corrected bootstrap tests with 10,000 samples (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wager et al., 2008</a>)."

Noisy evidence for an error was assumed to accumulate over time at drift rate <i>\u03bd</i> until a decision bound <i>a</i> was met, at which point error detection was achieved. The moment-to-moment noise in the evidence is determined by the <i>s</i> parameter, which refers to the standard deviation of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution from which random increments to the deterministic component of the accumulation process (represented by \u03bd) are drawn. As is common in fits of the drift diffusion model to data, <i>s</i> was fixed at 0.1 in order to scale all other parameters in the model across individuals. Drift rate was assumed to be normally distributed across trials with a standard deviation <i>\u03b7</i>, and all non-decision-related processing was assigned to a non-decision time parameter <i>t<sub>nd</sub></i>. The inclusion of the <i>\u03b7</i> parameter accorded with previous one-choice model fits to first-order behavior which suggested that variability in drift rate is necessary to account for the various observable shapes of hazard function in one-choice data (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ratcliff and Van Dongen, 2011</a>). We made the additional assumption that the temporal integration process terminated if <i>a</i> was not reached by a time deadline, thereby resulting in an undetected error. A deadline on post-decision accumulation also features in a prominent model of fast changes of mind in decision-making (<a href=\"#bib55\">Resulaj et al., 2009</a>) and was a free parameter in that study. Here, we estimated the subject-specific detection deadline empirically in order to retain a degree of freedom when assessing model fit: any extreme outliers (&gt; mean + 3.5 s.d.) were trimmed from each subject\u2019s RT<sub>d</sub> distribution and the deadline was defined as the slowest remaining RT per subject. This procedure yielded an average deadline of 1.17 s relative to initial error commission (\u00b10.19; range 0.81 to 1.47 s)."

The model was therefore implemented as a simulation using a random walk approximation to the diffusion process with 15,000 iterations per distribution at 1 ms step size. In order to fit the model to the observed data for each subject, five RT quantiles (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) were computed from that subject\u2019s RT<sub>d</sub> distribution and the proportions of all error trials (detected + undetected) lying between those quantiles were multiplied by the total number of error trials to yield <i>observed values (O</i>). Thus, the <i>defective</i> cumulative probability distribution of error detection reports was used to derive per-quantile trial frequencies, which allowed the model to simultaneously fit both RT<sub>d</sub> and error detection accuracy. We then calculated the model-estimated proportions of trials that lay between these RT quantiles, and these were multiplied by the number of actual observations to yield the model-derived <i>expected values (E</i>). A \u03c7<sup>2</sup> statistic \u03a3(<i>O</i> \u2013 <i>E</i>)<sup>2</sup>/<i>E</i> was computed and the parameters of the model were adjusted by a particle swarm optimization routine (<a href=\"#bib1\">Birge, 2003</a>) to minimize this value\u00a0iteratively (30 particles, set at pseudorandom starting points in parameter space).

However, the ratio of <i>v/\u03b7</i> remains invariant across different model fits. We therefore employed this \u2018drift ratio\u2019 quantity, which is analogous to <i>d\u2019</i> in classic signal detection theory (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ratcliff and Van Dongen, 2011</a>), as our model-based estimate of the quality of the evidence feeding into each subject\u2019s error detection decision process. In the reported between-subjects correlations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e,f,g</a>), drift ratio was correlated against summary electrophysiological measures for each subject. Amplitude and peak latency measures were calculated by averaging across single-trial estimates of these metrics on detected error trials, derived via the same measurement windows that were used for the previous within-subjects regression analyses. In an effort to increase the signal-to-noise of the build-up rate metric, per-subject build-up rate for each signal was defined as the slope of a linear fit to the average error-locked waveform on detected error trials, within a window that started at a subject-specific signal onset time obtained by visual inspection and ended at the subject-specific peak signal latency.

There has been considerable recent interest in the idea that sensory evidence continues to accumulate after a decision, and might underpin metacognitive phenomena such as confidence judgments and changes of mind. So far this notion has only been tested with behavioral modeling, but this paper reveals a possible biological mechanism. The authors present evidence suggesting that the post-error voltage positivity in the ERP (the Pe) reflects the same sort of evidence accumulation process as the central parietal positivity (CPP). This work thus re-defines well-known neuroelectric events based on more generalized and formalized algorithmic definitions. While the authors have previously described the CPP as a first-order evidence (direct sensory evidence) accumulation process, here they argue that the post-error process described here (Pe) reflects second-order (endogenous evidence) evidence accumulation. The authors bolster this claim by applying a one-choice diffusion model to the RT data, facilitating a direct comparison between the mechanistic implementation of CPP-like algorithms (P3 and Pe) even though they have differing cognitive implications (first vs. second order decisions)."

Virtues of this approach include intelligent spatial and temporal filtering, appropriate capitalization on previously detailed understanding of the role of non-phase locked frontal theta power in post-error decision making (including a formalized mediation model of theta, CPP and RT change), and successful one-choice diffusion modeling and application of model parameters to assist in the generalization of these findings. The covariation of the CPP with the second-order detection response time is particularly clear, providing strong underpinnings for post-decision evidence accumulation frameworks. The concern that the second-order CPP response is a motor artefact is allayed by observation of a similar potential in a \"no response\" control experiment. But there are some lingering concerns that both reviewers highlighted, elaborated in detail below, consolidating comments from individual reviewers."

The error detection process is modelled as a noisy one-response accumulator with its own drift rate, but this process does not know anything about the first-order decision. I understand the benefit of keeping things simple here and not making unnecessary assumptions about the link between first and second order accumulation, but I worry that it gives a misleading picture of the underlying second order accumulation process, and what we should expect of the data. Specifically, the model predicts that objective errors that don't reach a response threshold are no different, neurally, from correct \"go\" trials. Instead it seems more plausible that objective features of error trials drive fluctuations in \"error evidence\" and that on a subset of trials this evidence reaches criterion for report. It's therefore also surprising that the CPP and FC\u03b8 signals for both \"Go\" and \"Undetected errors\" (which are matched for motor output) were also near-identical (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Doesn't this finding go against the notion that these signals are accumulating noisy evidence to a bound? Or are these signals instead indexing the criterion for error reporting?

There is no manipulation of \"evidence\" strength (i.e. where faster accumulation would proceed for larger evidence), and no speed-accuracy trade-off manipulation to test for some kind of bounded accumulation, either of which would provide stronger support that the error detection process reflects a similar sequential sampling of evidence. Thus the authors should discuss and/or address this limitation."

This decreases confidence in the robustness and thus the replicability of these full sets of findings and raises concerns of \"p-hacking\" based on the best of many seemingly arbitrary analytic choices (which I do not think are arbitrary at all). In particular, in paragraph four of the subsection \u201cEEG acquisition and preprocessing\u201d the authors describe the use of differing baseline procedures for frontal theta, which is potentially problematic. As the authors allude to (\"leaving within-condition trial-by-trial fluctuations in baseline power intact\"), condition-specific pre-stimulus baselines could have important influence on the appropriate level of trial-to-trial vs trial-specific inference, yet it could also simply add spurious variance into the dB ratio of post-event power. The authors do not distinguish between these possibilities or otherwise adequately justify their approach. Moreover, the between-subjects contrasts were not baseline corrected and the authors describe how both are \"important source(s) of variance contributing to the reported effects\". The authors need to do a more compelling job of justifying their analytic choices based on a principled, a priori framework, for example a common cross-condition baseline for all contrasts (see Cohen 2014: Analyzing Neural Time Series Data, MIT Press)."

Comparing <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, FC\u03b8 power differentiates between RTd earlier than CPP, but could this be due to the influence of neighbouring timepoints on the wavelet measure? This could be addressed with narrow-band wavelets or a filter-HIlbert approach. In single-trial analyses the FC\u03b8 power window (-0.1 to +0.4s) extends beyond the window at which the CPP build-up rate is calculated (+0.1 to +0.3s; Methods, paragraph three of the subsection \u201cAnalysis of electrophysiological decision signals\u201d). It's therefore odd to enter FC\u03b8 as a cause of CPP in a mediation analysis given that the relevant part of the former potentially takes place after the latter. Putting aside the issue of timing, could the assumed causality be further bolstered by flipping the nodes in the mediation analysis, i.e. could the authors show that FC\u03b8 does not mediate the influence of CPP build-up on RTd?"

But the second-order CPP increases only on error trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). If the second-order decision is analogous to the first (i.e. a race between neural subpopulations controlling whether or not to press the button based on fluctuating evidence), then presumably there should also be accumulation towards a no-go bound in the second-order, confident-in-being-correct case. Doesn't this mismatch between first-order and second-order CPP features weaken the conclusion that the same DV mechanism underpins first- and second-order decisions? It would be interesting to hear the author's perspective on this. For instance the second-order CPP could reflect evidence accumulation from endogenous activities towards an overt error detection response, but the authors also argue the first-order CPP is also involved in evidence accumulation leading to a non-response (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

For instance the ERP analysis in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> only directly contrasts undetected and detected errors, but there appears to be a difference between go and undetected errors later in the time course.

Indeed, a key strength of our modelling approach is to show that even though we make very few assumptions beyond this basic feature of sequential sampling models, our one-choice model is able to reproduce both observed error detection behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>) and the associated neural dynamics (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) \u2013 including, of particular note, the negative-going trial-averaged trajectory of the CPP on undetected errors.

However, we note that similar trial-averaged neural dynamics on Go and undetected error trials are not necessarily inconsistent with a post-decision accumulation account. Go trials are also likely to be associated with varying levels of error evidence (e.g. on tasks that evoke response conflict, FC\u03b8 power has been shown to vary strongly across correct trials and be predictive of task behavior, even within conflict conditions; Cohen &amp; Cavanagh, 2011). Although in most cases the error evidence is likely to be weak, the presence of a minority of trials with elevated error evidence may be sufficient to yield equivalent trial-averaged signals to those observed on undetected error trials, which represent the subset of error trials on which the internal representation of evidence was weakest. This possibility accommodates our current modelling efforts which, as described above, specify that post-decisional accumulation takes place on both undetected and detected error trials. We do generally agree with the reviewers that our findings are not decisive about the nature of the relationship between the first- and second-order decision processes, and that this remains a key area of future inquiry. We have now attempted to further highlight this point in the Discussion section of our manuscript (paragraph six)."

By contrast, a central aspect of our results is the demonstration that the decision signals that we describe persist for an extended period of time after first-order response execution even in the explicit absence of any new sensory input. This approach allowed us to verify that truly metacognitive error detection decisions are preceded by a CPP that exhibits the critical properties of a build-to-threshold decision variable as specified by sequential sampling models (an RT-predictive build-up rate and threshold amplitude at response), which itself constitutes the strongest neurophysiological support to date for the existence of post-decision accumulation.

These decisions required active processing of the stimulus information presented on each trial and, as we (subsection \u201cTask behaviour\u201d) and the reviewers point out, are typically understood in terms of a race between two competing accumulators \u2013 one for \u2018Go\u2019 and one for \u2018Don\u2019t Go\u2019 (Boucher et al., 2007; Gomez et al., 2007; Logan & Cowan, 1984; Verbruggen & Logan, 2009). In this kind of context, where two distinct alternatives must be arbitrated between given the current sensory information, we have previously shown that the CPP reflects the evidence accumulation process for decisions in favor of either alternative (Kelly & O\u2019Connell, 2013). By contrast, for their second-order task of error detection, participants needed to engage in a process that is akin to signal detection: if there is sufficient evidence available that an error has been committed, then simply execute a response to indicate this. We (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012) and others (e.g. Hillyard et al., 1971) have shown that the CPP/P3 in such detection contexts is clearly evident for hits (detected errors in the present context) but absent for misses (undetected errors)."

By contrast, simple perceptual detection tasks are thought to be determined by a competition between \u2018No/stimulus absent\u2019 and \u2018Yes/stimulus present\u2019 pools of neurons (e.g. Deco et al., 2007). The \u2018No\u2019 pool receives a static input and dominates the competition by default, whereas the \u2018Yes\u2019 pool is activated by stimulus information (or in our scenario, by \u2018error evidence\u2019). On hit trials (detected errors), the 'Yes' pool eventually dominates the competition and becomes highly activated; on miss trials (undetected errors), it fails to do so and there ends up being little-to-no evoked increase in firing rate in either pool.

Similarly only go-trial build-up rates are documented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>. I suggest including the comparison between go and undetected CPP and FC\u03b8 timecourses as a supplemental figure to cover this issue.</i> "

We have now included an additional figure supplement as recommended by the reviewer (labelled \u2018<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2019 in the latest submission), which displays direct comparisons of the CPP, fronto-central ERP and FC\u03b8 signals on Go trials and undetected errors. These analyses did not yield clear and robust effects for the CPP and FC\u03b8 signals (panels A and C of the new supplement), but as the reviewer correctly points out, there is a clear difference in fronto-central ERP amplitude that manifests from approximately 400ms post-response (panel B). We do not have a clear hypothesis about the functional significance of this effect and do not discuss it in detail in the revised submission. But we do acknowledge that the effect hints that these trial types may be at least partially dissociable in terms of underlying neural dynamics. We now draw attention to this interesting point in the revised manuscript (Discussion, paragraph six) in the context of our discussion about the inability of our model to provide a precise explanation for the apparent equivalence of the CPP on Go trials and undetected errors."
