Activation-induced deaminase (AID) can drive lymphomagenesis by generating off-target DNA breaks at loci that harbor highly active enhancers and display convergent transcription. The first active transcriptional profiles from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients acquired here reveal striking similarity at structural variation (SV) sites. Specific transcriptional features, namely convergent transcription and Pol2 stalling, were detected at breakpoints. The overlap was most prominent at SV with recognition motifs for the recombination activating genes (RAG). We present signal feature analysis to detect vulnerable regions and quantified from human cells how convergent transcription contributes to R-loop generation and RNA polymerase stalling. Wide stalling regions were characterized by high DNAse hypersensitivity and unusually broad H3K4me3 signal. Based on 1382 pre-B-ALL patients, the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion positive patients had over ten-fold elevation in RAG1 while high expression of AID marked pre-B-ALL lacking common cytogenetic changes."

Activation-induced deaminase (AID) can drive lymphomagenesis by generating off-target DNA breaks at loci that harbor highly active enhancers and display convergent transcription. The first active transcriptional profiles from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients acquired here reveal striking similarity at structural variation (SV) sites. Specific transcriptional features, namely convergent transcription and Pol2 stalling, were detected at breakpoints. The overlap was most prominent at SV with recognition motifs for the recombination activating genes (RAG). We present signal feature analysis to detect vulnerable regions and quantified from human cells how convergent transcription contributes to R-loop generation and RNA polymerase stalling. Wide stalling regions were characterized by high DNAse hypersensitivity and unusually broad H3K4me3 signal. Based on 1382 pre-B-ALL patients, the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion positive patients had over ten-fold elevation in RAG1 while high expression of AID marked pre-B-ALL lacking common cytogenetic changes."

This revealed that in the error-prone DNA regions, two processes \u2013 called convergent transcription and transcriptional stalling \u2013 interfere with transcription. Both processes temporarily leave the normally double-stranded DNA unzipped as two single strands and free of nucleosomes, which makes DNA more vulnerable to breaking. This would explain how pieces of DNA might be lost, added, or moved to cause the genetic errors that lead to leukemia."

Further studies are now needed to investigate the exact roles of these protein complexes. This could eventually help scientists devise strategies to protect the DNA of people with leukemia from these errors, which could reduce the risk of the cancer reoccurring."

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of ETV6-RUNX1 (also known as TEL-AML1) positive acute leukemias suggested that the secondary lesions are predominantly caused by off-target activity of the RAG complex (<a href=\"#bib29\">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</a>). In a similar fashion, the expression of the AID complex in more mature B cells is implicated in genomic instability and development of lymphomas (<a href=\"#bib27\">Meng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Qian et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Robbiani et al. 2015</a>).

Cells incorporate multiple strategies to control the action of the RAG complex to appropriate genomic loci: the expression of <i>RAG1</i> and <i>RAG2</i> is limited to precursor stages of lymphocytes, the activity of the complex is attenuated during S-phase of cell cycle, and RAG cleavage is directed towards RSS pair containing sequences (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</a>). The engagement of RAG2 is further limited by the histone modification H3K4me3, which is typically found at transcription start sites (TSS) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matthews et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Teng et al., 2015</a>).

Notably, VH gene segment recombination by RAG at the IgH locus coincides with sense- and antisense transcription (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bolland et al., 2004</a>), which could be relevant also at off-target sites. Secondly, stalled polymerases, which are found at exons, R-loops and actively paused at TSS regions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</a>), expose single stranded DNA, recruiting AID via Spt5 binding (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pavri et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, the polymerase complex displaces nucleosomes completely or partially (the H2A/H2B moiety), which in vitro\u00a0promotes cleavage by RAGs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</a>). Despite these intriguing findings, the relevance of transcription-coupled processes has not been systematically characterized, and the clinical relevance of RAG and AID expression in the different leukemia subtypes remains unclear. RNA polymerases engaged into primary transcription across the genome can be measured using Global-Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, this method is ideally suited to distinguish features of transcription at SV sites, including convT and RNA polymerase stalling. To this end, we acquired the first patient profiles of nascent transcriptional activity in leukemic blasts representing seven cytogenetic subgroups and performed integrative analysis of various genome-wide profiles and patient transcriptomes."

(<b>D</b>) The TAD visualized represents a genomic region that harbors most SV in HeH (see <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a> for the hypodiploid SV hotspot). The GRO-seq signal (track from patient 1) indicates a novel locus with abundant transcription in leukemic samples (refer to <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a> for all GRO-seq profiles). The highest recurrence of SV occurs at the convT overlapping mid-region (zoom-in panel), which has also two ETV6-RUNX1 breakpoints."

However, we noticed that the recurrent breakpoints often lied several kb downstream of TSS, as highlighted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and D</a> (see inserts), and coincided with simultaneous transcription on both strands, ie. convT spanning a minimum of 100 bp. In closer examination of the signal data from leukemia SV hotspots, many of these regions likely correspond to transcription from intragenic enhancers that generate enhancer RNAs (eRNA) that are typically a few kb in size (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kaikkonen et al. 2013</a>). In agreement, a significant enrichment of breakpoints in enhancers overlapping with convT was observed (hypergeometric test P=0.00012 for intergenic and P=4.6e-08 for all enhancers identified based on eRNA signal, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). An overlapping eRNA transcript at the TSS region of <i>PAX5,</i> confirmed by the active enhancer chromatin marker H3K27ac, led to convT extending nearly 20 kb, with SV sites located between 3.7\u20139.7 kb downstream of the TSS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, see insert)."

The observed signal features were highly reproducible between biological replicates and shared among a subset of cytogenetic groups (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We hypothesized that they represent RNA polymerase II (Pol2) stalling events. Previous analyses of Pol2 stalling have focused on promoter proximal regions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>). To examine such events genome-wide and across gene bodies, we developed a general analysis approach that identifies change points within gene regions and reports those with high elevation in the signal level (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a> for the identified regions) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Killick et al., 2012</a>). As additional confirmation, we analyzed stalling from Pol2 ChIP-seq in the REH and Nalm6 cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To distinguish between different Pol2 complexes (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>), antibodies against the serine 2 or serine 5 phosphorylated Pol2 were used (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

With this in mind, we investigated regions where off-targeting could occur via R-loops by focusing on breakpoints without RSS-motifs (data shown in figures represents the 416 ETV6-RUNX1 NR-breakp, refer to <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 3</a> for all statistical results). We observed significant genome-wide enrichment of breakpoints with the investigated transcriptional features (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and F, 29% overlap with Pol2 stalling within gene regions, binomial test P=4.088e-07; 9% genome-wide overlap with convT, P=5.16e-07). This enrichment of breakpoints to convT and Pol2 stalling regions was significant across a wide range of transcriptional activity (refer to <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Co-occurrence of breakpoints within a 1-kb window was used to distinguish non-recurrent (one breakpoint) and recurrent (more than one breakpoint) events (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Breakpoint recurrence was found to increase the overlap with both Pol2 stalling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)and convT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The mean overlap observed in 1000-fold random sampling (grey bars) confirmed the specificity of the overlap (note that Pol2 stalling is analyzed from intragenic regions only). The breakpoints in Pol2 stalling sites were concordant with analysis using Pol2 ChIP-seq (by 78%) and they co-localized with both Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylated forms of Pol2 complex (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We hypothesized that locally depleted nucleosomes around the Pol2 complex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</a>) may enhance access to RSS/RSS-like sequences. To this end, we retrieved DNAse hypersensitivity data from ENCODE (<a href=\"#bib48\">The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</a>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). DNAse-seq signal peaks were significantly wider when overlapping with Pol2 stalling sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). A 876 bp (95% CI, 855\u2013896) increase was observed in B-lymphoblastoid cells and 412 bp (95% CI, 395\u2013429) in ES cells (Wilcoxon rank sum test P&lt;2.2e-16 in both cell types, see also <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>). This was reproducibly observed using peaks located within gene TSS, body or end regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We selected TSS regions with RSS motifs for closer examination and found that Pol2 stalling sites at these TSS were significantly wider than at other TSS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), with a difference of 259 bp (95% CI, 79\u2013475 bp, Wilcoxon rank sum test P=0.0024). Thus, wide Pol2 stalling increases the likelihood of RSS motif occurrence in accessible chromatin. The width of stalling did not correlate positively (Pearson\u2019s correlation \u22120.11; 95% CI, \u22120.09 to \u22120.13) with the transcription level of the corresponding gene, indicating that stalling events, and not just active transcription, are important. We further analyzed the top 5% of widest Pol2 stalling regions by comparing them to widest peaks from DNAse hypersensitivity and ChIP for histone marks (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The odds ratios for the overlap are visualized as a heatmap (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, OR&gt;10 is shown in darkest color tone, refer to <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> for more statistics). In addition to DNAse-seq and Pol2 ChIP peaks, the H3K4me3 was found among the top category, confirmed also by ChIP-seq data acquired from REH and Nalm6 cells (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Among samples with annotation of cytogenetic subtype (N\u00a0=\u00a01008), the ETV6-RUNX1 cases (N\u00a0=\u00a0153) exhibited 10.8-fold higher median level of <i>RAG1</i> expression relative to other cases with annotated cytogenetic type (Wilcoxon rank sum test P&lt;2.2e-16, 95% CI 8.6\u201313.6-fold, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and also high <i>RAG2</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Moreover, <i>AICDA</i> expression was also detected in a specific subset of patients. It was highest in the 'other' group (N\u00a0=\u00a0267) that does not carry recurrent fusion genes or karyotypic changes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, no statistical evaluation was performed as majority of signal values were below detection level of 4.2 in log2 scale). As comparison, we carried out unsupervised analysis of sample similarities based on the global gene expression profiles. To visualize these molecular subtypes in two dimensions, we utilized the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method (<a href=\"#bib49\">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</a>) (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, refer to <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a> for coordinates).

The discrete expression states (high; low; not detected) of <i>RAG1, RAG2</i> and <i>AICDA</i> were evident in distinct groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>, respectively, the annotated ALL subtypes are colored in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Upon further examination, high levels of <i>AICDA</i> expression were particularly prevalent in sample clusters that corresponded to high risk cases from two independent ALL datasets (hypergeometric test P=7.19e-47, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>, see <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Supplementary file 5</a> for patient characteristics). The highest level of <i>AICDA</i> expression was presented by a relapsed ALL case, and the <i>RAG1</i> and <i>RAG2</i> expression levels were 3.09- and 1.93-fold increased at relapse, respectively. Based on the integrated patient profiles, the expression of AID and RAG is distinct in leukemia subtypes and clinical prognosis groups."

Recently, a functional role of transcription in genomic instability has begun to emerge (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hatchi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sollier et al., 2014</a>). The maturing lymphoid cells are vulnerable to off-target effects downstream of RAG and AID activity that is required for immune gene rearrangement (<a href=\"#bib27\">Meng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Qian et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">Swaminathan et al., 2015</a>). The present study represents a systematic investigation of SVs detected in acute pre-B-cell leukemia using WGS in the context of global transcriptional activity in leukemic cells.

While protein-coding secondary hits required in disease progression have been recognized for some time, our integrative analysis identified several putative long non-coding RNAs and eRNAs, which merit further investigation. Earlier work has linked eRNAs generated from intragenic superenhancers with AID-mediated instability in lymphomas (<a href=\"#bib27\">Meng et al., 2014</a>), proposing that convT leads to arrested transcription, in agreement with experimental evidence from yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prescott and Proudfoot, 2002</a>).

We further demonstrate a link between convT and elevated R-loop levels and Pol2 stalling on a genome-wide level, with evidence from normal and leukemic human cells.

Previous studies investigating motif recognition and genome-wide binding profiles of RAGs have shed light on the mechanisms how this complex is recruited to DNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">Teng et al., 2015</a>); however these studies have been carried out using normal cells or mouse models that limit their integration with patient WGS data. The chromatin mark H3K4me3 typically found at active promoters serves as a docking site for RAG2 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matthews et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">Teng et al., 2015</a>). RAG-mediated cleavage further requires recognition of RSS motifs by RAG1 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</a>). Our results revealed that TSS that carry breakpoints with an RSS motif differ from unaffected TSS by the presence of unusually wide Pol2 stalling. We show that Pol2 stalling sites, in general, have increased DNA accessibility. Further, the top 5% of widest stalling regions are characterized by unusually broad DNAse hypersensitive regions and H3K4me3 signal. Unique regulation of Pol2 pausing and elongation has been recognized to be related to broad H3K4me3 domains across a wide variety of cell types (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benayoun et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">Scheidegger and Nechaev, 2016</a>).

The feasibility of our approach was confirmed by high overlap of detected regions with RLFS rich regions that represent known structural obstacles to the progression of transcription (<a href=\"#bib41\">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014b</a>). Furthermore, analysis of Pol2 stalling from Pol2 ChIP-seq profiles acquired in pre-B-ALL cells had high agreement with the GRO-seq profiles. The slowing of Pol2 upon transition from initiation to elongation, measured by the Pol2 Ser5 phosphorylation, occurs at AID hypermutation sites within the IgH-V region (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>).

Moreover, a negative effect on patient survival and increased relapse frequency were observed in high <i>AICDA</i> expressing leukemia patients (<a href=\"#bib46\">Swaminathan et al., 2015</a>). We found that high expression of <i>RAG1/2</i> or <i>AICDA</i> is markedly distinct between different subtypes of pre-B-ALL at the leukemia state. Prevalent <i>AICDA</i> expression was a distinguishing feature of high risk pre-B-ALL cases, in line with the previous data (<a href=\"#bib46\">Swaminathan et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the molecular profiles of patients belonging to the cytogenetic subtype designated as 'other', had high similarity, placing them in close proximity on the t-SNE map. This genetically heterogeneous category of rare cytogenetic types had a distinct elevation in <i>AICDA</i> expression. Further investigation of the WGS profiles focusing on this patient category may shed light on whether <i>AICDA</i> expression could serve as a putative underlying factor that may spur the diversity of DNA lesions in these patients. Similarly, the over ten-fold higher <i>RAG1</i> expression could also be relevant for the prevalent development of leukemia carrying the ETV6-RUNX1 initiating fusion. The <i>RAG</i> locus is under complex regulation of local chromatin looping by SATB1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hao et al., 2015</a>) that controls silencing and activating regulatory elements and was shown to directly control the elevated <i>RAG1</i> expression in mice.

The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and a written informed consent was received by the patient and/or guardians. In addition, three ALL cell lines (REH, Kopn-8 and Nalm-6) representing different genetic subtypes (ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, MLL rearrangement and 'other') were included to complement the dataset. REH (ACC-20), Nalm6 (ACC-128), and Kopn8 (ACC-552) cell lines were obtained from the Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Germany). Mycoplasma status was defined negative by PCR (PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit I/C, PromoCell GmbH, Germany) for all cells. The cell lines were authenticated by PCR of known fusion genes: ETV6-RUNX1 in REH, MLL-MLLT1 in Kopn8, and the lack of recurrent fusions in Nalm6. In addition, the generated genome-wide results can be used in verification of cell line specific markers. We reasoned that a collection of samples that represent both primary blasts and cell lines of different cytogenetics types (and genetic complexity) would be ideal to capture the patterns of transcriptional activity in the lymphoid lineage and leukemic cells.

For nuclei extractions in co-culture experiments, same cell lines with different culture conditions but with same time points were processed simultaneously. For example, total of eight extractions from REH cells were performed ('Sample name' column), in six slightly different culture conditions ('Cell culture type' and 'Time point (h)' columns), and with two replicate samples collected for two conditions in independent experiments ('Biological replicate' column). There were no technical replicates in the sense that multiple nuclei extractions would have been made from the same biological replicate. Patient samples (N\u00a0=\u00a07) collected represent different cytogenetic subtypes and were used as additional confirmation at individual gene loci: for most subtypes N\u00a0=\u00a01, except hyperdiploid N\u00a0=\u00a02; ETV6-RUNX1 is represented also by the REH cell line; and replicate samples were generated for Patient 1 that correspond to cultured and freshly isolated cells. (Re-analyzed GRO-seq data: lymphoblastoid data is from three donors; ESC data is from two independent experiments where several technical replicates were pooled). For cell culture conditions and further details, see <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. The nuclei isolation was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</a>), yielding ~1\u20135\u00d710<sup>6</sup> nuclei per condition. The REH, Nalm6, lymphoblastoid and ES cell samples that represent very deeply sequenced data, were used in the genome-wide analysis (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, GEO accession numbers for deposited pre-B-ALL data: GSE67519 and GSE67540)."

The cells were pelleted for 10\u2009min at 400 \u00d7 g and resuspended in 500 \u00b5l of swelling buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol. Subsequently, 500 \u00b5l of swelling buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol and 1% Igepal was added drop by drop to the cells while being vortexed gently.

Subsequently, a poly-A tailing reaction (PolyA polymerase, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was performed according to manufacturer`s instructions, followed by circularization and re-linearization. The cDNA templates were PCR amplified (Illumina barcoding) for 11\u201314 cycles and size selected to 180\u2013300 bp length. The ready libraries were quantified (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit on a Qubit fluorometer, Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and pooled for 50 bp single-end sequencing with Illumina Hi-Seq2000 (GeneCore, EMBL Heidelberg, Germany).

Ser5 phosphorylation is present before the Pol2 is released to active elongation and it diminishes within the gene body and is greatly reduced downstream of the poly(A) site, where Ser2 phosphorylation is predominantly found (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). For ChIP, 40 million cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10\u201315 mins. The reactions were quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125\u2009mM, and the cells were centrifuged and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. For ChIP 5 or 10 million cells were used (Pol2 or H3K4me3, respectively). Nuclei were extracted by washing cell pellet twice with 1\u2009ml of MNase buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris ph 7.4, 10\u00a0mM NaCl, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 [Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany], 1x protease inhibitor cocktail [PIC, Roche, Basel, Switzerland], 1\u2009mM PMSF [Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA]). Nuclei were spun down (1500 \u00d7 g, +4\u00b0C, 5\u2009min) and suspended into 90\u00a0\u00b5l of MNase buffer supplemented with 5\u00a0mM CaCl2 and 0.1% Triton-X. Different amounts of MNase (0.5\u201320\u00a0U; #88216, Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to the nuclei in 10 \u00b5l volume and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 mins. To stop the reaction, 100 \u00b5l of 2x Lysis buffer was added to the reaction (1% SDS, 40\u00a0mM EDTA, 100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1) and samples were sonicated using Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 5 cycles (30\u00a0s\u00a0-\u00a030\u2009s) to break the nuclei. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and supernatant was diluted with RIPA buffer (for Pol2 antibodies, 1X PBS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, PIC) or dilution buffer (for H3K4me3; 20\u00a0mM Trix-HCl pH 7.4, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5% TritonX, PIC). The diluted lysate was pre-cleared by rotating for 2\u2009h at 4\u00b0C with 60 \u00b5l 80% CL-4B sepharose slurry (GE Healthcare, UK). Before use, sepharose was washed twice with TE buffer, blocked for 1\u00a0hr min at room temperature with 0.5% BSA and 20 \u00b5g/ml glycogen in 1\u2009ml TE buffer, washed twice with TE and brought up to the original volume with TE. The beads were discarded, and 1% of the supernatant were kept as ChIP input. The protein of interest was immunoprecipitated by rotating the supernatant with 3\u20135 \u00b5g antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Antibodies against Ser2P (cat# ab5095, RRID:AB_304749) and Ser5P (cat# ab5131, RRID:AB_449369) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). The Ab was captured using 25 \u00b5l blocked Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, UK)\u00a0and rotating the sample for 2\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C.\u00a0Sepharose was blocked as CL-4B above, except that it was rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The beads were pelleted (1\u2009min, 1000\u00d7g, 4\u00b0C) and the supernatant discarded. The beads used to bind Ser2P/5P Ab were washed five times with 5X LiCl IP wash buffer (100\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 500\u2009mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Sodium deoxycholate) and twice with TE in 0.45 \u00b5m filter cartridges (Ultrafree MC, Millipore,\u00a0Bedford, MA, USA). The beads used to pull down H3K4me3 Ab were washed three times with wash buffer I (20\u2009mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2\u2009mM EDTA), twice with buffer II (20\u2009mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 500\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2\u2009mM EDTA) and buffer III (10\u2009mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 250\u2009mM LiCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1\u2009mM EDTA), once with TE\u00a0+\u00a00.2% TritonX and twice with TE. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted twice with 100 \u00b5l elution buffer (TE, 1% SDS). The NaCl concentration was adjusted to 300\u2009mM with 5\u2009M NaCl and crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65\u00b0C. The samples were sequentially incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2\u2009h each with 0.33 mg/ml RNase A and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (both from\u00a0Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA was isolated using the ChIP DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (Zymo Research,\u00a0Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sequencing libraries were prepared from collected DNA by blunting, A-tailing, adaptor ligation as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>) using barcoded adapters (NextFlex, Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX, USA). Between the reactions, the DNA was purified using Sera-Mag SpeedBeads (Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Libraries were PCR-amplified for 15\u201316 cycles, size selected for 230\u2013350bp fragments by gel extraction and single-end sequenced on a Hi-Seq 2000 (Illumina) for 50 cycles."

Specifically, the quality of raw sequencing reads was confirmed using the FastQC tool (<a href=\"http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/\">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</a>) and subsequently bases with poor quality scores were trimmed (requiring a minimum 97% of all bases in one read to have a min phred quality score of 10) using the FastX toolkit (<a href=\"http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/\">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</a>).

To identify TADs with highest frequency of breakpoints, HiC-data analysis was performed using HOMER 4.3. As our goal is to generate a natural division of the genome into sub-regions that are relevant in context of transcriptional regulation, this approach is superior to arbitrarily assigning sub-regions based on fixed windows. The pre-B-ALL breakpoints and annotation data (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andersson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Holmfeldt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Paulsson et al., 2015</a>) were analyzed in context of TADs. Specifically, TADs were overlapped with subtype-specific breakpoints (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> presents TADs sorted based on the count of breakpoints). Subsequently, TADs with breakpoints were divided into quartiles based on breakpoint frequency per bp to analyze enrichment of feature overlap that exceeds the genomic background level. To obtain the total transcribed area width within each TAD, the TAD coordinates were overlapped with the detected GRO-seq transcripts (bedtools intersect -wao). The combined SV data represents in total 1680 breakpoints and is the most comprehensive collection of pre-B-ALL SV that we are aware of."

Both approximate and exact methods exist for estimating the point at which the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change. The analysis of changepoints in the signal mean was carried out using functions implemented in the R package \u2018changepoint\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Killick and Eckley, 2014</a>). An exact method with favorable computational cost was recently introduced in context of time-series data (<a href=\"#bib22\">Killick et al., 2012</a>). This method called PELT was selected to detect the changepoints from scaled (zero mean, equal variance) signal profiles calculated at 50-bp resolution (generated bedGraph files are available under the GEO accession GSE67540). The analysis was performed separately for each gene, using Bayesian Information Criterion as a penalty term with the changepoint counted as a parameter (function cpt.mean with parameters penalty = 'BIC1', method ='PELT'). The input dataset representing primary transcription activity at gene loci was generated by overlapping the GRO-seq signal file strand-specifically with transcript coordinates from UCSC and Refseq (see genomic regions used). The analysis only considered regions with annotation match (in minimum 5% of identified transcript covered by annotation; a minimum of 50% overlap with the identified transcript; annotated and detected starts do not differ more than 10 kb). In order to define Pol2 stalling sites, the signal level between changepoints were compared to the median across the whole gene, and intervals above 90% quantile were reported as stalled. For ChIP-seq, this cut-off was relaxed to 80% due to higher background signal. Notice also that there is no strand information based on ChIP-seq. The analysis was carried out separately for each of the deeply sequenced (REH, Nalm6 and lymphoblastoid) GRO-seq datasets and ChIP-seq replicates and subsequently merged to one bed file specifying stalled region coordinates (bedTools merge \u2013d 100). The ES GRO-seq dataset GSE41009 was processed similarly and used as an independent control. To study whether there was a relationship between the stalled region size overlapping TSS regions and R-breakp frequency, the following intersects were calculated using BEDTools (intersectBed -wa | uniq): (i) overlap of Pol2 stalling sites and TSS regions harboring R-breakp and (ii) overlap of Pol2 stalling sites and TSS regions not harboring R- or NR-breakp. Subsequently, the sizes of Pol2 stalling sites in each coordinate file were calculated and the Wilcoxon rank sum test used for evaluating statistical significance for the difference in Pol2 stalling width. Secondly, top 5% widest Pol2 stalling sites were identified and compared to top 5% widest peaks from ChIP-seq and DNAse-seq profiles (see below)."

In total, 1382 pre-B-ALL samples were included. Probe-level quality control was performed to exclude samples with very high difference in data location or distribution as measured by median and interquartile range of raw probe intensities. Samples that passed this filtering were processed using the RMA probe summarization algorithm with probe mapping to Entrez Gene IDs (from BrainArray version 18.0.0, ENTREZG), followed by bias correction using the R package \u2018bias\u2019. The Barnes-Hut-SNE algorithm (computationally faster approximation of t-SNE) implementation from the R package \u2018Rtsne\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Krijthe, 2015</a>) was used to discover near-optimal representation of sample distances in two dimensions (using parameter values perplexity 30 and theta 0.5) using 15% genes with highest variance. The t-SNE method belongs to dimensionality reduction methods that include also traditional methods such as Principal Component Analysis. The main objective of the method is to accurately place highly similar samples (here based on the high-dimensional gene expression profile) to close proximities in lower dimensions. The result can be visualized in two-dimensions as a scatter plot that allows observing sample groups based on the molecular profiles. According to our experience, this method provides better separation between sample groups compared to more traditional methods for large heterogeneous sample collections. To identify whether a given gene was expressed or unexpressed in a sample, a Gaussian finite mixture model (testing equal and variable variance models, best fit chosen by BIC) was fitted by expectation-maximization algorithm to the probe signals (R package \u2018mclust\u2019, version 4.3, <a href=\"#bib9\">Fraley and Raftery, 2002</a>)."

The sampling was performed 1000-fold within the same genomic context as used in the analysis. To estimate the significance of overlap between stitched breakpoint regions with e.g. convT regions, the stitched regions were allocated random genomic coordinates, thus preserving the size distribution and breakpoint event frequencies within stitched regions. The observed random region overlap was used as the empirical p-value estimate. Further, the z-test was used to evaluate whether there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the observed feature overlap value would belong to the empirical distribution obtained."

The clinical relevance of comparing RNA expression in samples from fully established leukemia (i.e. diagnostic samples) between subtypes, has been addressed and supported with patient data in the earlier work by Swaminathan et. al 2015 Nat Immunol. Specifically, in their Results section Swaminathan et al. write \u201cWe correlated AICDA mRNA expression in patients at diagnosis with overall and relapse-free survival. [\u2026] Notably, higher-than-median AICDA expression was strongly indicative of poor overall patient survival(P = 0.026; Supplementary <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left [shown using The ECOG E2993 trial that included 215 patients: 106 bone marrow samples and 109 peripheral blood samples]). Likewise, higher-than-median RAG1 mRNA abundance was indicative of shorter relapse-free and overall survival of patients with ALL (Supplementary <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, center and right). In a comparison of AICDA mRNA expression in matched sample pairs at diagnosis and relapse, for most patients, AICDA mRNA abundance was increased at relapse (Supplementary <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> [shown using 49 patients relapsed after successful initial therapy from COG P9906 trial]). These findings suggested that AICDA expression at diagnosis can be used to predict the outcome of patients with ALL.\u201d"

The RLFS sequence motif alone did not display a strong enrichment trend for recurrent sites. However, we found that convT can contribute to R-loop generation based on DRIP-seq data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and that convT overlap was increased at recurrent breakpoints. Although the experimental evidence for R-loops used in our analysis comes from non-B-lineage cells (ES cells), the biochemical mechanism for recruitment of AID or similar complexes binding to R-loops is unlikely to be cell-specific. Overall, our results are consistent with the mechanism proposed for convT/Pol2 stalling mediated AID recruitment in lymphomas (Pavri et al. 2010, Meng et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2014), and we have included experimental and sequence-level motif data to support a mechanistic link between genetic instability and convT and Pol2 stalling.

However, this is rarely observed (reviewed in Jonkers and Lis, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, 16, 167\u2013177, 2015). A Pol2 stalling region corresponds to elevated signal within an actively transcribed region. As described in the review by Jonkers and Lis, Pol2 has been documented to slow down e.g. at exons (to facilitate splicing), R-loops (difficult structurally to transcribe) and is actively paused at TSS regions (regulated by phosphorylation, this type of pausing typically occurs within the first 50-200 bp). Each of these events are visible as a signal increase in GRO-seq. Our changepoint analysis assigns a relative increase in the signal (cut-off at highest 90%) within a transcribed region as a Pol2 stalling site, which corresponds to local slowing of Pol2. Notice that the signal data is scaled and analyzed separately for different gene regions."

Using a similar analysis of the signal profile to detect Pol2 stalling from the ChIP-seq profile, we found highest overlap of RSS-motif containing SV sites with the Ser5 form, typically considered as the paused/stalled Pol2. However, also locally elevated Ser2 phosphorylated Pol2 has been found to be relevant for genomic instability (Hatchi et al. 2015): in this case the stalling typically occurs at gene ends.

As a second measure, we used the total GRO-seq read count per TAD. A new figure has been added to show how the activity of transcription increases in the TADs with highest breakpoint frequency (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), supporting a transcription-coupled mechanism. We have further provided a new control that shows the% of transcribed region spanned by convT/Pol2 stalling (new <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This result confirmed that the enrichments we see are not just a reflection of total transcriptional activity. We also binned genes by their transcription level for the analysis of recurrent breakpoints, similarly to control for the effect of transcription (new <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>)."
