In a given multisensory neuron in the colliculus, the amount of integration is dependent on both the overlap between spatial receptive fields for the two stimulus modalities and the time window between stimulus presentations in a crossmodal pair (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meredith et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Meredith and Stein, 1996</a>).

The prevalent experimental models of multisensory integration have been the superior colliculus of cats and rodents and to some degree the optic tectum of the barn owl; their location within the animal makes these structures difficult to access with whole-cell recording techniques in vivo and impossible to isolate in vitro without significantly disrupting the neural networks in which they operate. In Xenopus laevis tadpoles, the optic tectum is superficially located and thus accessible for whole-cell recordings in vivo (<a href=\"#bib19\">Khakhalin et al., 2014</a>) and can be isolated in an intact whole-brain preparation for recordings ex vivo (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pratt and Aizenman, 2007</a>). This is a tremendous advantage over other preparations, where assessing synaptic events during MSI is usually inferred from local extracellular field potentials."

Tectal neurons also undergo dramatic change in their intrinsic excitability (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ciarleglio et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pratt and Aizenman, 2007</a>), and behavioral data demonstrate that even young Xenopus tadpoles generate behavioral responses to visual and mechanosensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Roberts et al., 2009</a>). We used a whole brain ex vivo preparation which allows us to preserve intact the relevant brain circuits (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wu et al., 1996</a>). We isolated inputs carrying either visual or mechanosensory information by placing stimulating electrodes in the optic chiasm to activate visual pathways (V) and in the contralateral hindbrain to activate mechanosensory pathways (HB; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Previous descriptions of crossmodal integration, evidenced in either the number or temporal distribution of action potentials, reveal that the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between two crossmodal inputs is a key factor that determines the direction and magnitude of the integrative response (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meredith et al., 1987</a>). This temporal relationship can be further modulated by the relative size of the individual responses, where greater multisensory enhancement is observed if the stronger modality precedes the weaker one (<a href=\"#bib30\">Miller et al., 2015</a>). To assess how ISI influences the ability of Xenopus tectal neurons to integrate crossmodal stimulus pairs, we performed cell-attached recordings from tectal neuron somata to measure individual spikes evoked by stimulation of sensory inputs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Stimulus intensities were set such that response sizes for each modality were roughly matched. We systematically varied the time interval between the two electrical stimuli delivered to the different sensory pathways. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows examples of spike time raster plots at different ISI\u2019s in both developmental groups. From these examples two observations become evident. First that paired responses have a faster onset and can have a greater gain than single modality responses. And second that these changes show a temporal dependence on ISI. The temporal dependence of crossmodal responses on ISI is revealed in the population means of the Multi-Sensory Index (MSIn; see Materials and methods) values from both developmental groups (stages 44\u201346 and stages 48\u201349; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In general, greater and more-positive MSIn values were observed as a result of shorter inter-stimulus intervals, whereas negative MSIn values\u2014indicating a suppression of responses due to crossmodal paired stimuli\u2014are produced exclusively by longer inter-stimulus intervals, of up to 1000 ms. Noticeably, the net average MSIn values (both negative and positive) appear to be reduced in the older animals."

As a result, these differences could be drowned out in the population averages. Thus, to investigate the possibility that tectal neurons become tuned to respond best to different crossmodal ISI's over development, we measured the ISI's at which each cell\u2019s maximal MSIn values were generated and plotted these ISI values as a histogram for both developmental stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). We found that in the stage 48\u201349 group, maximum MSIn responses occur at a relatively broad range of ISIs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) across the population of cells, in contrast to the younger tadpoles, where maximal MSI mostly occurs at short ISIs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Another way to describe this is that in the older tadpoles, tectal neurons, as a population, are tuned to respond optimally to a wider range of crossmodal ISIs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; median ISI, st 44\u20136 = 200 ms, IQR = 300 ms (n=26), st 48\u20139 = 400 ms, IQR = 775 ms (n=40), p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney).

This alignment of all \u2018ISI tuning curves\u2019 at their maximal MSIn values should provide a common reference point for comparing the shapes of the entire curve, across cells. Tuning curves of individual cells, representing different combinations of H and V offsets, were aligned at their central peak in the X axis to allow for direct comparison of average temporal tuning curve shapes as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>. In the stage 44\u20136 tadpoles it was evident that across cells, crossmodal response enhancement was present over a wider range of ISIs surrounding the central peak, and that this tuning narrowed significantly over development. To quantify this difference we determined the best curve fit for each data, and the resulting curves were compared statistically using an F test, which tests whether the dataset is best fit by two separate curves or by a single curve.

Evoked multisensory responses could either result in supralinear, linear or sub linear summation, examples of sublinear and supralinear summation are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. When we compared the maximal evoked crossmodal response to the response predicted by a linear sum of both inputs, we found that for both developmental stages data points fall below the line of unity indicating a tendency for sub-linear summation (i.e. predicted &gt; actual, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This tendency toward sublinearity was evident by plotting a cumulative probability distribution of Z-scores across cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and by comparing the relative proportion of cells showing sublinear, linear and supralinear responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

If the effects on the temporal properties and raw magnitude of multisensory integration are simply due to changes overall in tectal circuitry and excitability, respectively, then these changes should also be manifested in all paired interactions, including responses to pairs of unisensory stimuli. To test this, we performed paired stimulation of either V or HB inputs over the same range of ISIs we used for the crossmodal pairs. We found that at both developmental stages paired unimodal responses showed significant response enhancement over a wide range of ISIs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), in contrast to what we had observed for crossmodal responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2A</a>). Moreover, there was significantly more enhancement in response to unimodal pairs than there was for crossmodal pairs, and no developmental decrease was observed in the gain of the paired responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, compare to <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>; mean max PPE, st 44\u20136 = 2.25 \u00b1 0.44 (n=29), st 48\u20139 = 2.57 \u00b1 0.33 (n=26), p = 0.56, unpaired T-test). Similarly, there was also no developmental difference in the range of ISIs that produced the maximal enhancement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, compare to 2D; median ISI, st 44\u20136 = 400 ms, IQR = 300 ms (n=29), st 48\u20139 = 400 ms, IQR = 300 ms (n=26, p&lt;0.34, Mann-Whitney). Finally, when we looked at the temporal tuning around the maximal ISI, there was no narrowing of the temporal tuning window for unimodal pairs over development as both tuning curves were not significantly different from each other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, compare to <a href=\"#fig2\">2E</a>, F\u00a0=\u00a01.394 (2,544), p\u00a0=\u00a00.249)."

In the superior colliculus it has been proposed that maturation of inhibitory feedback correlates with the emergence of multisensory integration. In the tectum, between developmental stages 45 and 49 there is a large increase in evoked inhibitory drive, as well as a negative shift in the Cl- equilibrium potential (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akerman and Cline, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Miraucourt et al., 2012</a>). Inhibition is known to both narrow the tuning of sensory neurons to their preferred responses and to alter the timing and reliability of sensory driven spike output (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shen et al., 2011</a>). Thus, in the tectum, this increased inhibitory drive could constrain multisensory interactions by decreasing the amount of enhancement and narrowing the temporal window for interaction."

To block inhibition we performed recordings in the presence of 100 \u00b5M picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor blocker. We found that inhibitory blockade resulted in an overall increase in MSIn values over a wide range of ISIs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The ISI values at which the maximum MSIn was recorded were also shorter and became less variable across cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>; median ISI, PTX = 100 ms, IQR = 425 ms (n=22), no drug = 400 ms, IQR = 775 ms (n=40), p\u00a0= 0.029, Mann-Whitney) and the overall maximum MSIn per cell increased significantly (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; mean max MSIn, PTX = 1.96 \u00b1 0.25 (n=22), no drug = 0.55 \u00b1 0.100 (n=40), p\u00a0= 0.0001, unpaired T-test).

These effects are all similar to what we had observed in the younger, stage 45 tadpoles without inhibition blocked. Inhibitory blockade also affected the linearity of crossmodal responses. In the presence of picrotoxin, there was an increase in the relative proportion of neurons showing supralinear responses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), significantly shifting the cumulative distribution of Z-scores to the right (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, D = 0.595, p&lt;0.0001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

We performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses during crossmodal stimulation at different ISIs. To isolate excitatory from inhibitory conductances, we recorded at the reversal potential for Cl- (\u221245 mV) to isolate excitatory currents and at the reversal potential for ionotropic glutamate receptors (+5 mV) to isolate inhibitory currents (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akerman and Cline, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Khakhalin and Aizenman, 2012</a>). We then converted the synaptic currents into conductance values (see Materials and methods). Sample excitatory and inhibitory conductances are shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, at different ISIs. Overall, we found that inhibitory conductances were much greater in general than excitatory conductances and that the ratio of excitation to inhibition varied greatly across cells, consistent with prior observations (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akerman and Cline, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Khakhalin and Aizenman, 2012</a>). Based on our previous studies, it is hard to predict a tectal cell\u2019s spike output by simply looking at the raw values of individual conductances. Thus it would be more informative to look at the relative enhancement of both excitation and inhibition separately in response to crossmodal pairs. We calculated the MSIn of evoked crossmodal responses to assess the amount of response enhancement of both excitation and inhibition at the different ISIs (see Materials and methods). At both developmental stages we found on average an overall enhancement of both excitatory and inhibitory multisensory responses across all ISIs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). However we found proportionally greater enhancement across ISIs of excitatory responses in the stage 44\u201346 tadpoles, compared to stage 48\u201349 (p=0.037, 2-way ANOVA). In contrast we found that enhancement of inhibitory conductances, and its dependence on ISI, did not change over this developmental time window. We also compared data from individual cells by plotting the maximal Excitatory MSIn vs. the corresponding Inhibitory MSIn for both developmental stages (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). In both cases maximal Excitatory and Inhibitory MSIn values were positively correlated (St 44\u201346: r\u00a0=\u00a00.758, p&lt;0.0001; St 48\u201349: r=0.767, p&lt;0.0001). However the ratio between excitatory enhancement and inhibitory enhancement was greater in younger tadpoles than in older tadpoles, overall, consistent with the observation that excitatory currents show proportionally greater MSIn values than inhibitory currents (test for differences in slopes of linear fits: p=0.023, F\u00a0=\u00a05.56(1,45)."

However, these data do not directly account for the dependence of multisensory integration on ISI. One possibility is that the temporal dynamics of concurrent excitation and inhibition may vary as a function of ISI, thus resulting in different patterns of spike output. In order to test this hypothesis we would need to record excitation and inhibition simultaneously during a single response, due to the trial-to-trial variability in response shape, something that was not done in the present study."

We found that optic tectal neurons exhibit enhanced responses to crossmodal stimulus pairs, compared to single modality responses, and that this enhancement is heavily dependent on the ISI. The temporal window for multisensory enhancement becomes narrower between developmental stages 44\u201346 and 48\u201349, but across the tectal population neurons become preferentially tuned to a wider range of ISIs. We also find that the net gain of multisensory responses decreases between these stages. Across both developmental stages we also consistently observed a speeding up of response latency in paired compared to single responses. Inhibitory blockade in older tadpoles results in a broadening of the integration window, increased gain, and delays in response latency. Furthermore, the balance of excitation to inhibition during crossmodal responses decreases over this developmental period."

Crossmodal inputs also recruit local inhibition, and the relative enhancement of inhibition, versus excitation, increases over development. This change in relative enhancement sculpts the temporal sensitivity of the tectal network such that individual neurons become more narrowly tuned to specific ISIs, thus enhancing the diversity of responses to different temporal combinations of inputs. Local inhibition also serves to constrain the timing of evoked multisensory responses, by limiting the temporal window in which spikes can occur during a response, and thus shortening response latencies."

First we show that pharmacologically blocking inhibition results in a broadening of the window for multisensory integration in the older tadpoles. During inhibitory blockade, tectal cells are no longer narrowly tuned to a specific ISIs, respond with a greater gain, and preferentially respond to shorter ISIs. All of these characteristics are similar to what we observed in the younger tadpoles. Second, we find that the relative amount of multisensory enhancement (as measured by higher MSIn values) of inhibitory to excitatory responses is greater in the older tadpoles, indicating that they receive more inhibition relative to excitation. There is ample evidence throughout the nervous system that suggests that the inhibition to excitation ratio can sharpen the tuning of sensory neurons to their preferred stimulus (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Priebe and Ferster, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>). Having more inhibition can limit the range of stimuli that can effectively drive a cell above spike threshold. Our observation that the balance of excitation and inhibition changes developmentally for multisensory responses is consistent with this view."

Our data show that at both developmental stages tectal neurons tend to either mostly show linear or sublinear summation, with a small percentage of cells showing supralinear responses. Thus it is likely that inhibition is also constraining, to a degree, the amount of multisensory integration in the younger tadpoles. Finally, blocking inhibition delays the median onset latency of multisensory responses, which is consistent with a role for feedforward and feedback inhibition in controlling the temporal output of neuronal responses of sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shen et al., 2011</a>).

When both modalities are matched in their response sizes, then the temporal order becomes less important. This \u2018stronger-first\u2019 rule is thought to result from differential recruitment of inhibition. In our findings we did not observe any differences between the order in which visual or hindbrain inputs were activated, likely because we used responses of similar size in our experiments. It will be interesting to see in future studies if the \u2018stronger first\u2019 rule is preserved in the tectum, and whether this rule can be disrupted by inhibitory blockade."

                        "text": "Our findings in the optic tectum also share other fundamental similarities and differences with other animal models of multisensory integration. (i) In the superior colliculus of mammals (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meredith et al., 1987</a>) as well as in the optic tectum of owls (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bergan and Knudsen, 2009</a>), there are clear demonstrations of dependency of multisensory integration to the temporal interval between different modality inputs. Furthermore, a developmental narrowing of the temporal window underlying multisensory integration has been shown behaviorally in humans (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hillock et al., 2011</a>) and has been proposed to mediate development of important cognitive processes such as temporal binding. (ii) Second, like in the tadpole tectum, in mammals, collicular cells show also differences in the type of integration, having a combination of supralinear, linear and sublinear responses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarado et al., 2007</a>). (iii) Third, another important aspect that underlies the development of multisensory integration in the mammalian colliculus is the presence of cortical feedback (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wallace et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wallace and Stein, 2000</a>). While tadpoles do not have a proper cortex, during the developmental stages used in this study tadpoles do have forebrain feedback into the tectum (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zittlau et al., 1988</a>), as well a local recurrent circuits (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pratt et al., 2008</a>) which can provide the necessary excitatory network activity to drive multisensory integration in individual neurons. The relative contributions of both of these feedback circuits on multisensory integration remains to be determined, yet based on the timing of the tectal neuron spiking, it is likely that it is this recurrent activity that drives the majority of spiking activity, rather than the afferent input itself (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pratt et al., 2008</a>). Since the temporal output characteristics of these recurrent circuits has been shown to be highly plastic in response to experience (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pratt et al., 2008</a>), this raises the possibility that this network plasticity can help tune the selectivity of different tectal cells over development to specific combinations of crossmodal ISIs. This type of network plasticity may also help explain observations in the mammalian superior colliculus where temporal statistics of cross-modal stimuli during development and in adulthood shape the temporal tuning of multisensory responses (<a href=\"#bib55\">Xu et al., 2012</a>: <a href=\"#bib57\">Yu et al., 2013</a>). Using the Xenopus tadpole tectum preparation it should be possible to study this type of plasticity at the cellular level."

(i) In the present study we find that pairs of unimodal stimuli result in greater integration over a wider range of intervals than crossmodal pairs. This finding is opposite to what is observed in mammals, where crossmodal inputs are more effective than unimodal ones (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarado et al., 2007</a>). There are likely two mechanisms underlying this difference. The first is due to presynaptic interactions that lead to paired pulse facilitation, which has been described for both visual and hindbrain inputs in the tadpole tectum (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deeg et al., 2009</a>). The second may be due to localization of inputs in the dendritic arbor of tectal neurons. Unisensory pairs thus, might be more effective in driving local dendritic depolarization since they are not spatially segregated, and therefore activate non linear response elements such as NMDA receptors or voltage gate Ca++ channels, thus enhancing the amount of integration. (ii) A second key difference is that the developmental decrease in pair-driven enhancement of excitatory conductances and spike output appears to contradict developmental studies in mammals, where the progressive refinement of superior colliculus receptive fields is associated with the capacity for response enhancement, after paired stimulation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wallace and Stein, 1997</a>). Indeed, an analogous developmental refinement of visually-driven receptive fields, specifically, is found for both excitatory and inhibitory conductances\u2014recorded in the same neuron\u2014in the X. laevis optic tectum over the same developmental stages examined here (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tao and Poo, 2005</a>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the use of bipolar stimulating electrodes in our preparation to evoke action potentials throughout an afferent pathway. While this stimulation paradigm provides excellent temporal control of stimulus delivery, this stimulation method by its nature has no selectivity for spatiotopic organization. Each stimulus is therefore considered 'whole-field', and loses its spatial specificity. Furthermore, in vivo stimuli are likely to also have more temporally complex patterns that may result in somewhat different multisensory interactions. It will be important in future studies to compare the rules underlying multisensory integration using in vivo visual and mechanosensory stimuli."

We have used this preparation to uncover some of the basic phenomenology of multisensory integration in this preparation, and have shown that recruitment of recurrent inhibition is a central mechanism in mediating this process. We have also shown that some of the basic features and computations of multisensory integration observed in higher order mammalian preparations are conserved in the developing amphibian tectum, indicating that these are likely to be fundamental and evolutionarily conserved processes. These studies further open the door to follow up studies focusing on the behavioral consequences of these processes, as well as on the role of early sensory experience in determining the temporal properties of multisensory integration. Several neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, are often accompanied with deficits in sensory integration (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baum et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Markram and Markram, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Foxe et al., 2015</a>).

For each cell, responses after each trial of the individual (baseline) stimulus presentations were collected and, as appropriate for the type of paired responses being predicted, all possible unimodal trial-by-trial combinations or all possible crossmodal trial-by-trial combinations were determined. For each such combination of trials, the sum of spike counts recorded in each was calculated. Thus, with 33 single-stimulus trials delivered through each modality, in each cell, 33 \u00d7 33 = 1089 possible sums exist. In the actual experiments, however, at each ISI 4 trials of paired stimuli were presented, and the mean response over these trials was determined. To mirror these procedures in the predictive analysis, for each cell and for each type of stimulus pair, 4 of the possible sums were randomly selected (with replacement) and their mean taken. This randomly sampling and averaging was repeated 10,000 times for each pair type, to create an approximately normal distribution of predicted mean sums. In each cell, Z-score comparisons of the actual mean response, at each ISI of each pair type, were then performed against this distribution."

The authors have done an admirable job here, and have provided some interesting and insightful observations. Their use of picrotoxin was especially helpful in dealing with their supposition that inhibitory portions of the circuit are becoming more robust with development, thereby minimizing the magnitude of the multisensory response that they see earlier in life. Their comparison to data generated from mammals is particularly helpful, and demonstrate the constancy of many of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon across species and ecological challenges. They do note, quite appropriately so, that the use of electrical stimulation (which has no clearly defined spatiotopic referent in space) may have produced differences that are not really species-specific is an important caveat. This is especially important in their studies of within-modal stimulus pairs. Two electrical stimuli, via the same electrodes engage the same afferents at different ISIs. This condition that is difficult to relate to two visual stimuli at different locations in space, and may be more akin to a single, repeated stimulus. This makes the comparison to the visual-mechanosensory stimulus a bit tricky, and may require a stronger caveat. Nevertheless, the observation is an important one, and is thought-provoking. This point is also important with regard to the proportion of sublinear and supralinear responses in the multisensory condition. Electrical stimuli by their nature produce very different discharge patterns than do environmental stimuli. The absence of similar stimulation patterns in mammalian multisensory neurons makes it difficult to compare. Nevertheless, their findings that only the multisensory condition shows developmental changes, and that it shows an increasing sensitivity to the effects of picrotoxin, clearly indicate substantial differences from the two visual stimulus conditions \u2013 and that the nature of these differences differ from the unisensory-multisensory differences noted in mammals. Some of these issues are discussed in a recent review of the development of multisensory integration (see Stein et al., Nat Rev. Neurosci., 2014)."

Prior studies in mammalian superior colliculus, largely from the Stein lab, have shown that sensory experience is required for development of multisensory integrative capacity. Felch et al. provide important new information on the cellular and synaptic mechanisms contributing to the development of multisensory integration over a developmental period when tectal circuitry matures as a result of changes in intrinsic excitability, recurrent excitation and inhibition, and changes in sensory receptive fields and topographic maps. This study uses an isolated brain preparation from <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles, which allows ready access to tectal neurons where MSI occurs and direct stimulation of visual and mechanosensory inputs in a preparation where the tectal circuit remains intact. Felch et at used cell attached recordings to determine the outcome of changing the temporal interval between visual and mechanosensory afferent stimulation to tectal neurons compared to unisensory stimulation. In contrast to unisensory paired responses they found that shorter intervals result in faster stronger MSI responses while MSI responses were inhibited with longer intervals. They found that the population of neurons from older animals had smaller responses, and that this was due partially to individual neurons having a smaller response and narrower tuning curve. The authors then test whether inhibition is constraining MSI responses and find that blocking inhibition increases MSI responses and broadens the MSI tuning curve in neurons from older animals, so they resemble the tuning curves in younger stages. Furthermore, MSI responses were largely sublinear and this sublinear response was due to inhibition. The authors present a model in which multisensory inputs recruit both recurrent excitatory and inhibitory networks, which increase responses to MSI and sharpen tuning curves and temporal responses, respectively. The study characterized MSI at earlier developmental stages than in previous studies and demonstrates the predominant role of developmental changes in inhibition in MSI responses."
