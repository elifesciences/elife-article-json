An enzyme called the sodium and potassium pump is found in the membrane that surrounds neurons. It uses energy to pump sodium ions out of the neuron and potassium ions in the opposite direction. This helps to maintain different concentrations of these ions across the membrane, which is critical for the electrical activity of neurons and also generates an electrical current in the process. The size of the current is influenced by how many sodium ions have leaked back into the neuron due to the neuron\u2019s electrical activity."

This effect depended completely on the presence of a channel protein \u2013 called an <i>h</i>-channel \u2013 that was activated with a delay by the altered pump current and allowed sodium and potassium ions to cross the membrane, counteracting the pump current. Inhibiting the pump also sped up the rhythm of neural activity, but this effect did not depend on the <i>h</i>-channel. Kueh et al. developed a computer model that indicated that the time course of the pump current following the sodium ion leak and the slow activation of the <i>h</i>-channel were important for these effects."

The rhythmic bursting activity of each constituent neuron within a central pattern generator is shaped by the dynamics of various ionic currents that are intrinsic to each neuron (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harris-Warrick, 2002</a>). Many of these neurons share subsets of ionic currents with similar functional properties that give rise to bursting activity. For example, many central pattern generator neurons have a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current or a low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> current that supports bursting (<a href=\"#bib68\">Opdyke and Calabrese, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Butera et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Del Negro et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Rybak et al., 2004</a>), a hyperpolarization-activated inward current that provides recovery from inhibition to initiate bursting (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angstadt and Calabrese, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Golowasch and Marder, 1992</a>), and a transient K<sup>+</sup> current that impedes initiations of action potentials and bursts (<a href=\"#bib78\">Simon et al., 1992</a>). Moreover, modulation of these ionic currents can alter the timing and intensity of these neurons\u2019 bursting activity (e.g., <a href=\"#bib87\">Tobin and Calabrese, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Koizumi and Smith, 2008</a>)."

The pump is a transmembrane protein that maintains the intracellular concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> by exchanging three intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions for two extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ions with each cycle of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib85\">Thomas, 1972a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">De Weer and Geduldig, 1973</a>). Because the exchange of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions is unequal, the pump is electrogenic as it generates an outward current (<a href=\"#bib31\">Glitsch, 2001</a>). In addition to maintaining internal concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, the pump contributes a voltage drop to the resting membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hodgkin and Keynes, 1955</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carpenter and Alving, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Smith et al., 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baylor and Nicholls, 1969</a>) and is able to generate a slow afterhyperpolarization after a train of action potentials when its activity is enhanced by increased intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gage and Hubbard, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Nakajima and Takahashi, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Rang and Ritchie, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baylor and Nicolls, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sokolove and Cooke, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bolton, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mat Jais et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gordon et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Catarsi and Brunelli, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Lombardo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Pulver and Griffith, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gulledge et al., 2013</a>). In the context of motor patterns, the pump appears to play an important role in regulating bursting activity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ballerini et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tobin and Calabrese, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Zhang and Sillar, 2012</a>). For example, <a href=\"#bib93\">Zhang and Sillar (2012)</a> found that blocking the pump with ouabain abolished the slow afterhyperpolarization of spinal cord central pattern generator neurons in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpoles, resulting in longer swimming episodes. In a separate study, <a href=\"#bib87\">Tobin and Calabrese (2005)</a> observed that inhibition of the pump with the neuropeptide, myomodulin, or with ouabain speeds up the bursting activity of oscillator heart interneurons in the leech heartbeat central pattern generator (<a href=\"#bib87\">Tobin and Calabrese, 2005</a>). These studies show that the pump can serve as a target for modulating the bursting activity of neurons and networks that program motor output."

                        "text": "Many studies have explored the function of the pump by inhibiting its activity; fewer have investigated the pump\u2019s function by stimulating its activity. For example, <a href=\"#bib92\">Zhang et al. (2015)</a> recently found that stimulating the pump activity of central pattern generator neurons in <i>Xenopus</i> enhances the ultraslow hyperpolarization, which suppresses excitability of the entire motor network. Nevertheless, the effects of stimulating pump on the ongoing activity of rhythm generating neurons have yet to be explored. In the present study, we had two principal goals. First, we wanted to reveal experimentally the mechanisms that underlie the effects of a stimulated pump on the bursting activity of central pattern generator neurons, especially with respect to the temporal or burst characteristics of these neuron\u2019s bursting activity such as period or duty cycle. Second, we wanted to develop a mathematical model that could capture our experimental results and help identify mechanisms. For our analysis, we used leech oscillator heart interneurons, which participate in half-center oscillators to pace the heartbeat central pattern generator. We examined the influence of the pump on bursting based on changes in the burst characteristics of these oscillator heart interneurons. We used monensin, a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, to increase Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations to stimulate the pump (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hill and Licis, 1982</a>). Our results show that monensin enhances the outward pump current, which hyperpolarizes the membrane potential of oscillator heart interneurons. We also found that stimulation of pump activity by monensin speeds up the bursting activity of oscillator heart interneurons. Blocking the <i>h</i>-current of these neurons with Cs<sup>+</sup> while stimulating the pump with monensin failed to speed up bursting. Our biophysical model captured these experimental results by simulating the interaction between the pump current and the <i>h</i>-current to control the interburst interval and thus the period. Taken together, our study leads us to conclude that in the presence of the <i>h</i>-current, the electrogenic activity of the pump can play a significant role in the dynamics of bursting activity in the leech heartbeat central pattern generator and likely in other rhythmically bursting neuronal networks."

There are two pairs of these oscillator heart interneurons in each animal, with each pair located in the third and fourth segmental ganglia of the ventral nerve cord. Both neurons in each ganglion form mutual inhibitory synaptic connections, thereby constituting a half-center oscillator. We used only individual isolated ganglia in our experiments to determine the contribution of the pump to ongoing rhythmic bursting in oscillator heart interneurons. The pump current is proportional to the pump rate, which is itself proportional to intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (<a href=\"#bib85\">Thomas, 1972a</a>). Thus, the pump can be stimulated by increasing the intracellular loading of Na<sup>+</sup> from an electrode filled with a Na<sup>+</sup>-based solution, which has been demonstrated in other neurons such as mechanoreceptors in leeches (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jansen and Nicholls, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Catarsi and Brunelli, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Lombardo et al, 2004</a>) and snails (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kerkut and Thomas, 1965</a>)."

Upon impalement, we measured the base potential, defined as midway between an undershoot trough and the next threshold (first peak of the third derivative) of the intracellularly recorded neuron in the first 10 min.

Once the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline took effect, the oscillator heart interneurons no longer burst regularly but instead fired tonically, indicating that the neurons were synaptically isolated and incapable of normal bursting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B<sub>2</sub></a>). Such tonic firing was interspersed by brief Na<sup>+</sup>-based synchronized oscillations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B<sub>2</sub></a>), a characteristic of Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure in leech neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Angstadt and Friesen, 1991</a>). We measured the base potential of these neurons after these synchronized oscillations had appeared, which was 2\u20137 min after applying the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline. We then added 10 \u00b5M monensin to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline, which abolished the synchronized oscillations and eventually suppressed spiking activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B<sub>3</sub></a>). We chose the concentration of 10 \u00b5M for monensin because we wanted to produce the maximum effect within the shortest amount of time (see details below on the effects of lower concentrations of monensin on bursting activity). Within 7\u201310 min of adding monensin, the base potential under the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free monensin saline became significantly more hyperpolarized than the base potential under Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B<sub>3</sub></a>, \u221243 \u00b1 1.8 mV for pre-monensin vs. \u221254.4 \u00b1 3.4 mV for monensin, n = 5, paired t-test, p=0.02).

If monensin does indeed stimulate the pump, we should see an outward shift in the membrane current. We first bathed the oscillator heart interneurons in the same Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline to block the <i>h</i>-current and all Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, thereby also suppressing synaptic transmission. The neurons were then voltage-clamped at \u221245 mV for five minutes and later treated with 10 \u00b5M monensin for ten minutes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A<sub>1</sub></a>). The holding potential of \u221245 mV was chosen because it is near the observed base potential of oscillator heart interneurons when bathed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B<sub>2</sub></a>). Moreover, we wanted to reduce the escape spiking of these neurons (<a href=\"#bib65\">Norris et al., 2007</a>). Before adding monensin, the average holding current at \u221245 mV was \u221226.4 \u00b1 16.9\u2009pA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A<sub>2</sub></a>, n = 5), which was measured at the fifth minute of voltage-clamping the neurons in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline. Monensin suppressed all escape spiking and induced an outward current which moved the holding current to 62.4 \u00b1 29.6\u2009pA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A<sub>1-2</sub></a>, n = 5, Tukey\u2019s test, p=0.009), measured at the tenth minute after monensin application. This monensin-induced outward current was apparently blocked, however, by the application of 100 \u00b5M strophanthidin, resulting in a large inward holding current (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A<sub>1-2</sub></a>, \u2212180.0 \u00b1 33.3\u2009pA, n = 5, Tukey\u2019s test, p=0.0002) and a resumption of escape spiking by the neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A<sub>2</sub></a>). The difference between the average outward current generated by monensin and the average inward current observed upon blocking the pump with strophanthidin, suggests that the pump is able to generate a maximum outward current of 242.4 \u00b1 16.0\u2009pA, assuming a saturating effect of 10 \u00b5M monensin on the pump. Subtracting the outward current generated by monensin from this maximum pump current, suggests that the resting pump current is about 180.0 \u00b1 33.3\u2009pA (or 74.0 \u00b1 11.2% of the maximum pump current). Thus, the maximum pump current appears to have a limited range of 202 to 289\u2009pA, with about three-quarters of this current being generated under resting conditions, leaving another quarter of the current available for enhancement by 10 \u00b5M monensin."

To test this hypothesis, we again performed dual intracellular and extracellular recordings from a pair of oscillator heart interneurons in normal saline. Contrary to what we expected, when we applied 10 \u00b5M monensin for 15 min, we found that the average period of both oscillator heart interneurons actually decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, 9.3 \u00b1 1.0\u2009s for control saline vs. 3.9 \u00b1 0.2\u2009s for monensin saline, n = 5, paired t-test, p=0.007), which were detectable within two minutes of applying monensin. We measured the period after 5.1\u201310.5 min of adding monensin because shortening of the period stabilized during this time period (see example in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In four of the five preparations, the activities of both neurons initially transitioned from bursting to tonic-like firing and back to bursting again (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The disorganized tonic-like firing pattern did not appear in the extracellular recordings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), leaving us to conclude that this pattern was due to a nonspecific leak current introduced by the intracellular electrode (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cymbalyuk et al., 2002</a>). We also measured the base potential before and after application of monensin but did not find any significant changes. Thus, monensin actually speeds up the bursting activity of oscillator heart interneurons without significantly affecting their base potential."

Average values for both currents were obtained by computing the integral of each current over a closed interval and then dividing that integral by the duration of the closed interval. When averaging these currents, we only considered the segment of the interburst interval from the time after the last action potential in a burst in which the membrane potential crossed \u221250 mV to the time before the first action potential of the next burst whereby the membrane potential crossed \u221250 mV again.

The decreased pump current was due to the average decrease in intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration from 14.6\u2009mM to 14.3\u2009mM during each burst and from 14.4\u2009mM to 14.0\u2009mM during each interburst interval. Taken together, the application of monensin in our simulations decreased the burst duration by increasing the average pump current during each burst. Moreover, monensin also increased the average pump current during each interburst interval, which hyperpolarized the membrane potential and activated the <i>h</i>-current during each interburst interval, which in turn decreases the interburst interval itself. Our simulations also confirmed our experimental results whereby stimulating the pump while blocking the <i>h</i>-current in half-center oscillators shortens the burst duration but increases the interburst interval, which has the effect of decreasing the duty cycle. These simulations confirmed our experimental results that a stimulated pump interacts with the <i>h</i>-current to decrease the period that results from the combined decrease of the burst duration and interburst interval."

The pump current at the end of each interburst interval had a minimum (or baseline) value of about 98.0\u2009pA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A<sub>1</sub></a>). During the beginning of each burst, intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration accumulated with each action potential (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A<sub>1</sub></a>). As the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increased, the pump current also increased. Over the course of a burst, the spike frequency decreased and the outward Na<sup>+</sup> flux generated by the pump began to balance\u2014at a maximum pump current of 203.6\u2009pA \u2014and exceeded the inward Na<sup>+</sup> flux produced by the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A<sub>1</sub></a>). At the termination of each burst, the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and pump current relaxed to a baseline of about 14\u2009mM and 100\u2009pA, respectively, over the duration of an interburst interval (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A<sub>1</sub></a>). The outward pump current was active over the entire cycle of bursting activity, but it was stronger during each burst. These effects are much like the ones we would expect from a leak current with a very negative equilibrium potential: an outward current that seems to track the membrane potential exerting a hyperpolarizing drag on both the burst duration and the interburst interval. The pump current actually tracks intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> dynamics, which is delayed (low-pass filtered) with respect to the membrane potential and this delay might exert sizable effects in some cases."

Compared to the dynamic pump current, the value of this constant pump current was lower during each burst but higher during each interburst interval. This constant value was chosen because lower values of the pump current (e.g., 144.4\u2009pA) produced irregular bouts of bursting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B<sub>3</sub></a>). When the pump current was fixed to 155.5\u2009pA, the period, burst duration and interburst interval were 19.9\u2009s, 9.6\u2009s, and 10.2\u2009s, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B<sub>2</sub></a>). The durations of these burst characteristics were longer than those observed in simulations with a dynamic pump current (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A<sub>1</sub></a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The relatively lower constant pump current during each burst increased the burst duration. Because the period in the half center oscillator is determined in part by the burst duration, the period itself became longer relative to simulations with a dynamic pump. Taken together, we concluded that in a half-center oscillator, a dynamic pump current that changes from an interburst interval to the next burst is critical for the formation of burst patterns with normal burst characteristics. Such a conclusion is also consistent with the observed non-spiking activity that result from inhibiting the pump with strophanthidin or K<sup>+</sup>-free saline in our experiments."

In doing so, we performed experiments that allowed us to determine the effects of a stimulated pump on the burst characteristics of these oscillator heart interneurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Because the rate of pump activity is dependent on intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (<a href=\"#bib85\">Thomas, 1972a</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Mogul et al., 1990</a>), we were able to stimulate the pump of the oscillator heart interneurons by increasing the intracellular loading of Na<sup>+</sup> with an electrode (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A<sub>2</sub></a>) or by applying monensin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B3</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2A2</a>), a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hill and Licis, 1982</a>). Monensin has a hyperpolarizing effect when applied to excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lichtshtein et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tsuchida and Otomo 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib76\">Satoh and Tsuchida, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Doebler, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Our stimulation of the pump with monensin did indeed hyperpolarize the membrane potential of the oscillator heart interneurons when the <i>h</i>-current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were blocked (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B<sub>3</sub></a>). When we voltage-clamped oscillator heart interneurons under the same conditions, we observed that monensin produced a long-lasting outward current, indicating that the outward pump current was enhanced by monensin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A<sub>1-2</sub></a>). This outward current is consistent with the results of <a href=\"#bib88\">Tsuchida and Otomo (1990)</a>, who also showed monensin enhancing the outward current generated by Purkinje fibers that were isolated from the hearts of dogs and goats.

Our voltage-clamp experiments were performed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline that contained Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which would have prevented the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current. Even if the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current was present, it is a fast transient current in these neurons, which could not sustain a long-term outward current (<a href=\"#bib78\">Simon et al., 1992</a>). The combined use of strophanthidin and monensin in our voltage-clamp experiments allowed us to determine the fixed range (202\u2013289\u2009pA) of the maximum pump current by taking the difference between the outward current produced by monensin and the inward current produced by monensin plus strophanthidin. At rest, the pump current varies between 82\u2009pA to 283\u2009pA, a range that is consistent with outward currents attributed to the pump at rest in other voltage-clamp experiments (e.g., <a href=\"#bib75\">Sakai et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Mogul et al., 1990</a>). Because the maximum pump current is usually not generated under resting conditions, there is a certain amount of pump current left available that can be stimulated by monensin. These results indicate that the action of monensin in oscillator heart interneurons is consistent with its well-established role of facilitating an electroneutral exchange of intracellular H<sup>+</sup> for extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, thereby increasing intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, which in turn stimulates the pump to generate more outward current that hyperpolarizes the membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lichtshtein et al. 1979</a>)."

For example, at the same concentration of 10 \u00b5M used in our experiments, monensin has been found to increase the intracellular pH of astroglial cells by 0.07 (from 7.26 to 7.33) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Itoh et al, 2000</a>). Intracellular alkalization has been reported to prolong the bursting activity of ventral white cells in snails, increase the number of spikelets in hippocampal neurons of rodents, decrease the viability of endothelial cells, and enhance glycolysis in neurons and glioma cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gillette, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Valiante et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cutaia et al., 2000</a>).

Moreover, the monensin-treated oscillator heart interneurons do not appear to be adversely affected by any potential intracellular alkalization as they were able to burst continuously for well over thirty minutes to an hour (data not shown). Nevertheless, if monensin were to enhance glycolytic functions, thereby increasing ATP production, it would only serve to enhance pump activity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Lombardo et al., 2004</a>), which would be consistent with the use of monensin in this study. Thus, even if modest intracellular pH changes by monensin occurred, we do not expect these changes to confound our results or to affect our interpretations of them."

The paradox of stimulating the pump to speed up bursting activity can be explained if we consider other intrinsic ionic currents that are also present and are likely to be activated or deinactivated by a membrane potential hyperpolarized by an outward pump current. The <i>h</i>-current is an obvious candidate as it is an inward current with a voltage-threshold near -50 mV and becomes fully activated at \u221270 to \u221280 mV (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angstadt and Calabrese, 1989</a>). The threshold of the <i>h</i>-current is well within the range of membrane potential produced by monensin.

For example, when <a href=\"#bib73\">Robert and Jirounek (1998)</a> recorded the slow afterhyperpolarization (described by the authors as a slow posttetanic hyperpolarization), which occurs after a burst of compound action potentials, in the rabbit vagus nerve, they found that blocking the <i>h</i>-current or the inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> with Cs<sup>+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup>, respectively, would increase the amplitude of the slow afterhyperpolarization.

Such a counterbalancing role by the <i>h</i>-current could explain the previously mentioned paradoxical shortening of the period when we stimulated the pump in the heart interneurons.

Pump stimulation hyperpolarizes the membrane potential, which activates the <i>h</i>-current to shorten the period whereas pump inhibition depolarizes the membrane potential, increasing the likelihood of spiking activity, thereby also shortening the period. Thus, the activation of these two separate pathways ultimately result in the same decrease in period. It is also interesting to note that myomodulin not only inhibits the pump current but increases the <i>h</i>-current thus ensuring that there is ample <i>h</i>-current during each burst cycle despite the depolarization caused by reduction of the pump current (<a href=\"#bib87\">Tobin and Calabrese, 2005</a>)."

Our model also confirmed our experimental results showing that increasing intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations enhances the hyperpolarizing pump current, which interacts with the <i>h</i>-current to shorten the interburst interval (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7A<sub>2</sub></a>). Moreover, the model suggests that when a half-center oscillator model is treated with monensin, the pump current contributes to burst termination thereby influencing burst duration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A<sub>2</sub></a>). Overall, our model quantitatively reproduced nine of the twelve measures (four burst characteristics multiplied by three experimental treatments). Although the three modeled burst characteristics did not fall within the experimentally observed range, the model still faithfully reproduced the observed trends of the experimental data. Our model also shows that a dynamic pump current is essential to normal bursting activity. When we set the average pump current to be constant over the entire burst cycle, the period of the oscillator heart interneuron simulations became longer, as each burst duration and interburst interval increases. Thus, our model reveals that importance of a pump current that is dynamic and not static for there to be normal bursting activity in the oscillator heart interneurons. Furthermore, stimulating the pump current with monensin offsets the amount pump current being generated, thereby influencing the entire burst cycle."

The leak current is predominantly an outward current and if its reversal potential is sufficiently hyperpolarized, it is an outward current over the entire burst cycle. <a href=\"#bib20\">Cymbalyuk et al. (2002)</a> found that the conductance and reversal potential of the leak current controlled properties of bursting activity in isolated oscillator heart interneurons. For example, when the leak conductance increases, the duty cycle and burst duration decrease (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cymbalyuk et al., 2002</a>). The pump current is always an outward current that increases, along with the leak current, during each burst. In simulations of a half-center oscillator, over the course of the burst this outward current creates a drag that promotes burst termination as the underlying inward currents wane. An increase in an outward current, such as a leak current or a pump current, or increase of a constant outward current, could lead to earlier burst termination. In contrast, the interburst interval of a half-center oscillator is mainly determined by the interaction of the <i>h</i>-current with the pump current but also by the burst duration of the inhibiting cell. Adding monensin in our model slightly increases the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration throughout the burst cycle. By increasing the baseline intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and the resulting pump current in both phases of each burst cycle, we achieved an effect similar to introducing an outward leak current."

After each burst, the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration takes time to decay to its baseline between bursts, resulting in a strong outward pump current being present immediately after each burst, which hyperpolarizes the membrane potential and activates the <i>h</i>-current during each interburst interval."

Although the pump generates an outward current, its contribution to the resting membrane potential is often too small to be detectable (<a href=\"#bib85\">Thomas, 1972a</a>). Only recently has the potential role of the pump current in regulating motor activity been explored, and there is growing experimental evidence that the pump current can contribute to the motor activity (e.g., <a href=\"#bib6\">Ballerini et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tobin and Calabrese, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Krey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Pulver and Griffith, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Zhang and Sillar, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>).

Instead, our results point to an interaction between the pump current and the <i>h</i>-current to regulate ongoing bursting activity of central pattern generator neurons. Such regulation has strong behavioral implications as changes in burst characteristics underlie the production of various rhythmic behaviors (e.g., walking vs. running or breathing fast vs. breathing slow) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hooper, 1998</a>). Nevertheless, for the pump current to regulate bursting activity, it has to be dynamic and stimulating the pump currents offsets the amount of pump current generated. Thus, the dynamics of the pump current, along with the dynamics of the <i>h</i>-current, can help shape the bursting activity of neurons and networks that control motor output."

The undershoot phase was identified based on the time point of the undershoot\u00a0trough of an action potential.

Finally, in the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> experiment, which has time as the within-group factor and electrode cation (Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) as the between-group factor, a split-plot ANOVA was used to analyze changes in base potential from both groups over time.

Its fundamental role of maintaining intracellular ion concentration has made it very difficult to manipulate without affecting other electrical properties. This study, through carefully controlled pharmacology buttressed with a theoretical model, provides strong evidence that an interaction between the hyperpolarizing pump current generated by the Na+/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current Ih has a substantial influence on the half-center oscillations of leech heartbeat interneurons. The findings are of broad interest as this intrinsic self-regulation may be present in other neuronal circuits and play a similar role."

They then test their hypothesis with a model to confirm the plausibility of the findings from their experiments. They conclude that the h-current can be activated by the hyperpolarizing pump current and is important for controlling burst period. These results, if they could be substantiated more strongly would represent an important contribution to our understanding of rhythmic activity."

The paper falls into three sections. First, the effect of monensin on bursting activity and its interaction with h-currents is described. Then follows a set of experiments aimed at providing evidence for the specificity of monensin effects by using intracellular electrophysiology while manipulating the pump in different ways. Last, the modeling work is presented to address the mechanisms underlying the effects on neuronal activity. In my opinion, the flow of this work could be much improved by addressing the cellular actions of monensin first, providing evidence that it is really the pump that is activated. The effect on bursting activity can then be addressed experimentally and theoretically without interruption. In addition, results described in the text and presented in the figures should be in the same sequence, which is not always the case."

They then test their hypothesis in a modified computer model and confirm the findings from their animal experiments.

They conclude that the h-current can be activated by hyperpolarizing pump current and is important for controlling burst period.

This equation is similar to other published pump models (e.g., Gadsby, 1980; Mogul et al., 1990; De Weer et al., 2001). In the text describing the model, we claim and show that the pump current follows the Nai dynamics (now <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A1</a>). Monensin has the effect of shifting the baseline Na<sup>+</sup> influx (now <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A2</a>). Thus, it does not alter the pump dynamics (it has no dynamics) but it does alter the pump current. The pump current does indeed have dynamics and these dynamics are important for the 2 effects it has on electrical activity (now <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B2-3</a>). Monensin does change [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which alters the pump current. Although it is true that the off-target effects of monensin are not known in this system, we did perform additional voltage-clamp experiments (now <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) with strophanthidin to show that it alters the pump current."
