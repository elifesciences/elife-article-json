Gas-chromatographic mass-spectral analyses of <i>A. oligospora</i>-derived volatile metabolites identified several odors mimicking food cues attractive to nematodes. One compound, methyl 3-methyl-2-butenoate (MMB) additionally triggered strong sex- and stage-specific attraction in several <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species. Furthermore, when MMB is present, it interferes with nematode mating, suggesting that MMB might mimic sex pheromone in <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species. Forward genetic screening suggests that multiple receptors are involved in sensing MMB. Response to fungal odors involves the olfactory neuron AWCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the GPCRs expressed in AWC. We propose that <i>A. oligospora</i> likely evolved the means to use olfactory mimicry to attract its nematode prey through the olfactory neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> and related species."

Gas-chromatographic mass-spectral analyses of <i>A. oligospora</i>-derived volatile metabolites identified several odors mimicking food cues attractive to nematodes. One compound, methyl 3-methyl-2-butenoate (MMB) additionally triggered strong sex- and stage-specific attraction in several <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species. Furthermore, when MMB is present, it interferes with nematode mating, suggesting that MMB might mimic sex pheromone in <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species. Forward genetic screening suggests that multiple receptors are involved in sensing MMB. Response to fungal odors involves the olfactory neuron AWCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the GPCRs expressed in AWC. We propose that <i>A. oligospora</i> likely evolved the means to use olfactory mimicry to attract its nematode prey through the olfactory neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> and related species."

To minimize the risk of being eaten, prey have often evolved specific behaviors and strategies such as camouflage, avoidance, mimicry, and tonic immobility to increase their chance of survival.\u00a0In turn, predators also evolved enhanced predatory strategies to secure food sufficient to survive and reproduce, giving rise to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dawkins and Krebs, 1979</a>)."

Venus flytraps, sundews and pitcher plants acquire some or most of their nutrients from trapping and consuming insects, a feature that evolved in response to nitrogen limitation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Darwin, 1875</a>). Many fungi that grow in nitrogen-poor environments have likewise evolved carnivorism and nematodes, being the most numerically abundant animals on earth, conveniently became the prey (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barron, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nordbring-Hertz, 1988</a>). This predatory lifestyle has independently evolved multiple times among different fungal lineages including Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barron, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liou and Tzean, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2007</a>). Nematode-trapping fungi depend on their elaborate traps to prey on nematodes. However, the majority of the nematode-trapping fungi do not constitutively generate these trapping structures; trap-morphogenesis is only triggered by the presence of nematodes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pramer and Stoll, 1959</a>). This suggests that trap-formation might be a highly energy-consuming process and that, to conserve energy, these fungi have evolved to sense signals from nematodes, which indicate the presence of prey. One such signal is the group of nematode pheromones, ascarosides.\u00a0These pheromones regulate various aspects of behavior and development in <i>C. elegans</i> and are sufficient to induce trap-morphogenesis in several species of nematode-trapping fungi (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hsueh et al., 2013</a>). Since the nematode-trapping fungi have clearly evolved the ability to eavesdrop on nematode communication, we wondered whether the nematodes also sense and respond to their fungal predators."

Bacterial secondary metabolites are able to modulate the signaling and the protective lawn-avoidance behavior in <i>C. elegans</i>, demonstrating that the sensory neurons of <i>C. elegans</i> are critical for its defensive responses against pathogens (<a href=\"#bib44\">Meisel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pradel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). By contrast, little is known about how <i>C. elegans</i> responds to its natural predators such as the nematode-trapping fungi, with only an early study showing that the nematode <i>Panagrellus redivivus</i> was attracted to a species of nematode-trapping fungi (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balan and Gerber, 1972</a>). Many prey are known to begin fleeing when they sense a possible predator, while many predators are also known to attract their prey (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haynes et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rosier, 2011</a>). Therefore, we investigated the behavioral and molecular basis for how <i>C. elegans</i> responds to <i>Arthrobotrys oligospora</i>, one of the most common nematode-trapping fungal species and one that we had previously found to eavesdrop on ascarosides produced by <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hsueh et al., 2013</a>)."

Through genetic screens and single-cell transcriptome analyses of the AWC neuron, we identified the potential chemosensory receptors that were expressed in this neuron, which is involved in sensing some of these fungal odors.

When varying doses were tested for elicited responses, MMB attracted <i>C. elegans</i> across a 10<sup>6</sup> fold concentration range (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Moreover, when <i>C. elegans</i> were given a choice between isoamyl alcohol (IAA, a previously described attractant) and MMB, the worms exhibited a strong preference for MMB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To examine whether MMB is indeed a genuine molecule naturally produced by <i>A.\u00a0oligospora,</i> and not an artifact of GC-MS analysis, we exposed <i>C. elegans</i> to <i>A. oligospora</i> cultures for two hours, and measured the chemotaxis behavior of these <i>A. oligospora</i>-adapted animals. If the <i>A.\u00a0oligospora</i> cultures were emitting MMB, we expected to subsequently observe significantly decreased attraction toward MMB as a result of olfactory adaptation, a behavior that has been well-characterized in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Colbert and Bargmann, 1995</a>). Indeed, we found that when <i>C. elegans</i> were exposed to <i>A. oligospora</i> volatiles for two hours, their chemotactic response to MMB was strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This reduction in chemotaxis was odorant-specific, as opposed to a global reduction in chemotaxis, as <i>A. oligospora</i>-adapted animals were still attracted to IAA and benzealdehyde (BA), two odorants that were not detected in the <i>A. oligospora</i> volatiles and are known to attract <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bargmann et al., 1993</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

The gene <i>str-2</i> encodes a predicted G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is randomly and asymmetrically expressed in one of two bilateral AWC chemosensory neurons,\u00a0called AWC<sup>on\u00a0</sup>(<a href=\"#bib71\">Troemel et al., 1999</a>). We thus transgenically expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6 in AWC by driving it with the <i>str-2</i> promoter. We then measured the AWC<sup>on</sup> activity in response to different odorants via a microfluidic device (the olfactory chip) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chronis et al., 2007</a>). The AWC<sup>on</sup> neurons are known to respond to odor removal (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>), so we tested whether the AWC<sup>on</sup> neurons responded to the removal of the <i>A. oligospora</i>-derived odorants. We observed a strong activity in the AWC<sup>on</sup> neuron triggered by several <i>A. oligospora</i>-derived odorants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To test if the activation of the AWC<sup>on</sup> neuron was a primary response, we also imaged the AWC<sup>on</sup> activity in an <i>unc-13</i> background. Mutations of <i>unc-13</i> impair the priming of presynaptic vesicles for release, either impairing or completely blocking synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib58\">Richmond et al., 1999</a>). AWC<sup>on</sup> neurons were still strongly activated by MMB removal in an <i>unc-13</i> mutant background, suggesting that this activation is likely to be a direct chemosensory response to MMB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Compared to wild-type animals, the AWC<sup>-</sup> mutant (<i>ceh-36</i>) had a strong defect in MMB attraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

To investigate why adult hermaphrodites were so attracted to this odor, we further examined the chemotaxis behavior in different developmental stages of <i>C. elegans</i>. We found that attraction to MMB was both sex- and developmental stage-dependent, as L1 larvae, dauers, and the male animals did not exhibit strong attraction to this odor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Furthermore, when we tested MMB attraction in other <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species, we found that MMB was highly attractive to adult females but repulsive to males in the gonochoristic species such as <i>C. remanei</i>, <i>C. nigoni</i> (sp. 9), and <i>C. afra</i> (sp.7; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These observations prompted us to hypothesize that MMB-triggered attraction might be related to\u00a0sex pheromone-triggered attraction. Therefore, we monitored the mating behavior of <i>C. afra</i> in the presence or absence of MMB to examine whether MMB might interfere with mate seeking. We chose this species as we found that it has a highly robust and reproducible mating behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). When one female and two males were placed on a 3 cm NG plate without food, the nematodes mated within average\u00a0of\u00a0~5 min. However, if 1 \u03bcl MMB was placed on the lid of the Petri dishes, in a\u00a0majority of the trials, the animals failed to mate within the 30 min tracking time, suggesting that MMB interferes with mating (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Furthermore, if the female animals were pre-exposed to MMB odor for an hour before testing, mating efficiency also dramatically decreased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In contrast, if mineral oil (solvent control) or diacetyl (another food odor attractive to <i>C. elegans</i> and both sexes of <i>C. afra</i>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) was present, mating was not affected. These results suggested that MMB interfered\u00a0with mating in the gonochoristic species <i>C. afra</i> and are consistent with the hypothesis that MMB might mimic a\u00a0sex pheromone that specifically and strongly attracted hermaphroditic and female nematodes."

The <i>C. elegans</i> genome contains\u00a0~1300 genes encoding putative chemoreceptors, but only a few of their chemical ligands have been identified (<a href=\"#bib69\">Thomas and Robertson, 2008</a>). The diacetyl receptor, <i>odr-10</i>, was the first <i>C. elegans</i> chemoreceptor identified through a genetic screen and more recently, three pairs of GPCRs (<i>srbc-64</i>/<i>srbc-66</i>, <i>srg-36/srg-37,</i> and <i>daf-37</i>/<i>daf-38</i>) have been shown to encode receptors that sense ascarosides (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sengupta et al., 1996</a>). The design of our genetic screen followed an approach similar to that used in the screen that identified the diacetyl receptor, <i>odr-10</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sengupta et al., 1996</a>). In brief, mutagenized animals were given a choice between MMB and IAA (another odor sensed by the AWC neurons). Under this condition, more than 95% of the wild-type N2 animals preferred MMB. We expected that mutants with specific defects in sensing MMB, but with otherwise intact AWC function, would exhibit an abnormal preference for IAA in our screen. After two rounds of behavioral screen enrichment, mutant lines were isolated for further analyses. In total, we isolated thirteen mutants with varying degrees of chemotactic deficiency to MMB. Two mutants (<i>sy837</i> and <i>sy838</i>) showed dramatic decreases in MMB attraction, whereas eleven other mutant lines only exhibited minor decreases. Diminished MMB attraction seemed to be specific, as attraction to other odorants such as IAA and BA remained at wild-type levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). SNP mapping with the Hawaiian strain revealed the mutations mapped to chromosome X for both strongly defective mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Complementation assays revealed that the two mutants failed to complement each other, suggesting that the phenotype was likely caused by a mutation in the same gene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). By whole-genome sequencing of the two mutant lines (PS7117 and PS7118), we found that both lines had mutations in the <i>odr-7</i> gene, causing premature stop codons at codon 83 and codon 188 respectively (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A genomic rescue line generated with the fosmid WRM0639bF05 that contains the <i>odr-7</i> gene\u00a0restored the chemotaxis defects (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). ODR-7 is a nuclear receptor that modulates gene expression in the AWA and AWC neurons, including that of two GPCR genes, <i>odr-10</i> and <i>str-2</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Colosimo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sengupta et al., 1994</a>). We identified two independent <i>odr-7</i> mutants in our genetic screen but not any other mutants that exhibited a strong reduction in MMB chemotaxis, as one might expect if MMB attraction was mediated via a single chemosensory receptor. Thus, the results from our genetic screen suggest that MMB is more likely to be sensed by multiple redundant receptors in <i>C. elegans</i>."

Genes in this table have been ranked by descending values of AWC/larvae, as a general measure of their AWC-specificity. <b>AWC.vs.larvae_padj</b>: the statistical significance (if any) with which a given gene was expressed either more or less strongly in AWC neurons than in larvae. Significance is given as a p-value, adjusted for multiple testing (hence, named \u2018padj\u2019) by the collective false discovery rate (FDR) formula of Benjamini and Hochberg (<a href=\"#bib7\">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</a>).

'SigP' indicates a predicted signal sequence, and 'TM' indicates one or more transmembrane-spanning helices, with N helices indicated with '(Nx)'. Varying predictions from different isoforms are listed. <b>NCoils:</b> this shows coiled-coil domains, predicted by ncoils (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lupas, 1996</a>).

The fact that in <i>A. oligospora</i> trap morphogenesis is usually only triggered by the presence of nematodes makes it even more challenging. Since trap morphogenesis takes more than 12 hr, there is a long period during which nematodes could escape before the functional traps become fully developed. In this study, we have shown that <i>A. oligospora</i> may overcome this problem by luring nematodes to stay nearby, by producing several volatile compounds that mimic nematode food and sex cues."

Several of the odors we identified from <i>A. oligospora</i>, including the sulfurous compounds DMDS, DTP and SMT, have pungently overripe or rotten smells, suggesting that these odors might be sensed as food cues by nematodes and, as a result, are attractive to <i>C. elegans</i>. Such olfactory mimicry is also employed by various plants to attract pollinators. For example, the dead horse arum (<i>Helicodiceros muscivorus</i>) and the infamous corpse flower (<i>Amorphophallus titanium</i>) are known to produce rotten smells to attract insects; in both cases, one of the odors identified was DMDS (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lim, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shirasu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Stensmyr et al., 2002</a>).

In the gonochoristic <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species (<i>C. remanei</i>, <i>C. nigoni</i> and <i>C. afra</i>), MMB was highly attractive to the females but repulsive to the males. In the hermaphroditic <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species including <i>C.\u00a0elegans</i> and <i>C. tropicalis</i>, MMB was highly attractive to the adult hermaphrodites, but not to the males, dauers, or larvae. The presence of MMB strongly interfered with mating in <i>C. afra</i>, which is in contrast to the presence of diacetyl, another attracting chemical that is likely to be a food cue. If the female nematodes were adapted to MMB, mating was also strongly affected. Therefore, we hypothesize that MMB might be an olfactory mimic of a sex pheromone produced by male nematodes."

For example, the American bolas spider <i>Mastophora hutchinsoni</i> produces odorants that mimic female moth sex pheromones to attract different moth species (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haynes et al., 2002</a>). Orchids such as <i>Ophrys sphegodes, O. exaltata</i> and <i>Mormolyca ringens</i> produce volatile compounds that greatly resemble the chemical composition of female bee pheromones in order to attract the male bees as pollinators (<a href=\"#bib22\">Flach et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mant et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schiestl et al., 2000</a>). Whether male <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematodes produce any volatile sex pheromones is currently unknown, but a recent study has found that male pinewood nematodes <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i> produce an as yet unidentified volatile pheromone that attracts the females (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shinya et al., 2015</a>). Our study suggests that MMB produced by <i>A. oligospora</i> might function as an olfactory mimic of a sex pheromone produced by male nematodes to attract hermaphrodites or females. Therefore, it would be of interest to screen male <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematodes for the production of any volatile compounds that could be functionally or structurally related to MMB. Why <i>A. oligospora</i> produces an odor that only attracts the females and the hermaphrodites is open to speculation. We suspect that in the niches inhabited by <i>A. oligospora</i>, there is a larger population of female and hermaphroditic nematodes than males. Furthermore, males are potently attracted to females and hermaphrodites so they might be also lured to the trapped female and hermaphroditic nematodes. <i>C. elegans</i> dauers are not attracted to MMB or <i>A. oligospora</i>, which might enable them to better survive <i>A. oligospora</i> predation. MMB attraction only seems to be conserved in <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species; <i>P. pacificus</i> was attracted to <i>A. oligospora</i>, but not to MMB, suggesting that <i>A. oligospora</i> attraction is likely mediated via other odorants in <i>P. pacificus.</i>"

We believe that the olfactory mimicry strategy used by <i>A. oligospora</i> likely represents a conserved mechanism that is employed by many other predacious fungi.

We believe that our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of AWC neurons provides a useful transcriptomic dataset with which the <i>C. elegans</i> community can study diverse functions of AWC. Our study has demonstrated that AWC neurons can sense different odors produced by <i>A. oligospora</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and the response is likely to be primary, as strong activation of the AWC<sup>on</sup> neuron was still observed in the <i>unc-13</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We have identified at least 34 chemosensory GPCRs expressed in the AWC neurons, many of which might be candidates for receptors of the <i>A. oligospora</i> odors. <i>A. oligospora</i> attracts a broad range of nematode species, and we suspect that this is due to the\u00a0production of a multitude of attractive odorants that are attractive to different nematode species and are sensed by multiple chemoreceptors in the nematodes.

The preparation was obtained from starved mixed-stage hermaphrodites, mostly L3 and L4 stage larvae, with some young adults and L2-stage larvae, and a few L1-stage larvae and eggs; as before, we briefly describe it as \u2018larval RNA\u2019. This larval RNA had previously been quantitated and tested for quality with a Bioanalyzer, and successfully used for standard full-length RNA-seq (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mortazavi et al., 2010</a>). The two RNA-seq read sets counted as technical rather than biological replicates, because their starting RNA aliquots derived from a single whole larval RNA stock. However, single-cell RT-PCR amplification is an inherently noisy procedure for both technical and biological reasons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davidson et al., 2014</a>), and the different expression values for genes in the two larval RNA-seq read sets therefore provided important information about the noisiness of comparisons between expression levels of genes in AWC neurons versus whole animals.

A single volatile produced by <i>A. oligospora</i>, MMB, is sufficient to attract females or hermaphrodites from many nematode species. In hermaphrodite <i>C. elegans</i>, this attraction requires AWC sensory neurons, and AWC neurons respond to many odors produced by <i>A. oligospora</i>, including MMB. The description and identification of volatiles that attract <i>C. elegans</i> is interesting, and provides a platform for further study of micro predator-prey relationships."

I do not have an issue with equating MMB with a food cue because the GC-MS-identified volatiles are plausible microbial metabolites, but nothing that the fungi produce looks like a worm pheromone. Further, AWC has never been described as a pheromone-sensing neuron."

While the rationale for the production of food-like cues is good, I'm not entirely convinced that the authors have demonstrated that MMB mimics a sex pheromone. The authors' conclusion stems from two observations: first, that hermaphrodites are more strongly attracted to MMB than are males, and second, that hermaphrodite attraction is adult-specific. With regard to the first point, it's been recently shown that hermaphrodites are significantly more attracted than males to the food cue diacetyl and to bacterial food itself (Ryan et al. Curr Biol 2014). Thus, sex specificity alone is not conclusive evidence (i.e., we wouldn't call diacetyl a sex pheromone). If MMB is truly mimicking a male sex pheromone, there are several predictions \u2013 for example, the presence of MMB might interfere with hermaphrodite responses to genuine male pheromones, and srx-96 mutant hermaphrodites should be less attracted to males. The problem with this, as the authors note, is that there's little evidence in <i>C. elegans</i> that hermaphrodites are attracted to male pheromones at all \u2013 the only relevant evidence I know of is from the Schroeder lab (Izrayelit et al. 2012 ACS Chem Biol). Certainly, it could be that the more relevant function of MMB is to mimic male sex pheromones of related (likely male/female) nematode species, but evaluating this would not be straightforward. With regard to the second point (adult-specificity), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> pretty clearly indicates that L1 animals are indeed attracted to <i>A. oligospora</i>. It's true that dauers are not attracted, but given how little we know about dauer sensory behavior, I'm not sure this is particularly informative."

To claim that <i>odr-7</i> is the source of MMB loss, a rescue experiment is required, or at least failure to complement with <i>odr-7</i> mutants. It is similarly necessary to show Hawaiian chemotaxis to MMB to make the mapping results interpretable. Further I don't understand the logic that <i>odr-7</i> mutants are necessarily affecting only chemosensory receptor expression as the underlying mechanism for perturbations in MMB sensing. Couldn't it be any number of other transcriptional targets of <i>odr-7</i> that would affect the behavior (e.g. downstream signaling components specific to AWC)?"

Of course, this gets quite complicated: it's easy to imagine a scenario where a non-predatory ancestor produces some attractive cues.

While the rationale for the production of food-like cues is good, I'm not entirely convinced that the authors have demonstrated that MMB mimics a sex pheromone. The authors' conclusion stems from two observations: first, that hermaphrodites are more strongly attracted to MMB than are males, and second, that hermaphrodite attraction is adult-specific. With regard to the first point, it's been recently shown that hermaphrodites are significantly more attracted than males to the food cue diacetyl and to bacterial food itself (Ryan et al. Curr Biol 2014). Thus, sex specificity alone is not conclusive evidence (i.e., we wouldn't call diacetyl a sex pheromone). If MMB is truly mimicking a male sex pheromone, there are several predictions \u2013 for example, the presence of MMB might interfere with hermaphrodite responses to genuine male pheromones, and srx-96 mutant hermaphrodites should be less attracted to males. The problem with this, as the authors note, is that there's little evidence in C. elegans that hermaphrodites are attracted to male pheromones at all \u2013 the only relevant evidence I know of is from the Schroeder lab (Izrayelit et al. 2012 ACS Chem Biol). Certainly, it could be that the more relevant function of MMB is to mimic male sex pheromones of related (likely male/female) nematode species, but evaluating this would not be straightforward. With regard to the second point (adult-specificity), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> pretty clearly indicates that L1 animals are indeed attracted to A. oligospora. It's true that dauers are not attracted, but given how little we know about dauer sensory behavior, I'm not sure this is particularly informative.</i> "

As the reviewers suggested, if MMB is truly mimicking a male sex pheromone, the presence of MMB might interfere with the animal\u2019s responses to genuine male pheromones. We therefore monitored the mating behavior of a male/female <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species (<i>C. afra</i>, also known as sp. 7) in the presence or absence of MMB and the results were included in the revision (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We selected <i>C. afra</i> because it has highly robust and reproducible mating behavior. Using a worm tracker, we found that <i>C. afra</i> wild-type male and female animals would mate within an average of ~5 minutes after they were put on the assay plate. However, in the presence of MMB, the majority of the animals failed to mate during the entire tracking period (30 minutes). If the female worms were pre-exposed to MMB before mating, the majority of the animals also failed to mate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As a control, we also tracked mating behavior in the presence of another attractant that is more likely a food cue, diacetyl, and found that mating was not affected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>). We therefore think that this additional evidence further supports the idea that MMB might mimic a sex pheromone. We have also rephrased the wording in our manuscript, in order to make our interpretation of the data more nuanced and less speculative."

It is similarly necessary to show Hawaiian chemotaxis to MMB to make the mapping results interpretable. Further I don't understand the logic that odr-7 mutants are necessarily affecting only chemosensory receptor expression as the underlying mechanism for perturbations in MMB sensing.
