The most common culprit is a strain of the virus called influenza type A subtype H3N2. One reason that so many people become infected each year is that this virus evolves rapidly. Within a few years, proteins on the surface of the virus known as antigens become less recognizable to the immune system of a person who has been previously infected. This means that the person can become ill with the virus again because their immune system cannot mount an effective response to the evolved virus strain."

The third possibility is that a large beneficial mutation may arise in viruses that have many harmful mutations. These harmful mutations may initially limit the ability of the virus to spread, but over time, some of these harmful mutations may then be lost."

This substantial disease burden stems from the virus's rapid antigenic evolution, which enables it to infect hosts within several years of a previous infection. A large body of research has therefore focused on understanding the process by which influenza evolves antigenically, particularly how point mutations in the virus's hemagglutinin (HA) protein allow for immune escape (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wiley et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wilson and Cox, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Koel et al., 2013</a>) and how virus strains interact immunologically to shape this subtype's evolutionary patterns in the long term (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tria et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Recker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bedford et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Zinder et al., 2013</a>)."

Specifically, early work by <a href=\"#bib24\">Fitch et al. (1997)</a> found the number of nonsynonymous changes on tip branches of the HA phylogeny to be higher than expected, indicative of either strain selection bias or the presence of transiently circulating deleterious mutations in the influenza viral population. In more recent work, <a href=\"#bib59\">Pybus et al. (2007)</a> performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of over 140 viruses, including influenza A/H3N2. For H3N2's M1 protein, as well as for the majority of the other viral proteins examined in the study, they found heightened ratios of non-synonymous-to-synonymous substitutions on external tree branches relative to those found internally. This finding again points towards transiently circulating deleterious mutations in influenza and, more generally, across RNA virus populations. Other recent work on predicting the short-term evolution of influenza has highlighted the necessity of accounting for fitness costs associated with sublethal deleterious mutations when projecting the frequencies of influenza clades into the next season (<a href=\"#bib49\">\u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014</a>). Together, these results indicate that purifying selection is not sufficiently strong to immediately eliminate deleterious mutations from the influenza A/H3N2 virus population that circulates among humans. As a result of genetic linkage within genes and, to a lesser extent, across genes, these deleterious mutations have the potential to interact with beneficial mutations in determining which viral lineages will persist and which ones will ultimately be lost. Indeed, a recent statistical analysis of HA sequences from influenza A/H3N2 has suggested that interference effects largely determine the fates of viral mutants, rather than their inherent selective effects (<a href=\"#bib37\">Illingworth and Mustonen, 2012</a>). These interference effects are possible because of an extensive genetic linkage across influenza's HA (<a href=\"#bib72\">Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</a>) and arise from variation in the background fitness of viral strains and from variation in the fitness effects of subsequent mutations."

However, the impact that these deleterious mutations have on the population dynamics and long-term evolutionary patterns of this subtype has to date not been explored. Here, we address this question with a set of increasingly complex population genetic and population dynamic models, under the common assumption that influenza's adaptive evolution is driven by antigenic changes that allow for escape from herd immunity. We start by extending classic population genetic models into an epidemiological context. As expected from previous analyses of these types of models (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fisher, 1930</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Birky and Walsh, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Peck, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barton, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Orr, 2000</a>), we find that circulating sublethal deleterious mutations in influenza A/H3N2's viral population reduce the rate of adaptive evolution and increase the average size of the beneficial mutants that fix. Extending this analysis to models explicitly incorporating epidemiological dynamics, we further show that the accumulation of deleterious mutations can contribute to explaining the invasion dynamics of new antigenic clusters, defined as sets of viral strains that are antigenically similar to one another (<a href=\"#bib70\">Smith et al., 2004</a>). This model further predicts three distinct molecular pathways by which antigenic cluster transitions can occur, and we find empirical patterns consistent with each of these pathways in sequence data from 1992 to 2004."

This extension is critical given that antigenic mutations acquire their selective advantage through immune escape, which reduces competition for susceptible hosts and therefore in principle could allow for long-term coexistence of virus strains through niche partitioning of the host population (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cobey, 2014</a>). Indeed, in the absence of other contributing processes, it has been shown that reduced between-strain competition resulting from antigenic evolution leads to explosive genetic and antigenic diversity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>), a pattern that is inconsistent with the long-term evolutionary dynamics of influenza A/H3N2 in humans. Intriguingly, the phylodynamic model we present robustly reproduces the spindly phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's HA protein (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fitch et al., 1997</a>) under parameterizations relevant to A/H3N2 in humans. It further reproduces the recently described patterns of co-circulation of minor antigenic variants (<a href=\"#bib72\">Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</a>), as well as high annual attack rates (<a href=\"#bib79\">World Health Organization, 2014</a>). In the discussion, we situate these findings in the context of previously published models used to explain the characteristic evolutionary dynamics of influenza A/H3N2 in humans, speculate on the applicability of these findings to other influenza-host systems, and comment on the consequences of these findings for the predictability of influenza evolution."

As is common in many population genetic models, we assume an infinite population and consider this population subject to frequent sublethal deleterious mutations that act independently from one another in reducing fitness. In an explicit susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemiological context that does not yet incorporate immune escape, these assumptions lead to a deleterious mutation-selection balance in the virus population (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This balance is given by a Poisson distribution with mean <i>\u03bb</i>/<i>s</i><sub>d</sub>, where <i>\u03bb</i> is per-genome deleterious mutation rate and <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> is the transmission fitness cost of sublethal deleterious mutations. The virus population at epidemiological equilibrium will have an overall net reproductive rate (i.e., mean absolute fitness) of <i>R</i> = 1, with more transmissible viruses that carry fewer deleterious mutations having reproductive rates above one and less transmissible viruses that carry more deleterious mutations having reproductive rates below one (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, inset).

This advantageous mutant will necessarily arise in a genetic background with a certain number of deleterious mutations and, in our case, carry an immune-escape mutation that is beneficial to its spread. The genetic background in which the antigenic mutation arises and the size of the antigenic change jointly determine the mutant's initial reproductive rate <i>R</i><sub>m</sub>(<i>t</i> = 0) in the virus population (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). If this initial reproductive rate is less than one, the antigenic mutant is likely to be rapidly lost from the virus population. If the mutant's initial reproductive rate is instead greater than one, the mutant will invade the virus population if it is not initially stochastically lost. In the case of invasion, the mean reproductive rate of the antigenic mutant lineage will necessarily decline because it will accumulate its own set of deleterious mutations. (The mutant lineage's mean reproductive rate will also necessarily decline because the size of its susceptible host pool will decline over time, a factor we for now ignore but return to in later models.) For this invading antigenic mutant lineage, we can calculate a final reproductive rate <i>R</i><sub>m</sub>(<i>t</i> = \u221e), which is the mean reproductive rate of this lineage once it has reached its own mutation-selection balance (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). If this final reproductive rate falls below one, an invading antigenic mutant will therefore only transiently circulate before deterministically declining as a result of deleterious mutation accumulation. If this final reproductive rate exceeds one, however, the invading antigenic mutant lineage, under the assumptions of this model, will successfully establish. Antigenic mutants therefore experience one of three possible fates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>): rapid loss, transient circulation, or successful establishment."

                                "text": "Which of these three fates awaits an antigenic mutant depends in part on the number of deleterious mutations carried by the strain in which the antigenic mutation arises: the lower the number of background deleterious mutations, the higher the antigenic mutant's chances are of at least transient establishment, consistent with the background fitness interference effects found in <a href=\"#bib37\">Illingworth and Mustonen (2012)</a>. Which fate occurs also depends on the extent to which the antigenic mutant escapes immunity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The vast majority of small-sized antigenic mutants are rapidly lost; the remaining ones only circulate transiently before the accumulation of deleterious mutations results in their ultimate loss. Antigenic mutants that significantly escape immunity are less subject to rapid loss and also less likely to circulate only transiently. Given a specified size distribution for antigenic mutations, the average size of antigenic mutations that will successfully establish can be calculated. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> shows that this average antigenic size increases with increases in the deleterious mutation rate <i>\u03bb</i>. The magnitude of the transmission fitness cost <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> also affects the average size of antigenic mutants that will successfully establish. For any given deleterious mutation rate <i>\u03bb</i>, as <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> decreases the average size of antigenic mutants that fix increases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These results can be interpreted in the context of findings from the population genetics literature: increases in <i>\u03bb</i> and decreases in <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> similarly increase the virus population's fitness variance (as quantified by the variance in net reproductive rate <i>R</i>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> inset, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Increases in the fitness variance of asexual populations makes fixation of a beneficial mutant increasingly dependent on genetic background; only beneficial mutants that exceed a characteristic large size will have a high probability of fixing in populations with substantial fitness variance (<a href=\"#bib57\">Peck, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barton, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Schiffels et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Good et al., 2012</a>)."

This particular effect has previously been remarked upon in the context of a population genetics model for influenza's HA protein (<a href=\"#bib72\">Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</a>). Again, increases in the fitness variance of the viral population is the culprit: increases in the deleterious mutation rate <i>\u03bb</i> and decreases in the fitness cost of deleterious mutations <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> similarly act to increase fitness variance; with increased fitness variance in the population, the genetic background in which an antigenic mutant needs to arise in to have a chance at fixation will be increasingly restrictive. This leads to a reduced tempo of antigenic change, consistent with a reduction in the rate of adaptation that is known from the population genetics literature (<a href=\"#bib57\">Peck, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barton, 1995</a>)."

This dynamic is consistent with our results that antigenic evolution\u2014as traced by lineages that ultimately fix\u2014should occur via mutations of characteristically large size. These same analyses, as well as others (<a href=\"#bib58\">Plotkin et al., 2002</a>), have further indicated that antigenic cluster transitions occur only every 2 to 6 years, an incredibly slow pace given the virus's high mutation rate and the need for only a single amino acid to substantially alter antigenicity. Again, this dynamic is consistent with our results that the tempo of antigenic evolution should be severely reduced by circulating deleterious mutations. Thus, our model posits that the punctuated and surprisingly slow nature of influenza A/H3N2's antigenic evolution are related features of this largely asexual, adapting population subject to a deleterious mutation load: adaptive evolution requires not only that large antigenic mutants occur, but also that they occur in good genetic backgrounds."

Among these are that the susceptible host pool is negligibly affected over the time period of the antigenic mutant's establishment and that the successful establishment of an antigenic mutant will lead to the fixation of the mutant lineage in the virus population. Although these assumptions may be reasonable under some scenarios, they may not always be in an epidemiological context. For example, an antigenic mutant might invade sufficiently slowly to erode its frequency-dependent advantage prior to the exclusion of the existing antigenic lineage. Due to only partial cross-immunity between these lineages, this would lead to long-term coexistence of the variants. Another scenario is one of an antigenic mutant with a particularly large selective advantage: this mutant might burn through its susceptible host population so rapidly that its net reproductive rate drops significantly below one, leading to the possibility of its own extinction along with that of the previously circulating variant (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballesteros et al., 2009</a>). This scenario underscores the importance of considering the possibility of a variable virus population size; population genetic models that assume a constant population size may not be appropriate under certain epidemiological conditions."

These simulations indicate that the three fates predicted in the simpler model still play out in the explicit context of epidemiological dynamics when parameterized for influenza A/H3N2 in humans. Rapid loss is expected to occur when a small antigenic mutant arises in an average genetic background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As this combination occurs commonly, rapid loss is the most frequent fate experienced by antigenic mutants. Transient circulation occurs when a small antigenic mutant arises in a good genetic background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), provided that it survived genetic drift. Transient circulation also occurs when a large antigenic mutant arises in an average genetic background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), again provided that it survived genetic drift. Successful establishment can only occur when a large antigenic mutation arises in a good genetic background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), a \u2018jackpot\u2019 combination. In this case, the resident strain is competitively excluded as a result of strain cross-immunity. Intriguingly, the presence of deleterious mutations can also affect the invasion dynamics of antigenic mutants having this \u2018jackpot\u2019 combination: because offspring of antigenic mutants accumulate deleterious mutations, and these deleterious mutations reduce viral transmissibility, the invasion dynamics of particularly large antigenic mutants are considerably less explosive than would be expected in the absence of deleterious mutation accumulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Consequently, large antigenic mutants do not readily burn themselves out during attempted establishment, as might in theory be expected (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballesteros et al., 2009</a>)."

                                "text": "<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> shows that an antigenic mutant can exclude a resident antigenic strain, provided that it arises in a good genetic background and carries an antigenic mutation of large effect. This is consistent with detailed molecular studies of influenza A/H3N2 that have shown that single amino acid changes of large antigenic effect can precipitate an antigenic cluster transition (<a href=\"#bib70\">Smith et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Koel et al., 2013</a>), although the importance of the genetic background in which the antigenic mutation arises has not been discussed in the context of this work. The BE92-to-WU95 cluster transition, precipitated by an amino acid change from N to K at site 145, is a good example of a cluster transition occurring via a single mutational step (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koel et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Of note, several clades witnessed the 145NK amino acid substitution before it occurred in the clade that founded the WU95 viral lineage. Our models above indicate that the failure of these early 145K clades to establish could in principle be a consequence of this N-to-K amino acid change occurring in insufficiently good genetic backgrounds, as also suggested in <a href=\"#bib53\">Neher et al. (2014)</a>. Other explanations for the failure of early 145K clades to establish are of course possible. One such explanation is that these clades might have circulated in spatial locations that are not sufficiently well-connected globally. Recent work has further emphasized the important role that spatial ecology plays in the global establishment of antigenic variants (<a href=\"#bib64\">Russell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lemey et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bedford et al., 2015</a>), with findings suggesting that Asia plays a dominant role in sourcing these new variants. Thus, if the early 145K clades were not geographically well-situated, the spatial context (rather than the genetic context) of these clades may have led to their failure in establishing. We thus examined the spatial locations of the sequences from the three largest 145K clades that failed to establish: all three clades were geographically widespread, spanning at least two continents. Furthermore, two of the three clades contained sequences from Asia, despite Asia being undersampled during this time period. It is thus unlikely that these early 145K clades were geographically restricted to \u2018sink\u2019 populations. An alternative explanation for the failure of these early 145K clades to establish is that herd immunity levels against BE92 may not yet have been high enough to result in a sufficiently large selective advantage for these WU95-like lineages. Given these alternative explanations, an in vitro experimental study that quantifies relative viral fitness of these 145K lineages would thus be necessary to confirm our genetic background hypothesis."

We can therefore consider whether there might be alternative molecular pathways open to antigenic mutants that would similarly yield a successful cluster transition. One possibility is for a more common small- to medium-sized antigenic mutation to first occur in a good genetic background. This would result in a transient rise of this mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), thereby increasing the number of individuals infected with the virus carrying few deleterious mutations. A less common, large-sized antigenic mutation could then occur, effectively piggy-backing on the good genetic background that the smaller antigenic mutant inflated. Because smaller antigenic mutations can only circulate transiently, and accumulate deleterious mutations during their circulation, the large antigenic mutation must not only follow, but also rapidly follow, the rise of the smaller antigenic mutation for this molecular pathway to yield an antigenic cluster transition. This scenario is depicted in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, and phylogenetically would result in a sudden appearance of a viral lineage carrying two antigenic mutations. A phylogenetic analysis of the WU95-SY97 antigenic cluster transition provides an empirical example that is consistent with this molecular pathway of antigenic turnover, with a seemingly simultaneous accumulation of two antigenic amino acid changes (156KQ and 158EK) occurring on a short branch of the reconstructed phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koel et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

This purging could arise through within-subtype viral reassortment taking place in an individual coinfected with a strain belonging to the resident cluster and a strain belonging to the transiently circulating antigenic mutant. Even though both of the strains infecting this individual would likely carry an average deleterious mutation load, it is highly unlikely that they will carry the same set of deleterious mutations if phylogenetically sufficiently far apart. Reassortment of the eight gene segments within the coinfected host could therefore significantly lower the number of deleterious mutations carried by viral progeny characterized as belonging to the new antigenic cluster. Once the deleterious mutation load has largely been shed, the reassortant virus would quickly rise and cause an antigenic cluster transition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Indeed, many historical instances of intrasubtypic reassortment contributing to antigenic turnover have been documented (<a href=\"#bib51\">Morens et al., 2009</a>); these instances have been associated with high incidence levels as would be expected by purging of deleterious mutations. A phylogenetic analysis of the SY97-FU02 cluster transition provides an especially compelling example that is consistent with this molecular pathway of antigenic turnover. In this cluster transition, a virus antigenically characterized as FU02 reassorted with a genetically distant virus antigenically characterized as SY97 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barr et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Holmes et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This reassortant viral lineage circulated extensively in Australia and New Zealand in 2003 and subsequently in the US in the 2003\u20132004 influenza season, causing substantial morbidity and mortality (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barr et al., 2005</a>). Although this viral lineage may ultimately have led to the replacement of the non-reassortant FU02 viral lineage, both of these FU02 lineages were excluded by the subsequent CA04 antigenic cluster, which appears to have originated from the non-reassortant FU02 lineage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Intriguingly, the CA04 lineage carried with it not only an HA mutation of large antigenic size, but also two amino acid changes in its polymerase gene segment that enhanced replicative fitness (<a href=\"#bib50\">Memoli et al., 2009</a>)."

These analyses indicate that deleterious mutation loads should lower the rate of antigenic evolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Based on previous modeling work (<a href=\"#bib40\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Zinder et al., 2013</a>), a lower rate of antigenic evolution is known to constrain genetic and antigenic diversity and thus might lead to a spindly HA phylogeny. Our analyses also indicate that deleterious mutation loads increase the average size of antigenic variants that establish in the long run (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>); observed patterns of punctuated antigenic evolution (<a href=\"#bib70\">Smith et al., 2004</a>) may thus be better reproduced with a model that integrates sublethal deleterious mutations than one that ignores these mutations. Furthermore, our above analyses indicate that antigenic variants can reach appreciable numbers even when their ultimate fate is one of only transient circulation. This pattern of transient circulation points towards the possibility of co-circulation of a substantial number of antigenic variants, as argued for in statistical analyses of influenza's HA sequences (<a href=\"#bib72\">Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</a>). In our model, these antigenic variants need not necessarily strongly compete with one another for susceptible hosts for only a single lineage to persist. In the absence of exceptionally strong competition for susceptible hosts, the co-circulation of these antigenically distinct variants may thus be capable of reproducing empirically observed high annual attack rates (<a href=\"#bib79\">World Health Organization, 2014</a>)."

Most notably, these are the evolutionary parameters of the model: the deleterious mutation rate <i>\u03bb</i>, the fitness cost of deleterious mutations <i>s</i><sub>d</sub>, and the antigenic mutation rate <i>\u03bb</i><sub>antigenic</sub>. In <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, we show how the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the model simulations depend on these three parameters. Specifically, we vary one parameter while keeping the remaining two parameters fixed. For each parameter set considered, we perform 20 simulations to determine the range of dynamics predicted under a single parameterization. For each simulation, we quantify the virus's evolutionary dynamics by plotting the minimum and maximum tMRCA calculated over a continuous 10-year period (years 15\u201325 of the simulation) as a measurement of the extent of genetic diversity in the viral population. To quantify the virus's epidemiological dynamics, we plot the minimum and maximum annual attack rates over this same time period. <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a> shows that in the absence of deleterious mutations (<i>\u03bb</i> = 0) the model simulations yield explosive viral diversity, with the maximum tMRCA ranging between 5 and 25 years. The observed increases in viral genetic and antigenic diversity result in unrealistically high maximum annual attack rates, in the range of 15\u201345% (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Simulated under this parameterization, the results shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a> are representative of these results.

                        "text": "Here, we have shown that population genetic and population dynamic models incorporating sublethal deleterious mutations can reproduce the characteristic features of influenza A/H3N2's evolutionary dynamics in humans. These include the virus's rare punctuated antigenic evolution and the low genetic diversity of its hemagglutinin protein. The low genetic diversity of the virus's HA, reflected in the spindliness of its phylogeny, has been a particular evolutionary characteristic that influenza modelers have sought to reproduce. To date, three other models exist that can explain this evolutionary characteristic of influenza (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bedford et al., 2012</a>). All three of these models, however, are subject to criticism. Influenza's epochal evolution model (<a href=\"#bib40\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>) assumes that neutral or nearly neutral mutations accumulate at HA epitopes and that these changes enable a previously neutral mutation to exact a large antigenic effect and thereby to precipitate an antigenic cluster transition. Criticisms of this model are several. First, recent work indicates that amino acid changes that are responsible for cluster transitions have large antigenic effects in consensus sequences (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koel et al., 2013</a>), such that genetic context is unlikely to be of utmost importance in determining the antigenic effect of mutations. Second, a molecular evolutionary analysis following the publication of the epochal evolution model has indicated that positive selection acts not only between antigenic clusters but also within antigenic clusters (<a href=\"#bib73\">Suzuki, 2008</a>). In support of this finding, a more recent statistical analysis has shown that multiple antigenic variants co-circulate (<a href=\"#bib72\">Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</a>). Both of these empirical analyses are inconsistent with the assumptions of the epochal evolution model and indicate that the evolution of influenza is unlikely to be limited by the occurrence of antigenic mutations."

(2003)</a> and the canalization model put forward by <a href=\"#bib7\">Bedford et al. (2012)</a>. When simulated, both of these models yield antigenic variant co-circulation and are thus consistent with the analyses detailed above that have shown that influenza evolution is not antigenic mutation limited. In <a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al. (2003)</a>, generalized (strain-transcending) cross-immunity lasting on the order of 6 months was invoked to limit the genetic and antigenic diversity of influenza A/H3N2 in humans. The major criticism of this model is lack of empirical support for this duration and form of generalized cross-immunity: while there is evidence for long-lasting cross-immunity between more genetically distant strains (including heterologous influenza A subtypes), it appears to reduce pathology and possibly accelerate viral clearance rather than prevent infection (<a href=\"#bib31\">Grebe et al., 2008</a>). A recent experimental study in ferrets indicates that generalized cross-immunity that prevents infection appears to exist, but that it lasts for less than a week (<a href=\"#bib44\">Laurie et al., 2015</a>), which is insufficiently long to limit genetic and antigenic diversity in the model of Ferguson et al. The canalization model by Bedford et al. does not invoke generalized cross-immunity but instead assumes that antigenic mutations move viral strains in a two-dimensional (or higher) antigenic space. While these antigenic spaces or maps have been used to visualize the trajectories of flu's antigenic evolution (<a href=\"#bib70\">Smith et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">de Jong et al., 2007</a>), models that start with the assumption of these maps considerably inflate the degree of competition between antigenic variants. This inflation of competition results from antigenic distances between daughter variants (variants that are produced from the same parent) necessarily being subadditive in this space. Inflated competition for susceptible hosts between antigenic variants is expected to lead to a more spindly phylogeny due to increased \u2018niche overlap\u2019 and therefore more frequent occurrences of between-strain competitive exclusion."

(2003)</a> initially found that strain-specific immunity did not suffice in reproducing these patterns. From the population genetics literature on asexual populations in which interference effects are at play, it is well known that an increase in the fitness variance of a population acts to slow adaptive evolution and make the characteristic size of adaptive mutations that fix larger. While here we have invoked deleterious mutations in the generation of fitness variation, beneficial mutations can similarly contribute to inherited variation in fitness (<a href=\"#bib11\">Birky and Walsh, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barton, 1995</a>). Thus, in population genetic models, interference between beneficial mutations (or a combination of beneficial and deleterious mutations) similarly slows down the rate of adaptive evolution and increases the size of adaptive mutants that fix (<a href=\"#bib11\">Birky and Walsh, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barton, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gerrish and Lenski, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rouzine et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Park et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sniegowski and Gerrish, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Schiffels et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Good et al., 2012</a>).

In the context of influenza, however, it is a change in antigenicity that is thought to provide the selective advantage. Because antigenic changes allow for escape from herd immunity, these changes by definition reduce competition for susceptible hosts (the virus resource). As such, antigenic mutants create a partially new niche and so do not necessarily lead to competitive exclusion. The establishment of antigenic mutants can therefore instead lead to long-term coexistence and, as a result of only partial cross-immunity, a larger infected population size. This is why explosive genetic and antigenic diversity is expected in the presence of only strain-specific immunity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>). In this context, generalized cross-immunity acts to considerably increase the competition between strains for susceptible hosts (as well as to reduce the overall infected population size). As such, the fitness variance generated by beneficial antigenic mutations in this model results in a decrease in the rate of antigenic evolution, an increase in the size of antigenic mutations that establish, and limited diversity in the long run, as in population genetic models that assume full competition between beneficial mutations by considering populations of constant size (<a href=\"#bib29\">Good et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, the canalization model by Bedford et al. likely reproduces punctuated antigenic evolution and long-term limited genetic and antigenic diversity as a result of interference effects generated by inflated competition between antigenic mutations."

However, the first two of these models create fitness variation by beneficial antigenic mutations alone; because these mutations obtain their selective advantages by reducing competition for susceptible hosts, these models need other components (generalized cross-immunity or mutations that are necessarily subadditive in effect) to augment strain competition. In contrast, the deleterious mutation model we present here does not need to invoke processes to augment competition between antigenic strains because a large proportion of fitness variation in the virus population arises from differences in deleterious mutation loads (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Letting fitness variance be generated by deleterious mutations allows for limited diversity in the long run despite the co-circulation of antigenically very distinct variants that do not necessarily compete strongly for susceptible hosts. As such, our model can reproduce empirically observed high annual attack rates on the order of 10\u201315% (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a> for <i>\u03bb</i> = 0.10). Because deleterious mutations are known to circulate in the influenza A/H3N2 virus population (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fitch et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pybus et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</a>), and in light of existing criticisms of the other two models, we therefore argue that the model presented here provides a more plausible mechanistic explanation for influenza's characteristic evolutionary features."

One such finding is that cellular receptor binding avidity is an important phenotype that impacts viral fitness (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hensley et al., 2009</a>). In a naive host, influenza viruses with low receptor binding avidities have a selective advantage, whereas, in a more immune host, influenza viruses with high receptor binding avidities have a selective advantage (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hensley et al., 2009</a>). Which receptor binding avidity phenotype can be considered the \u2018deleterious\u2019 variant is therefore subject to which individual the virus finds itself in, as well as the overall degree of herd immunity in the host population (<a href=\"#bib80\">Yuan and Koelle, 2013</a>). Because changes in receptor binding avidity frequently also alter antigenicity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hensley et al., 2009</a>), it is therefore also easily conceivable that certain of these changes increase virus fitness via two distinct mechanisms. As such, even though the genetic change is one and the same, the change in binding avidity that results can be thought of as increasing the background fitness of a virus strain, whereas the change in antigenicity that results can be considered as in this paper. Successful cluster transitions via the \u2018jackpot\u2019 strategy, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, may therefore preferentially involve mutations that simultaneously affect binding avidity and antigenicity. Indeed, the majority of cluster-transition mutations that have been recently characterized fall near the receptor binding site of influenza's HA (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koel et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that changes in the receptor binding avidity phenotype that occur with these antigenic mutations may improve virus fitness."

Whether glycosylation sites accumulate over evolutionary time (as in the case of H3N2 in humans [<a href=\"#bib12\">Blackburne et al., 2008</a>]) or do not (as in the case of H1N1 in humans [<a href=\"#bib18\">Das et al., 2011</a>]) therefore will depend on how these sites impact the background fitness of virus strains. In the case of H1N1, for example, glycosylation has been shown to significantly reduce receptor binding avidity and therewith to lower overall virus fitness, despite the beneficial effect of glycosylation on escape from antibody-mediated neutralization (<a href=\"#bib18\">Das et al., 2011</a>). Compensatory mutations are therefore needed to restore virus fitness following the addition of a glycosylation site (<a href=\"#bib18\">Das et al., 2011</a>). Other phenotypes that impact virus fitness include those that influence protein stability (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bloom and Glassman, 2009</a>) and those that confer resistance to antivirals (<a href=\"#bib35\">Herlocher et al., 2004</a>). In the case of permissive mutations that influence protein stability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bloom et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gong et al., 2013</a>), these mutations may not directly influence virus fitness; their occurrence, however, may impact the viability of other mutations that have fitness consequences and thus may alter the size distribution of viable beneficial mutations, including those that allow for immune escape. Epistatic interactions such as these can therefore be accommodated within this general framework of fitness variation generated by phenotypes other than antigenicity in driving patterns of influenza's antigenic evolution. While we here simply model this fitness variation as arising from circulating deleterious mutations, any of these non-antigenic phenotypes can similarly contribute to this fitness variation. Indeed, deleterious mutations are necessarily deleterious as a consequence of some phenotype, whether it is susceptibility to antivirals, a suboptimal receptor binding avidity, a protein with reduced stability, or simply another phenotype that reduces viral replication. The complementary phenotypes to these can conversely be considered as beneficial mutations that contribute to fitness variation. As such, there is not always a clear source of fitness variation in the influenza virus population. What is critical, however, is that a significant proportion of the virus's fitness variation has to arise from non-antigenic phenotypes that do not reduce competition between virus strains, as antigenic mutants alone result in explosive genetic and antigenic diversity as a result of effective niche partitioning. Our choice of modeling simply deleterious mutation accumulation, instead of specific non-antigenic phenotypes, stems from the finding that virus populations, and more specifically influenza virus populations, carry substantial deleterious mutation loads (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fitch et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pybus et al., 2007</a>)."

Two processes exist, however, that can keep this long-term accumulation of deleterious mutations from occurring. First, as the virus population becomes less fit the proportion of non-antigenic mutations that are beneficial is likely to increase, such that the mutation-selection balance becomes an evolutionary attractor (<a href=\"#bib30\">Goyal et al., 2012</a>). Second, within-subtype viral reassortment could occur sufficiently frequently to keep any long-term decline in viral fitness at bay by combining segments with low mutational load onto the same genetic background. The possibility that influenza A/H3N2 has been declining in fitness over time may, however, also be entertained: a recent virological analysis of human H3N2 viruses points towards a long-term decrease (since 1968) in the propensity of the virus to bind human sialic acid receptors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lin et al., 2012</a>). This decrease has been invoked to explain the reduction in this virus's disease impact over the last 10 years (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lin et al., 2012</a>). Whether this finding can be interpreted as evidence for a \u2018weakening\u2019 of the virus over time is unclear, especially because \u2018weakening\u2019 by any epidemiological measure has not been empirically demonstrated. Clearly, more virological studies are needed to determine the fitness trajectory of influenza A/H3N2 in humans over the past decades."

For example, influenza B is known to have a lower mutation rate than influenza A/H3N2 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nobusawa and Sato, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010</a>). Given that the deleterious mutation rate <i>\u03bb</i> is likely to decrease with the overall mutation rate, we would expect influenza B to carry a lower mean mutation load and further to have lower fitness variance. As such, we would expect smaller antigenic mutants to be able to successfully establish (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Our model would therefore predict that influenza B evolves antigenically in a less punctuated manner than influenza A/H3N2\u2014a pattern that has been recently documented (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bedford et al., 2014</a>). All else equal, we would also expect influenza B to have a faster rate of antigenic evolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). However, a lower mutation rate would also surely reduce the rate at which antigenic mutations occur. The slower rate of antigenic evolution observed for influenza B (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bedford et al., 2014</a>) is therefore not inconsistent with our model. Relative to these two influenza viruses, human influenza A/H1N1 shows a similar pattern to H3N2 in terms of punctuated antigenic evolution (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bedford et al., 2014</a>). Despite this similarity, H1N1's rate of antigenic evolution is considerably slower than H3N2's, although it is faster than influenza B's rate of antigenic evolution (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bedford et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2015</a>). The observed difference in rate of antigenic evolution between H3N2 and H1N1 is unlikely to reflect differences in these virus's mutation rates, since both are influenza A subtypes. Instead, these differences may stem from differences in their basic reproductive rates and, therefore, differences in selection pressures. This explanation is consistent with the finding that H1N1 appears to experience weaker antigenic selection than H3N2 in humans (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bhatt et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, the lower rate of antigenic evolution in H1N1 relative to H3N2 may be a consequence of differences in these viruses' global circulation patterns, which have only recently been described (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bedford et al., 2015</a>)."

However, its rate of antigenic evolution is approximately six times slower than the same virus's in humans (<a href=\"#bib19\">de Jong et al., 2007</a>). This difference in the rate of antigenic evolution likely stems more from the stark ecological differences between the two hosts, rather than from differences in their deleterious mutation loads, with escape from humoral immunity being a less important evolutionary driver of HA in short-lived hosts than in humans."

Indeed, two recent publications have made great strides in predicting the genetic evolution of influenza A/H3N2 in humans over the short term (<a href=\"#bib53\">Neher et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">\u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014</a>). \u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig's approach incorporated knowledge of antigenic and non-antigenic sites in developing a fitness model for this virus. With the assumption that mutations at non-antigenic sites were weakly deleterious, the authors were able to predict which influenza clades would grow and which ones would decline with an accuracy of 93% and 76%, respectively (<a href=\"#bib43\">Koelle and Rasmussen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">\u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014</a>). Instead of using knowledge specific to influenza A/H3N2, Neher et al.\u2019s approach relied on branching patterns present in the HA phylogeny to predict strain evolution, with a success rate comparable to that of \u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig. The ability of both of these models to predict influenza evolution rests on the presence of substantial fitness variation in the influenza A/H3N2 virus population. The work here contributes to this understanding by reconciling the presence of fitness variation in the virus population with the observation of limited genetic and antigenic diversity of influenza A/H3N2's HA in the long run: cluster transitions will only succeed when large antigenic mutations find themselves in good genetic backgrounds, which must be largely determined by non-antigenic phenotypes. Successfully predicting cluster transitions will therefore require not only better characterizing the antigenic effects of mutations but also characterizing relative virus fitness, as mediated by differential deleterious mutation loads and contributions of non-antigenic phenotypes, in influenza's HA and other gene segments. An integrative understanding of these non-antigenic components of viral fitness will require the continued work of virologists and modelers alike, and ideally their interaction, for predicting viral evolution."

We here briefly re-derive the deleterious mutation-selection balance for a virus population in an explicit epidemiological context. To do so we consider a virus population subject exclusively to deleterious mutations. Because we are not considering antigenic variation at this point, the epidemiological dynamics are governed by a basic SIR model. In this model, the number of susceptible hosts increases only through births into the host population and decreases through background mortality and infection of susceptible hosts. The number of infected hosts increases through infection of susceptible hosts and decreases through recovery from infection and through natural mortality of infected hosts. The number of recovered hosts increases through recovery of infected individuals and decreases through natural mortality of recovered hosts. To extend this basic SIR model to allow for a virus population undergoing deleterious mutations, we classify infected individuals according to the number of deleterious mutations harbored by the virus they carry. This classification makes the implicit assumption that an infected host harbors a genetically homogeneous virus population; that is, in this case, that there is no variation in the number of deleterious mutations carried by distinct virions that make up the intrahost viral population. Although the assumption of a genetically homogeneous within-host virus population is clearly a simplifying assumption, it is an assumption that is commonly made in population-level models of influenza evolution (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andreasen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gog and Grenfell, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bedford et al., 2012</a>). As in <a href=\"#bib32\">Haigh (1978)</a>, we assume that mutations occur at birth, which, in the context of a virus population, are disease transmission events. We choose this approach to introduce new deleterious mutations over an approach that assumes that infected individuals can \u2018mutate\u2019 from being infected with a virus having a specified number of deleterious mutations to being infected with a virus having a higher number of deleterious mutations. This is because it is unlikely that a deleterious mutation that arises within a host could rapidly sweep to fixation in that host once the intrahost viral population is large. Introducing deleterious mutations at disease transmission events is therefore a more biologically reasonable assumption. Again as in <a href=\"#bib32\">Haigh (1978)</a>, we further let the number of deleterious mutations that arise at \u2018birth\u2019 be Poisson distributed with mean <i>\u03bb</i>, where <i>\u03bb</i> is the per-genome per-transmission deleterious mutation rate.

Neither of these parameters have been estimated specifically for influenza. We therefore do our best with estimating them using existing data from other viruses or via rough estimates that incorporate existing knowledge about influenza. The parameter <i>\u03bb</i> was roughly computed by first multiplying the genome size of influenza's major coding regions (12,741 nucleotides [<a href=\"#bib36\">Holmes et al., 2005</a>]) with the empirical estimate of 2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup> for the number of substitutions that occur per nucleotide per cell infection in influenza A viruses (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010</a>). This yielded a per-genome, per-transmission substitution rate of 0.293. With roughly 2/3 of mutations being non-synonymous and roughly 50% of non-lethal, non-synonymous mutations being deleterious (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2004</a>), we calculated the per-genome, per-transmission deleterious mutation rate <i>\u03bb</i> as the product: <math id=\"inf20\"><mrow><mn>0.293</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mo>\u00d7</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mo>\u2248</mo><mn>0.10</mn></mrow></math>.

                                "text": "To get a rough estimate of the transmission fitness cost of deleterious mutations for influenza, we start with empirical estimates of mean fitness cost values for the five viruses studied in <a href=\"#bib65\">Sanju\u00e1n (2010)</a>: 0.103, 0.107, 0.112, 0.126, and 0.132. These fitness costs are in vitro fitness costs associated with viral growth in cells. These costs therefore differ from transmission fitness costs at the population level, which is how <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> is defined in the models we present. To obtain a rough estimate for transmission fitness cost from these within-host viral growth fitness costs, we used a published within-host model of influenza dynamics (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baccam et al., 2006</a>) to simulate viral load dynamics under two scenarios: a \u2018wild-type\u2019 parameterization and a \u2018deleterious mutant\u2019 parameterization, where the mutant carries a specified fitness cost. The \u2018wild-type\u2019 scenario used parameter values that were estimated in <a href=\"#bib2\">Baccam et al. (2006)</a> using viral load data from six individuals who were experimentally infected with influenza. To parameterize the \u2018deleterious mutant\u2019 scenario, we assumed that the in vitro fitness cost manifested itself through a reduction in the within-host viral production rate. We therefore set all of the within-host parameters of the \u2018deleterious mutant\u2019 scenario to be equal to the ones used in the \u2018wild-type\u2019 scenario, with the exception of the viral production rate. This parameter we set to the product of the \u2018wild-type\u2019 scenario's viral production rate and the quantity 1 minus the in vitro fitness cost. For the six patients in <a href=\"#bib2\">Baccam et al. (2006)</a>, we simulated the \u2018wild-type\u2019 and the \u2018deleterious mutant\u2019 scenarios for each of the five in vitro fitness costs listed above. We then mapped these simulated viral load dynamics to between-host transmission rates by assuming that viral transmission rates are proportional to the log of viral load: <math id=\"inf21\"><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u221d</mo><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>. This assumption is commonly used (see <a href=\"#bib33\">Handel et al., 2013</a>) and has some empirical support, particularly from studies of HIV (<a href=\"#bib60\">Quinn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fraser et al., 2007</a>). The population-level transmission fitness costs <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> for the five empirical within-host fitness cost estimates from <a href=\"#bib65\">Sanju\u00e1n (2010)</a> could thus be inferred for each of the patients studied in <a href=\"#bib2\">Baccam et al. (2006)</a>. Our simulations indicate, first and foremost, that relatively large fitness costs within a host translate into much smaller fitness effects at the population level. This is in part unsurprising given that we assume that transmission rates scale with the log of the viral load. We further found that in vitro fitness costs in the last three patients studied in <a href=\"#bib2\">Baccam et al. (2006)</a> would translate into fitness benefits in terms of transmission. Rather than trusting this to be the case biologically, this paradoxical result is likely to be a result of the rough mapping that we (and others) use for translating between viral load and transmissibility. We therefore restricted ourselves to the first three patients studied in <a href=\"#bib2\">Baccam et al. (2006)</a>. For them, we found that within-host fitness costs of 0.103\u20130.132 yielded transmission fitness costs between 0.002 and 0.018, with a mean transmission fitness cost <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> of 0.008, which we use in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>. Given the uncertainties present in our estimate of <i>s</i><sub>d</sub>, we instead show three different values for <i>s</i><sub>d</sub> in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>. These indicate that the qualitative effects of circulating deleterious mutations (larger average antigenic sizes of mutants that establish and slower rates of antigenic evolution) are robust to specific values for <i>s</i><sub>d</sub>."

We use a birth/death rate of <i>\u03bc</i> = 1/30 years<sup>\u22121</sup>, based on crude birth rate estimates of approximately 33 per 1000 individuals per year (<a href=\"#bib76\">United Nations, 2011</a>). This value for <i>\u03bc</i> is also consistent with a recent flu modeling study (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bedford et al., 2012</a>). The recovery rate <i>\u03b3</i> was chosen based on an in-depth meta-analysis of 56 human challenge studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Carrat and Flahault, 2007</a>). In this study, the authors found an average duration of viral shedding of 4.8 days for influenza viruses (regardless of subtype). They also calculated an average generation time of 3.1 days for influenza A/H3N2, where generation time is defined as the time between an individual becoming infected and transmitting the virus. Because, in an epidemiological model with a constant transmission rate and a constant recovery rate, the duration of infectiousness (taken to be the duration of viral shedding) and the generation time take the same value when a virus is endemically circulating, we chose an intermediate value between these estimates, letting the recovery rate <i>\u03b3</i> = 1/4 days<sup>\u22121</sup>.

Using the same notation as in history-based multi-strain models (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andreasen et al., 1997</a>), each currently uninfected individual carries a list of antigenic types with which he has previously been infected. Each infected individual similarly carries this list of previously experienced antigenic types. In addition to this list, each infected individual carries a current viral infection that is characterized by the infecting virus's deleterious mutation load and its antigenic type. Again, we assume for the sake of model simplicity that the intrahost viral population is genetically homogeneous such that a single deleterious mutation load and a single antigenic type suffice in characterizing a viral infection.

Simulations without antigenic evolution were conducted with the same evolutionary and epidemiological parameters; average viral <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> was as in the simulations with antigenic evolution except <i>\u03bb</i><sub>antigenic</sub> was set to zero. However, because there was no antigenic evolution, the average number of infected humans over time and the annual attack rates were significantly lower than in the simulations with antigenic evolution. To compensate for this, in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, we allowed immunity to wane over time, as in standard SIRS epidemiological models. The rate of immune waning was set such that immunity from a previous infection lasted 12 years on average before the host became completely susceptible again. This rate of immune waning was chosen to produce an average annual attack rate of \u223c5\u201310%, consistent with what was observed in the simulations with antigenic and non-antigenic mutations."

This is an important aspect of influenza evolution, because traditional theory and data analysis of influenza evolution has focused on antigenic effects alone and neglected other evolutionary forces such as the genetic load caused by deleterious mutations. The dynamics analysed in this paper are complex, because they are shaped by the interplay of beneficial antigenic mutations, deleterious background mutations, and by large fluctuations in population size and absolute fitness caused by the epidemiology of the virus. The main findings are that deleterious mutations (a) change the speed and character of antigenic evolution, and (b) affect the epidemiology of influenza; in particular, they can explain the linear shape of the influenza tree."

In light of this theory, the result that deleterious mutations reduce the probability of fixation for beneficial mutations is well known. This effect is contained in the theory of background selection (e.g. in the work of B. Charlesworth), as well as in travelling wave models: deleterious mutations generate fitness variance, which makes the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation strongly background-dependent (Good et al., Distribution of fixed beneficial mutations and the rate of adaptation in asexual populations, PNAS 2012). Beneficial mutations with effect size below a certain threshold fix with a reduced rate close to neutral mutations, which results in an increased average effect of fixed mutations (Good et al., PNAS 2012; Schiffels et al., Emergent neutrality in adaptive asexual evolution, Genetics 2011); specifically for influenza, the reduction of the adaptive rate due to linked deleterious mutations in non-adaptive sequence has also been observed in <a href=\"#bib72\">Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</a>."

In particular, the authors find that the reduced rate and increased average effect of antigenic mutations may contribute to the linear shape of the influenza tree and to increased attack rates. However, it should become clearer that a strong pruning of antigenic mutations by the joint dynamics with deleterious mutations requires that the latter contribute a substantial fraction of the average fitness variance in the population. This may be the case in model simulations (and the results on tree shape should be compared with the relative contributions of mutation classes to fitness variance). But it is not clear for the actual system. Furthermore, we suggest the authors juxtapose their finding of the influence of deleterious mutations on tree shape with previous explanations of this characteristic."

We think this argument is incorrect. According to all models cited above, deleterious mutations should add to the fitness variance in the population and, hence, increase the amount of interference selection. This does not contradict the suggested pruning of antigenic mutations, because in the joint model, antigenic competition is no longer equivalent to fitness competition. The antigenic variance in the population may decrease with increasing rate or effect of deleterious mutations, even if the total fitness variance increases."

Charlesworth), as well as in travelling wave models: deleterious mutations generate fitness variance, which makes the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation strongly background-dependent (Good et al., Distribution of fixed beneficial mutations and the rate of adaptation in asexual populations, PNAS 2012). Beneficial mutations with effect size below a certain threshold fix with a reduced rate close to neutral mutations, which results in an increased average effect of fixed mutations (Good et al., PNAS 2012; Schiffels et al., Emergent neutrality in adaptive asexual evolution, Genetics 2011); specifically for influenza, the reduction of the adaptive rate due to linked deleterious mutations in non-adaptive sequence has also been observed in</i> <a href=\"#bib72\"><i>Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012</i></a>."

Instead, the most well known, as well as the most recent, multi-strain models of influenza at the population level have all \u2013 without exception that we know of \u2013 made the model-simplifying assumption that hosts, when infected, are infected with a single genotype of the virus (e.g. <a href=\"#bib27\">Gog &amp; Grenfell (2002)</a> PNAS, <a href=\"#bib1\">Andreasen et al. (1997)</a> J. Math Bio., <a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al. (2003)</a> Nature, <a href=\"#bib40\">Koelle et al. (2006)</a> Science, <a href=\"#bib7\">Bedford et al. (2012)</a> BMC Biology and papers based on this model, most recently <a href=\"#bib9\">Bedford et al. (2015)</a> Nature). We similarly make this modeling assumption. Although not \u2018true\u2019, this assumption greatly simplifies the structure of these types of dynamical systems models. Whether explicitly including intrahost diversity in any of these population-level models would make any difference in terms of predicted dynamics should be theoretically considered at some point in a separate piece of work. The degree of realism that is incorporated into epidemiological models is always to some extent a subjective decision, although it should be based in large part on the question being addressed in the work."

What is critical in terms of the model is therefore not how faithfully we model the exact manner in which deleterious mutations arise or are removed from the influenza viral population (this will depend on the size of the transmission bottleneck, the degree of intrahost diversity, and the relationship between within- host and population-level fitness). Instead, <i>what is critical is that the formulation of our model allows for the transient circulation of deleterious mutations in influenza\u2019s viral population</i>. This transient circulation of deleterious mutations has been empirically established through phylogenetic analyses of influenza virus sequence data (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fitch et al. (1997)</a> PNAS, <a href=\"#bib59\">Pybus et al. (2007)</a> Molecular Biology and Evolution). While a highly complex model that incorporates intrahost genetic diversity and transmission bottlenecks of a specified size may more faithfully capture the mechanistic origins of deleterious mutations, this model\u2019s complexity would very likely limit our ability to identify the specific roles that circulating deleterious mutations play in shaping patterns of influenza\u2019s antigenic evolution.

Specifically, we assume that deleterious mutations arise at the time of transmission and that they are removed from the population with recovery events of infected individuals. We make the assumption that deleterious mutations arise at the time of transmission to be consistent with population genetic models which assume that deleterious mutations arise at birth. Presumably, deleterious mutations do arise during the period of infection. Indeed, all of the multi-strain influenza models referenced above assume that individuals \u2018mutate\u2019 from being infected with one genotype/antigenic phenotype of the virus to being infected with a different genotype/antigenic phenotype of the virus (e.g., I<sub>1</sub> \u2192 I<sub>2</sub>). While this formulation may make sense for antigenic mutants, which are likely to have a selective advantage within infected hosts, this formulation is not reasonable for deleterious mutations. This is because if transmission-reducing deleterious mutations emerged de novo within hosts during their infectious period, it is unlikely that they would experience a strong intrahost selective advantage. As such, they would not rise to appreciable frequencies within hosts. Simulating the origination of deleterious mutations as coming from infected individuals \u2018mutating\u2019 from being infected with one viral strain carrying <i>k</i> deleterious mutations to being infected with a lower-fitness strain (in terms of transmission) carrying <i>k+1</i> or more deleterious mutations is therefore not a great modeling choice. We therefore have deleterious mutations be introduced at the time of transmission (\u2018birth\u2019). For consistency, we similarly model the introduction of antigenic mutations at transmission in the phylodynamic model. As the referees have noted, the assumption of a single genotype within an infected host is not biologically accurate (\u2018true\u2019). However, <i>short of modeling intrahost genetic diversity and transmission bottlenecks explicitly, we feel that the formulations of our models adopt the most parsimonious assumptions possible in terms of when mutations accumulate</i>."
