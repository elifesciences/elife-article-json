However, the functional importance of these intricate inter-connections, and how they are established is currently unclear. Here, we reveal that a conserved ATPase, Fap7, organizes interactions between neighboring r-proteins uS11 and eS26 prior to their delivery to the earliest ribosome precursor, the 90S. In vitro, uS11 only when bound to Fap7 becomes competent to recruit eS26 through tertiary contacts found between these r-proteins on the mature ribosome. Subsequently, Fap7 ATPase activity unloads the uS11:eS26 subcomplex onto its rRNA binding site, and therefore ensures stoichiometric integration of these r-proteins into the 90S. Fap7-depletion in vivo renders uS11 susceptible to proteolysis, and precludes eS26 incorporation into the 90S. Thus, prefabrication of a native-like r-protein subcomplex drives efficient and accurate construction of the eukaryotic ribosome."

However, the functional importance of these intricate inter-connections, and how they are established is currently unclear. Here, we reveal that a conserved ATPase, Fap7, organizes interactions between neighboring r-proteins uS11 and eS26 prior to their delivery to the earliest ribosome precursor, the 90S. In vitro, uS11 only when bound to Fap7 becomes competent to recruit eS26 through tertiary contacts found between these r-proteins on the mature ribosome. Subsequently, Fap7 ATPase activity unloads the uS11:eS26 subcomplex onto its rRNA binding site, and therefore ensures stoichiometric integration of these r-proteins into the 90S. Fap7-depletion in vivo renders uS11 susceptible to proteolysis, and precludes eS26 incorporation into the 90S. Thus, prefabrication of a native-like r-protein subcomplex drives efficient and accurate construction of the eukaryotic ribosome."

Cleavage within the 35S pre-rRNA releases the small subunit precursor, the 40S pre-ribosome and permits the remaining pre-rRNA to associate with 60S-r-proteins and assembly factors to form the 60S pre-ribosome.

Cytoplasmic maturation of the 40S pre-ribosome requires endonucleolytic cleavage of the 20S pre-rRNA at site D to generate the 3\u2019 end of mature 18S rRNA. This step is catalyzed by the endonuclease Nob1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fatica et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pertschy et al., 2009</a>) and is thought to occur within an 80S-like particle formed upon the interaction of a 40S pre-ribosome with a mature 60S subunit (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lebaron et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Strunk et al., 2012</a>). Functional studies have identified additional factors that influence the processing of immature 20S pre-rRNA. These include the Nob1-interacting protein Pno1, the methyltransferase Dim1, the GTPase mimic Tsr1, atypical ATPases Rio1 and Rio2, the DEAH ATPase Prp43 and its cofactor Pfa1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Geerlings et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McCaughan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pertschy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Strunk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Turowski et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, r-proteins uS11 and eS26 (yeast Rps14a/b and Rps26a/b; nomenclature according to <a href=\"#bib3\">Ban et al., 2014</a>) are essential for endonucleolytic cleavage of 20S pre-rRNA (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jakovljevic et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2014</a>). eS26 clamps the 3\u2019 end of 18S rRNA and directly contacts its neighboring r-protein uS11. Depletion of Tsr2 or the ATPase Fap7, the binding partners of eS26 and uS11, respectively, also impairs cytoplasmic processing of 20S pre-rRNA (<a href=\"#bib20\">Granneman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Strunk et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that these r-proteins play a role to correctly position the D site for Nob1-mediated 20S pre-rRNA cleavage."

In yeast, within 90 min, the majority of\u00a0~14 million newly synthesized r-proteins are targeted to the nuclear compartment by the import machinery for incorporation into pre-ribosomal particles (<a href=\"#bib71\">Warner, 1999</a>). r-proteins contain large unstructured regions that are prone to non-specific interactions with nucleic acids and proteolytic degradation in their non-assembled state (<a href=\"#bib23\">J\u00e4kel and G\u00f6rlich, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">J\u00e4kel et al., 2002</a>). To overcome this logistical challenge, a subset of newly synthesized r-proteins employ dedicated chaperones that bind them in the cytoplasm and co-coordinate their nuclear import (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mitterer et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pausch et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pillet et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Stelter et al., 2015</a>). Recently, we reported a different mechanism by which the r-protein eS26 is safely transferred to the 90S (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2014</a>). In this case, eS26, like a typical import cargo, directly recruits multiple importins for its transport to the nucleus. However, unlike a typical import cargo, after reaching the nuclear compartment, eS26 is extracted from the importin by an unloading factor, the escortin Tsr2, without the aid of RanGTP. Once bound to Tsr2, eS26 is shielded from proteolysis, enabling its safe transfer to the 90S."

How the assembly machinery co-ordinates incorporation of different r-proteins into their rRNA binding site(s), and thereby prevents wasteful production of incompletely assembled ribosomes is currently unclear. In this study, we unveil an essential energy-dependent mechanism that enables stoichiometric integration of r-proteins into an assembling 90S. We demonstrate that Fap7, a conserved ATPase, pre-organizes interactions between neighboring r-proteins uS11 and eS26 through native-like tertiary contacts prior to their delivery to the 90S. Subsequently, Fap7 ATPase activity concurrently integrates the uS11:eS26 subcomplex into the 90S. Thus, prefabrication of an uS11:eS26 subcomplex guarantees stoichiometric levels of these r-proteins are incorporated into the 90S."

A high-copy suppressor screen was performed in the model organism yeast, to identify genes, which, upon overexpression, suppressed the severe growth defect of a <i>TSR2</i> conditional mutant (P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i>). To this end, the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i> mutant strain was transformed with a high-copy (2\u00b5) plasmid library and grown on repressive glucose-containing media at 25\u00b0C. Plasmids were recovered from fast-growing suppressor colonies. Sequence analyses identified <i>RPS14a</i> (hereafter termed <i>uS11</i>), a gene encoding the 40S subunit r-protein uS11 (yeast Rps14), and another gene <i>YDL166C</i> encoding the essential ATPase Fap7 as candidate suppressors. To directly test this possibility, <i>FAP7</i> and <i>uS11</i> were subcloned into high-copy plasmids and then tested for their ability to suppress the impaired growth of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i> mutant. These analyses revealed that overexpression of <i>FAP7</i> and <i>uS11</i> weakly rescued the growth defect of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i> mutant, as determined by the size of single colonies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interestingly, uS11 forms a stable complex with the ATPase Fap7 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Granneman et al., 2005</a>). Structural studies of the Fap7:uS11 complex revealed that Fap7 functions as a RNA mimic suggesting that it stabilizes uS11 before being incorporated into 40S ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hellmich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Loc'h et al., 2014</a>). Co-overexpression of <i>FAP7</i> and <i>uS11</i> together restored impaired growth of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i> mutant to nearly WT rates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

First, we assessed whether impaired cytoplasmic processing of 20S pre-rRNA seen in the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i> mutant was rescued upon <i>FAP7</i> and <i>uS11</i> co-overexpression. For this, we localized the 5\u2032 portion of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). ITS1 is present within immature 20S pre-rRNA, but not in mature 18S rRNA. In a WT strain, due to efficient nuclear export of 40S pre-ribosomes, Cy3-ITS1 (red) is detectable only in the nucleolus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). After nuclear export, ITS1 is rapidly cleaved from 20S pre-rRNA by the endonuclease Nob1 and degraded by the exonuclease Xrn1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moy and Silver, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stevens et al., 1991</a>). As previously reported, Tsr2-depleted cells accumulate Cy3-ITS1 in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2014</a>), indicating impairment in cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing. However, these cells co-overexpressing <i>FAP7</i> and <i>uS11</i> did not show this phenotype as judged by the absence of cytoplasmic fluorescence signal of Cy3-ITS1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Next, we assessed 20S pre-rRNA levels by Northern blotting using an oligonucleotide complementary to ITS1. Consistent with previous studies, P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i> mutant cells showed high levels of immature 20S pre-rRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> lane 1; <a href=\"#bib49\">Peng et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2014</a>).

We tested whether Fap7 ATPase activity is required to load a preformed uS11:eS26 complex onto H23 rRNA. For this, immobilized GST-uS11 was incubated with eS26 and H23 rRNA in the presence of Fap7 or mutant Fap7-2, and ATP or the non-hydrolysable ATP-analog AMPPNP (summarized in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Recruitment of H23 rRNA to the GST-uS11:eS26 complex is not due to bound eS26, since GST-eS26 alone did not detectably bind H23 rRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, lane 2). Further, nearly identical levels of H23 rRNA were recruited to GST-uS11 and GST-uS11:eS26 complexes, in the presence of Fap7 and ATP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, compare lanes 5 and 7). Altogether, these data show that Fap7 orchestrates the formation of an uS11:eS26 complex, and its ATPase activity facilitates loading of this prefabricated r-protein subcomplex onto H23 rRNA."

We fused GFP to the C-terminus of uS11 with the aim of preventing its incorporation into the 90S. uS11-GFP localized to the nucleus indicating that the fusion protein was competent to interact with nuclear import machinery, but as expected it is unable to complement the lethality of the uS11-deletion strain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We exploited the uS11-GFP fusion as a tool to monitor transport of uS11 to the nucleus in different importin mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Nuclear uptake of uS11-GFP was specifically impaired in the <i>pse1-1</i> mutant and <i>pse1-1/kap104\u2206</i> double mutant, but not in other tested importin mutants such as <i>kap104\u2206</i>, <i>kap123\u2206</i>, <i>msn5\u2206</i>, <i>kap114\u2206/sxm1\u2206</i> and <i>kap120\u2206/sxm1\u2206/nmd5\u2206</i>. These in vivo data suggest that uS11 employs primarily Pse1 for nuclear targeting. We were unable to directly test interactions between uS11 alone and Pse1 as well as other importins in vitro, since untagged uS11, in the absence of Fap7, was aggregation-prone. However, we found that importins Pse1 and Kap104 efficiently recruited the Fap7:uS11 complex, but not Fap7 alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) suggesting that uS11 can function as an adaptor to transport Fap7 to the nucleus via a \u2018piggyback\u2019 mechanism.

We evaluated whether the importin:uS11:Fap7 complexes were disassembled by RanGTP in vitro. Indeed, incubation with RanGTP efficiently dissociated Fap7:uS11 from Pse1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Instead, Tsr2 was able to unload eS26 from the importin:eS26 complex in a RanGTP-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2014</a>). Since co-overexpression of Fap7 and uS11 compensated Tsr2-requirement in vivo, we wondered whether the Fap7:uS11 complex is able to release eS26 from a preformed Pse1:eS26 complex. To test this, we incubated a GST-Pse1:eS26 complex with the Fap7:uS11 complex, and evaluated eS26 release by Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). These analyses revealed that Fap7:uS11 did not release eS26 from Pse1. Instead, Fap7:uS11 was recruited to the GST-Pse1:eS26 resin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, lane 3). Intriguingly, eS26 was efficiently released after incubating this resin with RanGTP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, compare lanes 3 and 5). These data suggest that the GST-Pse1:eS26 complex becomes sensitive to RanGTP-dependent disassembly possibly due to the recruitment of the Fap7:uS11 complex. To test this, we treated the GST-Pse1:eS26 with the Fap7:uS11<sup>3R</sup> mutant complex that is impaired in binding eS26 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3C</a>). We then incubated the resin with RanGTP and evaluated eS26 release by Western blotting. These studies revealed that, unlike the wild-type Fap7:uS11 complex, treatment with the mutant Fap7:uS11<sup>3R</sup> complex did not render GST-Pse1:eS26 susceptible to RanGTP disassembly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, compare lanes 5 and 7). These data support the idea that recruitment of Fap7:uS11 to the Pse1:eS26 complex through tertiary contacts renders eS26 release from Pse1 RanGTP sensitive."

The majority of these r-proteins need to be imported into the nucleus and then safely delivered to the ribosome assembly site in nucleolus. A challenge for the assembly machinery is to ensure that stoichiometric levels of r-proteins are incorporated into every pre-ribosome, prior to the irreversible nuclear export step. Here, a genetic screen unveiled an essential energy-dependent mechanism that delivers neighboring r-proteins eS26 and uS11 to the 90S. We show that the ATPase Fap7 promotes tertiary interactions between eS26 and uS11 and then concurrently assembles the eS26:uS11 subcomplex into the pre-ribosome. In this way, prefabrication of an r-protein subcomplex guarantees that stoichiometric levels of uS11 and eS26 are integrated into the 90S."

Fap7-depletion compromises uS11 stability in vivo, and precludes eS26 recruitment to the 90S. Similarly, Tsr2-depletion compromises eS26 stability in vivo and precludes uS11 recruitment to the 90S. 40S pre-ribosomes assembled in Fap7- and Tsr2-depleted cells that lack both uS11 and eS26 efficiently escape nuclear proofreading, and are transported to the cytoplasm. These incompletely assembled subunits engage with mature 60S subunits to form 80S-like particles, but fail to undergo final 20S pre-rRNA processing and accumulate in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Strunk et al., 2012</a>).

Further, co-overexpression of FAP7 and uS11 bypasses the functional requirement of Tsr2 to safely transfer the r-protein to the 90S in vivo. These two findings provided critical clues to unveil the mechanistic interdependency of eS26 and uS11 incorporation into the 90S. uS11, only when bound to Fap7, recruits eS26 suggesting that Fap7 renders uS11 competent to load eS26. This interaction requires conserved tertiary contacts between uS11 and eS26 found on the mature 40S subunit and is critical for bypassing Tsr2-requirement. The mechanism of Fap7-mediated pre-organization of an uS11:eS26 r-protein subcomplex for ribosome assembly is essential and distinct from the non-essential symportin Syo1. Syo1 does not promote tertiary contacts between r-proteins uL5 and uL11. Instead, it directly binds to both the r-proteins at two distinct sites and then mediates their co-import into the nucleus for 5S rRNP assembly (<a href=\"#bib7\">Calvi\u00f1o et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kressler et al., 2012</a>)."

How eS26 dissociates from Tsr2 remains unclear. While Fap7 ATPase activity is not required to form a Fap7:uS11:eS26 complex, ATP hydrolysis is critical to load uS11:eS26 onto H23 rRNA. We therefore suggest that Fap7 scaffolds the uS11:eS26 complex formation and its ATPase activity regulates integration of this r-protein subcomplex into the 90S. Our findings are consistent with in vitro studies that showed that Fap7 could efficiently load uS11 onto H23 rRNA in an ATP-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib36\">Loc'h et al., 2014</a>). However, in that study, the cellular compartment in which uS11 loading onto the pre-ribosome occurs was not investigated. Our data support a model in which Fap7 loads the pre-formed uS11:eS26 complex during early nucleolar assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome. The essential nature and enzymatic activity requirement for its function distinguishes Fap7 from another dedicated chaperones such as Acl4. The Acl4 chaperone system captures the r-protein uL4 in the cytoplasm for Kap104-mediated import. Subsequently, the interaction of the eukaryotic-specific uL4 extension with the pre-ribosomal surface is thought to trigger energy-independent disassembly of the Acl4:RpL4 complex and allow for incorporation of uL4 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pillet et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Stelter et al., 2015</a>)."

Our data demonstrate that the Fap7:uS11 complex and RanGTP are components of this alternative mechanism that sustains viability of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<i>TSR2</i> mutant. In vitro, Fap7:uS11 interacts with the importin:eS26 complex and renders the importin:eS26 complex sensitive to RanGTP-dependent disassembly. This pathway involves tertiary contacts between uS11 and eS26, since mutations that disturb interactions between Fap7:uS11 and eS26 are unable to release eS26 from its importin and to compensate Tsr2-requirement in vivo. How Fap7:uS11 recruitment renders the importin:eS26 complex sensitive to RanGTP is unclear. It is tempting to speculate that an element within eS26 may be responsible to prevent its premature RanGTP-dependent release from its importin. Recruitment of Fap7:uS11 might relieve this negative regulation and permit RanGTP-dependent release. In general, such a mechanism could couple cargo release from importins with its transfer to an interaction partner and/or final functional destination in the nucleus."

The major pool seems to perform the essential duty of organizing a Fap7:uS11:eS26 subcomplex and incorporating it into the 90S. Only a small pool of the Fap7:uS11 complex is available for its adjunct role in RanGTP-dependent unloading of eS26 directly from the importin and is therefore limiting in Tsr2-depleted cells. Overexpression of Fap7 and uS11 would increase free Fap7:uS11 complex levels to perform the adjunct duty of extracting eS26 from its importin and compensating the absence of Tsr2. We propose two mechanisms that operate to extract eS26 from the import machinery. The major RanGTP insensitive mechanism involves Tsr2 that extracts eS26 from the importin:eS26 complex, and forms a stable Tsr2:eS26 complex. Subsequently, eS26 is released from Tsr2, and then recruited to the preformed Fap7:uS11 complex. The alternative mechanism employs the preformed Fap7:uS11 complex for eS26 extraction from its importin. In this case, the Fap7:uS11 interacts with eS26 when bound to its importin, and renders eS26 release RanGTP-sensitive. Importantly, both mechanisms converge to form a Fap7:uS11:eS26 complex for incorporation into the 90S."

It is apparent that mechanisms must exist that rapidly and, at the same time, correctly incorporate different r-proteins into their cognate rRNA binding sites, and thereby prevent production of a non-functional ribosome. A striking structural feature of eukaryotic r-proteins is that they cluster on the surface of the ribosome (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) through a network of\u00a0~140 tertiary contacts (<a href=\"#bib53\">Poirot and Timsit, 2016</a>). The function(s) of these intricate conserved inter-connections, how and when they are established has remained unclear. Prefabricating r-protein subcomplexes through these tertiary contacts prior to their assembly provides one mechanism to reduce the molecularity of the incorporation process and ensure stoichiometric levels of r-proteins reach their rRNA binding sites. Thus, Fap7 may represent a family of factors that pre-organize native-like r-protein subcomplexes and minimize production errors during eukaryotic ribosome formation."

They began by isolating Fap7 and uS11 as overexpression suppressors of the lethality and assembly defect of eS26 conferred by depletion of Tsr1, the escortin that unloads eS26 from its import receptor in the nucleus by a Ran-GTP-independent mechanism. They showed that efficient suppression occurs only when Fap7 and uS11 are co-overexpressed, and obtained evidence that Fap7 and uS11 function in concert with eS26 and Tsr1 in proper assembly of uS11 and eS26 into ribosomes. They reconstituted in vitro a GST-Fap7:uS11:eS26 complex and showed that it requires amino acid contacts between uS11 and eS26 found in the mature ribosome, as well as the ATPase activity of Fap7, and then demonstrated that this complex could be loaded onto rRNA helix 23, again dependent on ATPase activity, thus providing strong evidence that Fap7 orchestrates formation of an uS11:eS26 complex, and that its ATPase activity facilitates loading of this prefabricated r-protein subcomplex onto h23 rRNA during ribosome biogenesis. (How eS26 dissociates from Tsr2 to enable this process remains unclear, as this does not appear to be an activity of the uS11:eS26 complex.) Other results demonstrate that the Fap7:uS11 complex and RanGTP are components of an alternative mechanism that can operate in cells lacking Tsr1 to unload eS26 from the nuclear import machinery. They showed that Fap7:uS11 binding renders the importin:eS26 complex sensitive to RanGTP, which it ordinarily is not, again dependent on native uS11:eS26 contacts. They propose that in wild-type cells, the Fap7:uS11 complex performs the essential duty of organizing a Fap7:uS11:eS26 subcomplex and incorporating it into the 90S, but when overexpressed can also perform an adjunct role in RanGTP-dependent unloading of eS26 from the importin thereby compensating for Tsr2-depletion."

Here it is shown that Fap7 and S11 are imported into the nucleus separately or as a complex, released from import factors using RAN, then bind to S26 and deliver it to pre-ribosomes using ATP hydrolysis by Fap7. Most of the time, S26 is released from import factors by Tsr2. When this occurs, it is not clear how Tsr2 dissociates from S26 before S26 can bind to Fap7-S11, but this step appears to be RAN independent. When Tsr2 is not used to dissociate S26 from import factors, the Fap7-S11 complex can release S26 from import factors in a RAN-dependent fashion. The interesting point is that assembly of S11 and S26 is interdependent, brought together with Fap7, presumably in the nucleus, before they are inserted into pre-ribosomes using ATP hydrolysis by Fap7."

In that work, the authors described a RanGTP-independent pathway requiring Tsr2 but also argued that there was a second pathway of unloading. Here, the authors show that a complex of Fap7-uS11 can act in a RanGTP-dependent fashion to release eS26.

Does eS26 accumulate in a complex with its importin in Tsr2 depleted cells and is this relived by overexpression of Fap7 and uS11? This should be tested in vivo by co-IP.

The importance of native-like contacts between uS11:eS26, and the importance of Fap7 ATPase activity to load H23 rRNA were validated by genetic, cell-biological and in vivo biochemical studies."

For e.g. Sxm1, Kap120, Mtr10 and Nmd5 hardly interact with Fap7 as well as the Fap7:uS11 complex. In contrast, Msn5 efficiently binds to Fap7, but rather weakly with the Fap7:uS11 complex.
