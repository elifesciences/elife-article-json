The Vanderbilt team recorded activity from the human spinal cord using a technique called fMRI (short for functional magnetic resonance imaging). fMRI can measure neuronal activity indirectly by detecting changes in blood flow: when an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region increases (<a href=\"#bib9\">Logothetis, 2008</a>).

The spinal cord contains two ventral horns (one outlined in red) that are involved in motor function, and two dorsal horns (one outlined in green) that are involved in sensory function. (<b>B</b>) Barry et al. measured the correlation between spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI signal in the ventral horns (red traces; top) and the dorsal horns (green traces; bottom). This revealed that the ventral horns show a positive correlation with each other, as do the dorsal horns. However, there is no significant correlation between ventral and dorsal horns. This suggests that at rest, the spinal cord is intrinsically organised into two separate networks, corresponding to motor and sensory functions. (<b>C</b>) Possible mechanisms that could explain the spontaneous activity in the spinal cord include input from the peripheral nervous system (top), locally generated rhythms from the interneurons within spinal networks (middle), and ongoing communication between the brain and spinal cord (bottom)."

Barry et al. acquired fMRI data from the spinal cords of a group of healthy volunteers, who were simply resting inside the MRI scanner. Next, they extracted the fMRI signal over time from both ventral horns and both dorsal horns, and investigated the correlation between the activity in each of these four regions over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

This is obviously in good agreement with the functional organisation of the spinal cord. It also, to some degree, reflects the patterns of spontaneous fluctuations in the brain, where distinct resting-state networks (e.g., visual, auditory, etc) are observed (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fox and Raichle, 2007</a>)."

However, a variety of other mechanisms that are not related to neuronal activity are known to contribute to resting-state fMRI signals, including breathing-related changes and pulsations that are caused by each heartbeat (<a href=\"#bib2\">Birn, 2012</a>). Barry et al. used several different techniques to address these issues, which strengthens the idea that their results do indeed reflect the activity of the spinal cord at rest."

There are several possible answers to this question, which are not mutually exclusive (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). First, these fluctuations could be driven by ongoing input from the peripheral nervous system relaying information to the central nervous system, for example, about the relative position of body parts. Second, they could reflect signals that are generated locally within the spinal cord, including those created by the central pattern generators that control activities such as walking (<a href=\"#bib8\">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</a>). Third, the fluctuations could reflect ongoing sensory and motor signals travelling up and down between the brain and spinal cord. Most likely, a mixture of these (and possibly other) mechanisms is involved, and it will require carefully designed experiments to disentangle these mechanisms."

Many neurological disorders involve the spinal cord and the most obvious example is spinal cord injury. In these instances, the method developed by the Vanderbilt team could complement approaches that are focussed on structural changes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Freund et al., 2013</a>). Yet, for this to happen we first need to answer several other questions: what is the organisation of connectivity across the different segments of the spine? Are the reported networks stable over time or do they change? Also, how do the different networks (sensory and motor) interact with each other? Finally, it would be interesting to record such resting-state signals from the brain and spinal cord at the same time (<a href=\"#bib5\">Finsterbusch et al., 2013</a>) in order to obtain an integrative picture of the function of the central nervous system."
