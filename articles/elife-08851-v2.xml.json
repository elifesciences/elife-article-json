The mechanisms of the dramatic reprogramming events that occur have remained unknown, and presumed roles of histone modifying enzymes are just starting to be elucidated. Here, we explore the function of the oocyte-inherited pool of a histone H3K4 and K9 demethylase, LSD1/KDM1A during early mouse development. KDM1A deficiency results in developmental arrest by the two-cell stage, accompanied by dramatic and stepwise alterations in H3K9 and H3K4 methylation patterns. At the transcriptional level, the switch of the maternal-to-zygotic transition fails to be induced properly and LINE-1 retrotransposons are not properly silenced. We propose that KDM1A plays critical roles in establishing the correct epigenetic landscape of the zygote upon fertilization, in preserving genome integrity and in initiating new patterns of genome expression that drive early mouse development."

The mechanisms of the dramatic reprogramming events that occur have remained unknown, and presumed roles of histone modifying enzymes are just starting to be elucidated. Here, we explore the function of the oocyte-inherited pool of a histone H3K4 and K9 demethylase, LSD1/KDM1A during early mouse development. KDM1A deficiency results in developmental arrest by the two-cell stage, accompanied by dramatic and stepwise alterations in H3K9 and H3K4 methylation patterns. At the transcriptional level, the switch of the maternal-to-zygotic transition fails to be induced properly and LINE-1 retrotransposons are not properly silenced. We propose that KDM1A plays critical roles in establishing the correct epigenetic landscape of the zygote upon fertilization, in preserving genome integrity and in initiating new patterns of genome expression that drive early mouse development."

In particular, the paternal genome arrives densely packed with protamines rather than histones, and the maternal epigenome is highly specialised. Maternal factors must unravel these specialised chromatin states to enable zygotic gene activation and development to proceed. Histone tail post-translational modifications (PTMs), and more specifically lysine methylation, appear to be dynamically regulated during this first step of development (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2010</a>). Histone lysine methylation appears to have different biological read-outs, depending on the modified residue as well as the state of methylation (mono-, di- or tri-). For example, methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (referred to as H3K4 methylation hereafter) is mainly associated with transcriptionally active chromatin while methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (referred to as H3K9 methylation hereafter) is usually linked to repressive chromatin. The incorrect setting of some of these histone marks in cloned animals have been correlated with their poor development potential, pointing to their importance during early stages of development (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matoba et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Santos et al., 2003</a>). However, the actors underlying these dynamic changes in histone modifications after fertilization and their impact on the appropriate regulation of zygotic genome function remain open questions."

Importantly, KMTs and KDMs show different specificities for their target lysine substrates, as well as for the number of methyl group they can add or remove (from unmethylated -me0-, to dimethylated \u2013me2, and trimethylated -me3; and vice versa)."

This has been linked to their important roles in cell fate maintenance and differentiation, as well as in genome stability (<a href=\"#bib6\">Black et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Greer and Shi, 2012</a>). However, investigating their potential roles during the first steps of development, after fertilization is frequently hampered by their maternal mRNA and/or protein pool, which can persist during early embryogenesis and mask the potential impact that the absence of such factors might have (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2010</a>). In mice, conditional knock-outs in the female germline that suppress the maternal store of mRNA and protein at the time of fertilization, can be used to examine protein function during the earliest steps of development (<a href=\"#bib13\">de Vries et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lewandoski et al., 1997</a>). In this way, the roles of KMTs and KDMs during early embryogenesis are just starting to be explored. For example, it has been shown that depletion of maternal EZH2 affects the levels of H3K27 methylation in zygotes, although this did not lead to any growth defects during embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib16\">Erhardt et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Puschendorf et al., 2008</a>). Another study investigated maternal loss of <i>Mll2</i> (Mixed lineage leukemia 2), encoding one of the main KMTs targeting H3K4 and revealed its essential role during oocyte maturation and for the embryos to develop beyond the two-cell stage, through gene expression regulation, (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andreu-Vieyra et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, in the presence of maternal EZH2 or MLL2 protein (when wt/- breeders are used), both <i>Ezh2</i> and <i>Mll2</i> null embryos die much later <i>in utero</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">O'Carroll et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Glaser et al., 2006</a>). The roles of these regulators of lysine methylation can thus be highly stage-specific, with very different effects at the zygote, early cleavage or later developmental stages."

KDM1A was later shown to demethylate H3K9me2 and to activate transcription (<a href=\"#bib29\">Laurent et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Metzger et al., 2005</a>). Genetic deletion of murine <i>Kdm1a</i> during embryogenesis obtained by mating of heterozygous animals showed early lethality prior to gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Foster et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Macfarlan et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">2009</a>). In light of the above considerations, we set out to study the impact of eliminating or inhibiting the maternal pool of KDM1A during preimplantation development. We report for the first time the crucial role of <i>Kdm1a</i> following fertilization. The absence of KDM1A protein in zygotes derived from <i>Kdm1a</i> null oocytes led to a developmental arrest at the two-cell stage, with a severe and stepwise accumulation of H3K9me3 from the zygote stage, and of H3K4me1/2/3 at the two-cell stage. These chromatin alterations coincide with increased perturbations in the gene expression repertoire, based on single embryo transcriptomes, leading to an incomplete switch from the maternal to zygotic developmental programs. Furthermore, absence of KDM1A resulted in deficient suppression of LINE-1 retrotransposon expression, and increased genome damage, possibly as a result of increased LINE-1 activity. Altogether, our results point to an essential role for maternally-inherited KDM1A in maintaining appropriate temporal and spatial patterns of histone methylation while preserving genome expression and integrity to ensure embryonic development beyond the two-cell stage."

To assess a requirement for KDM1A enzymatic activity in early embryos, we tested the impact of KDM1A catalytic inhibition specifically after fertilization. To this end, we treated wild-type zygotes with pargyline, a well-characterized potent chemical inhibitor of KDM1A enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fierz and Muir, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Metzger et al., 2005</a>) and followed their development <i>in vitro</i> over 48\u2009hr. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, 76% embryos cultured with pargyline were found to be significantly blocked at the two-cell stage and 17% never progressed beyond the 3/4-cell stage. On the contrary, the majority (94%) of mock treated embryos developed to the eight-cell stage within 48\u00a0hr, as expected. These data parallel the phenotype of genetic ablation of the KDM1A maternal pool, where 96% of \u25b3m/wt embryos are developmentally arrested at the two-cell stage and 4% at the 3/4-cell stage. Taken together, the genetic depletion and pargyline inhibition data strongly support a requirement for KDM1A enzymatic activity during the zygote and two-cell stage, for embryos to proceed beyond the two-cell stage."

Transition from the maternal pool to zygotic products is essential for successful developmental progression (<a href=\"#bib19\">Flach et al., 1982</a>).

Furthermore, the analysis of oocyte transcriptomes also revealed that there were fewer genes misregulated in <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant oocytes, than in <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Moreover, Principal Component Analysis demonstrated that the gene expression patterns showed greater differences between controls and mutants at the two-cell stage, than in oocytes, and that the two different stages cluster away from each other (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The stage comparison also showed that only a subset of genes were misregulated in common, in both oocytes and two-cell stage embryos, upon loss of maternal KDM1A (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). GO analysis of up or down regulated genes at the two-cell stage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) or oocytes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) revealed very little overlap in the specific biological functions affected by loss of function of KDM1A before and after fertilization, with the notable exception of cell cycle associated genes. This connects well with the observed phenotype for poor oocyte competence at fertilization and the total developmental arrest at the two-cell stage. These results reveal that absence of maternal KDM1A most likely leads to transcriptome changes during oocyte maturation, but to even more serious defects after zygotic gene activation, at the two-cell stage. The latter may be due in part to an aberrant maternal supply of transcripts/proteins, or else to aberrant transcriptional regulation of the zygotic genome in absence of maternal KDM1A."

DBTMEE was built from an ultra-large-scale whole transcriptome profile analysis of preimplantation embryos, in which genes are classified depending on which transcription waves (as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) they are expressed. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> (see also Table\u00a01), we assessed the percentage of genes of each of our classes (up; down and not significantly changed) that overlapped with the different DBTMEE categories of transcription switches, from oocyte to two-cell stage. Strikingly, the upregulated genes in \u25b3m/wt embryos fall essentially into the earliest stages and belong to genes annotated as maternal (37% of this category), as minor ZGA genes (39%) and as zygotic-transient (38%). We checked whether the misregulation of these three categories of genes might originate from the oocyte stage changes. We found that only 56 out of 360 of maternal genes, 94 out of 540 of minor ZGA genes and 6 out of 34 of 1C transient (Table\u00a01 and data not shown) were already upregulated in mutant oocytes. These results reinforce the conclusion that the maternal and zygotic pools of transcripts become more compromised as development proceeds toward the two-cell stage in mutant embryos, rather than being aberrant right from the <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant germline. In clear contrast, the majority of downregulated genes in the \u25b3m/wt were found to belong to the three categories of genes that are normally activated at the two-cell stage, with 50% in the major ZGA class, 37% in the two-cell transient and 50% in the MGA (Mid zygotic gene activation). This suggests that absence of KDM1A compromises the activation of gene expression by the two-cell stage."

                                "text": "Many transposable elements are known to be expressed in early mouse embryos, as early as zygotic stage, and some of these repeat elements might even be competent for new events of retrotransposition between fertilization and implantation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fadloun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kano et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Peaston et al., 2004</a>). The repression of some of these transposable elements during preimplantation has been correlated with loss of active chromatin marks such as H3K4me3, rather than acquisition of heterochromatic marks such as H3K9me3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fadloun et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, a previous study using <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant mESCs and late preimplantation embryos found a significant impact on MERVL:LTR repeat expression (for Murine endogenous retrovirus-like LTR), as well as a good correlation for the presence of remnant ERVs within 2kb of the transcription start site of KDM1A-repressed genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Macfarlan et al., 2011</a>). The increased levels of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 that we found in \u25b3m/wt two-cell stage embryos and the reported role of KDM1A in late preimplantation embryos prompted us to analyze the effects of maternal KDM1A depletion on repetitive element expression after fertilization. To this end, we investigated our RNA-seq data from control and <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant two-cell embryos for the relative expression of repetitive elements. As our single embryo RNA seq approach was based on oligo-dT priming this restricted our analysis to reads at the 3\u2019 ends of transcripts, which somewhat limited our capacity to detect repeat variation. In particular we could not determine which specific LINE-1 families were expressed in the mutants, nor whether the LINE-1 reads we detected corresponded to full-length,and/or intact elements. Nevertheless, our results shows that by far the most abundant categories of expressed repeats at this stage of development were LTRs (long terminal repeat) and non-LTR retrotransposons in f/wt and \u25b3m/wt (95% and 92%, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, no significant impact on expression could be detected in the mutants, with the exception within the non-LTR elements, of quite a significant overrepresentation of LINEs, but not SINEs (for Long/Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements element) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). We validated this result by RT-qPCR using individually prepared cDNAs of two-cell stage embryos for three transposable element classes. LINE-1, SINE B1 and MuERV-L transcripts are all abundantly expressed in control and mutant embryos, but LINE-1 levels show a two-fold increase in the \u25b3m/wt embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). No significant up-regulation was seen in ERV-promoter driven genes, that had previously reported to be affected by loss of KDM1A in ESCs (<a href=\"#bib37\">Macfarlan et al., 2011</a>)."

These results suggest that the LINE-1 deregulation observed at the RNA level might indeed lead to the production and nuclear import of increased levels of LINE-1 ORF1 proteins. We next investigated whether expression of such proteins from transposable elements would have any consequences. We thus performed \u03b3H2AX IF staining to assess whether increased DNA damage signalling could be seen in \u25b3m/wt compared to f/wt embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We performed EdU pulse treatment (a nucleoside analog of thymidine incorporated into DNA) in two-cell embryos, at a stage when they have normally completed S phase (40\u201341\u00a0hr post hCG injection). This revealed that S phase is delayed in the \u25b3m/wt embryos given the incorporation of EdU in the mutants, while none of the control embryos used in parallel were stained (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All the mutant embryos delayed in their replication displayed concomitantly intense \u03b3H2AX signals. However, 38% of the mutant embryos did not show any EdU incorporation, indicating that they exit S phase, yet, they still show high levels of \u03b3H2AX signals. Finally, although, no significant enrichment was directly found for DNA damage pathways when running our GO analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), many genes related to DNA damage repair were upregulated (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Taken all together, these results suggest that the elevated DNA damage signalling observed could be independent from replication defaults in KDM1A maternally depleted embryos, but might be related either to changes in transcript levels for DNA damage genes or else to the observed increase in LINE-1 activity in <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant embryos at this stage."

Although the dynamics of histone modifications have been assessed, the biological relevance of such changes and the identification of the histone modifying enzymes involved in this process are only starting to be identified. In this study, we have focused on the critical function of KDM1A, a histone demethylase for H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/me2, that we find acts as a maternal chromatin factor at the time egg fertilization. We show that maternal KO results in abnormal oocytes at the time of ovulation (at meiosis II stage) and prevents development of fertilized eggs beyond the two-cell stage. Similar oocyte defects and developmental block were also observed in the accompanying paper by Wasson et al, where two other independent conditional alleles were used to induce deletion of KDM1A in oocytes, using Zp3-Cre or Gdf9 Cre. In a recent study maternal depletion of KDM1A was found to affect the first division of meiosis and leads to early apoptosis during oocyte growth (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). Taken together, these studies show that KDM1A is required during the formation of the female gametes for the two steps of meiosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0this study; Wasson et al. ). Our study also reveals that KDM1A is required as a key factor during early post-zygotic embryo development, as the enzymatic inhibition of KDM1A in wild-type embryos resulted in developmental arrest at the two-cell stage, comparable to maternal deletion. We further show that KDM1A is a major regulator of histone H3K4 and H3K9 methylation patterns at the one-two cell stages and that it controls early switches in transcription patterns during development. KDM1A may also have a potential role in the appropriate repression of some LINE-1 retroviral elements."

                                "text": "One of the most striking consequences of lack of maternal KDM1A that we observed was the disruption of the wave-like gene expression patterns previously described at the onset of mouse development (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hamatani et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xue et al., 2013</a>). At the two-cell stage, we saw a significant increase in mRNA levels of genes normally expressed maternally or at the zygote stage, and this increase relates more to post-fertilization disruption rather than inherited defects from <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant germline. The accompanying manuscript by Wasson et al reports similar findings concerning transcriptional regulation by maternal KDM1A in early stage post fertilization. Maternal and zygotic mRNA excess could reflect a reduced rate of mRNA degradation, maybe related to the developmental arrest, or else the severe impairment of the mutant embryos in the ribosome biogenesis pathways could preclude the translation machinery of their usage and clearance or else a change in the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of the maternal pool of mRNA could also be disturbing their utilization. Lastly, their abundance could also be due, maybe partly, to an increased transcription rate for these genes (and more specifically the one corresponding to the minor ZGA). Given the accumulation of H3K4 methylation that we show in our study for the mutants at this stage and the proven link of this mark with enhanced transcription (<a href=\"#bib6\">Black et al., 2012</a>), we hypothesise that KDM1A might normally be involved in the transcriptional down-regulation of these genes via H3K4 demethylation. Chromatin-based repression is thought to be superimposed on zygotic genome activation and is necessary for the transition from the two-cell to the four-cell stage (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ma, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ma and Schultz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nothias et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wiekowski et al., 1997</a>). We propose that KDM1A might be part of such a mechanism, and required for a transition towards two-cell stage specific gene expression patterns (ie in the major ZGA and MGA waves), and therefore for proper development beyond the two-cell stage. The significant absence of the major ZGA and MGA waves in the transcriptome of <i>Kdm1a</i> mutants supports this hypothesis. Whether misplaced or increased H3K9 methylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) could be involved in failure of transcription activation is not known, but one can speculate that such repressive chromatin and/or absence of KDM1A itself might impair correct recruitment of transcription regulators. So far, a small subset of such factors (TFs and co-regulators) acting at ZGA-gene promoters has recently been suggested to orchestrate the appropriate gene expression patterns following fertilization (<a href=\"#bib45\">Park et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xue et al., 2013</a>). Although, KDM1A was not reported in this study, our results suggest that maternal KDM1A is nonetheless crucial for shaping the transcriptome in early life. Its role in oocyte and embryogenesis may have long lasting effects, as reported in the accompanying paper by Wasson et al where a hypomorphic maternal KDM1A, associated with perinatal lethality, showed alterations in imprinted gene expression much later in life. The importance of the maternal pool of KDM1A opens up exciting prospects for the roles of this remarkable histone demethylase in early development."

Previous work has suggested that KDM1A may contribute to MERVL element repression in late pre-implantation embryos (<a href=\"#bib37\">Macfarlan et al., 2011</a>). We did not detect any impact on these elements in the <i>Kdm1a</i> mutants immediately post fertilization. However, we did see a small but significant increase in LINE-1 expression and LINE-1 ORF1 protein levels in the <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant embryos. This observation, together with the striking elevation in H3K4me3 levels, is of particular interest in the context of a recent study which proposed that loss of H3K4m3 at LINE-1 elements (rather than a gain in H3K9 methylation) might be critical for their repression during early pre-implantation development (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fadloun et al., 2013</a>). Whether this increase in LINE-1 expression actually leads to an increase in LINE-1 element retrotransposition (ie new insertions) remains to be seen, but the increase in LINE-1 proteins observed in <i>Kdm1a</i> mutant embryos is potentially consistent with such a possibility. In this context, we speculate that misregulation of LINE-1 elements in the absence of KDM1A might participate in the early developmental arrest that is observed, via an increased potential of genome instability and activation of some specific DNA damage checkpoints. The increase in \u03b3H2AX foci we detected in <i>Kdm1a</i> mutants, independently from replication stalling problems, could also be consistent with this hypothesis. Our results thus support the hypothesis that histone-based defence mechanisms act to safeguard the genome from LINE-1 retrotransposition during preimplantation development, when global DNA hypomethylation might compromises their usual silencing route (<a href=\"#bib31\">Leung &amp; Lorincz, 2012</a>)."

Nick translation (Vysis\u00a0Abbott,\u00a0Chicago, IL) using Spectrum green or Spectrum red (Vysis) was used to label double stranded probes. The LINE-1 probe used consisted of a full- length Tf element cloned into a Bluescript plasmid as previously described (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chow et al., 2010</a>). The <i>Atrx</i> probe consisted of a BAC (CHORI,\u00a0Oakland, CA; reference RP23-260I15). Briefly, embryos were taken at 42\u00a0hr post hCG and the <i>zona pellucida</i> was removed. Embryos were transferred onto coverslips previously coated in Denhardt\u2019s solution, dried down for 30\u00a0min at room temperature, after all excess liquid was removed. Samples were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2) for 10\u2009min at RT and permeabilized in ice-cold PBS 0.5% triton for 1\u2009min on ice and then directly stored in ETOH 70\u00b0C ethanol at -20\u00b0C until processed for RNA FISH. Hybridizations, without <i>Cot1</i> competition\u00a0for\u00a0LINE-1, were performed overnight at 37\u00b0C in a humid chamber. Excess of probes was eliminated through three washes in 2xSSC at 42\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min each. Slides were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI."

The DESeq R package v1.16.0 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>) was then used to normalize and identify the differentially expressed genes between control and mutant embryos. Genes with 0 counts in all samples were filtered out and only the 60% of the top expressed genes were used for the analysis, as described in the DESeq reference manual. Genes with an adjusted p-value lower than \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05 were consider as differentially expressed. Hierarchical clustering analysis for gene expression pattern of 16 libraries was based on Spearman correlation distance and the Ward method, and performed using the hclust function implemented in the gplots v2.16.0 R package."

Aligned reads were then annotated and intersected with repeats annotation from the repeatMasker database. The transposon counts table was generated using the reads that fully overlap with an annotated repeat and for which all possible alignments are concordant, i.e associated with the same repeat family in more than 95% of cases. The resulting count table was normalized by the total number of reads aligned on repeats. Statistical analysis to identify repeat families with significant changes in expression between control and mutant embryos was performed using the limma R package v3.20.4 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ritchie et al., 2015</a>).

It provides evidence that genetically depriving oocytes of LSD1 leads to embryonic arrest by the two-cell stage. Importantly, the authors show that they can phenocopy the effect by culturing embryos in the presence of an LSD1 inhibitor, demonstrating that the effect depends upon lack of catalytic activity of LSD1 in the embryo itself, rather than a compromise in the oocyte. Furthermore, they show altered levels of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation in zygotes and/or 2-cell embryos and, by RNA-seq, that there is a failure properly to activate a substantial proportion of genes that are induced at zygotic genome activation. In addition, they show up-regulation specifically of LINE1 repeats and, importantly, demonstrate this to be at the transcriptional level by RNA-FISH of nascent transcripts. Overall, this is an important finding that reveals that <i>Lsd1</i> is a maternal effect gene, and that correct regulation of H3K4 and/or H3K9 methylation is essential for correct expression of embryonic genes."

And this gap is understandable, given the limitations of ChIP-seq on low numbers of cells, compounded by the reduced number of zygotes and 2-cell embryos from <i>Lsd/Zp3-Cre</i> deficient females. Specifically regarding the observed elevated LINE1 expression, the proposed link with H3K4 demethylation seems plausible (as in Fadloun et al. 2013) and potentially easier to test. Given recent advances in ChIP methods for low numbers of cells and highly abundant features such as LINEs as the target of assessment (Fadloun et al. 2013, Brind'Amour et al. 2015), a ChIP-qPCR assay at LINE1s could be done."

Only a subset of Line1 elements are active and able to retrotranspose in the genome, and different mechanisms for H3K9me3 deposition appear to be action different Line1 families. It would be informative for Ancelin et al. to extract information about which families of Line1 element are activated in <i>Lsd1</i> \u0394m/wt from their RNA sequencing data or through RT-qPCR. Increased Line1 jumping in the genome would require active Line1 families (A, Tf, Gf) to be upregulated."

The gH2AX image shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> shows a lot of DNA damage in the <i>Lsd1</i> \u0394m/wt embryos. There would need to be a lot of active jumping of Line1 to generate this amount of DNA damage, yet Line1 transcript levels are only elevated around 2-fold. It's possible that the elevated DNA damage in <i>Lsd1</i> \u0394m/wt could be caused by some of the thousands of gene transcripts that are mis-regulated in these embryos rather than Line1. The authors could make this clearer. In particular, gH2AX signals normally arise during DNA replication. Maternal depletion of polycomb proteins causes defects in zygotic gene activation and impaired DNA replication in 2 cell embryos, and a similar increase in embryos with strong gH2AX staining as is reported by Ancelin et al. (see Supplementary <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> in Posfai et al., 2012, Genes Dev Vol 26 p920-932). In the 2 cell embryos that Ancelin et al. show in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, does the difference in gH2AX staining between the <i>Lsd1</i> \u0394m/wt and control embryos primarily reflect the mutant embryos arresting or delaying progression through the mid 2 cell stage/DNA replication rather than Line1-induced DNA damage?"

One would expect that the authors invest some time in trying to provide mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon and not just say that it \"merits further exploration\". It would be of interest to see what is happening during meiosis I and this should be included in the revised manuscript. In addition, the only significant molecular information is the transcriptome comparison between the maternally deleted and wt 2-cell stage embryos i.e. period of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). However, the ZGA is entirely regulated by the maternally inherited molecules; proteins and RNAs. Proteome comparison would be technically quite difficult but transcriptome comparison between maternally deleted and wt oocyte is possible, necessary and should be included and interpreted in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is one of the most important mechanisms controlling the utilization of many maternal mRNAs and it would be very important to determine how it functions during maturation of mutant oocytes and after fertilization in zygotes."

It would have been much better if superovulation was not used in all experiments, however it would not be fair to ask the authors to repeat everything. Nevertheless, they could and should determine if the effect on zygote to 2-cell stage transition in \u0394m/wt is ameliorated when using normal matings without superovulation."

Quantifying IF intensity is an inexact science. Although I think the conclusions are probably valid, the quantification is based on comparing IF intensity between embryos and there does not seem to be any obvious internal control. Granted, the embryos are processed in parallel and equivalent image settings are used, etc., but ideally fluorescence intensity of the modification of interest would be compared to an internal reference. For example, the authors report that levels of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 do not differ between controls and mutant (as expected), so one or other of these modifications could be used as an internal control in dual staining for greater confidence of the changes seen (or total H3)."

In WT embryos, S-phase is normally complete by this time at the two-cell stage. The replication assay was coupled with parallel detection of DNA damage by \u03b3H2AX immunostaining, to address the reviewers\u2019 suggestion that replication delay / stalling in <i>Lsd1</i> mutants might be an alternative explanation for the DNA damage observed. These new results reveal that DNA replication is indeed delayed, as replication foci are detected in a high proportion of mutant two cell stage embryos (62% blastomeres show EdU foci) compared to WT (no foci detectable). Furthermore, high levels of \u03b3H2AX foci are also observed in the mutant embryos showing EdU foci. However, we noted that in the 38% of mutant blastomeres that are not in S phase (ie Edu negative), \u03b3H2AX foci are still strongly present (compared to WT), although there may be slightly fewer foci than for the embryos in S phase. Importantly, control embryos processed in parallel are systematically negative or only faintly positive for \u03b3H2AX foci.

The fact that mutant embryos not undergoing DNA replication nevertheless showed strong \u03b3H2AX foci, supports a possible correlation between DNA damage and LINE-1 overexpression.

Finally, the number of identically misregulated genes (up or down) between oocytes and two-cell stage embryos (panel C) is far lower than the number of misregulated genes that are specific to each stage.

Quantifying IF intensity is an inexact science. Although I think the conclusions are probably valid, the quantification is based on comparing IF intensity between embryos and there does not seem to be any obvious internal control. Granted, the embryos are processed in parallel and equivalent image settings are used, etc., but ideally fluorescence intensity of the modification of interest would be compared to an internal reference. For example, the authors report that levels of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 do not differ between controls and mutant (as expected), so one or other of these modifications could be used as an internal control in dual staining for greater confidence of the changes seen (or total H3).</i>"

In summary, we select the nuclear area of the stack image, and then extract the integrated Intensity (intensity divided by the number of voxels represented within the nuclear area) using the 3D object counter plugin in Image J (Bolte and Cordeli\u00e8re, 2006).

The authors show by immunofluorescence that histone H3K9 methylation is altered in the mutant zygotes, and that histone H3K4 and H3K9 methylation levels are altered in 2 cell embryos. The authors perform RNA seq transcriptomic analysis on mutant oocytes and 2 cell embryos that transcription profiles are also changed with the 2 cell embryos seemingly unable to activate zygotic gene activation. The authors also show that L1 retrotransposon transcripts and protein are elevated in mutant 2 cell embryos, and that these embryos also have increased amounts of the DNA damage marker gH2AX. In response to the reviewers comments the authors have tried show which subtype of L1 retrotransposon is upregulated, and tested if the increased abundance of gH2AX represents a delay in cell cycle or S phase progression rather than L1 integrating into the genome as suggested in the original submission. The authors included in their response to reviewers\u2019 comments data showing that they could not detect upregulation of RNA for any of the three active subclasses of L1 in the LSD1 mutant embryos. The authors conclude in their response that \"Nevertheless the higher levels of L1 ORF protein that we observed in mutant embryos suggest that certain L1 elements must be up-regulated in the absence of Lsd1, but that the LINEs at the origin of this are not systematically from one family/type\". How can the authors exclude the possibility that the upregulated L1 RNA and protein represents full length but catalytically inactive L1 subfamilies such as L1_MdF? Data from ES cells shows that different L1 subfamilies are repressed epigenetic mechanisms (Castro-Diaz et al., Genes Dev. 2014 Jul 1;28(13):1397-409), so it's certainly possible that only inactive subfamilies of L1 are being upregulated in LSD1 mutant embryos.</i> "

However this has not been formally demonstrated and we fully acknowledge that the DNA damage observed in the mutant embryos may be due to other defects, including DNA replication defects. We have therefore included the following statement which we hope satisfies the reviewer \u201cIn this context, we speculate that misregulation of LINE-1 elements in the absence of KDM1A <i>might participate</i> in the early developmental arrest that is observed, via an increased potential of genome instability and activation of some specific DNA damage checkpoints\u201d."
