To better understand the cellular and molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory actions of apoA1, we explored the effect of acute human apoA1 exposure on the migratory capacity of monocyte-derived cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Acute (20-60 min) apoA1 treatment induced a substantial (50-90%) reduction in macrophage chemotaxis to a range of chemoattractants. This acute treatment was anti-inflammatory <i>in vivo</i> as shown by pre-treatment of monocytes prior to adoptive transfer into an on-going murine peritonitis model. We find that apoA1 rapidly disrupts membrane lipid rafts, and as a consequence, dampens the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway that coordinates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Our data strengthen the evidence base for therapeutic apoA1 infusions in situations where reduced monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation could have beneficial outcomes."
