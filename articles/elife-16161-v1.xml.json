Here we show a clear interaction between self-produced actions and the perceived numerosity of subsequent visual stimuli. A short period of rapid finger-tapping (without sensory feedback) caused subjects to underestimate the number of visual stimuli presented near the tapping region; and a period of slow tapping caused overestimation. The distortions occurred both for stimuli presented sequentially (series of flashes) and simultaneously (clouds of dots); both for magnitude estimation and forced-choice comparison. The adaptation was spatially selective, primarily in external, real-world coordinates. Our results sit well with studies reporting links between perception and action, showing that vision and action share mechanisms that encode numbers: a generalized <i>number sense</i>, which estimates the number of self-generated as well as external events."

Here we show a clear interaction between self-produced actions and the perceived numerosity of subsequent visual stimuli. A short period of rapid finger-tapping (without sensory feedback) caused subjects to underestimate the number of visual stimuli presented near the tapping region; and a period of slow tapping caused overestimation. The distortions occurred both for stimuli presented sequentially (series of flashes) and simultaneously (clouds of dots); both for magnitude estimation and forced-choice comparison. The adaptation was spatially selective, primarily in external, real-world coordinates. Our results sit well with studies reporting links between perception and action, showing that vision and action share mechanisms that encode numbers: a generalized <i>number sense</i>, which estimates the number of self-generated as well as external events."

Another study reported separate populations of neurons in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) responding selectively to sequential or simultaneous numerical displays, while a third set of neurons showed numerosity selectivity for both simultaneous and sequential presentations, suggesting that the information about spatial and temporal numerosity converges to a more abstract representation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nieder et al., 2006</a>). There is also evidence from functional imaging in humans for a right lateralized fronto-parietal circuit activated by both auditory and visual number sequences, and that right IPS is involved in processing both sequential and simultaneous numerosity formats (<a href=\"#bib15\">Castelli et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Piazza et al., 2006</a>)."

Developmental work also show similar accuracy in pre-schoolers for comparing spatial array of dots either with other spatial arrays, or with sequences of sounds (<a href=\"#bib9\">Barth et al., 2005</a>). Preferential-looking studies show infants prefer to look at screens displaying adults faces numerically matched with the soundtrack of adult voices (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jordan and Brannon, 2006</a>), and abstract visual ensembles (shapes) numerically matched with on-going sequence of sounds (<a href=\"#bib27\">Izard et al., 2009</a>).

The match is made at the decision level, so the interaction could be at any stage up to and including decision mechanisms. One of the more powerful psychophysical techniques to probe mechanisms is adaptation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mollon, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thompson and Burr, 2009</a>). Number, like most other primary visual attributes, is also highly susceptible to adaptation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwiedrzik et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burr and Ross, 2008</a>): visually inspecting for a few seconds a large number of items results in the perceived numerosity of a subsequent ensemble to be strongly underestimated, and vice-versa after adaptation to low numbers (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burr and Ross, 2008</a>). More recently we have shown that adaptation to numerosity also occurs with sequentially presented stimuli, and that the adaptation effects are both cross-modal and cross-format (<a href=\"#bib6\">Arrighi et al., 2014</a>): adapting to sequences of tones affects the perceived numerosity of a subsequently presented series of flashes (and <i>vice versa</i>), and adapting to sequences of flashes affects the perceived numerosity of spatial arrays of items. Importantly, the adaptation was spatially selective, in external rather than eye-centered coordinates, suggesting it has a perceptual rather than cognitive basis. fMRI studies have demonstrated BOLD activity selective for adaptation to numerosity in the human parietal sulcus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Piazza et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Castaldi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">He et al., 2015</a>)."

A few studies point to an interconnection between numerosity and motor control. For example, neurons in area 5 of the superior parietal lobule of monkey show a clear selectivity for the number of self-produced actions, and inactivation of the area impedes number-based tasks (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sawamura et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2010</a>). Other work has shown that the left ventral premotor cortex is activated by counting successive sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kansaku et al., 2007</a>), and that the human cerebellum shows strong activation for simple numerical calculations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Arsalidou and Taylor, 2011</a>)."

Most of these studies relied principally on cross-modal comparisons of number, which could occur at any processing stage, up to and including decision mechanisms. The spatial selectivity shown in our study suggests that the interaction is perceptual rather than cognitive: adapting on the left side did not affect stimuli on the right, and vice versa. Importantly, the specificity was in external coordinates, as adapting the left field with the right hand caused adaptation for visual stimuli presented to the left, not the right visual field. This complements nicely the result of our previous study (<a href=\"#bib6\">Arrighi et al., 2014</a>), where we showed that adaptation to visual sequences affects number perception of both sequential and simultaneous presentations, in a spatially selective manner. Interspersing an eye-movement between adaptation and test showed that the adaptation was spatially specific in external rather than eye-centered coordinates: as the current study shows the selectivity is external, not hand-centered. It would be interesting to look at the spatial tuning of the adaptation on a finer grain, to define the size of the adaptation field. The present study shows that the adaptation is at least broadly tuned, confined to a particular hemifield. It would be very informative to determine whether there was also selectivity within each hemifield, and on how fine a grain."

But both are signals about action, whether they are 'inflow' or 'outflow'.

This conclusion rests of the observation that the action-perception interaction is observed when the number displays are presented in the right visual field and the right hand is used for the production task, but now when the number displays are presented in the left visual field. Thus, the \"adaptation\" effects appear to be location specific. This is a surprising result given that many studies in the perceptual domain suggest that numeric representation is relatively abstract. However, the current design confounds adapted/unadapted side with right/left hand (or side of space). We would like to have additional experimental work to unconfound these factors. This work will also offer an opportunity to obtain a replication of the location specificity of the effect.

The authors need not run a full-factorial design here (fully cross hand and side of movement); a partial design would be fine as long as it unconfounds adapted/unadapted and right/left, with some subset of conditions to unconfound hand and space."

It would have been nice to have trials in which they are on opposite sides of space (which might present issues related to shifts of attention, or monitoring eye movements to ensure participants maintain fixation at the center). If this has been done in previous work, please cite this work. If not, it would be a nice additional condition, but we will not require these data in the revision."

The reviewers were surprised that this finding was noted in the Results section, but not included in the Discussion. Rather, there is discussion of number as a \"high-generalized system, capable of integrating numerical information from different senses, and across formats\". How do we reconcile this statement with the location specificity and claim of a perceptual basis for the effect? More generally, the conclusion about modality (or location) specificity seems at odds with the large literature showing that number representation is \"abstract\" and \"amodal\", work done in people (babies and adults), as well as in other primates. Much of the evidence comes from cross-modal paradigms. This issue should be addressed in the revision, with the authors working to provide an integration of the literature that has focused on number representation being modality specific (work cited in the current version) and the literature pointing to a more abstract representation. We can imagine that both views may be valid, with interactions arising at multiple levels of processing. We do want the authors to provide a better connection between these literatures. Some papers to consider that have advanced the amodal perspective."

The reviewers were surprised that this finding was noted in the Results section, but not included in the Discussion. Rather, there is discussion of number as a \"high-generalized system, capable of integrating numerical information from different senses, and across formats\". How do we reconcile this statement with the location specificity and claim of a perceptual basis for the effect? More generally, the conclusion about modality (or location) specificity seems at odds with the large literature showing that number representation is \"abstract\" and \"amodal\", work done in people (babies and adults), as well as in other primates. Much of the evidence comes from cross-modal paradigms. This issue should be addressed in the revision, with the authors working to provide an integration of the literature that has focused on number representation being modality specific (work cited in the current version) and the literature pointing to a more abstract representation. We can imagine that both views may be valid, with interactions arising at multiple levels of processing. We do want the authors to provide a better connection between these literatures. Some papers to consider that have advanced the amodal perspective.</i> "

We agree that this is an important point, thank you for pointing it out."
