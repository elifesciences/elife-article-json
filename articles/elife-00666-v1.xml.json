Apical localization and activity of Dia are at the core of restricting F-actin formation to the correct membrane domain. Here we identify the mechanisms that target Dia to the apical surface. PI(4,5)P2 levels at the apical membrane regulate Dia localization in both the MDCK cyst model and in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular epithelia. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is crucial for apical localization, implying direct binding to PI(4,5)P2. Dia apical targeting also depends on binding to Rho1, which is critical for activation-induced conformational change, as well as physically anchoring Dia to the apical membrane. We demonstrate that binding to Rho1 facilitates interaction with PI(4,5)P2 at the plane of the membrane. Together these cues ensure efficient and distinct restriction of Dia to the apical membrane."

Apical localization and activity of Dia are at the core of restricting F-actin formation to the correct membrane domain. Here we identify the mechanisms that target Dia to the apical surface. PI(4,5)P2 levels at the apical membrane regulate Dia localization in both the MDCK cyst model and in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular epithelia. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is crucial for apical localization, implying direct binding to PI(4,5)P2. Dia apical targeting also depends on binding to Rho1, which is critical for activation-induced conformational change, as well as physically anchoring Dia to the apical membrane. We demonstrate that binding to Rho1 facilitates interaction with PI(4,5)P2 at the plane of the membrane. Together these cues ensure efficient and distinct restriction of Dia to the apical membrane."

Now Rousso et al. report that a modified lipid, called PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, is involved in this localization. However, they also show that this lipid does not govern the apical localization of Diaphanous on its own: rather, an enzyme called Rho1 must also be present to assist with the localization of Diaphanous and to ensure that actin is deposited in the correct place. Rousso et al. also demonstrate that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-mediated localization of <i>Drosophila</i> Diaphanous occurs in mammalian cells. Lipid-protein collaboration also targets other proteins to the apical membrane. A common mechanism may therefore underlie cell polarity in tubular organ tissues in flies and mammals."

Polarization is apparent in the distinct composition of membrane domains: the apical membrane\u2014the surface facing the lumen, the basal membrane, which contacts the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and the lateral surfaces, which contain specialized cellular junctions that adhere adjacent cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bryant and Mostov, 2008</a>). The generation and maintenance of cell polarity is achieved by domain-specific proteins and lipids, which support the unique organization and function of each region. Among these, asymmetric distribution of phosphoinositides has been shown to be crucial for membrane identity and lumen formation in tubular systems. PI(4,5)P2 in the apical surface and PI(3,4,5)P3 in the basal membrane have been shown to tether specific polarity and cytoskeleton related proteins, which define their respective domains (<a href=\"#bib25\">Martin-Belmonte and Mostov, 2007</a>)."

One such structure, which is a common feature of tubular tissues, is a network of actin microfilaments lining the apical surface of the tube cells. In a previous study we found that in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular organs, this network mediates myosinV based transport of vesicles, promoting their secretion from the apical surface into the tube lumen. The actin-nucleator responsible for generating these structures was shown to be the formin-family protein Diaphanous (Dia) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Massarwa et al., 2009</a>)."

While the delivery of apical and baso-lateral transmembrane proteins through specialized routes of the secretory pathway has been well studied (<a href=\"#bib45\">Weisz and Rodriguez-Boulan, 2009</a>), much less is known about the targeting of cytoplasmic proteins such as Dia to distinct membrane domains."

The Dia-related formins (DRFs) can be functionally divided into two major domains, each encompassing roughly one half of the protein sequence (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goode and Eck, 2007</a>). The C-terminal portion of DRFs regulates actin polymer assembly by mediating microfilament nucleation, elongation and processive capping. Key functional sub-domains include the FH2 domain, which acts as a dimer, and moves processively with the growing barbed end, and the FH1 domain, which together with profilin acts to accelerate filament elongation by recruiting monomeric actin. The N-terminal portion of DRF nucleators is regulatory, governing the activation state of the molecule through interactions with various effectors. Importantly, this region has been shown to play significant roles in directing DRF localization in vivo (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Higgs, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chesarone et al., 2010</a>). DRFs are autoinhibited due to an intra-molecular interaction between the C-terminal DAD domain and the N-terminal DID domain, which maintains the molecule in a closed conformation. Upon binding of GTP-bound Rho1 to the N-terminal GTPase-binding domain, autoinhibition is relieved, allowing Dia to assume an open, active conformation and promote actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lammers et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Otomo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rose et al., 2005</a>)."

Accordingly, Dia-like proteins assume distinct subcellular localizations in a cell type specific manner. To prevent spatially unrestricted actin assembly in cells, localization of DRFs is highly regulated, and involves different factors and mechanisms. For example, the yeast formin Bni1p localizes during budding to the mother cell bud neck, by binding to the polarity factor Spa2, via a mechanism that involves four different localizing domains (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Targeting of mDia2, a mammalian homologue of Dia, to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, is achieved by binding to the scaffold protein anillin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Watanabe et al., 2010</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Dia is recruited to lamellipodia by the actin regulator Ena/Vasp in a small subset of epidermal cells, during the process of embryonic dorsal closure (<a href=\"#bib16\">Homem and Peifer, 2009</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i> tubular structures, <i>dia</i> mRNA is tightly concentrated at the apical side of the cells, by a mechanism that was shown to be distinct from the Dia protein apical targeting mechanism (<a href=\"#bib27\">Massarwa et al., 2009</a>). Thus, targeting of Dia-like proteins is regulated at multiple levels, to assure restriction of activity to the correct cellular domain."

We find that efficient apical targeting of Dia requires the detection of both PI(4,5)P2 and Rho1 on the apical surface. We show, both in a mammalian cell culture model and by genetic manipulations in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular organs, that PI(4,5)P2 levels regulate Dia localization. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is critical for this regulation, indicative of an electrostatic-based direct interaction between Dia and PI(4,5)P2. We demonstrate that apical enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 is a common feature of tubular organs in the fly, which can be attributed in part to the apical restriction of the PIP5 kinase (PIP5K) Skittles. We further show that Rho1 facilitates Dia apical targeting, both by inducing the Dia open conformation, thereby exposing N-terminal domains that are critical for localization, as well as by physically anchoring Dia to the apical surface. This anchoring appears to promote the Dia\u2013PI(4,5)P2 interaction, leading to synergistic effects of these two apical cues. We therefore propose that a multi-tiered targeting mechanism, utilizing both global and specific features of tubular organs, achieves a distinct localization pattern of Dia, thereby enabling execution of the cardinal process of apical secretion in these organs."

While expression of this construct in tubular epithelia results in protein levels similar to the full-length form (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), GFP-Dia-\u0394DAD displays a much tighter apical localization pattern (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>), suggesting that the molecule is now more accessible to apical-targeting signals. Quantification demonstrates that apical enrichment of GFP-Dia-\u0394DAD is enhanced up to fourfold relative to GFP-Dia-FL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013L</a>). Further measurements in GFP-Dia-\u0394DAD expressing cells reveal that \u223c45% of the total GFP intensity in the cell is concentrated at the apical surface, which encompasses only \u223c5% of the total cell area. When compared with the GFP-Dia-FL expressing cells, a clear shift in the GFP distribution is observed from the cytoplasm to the apical domain. In contrast, a similar degree of localization to the lateral membrane SJ domain is exhibited by both constructs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, enhanced apical localization of GFP-Dia-\u0394DAD appears to result primarily from efficient apical recruitment of its cytoplasmic pool.

GFP-Dia-\u0394DAD localization was dramatically altered, even after very short treatments of 10 min, displaying redistribution from the apical to the basal surface, while remaining apical in mock treated cysts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>). The rapid shift in GFP-Dia-\u0394DAD localization preceded the general shift in polarity induced by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 treatment in this system (<a href=\"#bib26\">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</a>). This can be readily appreciated by the partial basolateral localization of the apical membrane marker gp-135, which no longer co-localized with GFP-Dia-\u0394DAD following treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). The rapid nature of Dia re-localization suggests that recruitment to the baso-lateral membranes is a direct result of exogenous PI(4,5)P2 treatment.

Skittles (Sktl), one of the two <i>Drosophila</i> PIP5-kinases which catalyze PI(4,5)P2 production from PI(4)P (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), was shown to be critical for PI(4,5)P2 production in various systems (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gervais et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Fabian et al., 2010</a>), and is endogenously expressed in different <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic tubular organs (BDGP-Berkeley <i>Drosophila</i> Genome Project). Indeed, when we expressed an RFP-tagged version of Sktl in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular organs, it was targeted predominantly to the apical surface of cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>).

Supporting this notion is the observation that a mutated form of PIP5-kinase, containing an inactive kinase domain, fails to localize to the same membrane domain as the wild-type protein (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fairn et al., 2009</a>), demonstrating that continuous PI(4,5)P2 generation is required to enhance the localization bias of PIP5-kinases. We find a similar relationship in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular organs between Sktl activity and apical localization: a mutated form of Sktl, where the kinase domain is inactive (Sktl-KID), was no longer enriched apically, and instead assumed a general cortical distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013J</a>). We assume that the excess of Sktl-KID molecules may sequester endogenous levels of PI(4,5)P2 at the apical membrane, compromising localization of Sktl and other PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins, and leading to a disrupted morphology of tubular epithelia (not shown)."

(<b>H</b>) A model describing the dynamics of Dia targeting to the apical membrane in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular organs. a) Enrichment of both PI(4,5)P2 and Dia at the apical membrane is an inherent feature of <i>Drosophila</i> tubular epithelial cells. b) In a closed conformation, Dia assumes a cytoplasmic distribution. Dia binding to Rho1-GTP generates an initial apical bias, and promotes PI(4,5)P2 binding via exposure of the N-terminal region and enrichment near the apical membrane. The Dia- PI(4,5)P2 interaction further stabilizes apical membrane association. Dia can shift dynamically between three states, being bound to each of the apical cues alone, or to both simultaneously, increasing the probability for re-binding and therefore the efficiency of apical targeting.

This tight apical localization is critical for the formation of polarized actin tracks, guiding apical movement of secretory vesicles that are associated with MyosinV motors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Massarwa et al., 2009</a>).

Indeed, a reporter for the endogenous levels of PI(4,5)P2 displayed a highly significant apical enrichment in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular organs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The causal role of PI(4,5)P2 in recruiting Dia was demonstrated in several ways. First, <i>Drosophila</i> Dia was apically localized in the heterologous MDCK cell culture system, and its localization was shifted basally within minutes of adding PI(4,5)P2 to the basal membranes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We wish to point out that while in this system Dia localization is regulated by PI(4,5)P2 under both excess and normal conditions, it is currently unknown whether an interaction between Dia and mammalian Rho GTPases also contributes to the apical localization. Second, elevation in <i>Drosophila</i> tubular organs in the levels of Sktl, a PIP5-kinase that generates PI(4,5)P2, gave rise to a corresponding enhancement in the level of apical Dia. Conversely, knockdown of the <i>Pten</i> gene encoding the PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase in these tissues resulted in redistribution of PI(4,5)P2, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</a>). A corresponding alteration in Dia localization further supports the causal role of PI(4,5)P2 in its localization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

In contrast, a Sktl protein that is catalytically inactive was distributed uniformly, when expressed in a similar manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

These interactions are known to be weak, and are usually insufficient to stably associate proteins with the membrane under physiological conditions, requiring coupling to additional membrane-targeting motifs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mulgrew-Nesbitt et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, the Dia BD proved insufficient to direct apical targeting on its own (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In this respect, Dia differs from plant formins, which commonly contain a structured PTEN domain for phospholipid binding.

This asymmetry between the two cues suggests a model for the dynamics of Dia-apical targeting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Binding to activated Rho1 may represent the more prevalent scenario for the initial interaction of Dia with the apical membrane. This interaction will also give rise to an open conformation of Dia, which is more amenable to targeting, and will provide physical proximity to the membrane. Membrane proximity can now allow the interaction of Dia with PI(4,5)P2, which was not favored when the Dia protein was cytoplasmic, due to low affinity restrictions. The Dia-PI(4,5)P2 interaction stabilizes association with the apical membrane, resulting in synergy in the combined action of Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 in Dia apical localization. Once in the vicinity of the apical membrane, Dia can shift dynamically among three states, being bound to each of the cues alone, or to both simultaneously. This feature can increase the effective levels of apical-targeting cues, since they do not necessarily have to be used simultaneously at all times."

While GFP alone did not pull down Rho1, all other constructs (including the mut<sup>G</sup>) displayed a band of equal intensity that was recognized by Rho antibodies. We do not believe this reflects a bona-fide interaction, and have therefore removed this experiment from the paper. We also went one step further and carried out mass spectrometry analysis on a similar pull down with Dia-DAD (using a larger number of salivary glands, up to 500 per sample). The Rho1 protein could not be identified by this analysis, indicating that the sensitivity of the method does not allow the detection of endogenous levels of activated Rho that bind Dia, or that the extraction conditions used in the pull down were not sufficiently harsh to effectively remove membrane embedded proteins like Rho1."
