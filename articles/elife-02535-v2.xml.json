Negative epistatic interactions between genes from different parental genomes decrease the fitness of hybrids and can limit gene flow between species. However, little is known about the number and genome-wide distribution of genetic incompatibilities separating species. To detect interacting genes, we perform a high-resolution genome scan for linkage disequilibrium between unlinked genomic regions in naturally occurring hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We estimate that hundreds of pairs of genomic regions contribute to reproductive isolation between these species, despite them being recently diverged. Many of these incompatibilities are likely the result of natural or sexual selection on hybrids, since intrinsic isolation is known to be weak. Patterns of genomic divergence at these regions imply that genetic incompatibilities play a significant role in limiting gene flow even in young species."

Negative epistatic interactions between genes from different parental genomes decrease the fitness of hybrids and can limit gene flow between species. However, little is known about the number and genome-wide distribution of genetic incompatibilities separating species. To detect interacting genes, we perform a high-resolution genome scan for linkage disequilibrium between unlinked genomic regions in naturally occurring hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We estimate that hundreds of pairs of genomic regions contribute to reproductive isolation between these species, despite them being recently diverged. Many of these incompatibilities are likely the result of natural or sexual selection on hybrids, since intrinsic isolation is known to be weak. Patterns of genomic divergence at these regions imply that genetic incompatibilities play a significant role in limiting gene flow even in young species."

Many hybridizing populations and species remain genetically and ecologically distinct despite bouts of past admixture (e.g., <a href=\"#bib66\">Scascitelli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Vonholdt et al., 2010</a>). This has led to a surge of interest in identifying which and how many loci are important in maintaining species barriers. Recent work has focused on identifying so-called \u2018genomic islands\u2019 of high divergence between closely related species (e.g., <a href=\"#bib81\">Turner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nadeau et al., 2012</a>). This approach assumes that the most diverged regions between species are most likely to be under divergent selection between species or important in reproductive isolation. However, divergence-based measures need to be interpreted with caution because they are susceptible to artifacts as a result of linked selection events (including background selection and hitchhiking) such that outlier regions might reflect low within-population polymorphism rather than unusually high divergence (discussed in <a href=\"#bib7\">Charlesworth, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Noor and Bennett, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Renaut et al., 2013</a>), and there are many possible causes of elevated divergence that are not linked to isolation between species."

Hybridization leads to recombination between parental genomes that can uncover genetic incompatibilities between interacting genes. When genomes diverge in allopatry, substitutions that accumulate along a lineage can lead to reduced fitness when hybridization decouples them from the genomic background on which they arose. The best understood of these epistatic interactions, called \u2018Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller\u2019 (BDM) incompatibilities (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coyne and Orr, 2004</a>), can occur as a result of neutral substitution or adaptive evolution, and are thought to be common based on theoretical (<a href=\"#bib49\">Orr, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Turelli et al., 2001</a>) and empirical studies (<a href=\"#bib57\">Presgraves, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Presgraves et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Payseur and Hoekstra, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brideau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sweigart et al., 2006</a>). One defining feature of BDM incompatibilities is that they are predicted to have asymmetric fitness effects in different parental backgrounds, such that only a subset of hybrid genotypes are under selection. Though the BDMI model is an important mechanism of selection against hybrids, other evolutionary mechanisms can contribute to hybrid incompatibility. For example, co-evolution between genes can result in selection on all hybrid genotype combinations due to the accumulation of multiple substitutions (<a href=\"#bib72\">Seehausen et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, natural or sexual selection against hybrid phenotypes can be considered a form of hybrid incompatibility; in this case the genotypes under selection will depend on their phenotypic effects."

Most studies to date have addressed this question by mapping hybrid incompatibilities that contribute to inviability or sterility (<a href=\"#bib48\">Orr, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Orr and Coyne, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barbash et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Presgraves, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Presgraves et al., 2003</a>), in part because these incompatibilities affect hybrids even in a lab environment. Initial genome-wide studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and other organisms suggest that the number of incompatibilities contributing to hybrid viability and sterility can range from a handful to hundreds accumulating between deeply diverged species (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harushima et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Presgraves, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moyle and Graham, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Masly and Presgraves, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ross et al., 2011</a>); recent work has also suggested that substantial numbers of incompatibilities segregate within species (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cutter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Corbett-Detig et al., 2013</a>). However, because research has focused primarily on postzygotic isolation, little is known about the total number of loci contributing to reproductive isolation between species. For example, research shows that selection against hybrid genotypes can be strong even in the absence of postzygotic isolation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fang et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the focus on hybrid sterility and inviability is likely to substantially underestimate the true number of genetic incompatibilities distinguishing species."

These species are recently diverged (0.5% genomic divergence per site; 0.4% genomic divergence following polymorphism masking) and form multiple independent hybrid zones in river systems in the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico (<a href=\"#bib11\">Culumber et al., 2011</a>). <i>X. malinche</i> is found at high elevations while <i>X. birchmanni</i> is common at low elevations; hybrids occur where the ranges of these two species overlap. The strength of selection on hybrids between these two species is unknown, but several lines of evidence have suggested that selection may be weak. Hybrids are abundant in hybrid zones, often greatly outnumbering parental individuals. Hybrids are tolerant of the thermal environments at the elevations in which they are found (<a href=\"#bib13\">Culumber et al., 2012</a>). Though there is some evidence of BDMIs between the species that cause lethal melanomas, these melanomas typically affect hybrids post-reproduction (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schartl, 2008</a>) and may constitute a weak or even favorable selective force (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fernandez and Morris, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fernandez and Bowser, 2010</a>). Finally, recent behavioral studies show that once hybrids are formed, hybrid males actually have an advantage due to sexual selection compared to parental individuals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; and see <a href=\"#bib19\">Fisher et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Culumber et al., in press</a>). However, the genomes of adult hybrids sampled from hybrid populations have already been subject to multiple generations of selection (at least 30; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rosenthal et al., 2003</a>), making it difficult to evaluate the extent of selection on hybrids without genetic information. By surveying the genomes of hybrids from natural populations, we are able to identify interacting genomic regions under selection in hybrids, giving a powerful picture of the number of regions involved in reproductive isolation between this recently diverged species pair."

With this approach, we assign ancestry to nearly 500,000 ancestry informative markers throughout the genome, allowing us to evaluate genome wide patterns of LD at unprecedented resolution (\u223c820 markers/Mb). The joint analysis of two independent hybrid zones allows us to distinguish the effects of selection against genetic incompatibilities from confounding effects due to population history (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gardner et al., 2000</a>).

We genotyped 143 hybrid individuals from Calnali, 170 hybrids from Tlatemaco, and 60 parents of each species, determining ancestry at 469,400 markers distinguishing <i>X. birchmanni</i> and <i>X. malinche</i> at a median density of 1 marker per 234 bp (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). On average, hybrids from the Calnali hybrid zone derived only 20% of their genome from <i>X. malinche</i>, while hybrids from the Tlatemaco hybrid zone had 72% of their genomes originating from <i>X. malinche</i>. Most hybrid individuals were close to the average hybrid index in each group (Tlatemaco: 95% of individuals 66\u201380% <i>malinche</i> ancestry; Calnali: 95% of individuals 14\u201335% <i>malinche</i> ancestry). We determined the time since hybridization based on the decay in linkage disequilibrium (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), assuming an average genome-wide recombination rate of 1 cM/378 kb (<a href=\"#bib85\">Walter et al., 2004</a>). Estimates of hybrid zone age were similar for the two hybrid zones (Tlatemaco 56 generations, CI: 55\u201357, Calnali 35 generations CI: 34.5\u201335.6). Interestingly, these estimates are remarkably consistent with available historical estimates, which suggest that hybridization began within the last \u223c40 generations due to disruption of chemical cues by pollution (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fisher et al., 2006</a>)."

Using data from two hybrid populations to examine LD circumvents two problems: (1) within a single population cases of LD between unlinked sites are unlikely to be strong enough to survive false discovery corrections and (2) even interactions that are highly significant could be caused by population demographic history. The joint distribution of p-values in the two populations implies several hundreds of unlinked locus pairs are in significant LD in both populations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); 327 pairs of regions were significant at FDR = 5%, and 150 pairs were significant at a more stringent FDR = 2% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

Despite these findings, the true number of loci involved in incompatibilities may involve hundreds more interactions for several reasons. First, we conservatively exclude interactions within chromosomes due to the lack of detailed genetic map information. Second, we have only moderate power to detect incompatibilities (e.g., \u223c30% using parameter estimates for Calnali). Third, relaxing the p-value threshold suggests the true number of pairs in significant LD could be much larger (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, our experimental design incorporates two populations with opposite trends in genome-wide ancestry and independent histories of hybridization. This conservative approach allows us to exclude effects of population history, but false negatives in our joint analysis may result from effects that are population-specific (for example, different effects of extrinsic selection in the two populations). Investigating the role of such a large number of hybrid incompatibilities in determining the structure of hybrid genomes is an exciting area for future empirical and theoretical research."

Given the large number of putative incompatibilities, even weak selection would introduce substantial genetic load in hybrids. Depending on dominance effects, this could explain why hybrid populations are skewed in genome-wide ancestry. However, we may overestimate the potential for genetic load if epistatic interactions are complex. Though this study focuses on pairwise comparisons because statistically evaluating high-order interactions in a data set of this size is intractable, more complex interactions are predicted to be likely (<a href=\"#bib49\">Orr, 1995</a>). The fact that many locus pairs (\u223c40% of regions localized to 1 Mb or less) identified in this study interact with multiple partners provides indirect support for this prediction."

However, an issue that arises in testing this prediction is that functionally diverged regions associated with hybrid incompatibilities may also resist homogenization due to gene flow, conflating the cause and the effect of elevated divergence (but see below). While our study confirms that unlinked genomic regions in LD pairs are significantly more diverged between <i>X. birchmanni</i> and <i>X. malinche</i> compared to the genomic background (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we also find that these regions do not show elevated divergence in an independent comparison of <i>Xiphophorus</i> fish (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

However, the proportion of locus pairs in significant LD that are in conspecific association differs dramatically in the two populations. 6% of locus pairs in Calnali and 33% in Tlatemaco have significant heterospecific associations (i.e., significantly negative R) at FDR = 0.05. Heterospecific associations may be the result of beneficial epistatic interactions that result in hybrid vigor. For example, hybrid males are better at buffering the locomotor costs of sexual ornamentation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson, 2013</a>) and have an advantage compared to parental males from sexual selection (<a href=\"#bib12\">Culumber et al., in press</a>), which could in part counteract the negative fitness effects of genetic incompatibilities. However, the fact that few loci are heterospecific in association in both populations (2%, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) suggests that these patterns are not repeatable across populations. One possible explanation for this is divergent effects of mate preferences in the two populations. Behavioral studies have shown that <i>X. malinche</i> females prefer unfamiliar male phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib82\">Verzijden et al., 2012</a>) while <i>X. birchmanni</i> females prefer familiar male phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib83\">Verzijden and Rosenthal, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Verzijden et al., 2012</a>).

These associations are largely well described by a model of selection against hybrid incompatibilities, implying that reproductive isolation in these recently diverged species involves many loci. These regions were also more divergent between species than the genomic background, likely as a result of reduced permeability to ongoing gene flow between the species. By using samples from two populations with independent histories of hybridization, we are able to exclude population structure and drift as potential causes of these patterns. Our results suggest that past research has vastly underestimated the number of regions responsible for reproductive isolation between species by focusing on intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation. In addition, our results demonstrate that even in species without strong intrinsic post-zygotic isolation, hybrid incompatibilities are pervasive and play a major role in shaping the structure of hybrid genomes."

This resulted in 12,269 markers for linkage disequilibrium analysis; the median distance between thinned markers was 2 kb (mean = 48 kb). Individuals were considered hybrids if at least 10% of their genome was contributed by each parent; using this definition, 100% of individuals collected from Tlatemaco and 55% of individuals collected from Calnali were hybrids. Three more individuals from Calnali were excluded because their hybrid index was not within the 99% CI of the mean hybrid index. Including them resulted in a significant deviation from the expected R<sup>2</sup> between unlinked sites of 1/2n (n: number of sampled individuals)."

First, we used genome sequences of 5 <i>Xiphophorus</i> outgroups (<i>X. maculatus</i>, <i>X. hellerii</i>, <i>X. clemenciae</i>, <i>X. variatus,</i> and <i>X. nezahualcoyotl</i>) to identify autapomorphic loci in <i>X. malinche</i> and <i>X. birchmanni</i> respectively. We limit the analyses to only the autapomorphic loci for the minor parental species in each hybrid zone. We then fit an exponential curve D = a*exp (\u2212T*x), where \u2018D\u2019 is disequilibrium, \u2018a\u2019 is a coefficient, \u2018T\u2019 is time since hybridization in generations and \u2018x\u2019 is the physical distance between markers in Morgans (scripts are available in the Dryad data repository under DOI: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q6qn0\">10.5061/dryad.q6qn0</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">Schumer et al., 2014</a>). Because we do not have access to a recombination map for our species, we assumed a uniform recombination rate of 1 cM/378 kb (<a href=\"#bib85\">Walter et al., 2004</a>). This assumption can underestimate the time since hybridization in some cases (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sankararaman et al., 2012</a>), but better estimates await more detailed genetic map information."

We used the Matrix Spectral Decomposition method described in <a href=\"#bib36a\">Li and Ji (2005)</a> as implemented in the program matSpDlite (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nyholt, 2004</a>), to determine the effective number of markers.

We determined based on this analysis that the effective number of markers is 1087. Based on these results, we randomly selected 1087 markers from our data set, randomly shuffled genotypes within columns, calculated R<sup>2</sup> and p-values for the entire data set, and determined the expected number of false positives at different p-value thresholds. We repeated this procedure 1000 times. We compared the average number of false positives to the total number of positives in the actual data set at a number of p-value thresholds. Based on this analysis, we determined that p&lt;0.013 in both populations resulted in an expected false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 for 1087 independent markers (excluding within chromosome comparisons), while p&lt;0.007 resulted in an expected FDR of 0.02.

To evaluate levels of divergence relative to the genomic background, we compared divergence (calculated as number of divergent sites/length of region) between <i>X. malinche</i> and <i>X. birchmanni</i> at 207 regions in significant conspecific LD (FDR = 0.05) in both populations to 1000 data sets of the same size generated by randomly sampling regions throughout the genome that were not in significant LD (p&gt;0.013 with all unlinked regions) using a custom perl script and the program fastahack (<a href=\"https://github.com/ekg/fastahack\">https://github.com/ekg/fastahack</a>). For LD regions that included only 1 marker (n = 60), we included the flanking region defined by the closest 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 marker. To analyze coding regions, we extracted exons from these regions and calculated dN, N, dS, and S for each gene using codeml in PAML with the F3x4 codon model (<a href=\"#bib86\">Yang, 1997</a>; scripts are available in the Dryad data repository under DOI: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q6qn0\">10.5061/dryad.q6qn0</a>). For a phylogenetically independent comparison, we repeated this analysis using pseudogenomes for two swordtail species for which we previously collected genome sequence data, <i>X. hellerii</i> and <i>X. clemenciae</i> (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schumer et al., 2013</a>). Repeating all analyses for the full data set (i.e., including pairs in heterospecific LD in one or both populations) did not substantially change the results (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>)."

We used the ensembl annotation of the <i>X. maculatus</i> genome (<a href=\"http://www.ensembl.org/Xiphophorus_maculatus\">http://www.ensembl.org/Xiphophorus_maculatus</a>) to identify the HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee (HGCN) abbreviation for all the genes in each region. Using the GOstats package in R, we built a custom <i>Xiphophorus</i> database using the HGCN gene names listed in the genome and matching each of these to Gene Ontology (GO) categories as specified in the annotated human genome database (in bioconductor \u2018org.Hs.eg.db\u2019). This resulted in a total of 12,815 genes that could be matched to GO categories. We then tested for functional enrichment in GO categories, using the GOstats and GSEABase packages in R and a p-value threshold of &lt;0.01."

Because parameter estimates were similar for <i>X. malinche</i>, for simplicity, we used these estimates for both parental populations. For population 1, we set the time of admixture (t<sub>admix/4N</sub>) to 0.0014 generations, the proportion <i>X. malinche</i> to 0.7 (derived from the average hybrid index in samples from Tlatemaco), and the sample size to 170 diploids.

In each simulated replicate, we selected one substitution from each unlinked region and accepted a pair of sites if they were fixed for different states between parents (evaluated by generating 30 chromosomes of each species per simulation).

Under this migration scenario, our expected FDR at p&lt;0.013 is 15%. In addition to scenarios of ongoing migration, we simulated migration bursts. For a short time interval that corresponds to \u223c1 generation starting \u223c10 generations ago (t<sub>mig/4N</sub> = 0.00025\u20130.000275), we set the migration rate to 4Nm = 4000, or 10% of the population made up of migrants.

To optimize the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) parameters of MSG for analysis of natural hybrids, we used a combination of empirical data and simulations. We set the error rate parameter (deltapar) for each parent based on the genome wide average rate of calls to the incorrect parent in the 60 parental individuals of each species analyzed (deltapar = 0.05 and 0.04 for <i>X. birchmanni</i> and <i>X. malinche</i>, respectively). The transition probability of the HMM in MSG is determined by the mean genome-wide recombination rate multiplied by a scalar (rfac). We set the recombination rate to 240 based on the estimate of approximately 1 recombination event per chromosome per meiosis (24, 1 cM/378 kb, <a href=\"#bib85\">Walter et al., 2004</a>), and an a prior expectation of at least 10 generations of hybridization. We then increased the recombination factor step-wise to the maximum value that did not induce false breakpoints in parental individuals; we determined that rfac could be set to 3 without leading to spurious ancestry calls for parental individuals."

To determine the ancestry block size at which sensitivity decreases, we used the pseudogenomes to generate 25 Mb chromosomes with a homozygous block for the alternate parent randomly inserted (40, 60, 80, 100, 120 kb). We simulated 100 replicates of each size class and generated 1 million reads at MseI sites genome-wide. We then analyzed these simulated individuals using the MSG pipeline and determined whether the homozygous segment was detected. Based on our simulations, we determined that we had low power to detect ancestry blocks smaller than 80 kb (probability of detection \u226480%) and high power to detect blocks 120 kb or larger (probability of detection \u226597%). To determine how much of the genome we are failing to detect in small ancestry segments, we fit an exponential distribution to the observed block sizes in the real data for each parent and for each population, generated samples from an exponential distribution with the lambda of the observed distribution, and determined what percent of bases pairs were found in ancestry blocks below our detection threshold. Based on this analysis, we determined that in both hybrid zones, less than 5% of base pairs in the genome are likely to fall into undetectable segments."

Throughout the manuscript, you neither clearly define nor distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation (e.g., Abstract). In its classic form, the BDM model specifically describes how intrinsic postzygotic isolation evolves. Extrinsic postzygotic isolation might also evolve via this scenario (i.e., an environmentally-dependent BDMI), or instead by strictly additive gene action. Adding to the confusion, you conflate BDMIs with prezygotic factors. To improve clarity, you might want to describe the BDMI model in its traditional form, and then use a more general term like \u201cgenetic incompatibilities\u201d or \u201cisolation loci\u201d to describe heterospecific interactions that prevent zygote formation (e.g., egg-sperm incompatibilities) or lead to extrinsic isolation. We certainly agree that all of these types of genetic incompatibilities might be important for reproductive isolation between these species. Perhaps this should be the starting point, then: intrinsic hybrid sterility/inviability is weak in these species, so what maintains them in the face of considerable gene flow? What other mechanisms might generate the observed patterns of LD and genotype combinations? Similarly, while BDMI are a prominent model for the origin of incompatibilities, theory suggests they do not lead to effective isolating barriers (e.g., <a href=\"#bib22\">Gavrilets 1997</a>, Evolution 4: 1027-1035; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gompert et al. 2012</a> doi: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0196\">10.1098/rstb.2011.0196</a>). This does not invalidate the analysis of LD in hybrids, but it does provide prior expectations that even strong BDMI selection is not expected to leave strong effects on hybrid populations. It seems like this expectation is worth incorporating in the manuscript. One other concern is that you somewhat overstate the novelty of your study. Contrary to the claims, there is quite a bit known about the number and distribution of BDMIs between populations and species. In addition to a series of <i>Drosophila</i> studies that use deficiency mapping and/or introgression lines to examine genome-wide BDMIs (including the Presgraves and Masly &amp; Presgraves papers they cite), several other studies have characterized genome-wide patterns of transmission ratio distortion or LD.
