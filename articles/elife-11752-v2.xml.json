Here, we propose a new approach to define and quantify mRNA splicing in units of local splicing variations (LSVs). LSVs capture previously defined types of alternative splicing as well as more complex transcript variations. Building the first genome wide map of LSVs from twelve mouse tissues, we find complex LSVs constitute over 30% of tissue dependent transcript variations and affect specific protein families. We show the prevalence of complex LSVs is conserved in humans and identify hundreds of LSVs that are specific to brain subregions or altered in Alzheimer's patients. Amongst those are novel isoforms in the Camk2 family and a novel poison exon in Ptbp1, a key splice factor in neurogenesis. We anticipate the approach presented here will advance the ability to relate tissue-specific splice variation to genetic variation, phenotype, and disease."

Here, we propose a new approach to define and quantify mRNA splicing in units of local splicing variations (LSVs). LSVs capture previously defined types of alternative splicing as well as more complex transcript variations. Building the first genome wide map of LSVs from twelve mouse tissues, we find complex LSVs constitute over 30% of tissue dependent transcript variations and affect specific protein families. We show the prevalence of complex LSVs is conserved in humans and identify hundreds of LSVs that are specific to brain subregions or altered in Alzheimer's patients. Amongst those are novel isoforms in the Camk2 family and a novel poison exon in Ptbp1, a key splice factor in neurogenesis. We anticipate the approach presented here will advance the ability to relate tissue-specific splice variation to genetic variation, phenotype, and disease."

Different isoforms may arise through the use of alternative transcription start and end sites, or through alternative processing of pre-mRNA. A key process is alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA, where different subsets of pre-mRNA segments are removed while others are joined, or spliced together. The resulting differences between the mature mRNA isoforms can, in turn, encode different protein products, or affect mRNA stability, localization, and translation. Over 95% of human multiexon genes undergo AS, and disease associated genetic variants have been shown to frequently lead to splicing defects (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cooper et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2008</a>).

                                "text": "To address the shortcomings of previously defined AS types we suggest the formulation of local splicing variations, or LSVs. LSVs are defined and easily visualized as splits (multiple edges) in a splice graph where several edges either come into or from a single exon, termed the reference exon. A Single Source (SS) LSV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, yellow) corresponds to a reference exon spliced to several downstream RNA segments while single target (ST) LSV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, pink) corresponds to a reference exon spliced to upstream segments. The full specification of an LSV also includes the relative location of the exons and junctions (see Material and methods). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> illustrates how this formulation captures previously defined AS types (top panel) as well as more complex cases (bottom panel). Specifically, previously defined 'classical' AS events appear as special cases of binary graph splits (e.g., include or skip a cassette exon), while LSVs capture non-classical binary splits and splits involving more than two junctions. Such non-binary splits are termed complex LSVs. LSVs can also involve intron retention (intronic LSVs) or be comprised of only exons (exonic LSVs). Moreover, the transcriptome variability captured by LSVs may be the result of not only spliceosome decisions but also of alternative transcription start or end positions. For example, the gene in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> bottom panel involves two alternative first exons so a relative change in the transcription start site usage can result in changes in downstream LSVs quantification. Importantly, LSV formulation allows the probing of transcriptome structure and complexity yet, unlike full transcripts, can still be quantified directly from junction spanning reads."

MAJIQ\u2019s first step (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, top) is to parse a known database of transcripts, given as a GFF3\u2009annotation file, along with a set of mapped and aligned RNA-Seq experiments (indexed BAM files). Unlike many methods that only analyze known isoforms, MAJIQ supplements known transcripts with 'reliable' edges derived from <i>de novo</i> junction spanning reads. Several filters can be applied to define which edges are considered reliable and which LSVs have enough reads to be later quantified (see Material and methods). Similarly, LSVs whose edges are a subset of other LSVs, such as those denoted with dashed rectangles in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, are removed to avoid redundancy (see Material and methods). Next, MAJIQ can be executed to quantify LSVs either in a specific condition or to compare two experimental conditions, with or without replicates. LSV quantification in a specific condition is based on the marginal <span class=\"underline\">p</span>ercent <span class=\"underline\">s</span>elected <span class=\"underline\">i</span>ndex (PSI, denoted \u03a8) for each junction involved in the LSV, while comparison of experimental conditions is based on relative changes in PSI (dPSI, \u0394\u03a8). MAJIQ uses a combination of read rate modeling, Bayesian \u03a8 modeling, and bootstrapping to report posterior \u03a8 and \u0394\u03a8 distributions for each quantified LSV. The results of MAJIQ\u2019s LSV detection and quantification can be interactively visualized with the package VOILA in a standard web browser (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> bottom)."

                                "text": "We assessed MAJIQ\u2019s quantification accuracy for both \u03a8 and \u0394\u03a8 using a combination of RNA-Seq from biological replicates and an extensive set of 208\u2009RT-PCR validations. These experiments included two mouse tissues (cerebellum and liver [<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>]), and a human Jurkat T cell line (unstimulated and stimulated, [<a href=\"#bib10\">Cole et al., 2015</a>]). While accuracy depended on the dataset used, MAJIQ achieved an overall correlation of R = 0.8\u2009and R = 0.95\u2009for PSI and dPSI quantification by RT-PCR, comparing favorably to alternative methods on all datasets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, we used biological replicates from the Mouse Genome Project (<a href=\"#bib20\">Keane et al., 2011</a>) to assess reproducibility of differential splicing detection from RNA-Seq when comparing two experimental conditions. The reproducibility ratio (RR, see Material and methods) captures the fraction of top ranked differentially spliced LSVs that maintain their top ranking when analyzing another set of replicate experiments. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> shows MAJIQ compares favorably to other methods, including MISO (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2010</a>), rMATS (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shen et al., 2014</a>), and a bootstrapping approach (<a href=\"#bib51\">Xiong et al., 2015</a>) adopted for LSV. While MISO and rMATS achieved a reproducibility ratio of 61\u201367% we found the bootstrapping approach (N.B.) suffered from particularly high variance, which degraded reproducibility of LSVs ranking. In comparison, MAJIQ achieved a mean RR=77% when comparing two pairs of experiments and improving to RR=86% when the experiments compared had replicates. Notably, detection power was also improved. Defining differentially spliced LSVs as those for which P(|\u0394\u03a8|&gt;0.2) &gt; 0.95, the number of detected LSVs (N), after removing LSVs overlap (see Materials and methods), was on average 400\u2009for pairwise and 447\u2009for group comparisons, compared to 240\u2009and 260\u2009respectively by rMATS. The improvement in both detection and reproducibility of differentially spliced LSVs (N, RR) was robust to the statistical threshold used to define <i>N</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and when we removed MAJIQ\u2019s de-novo junction detection the number of LSVs dropped as expected but reproducibility remained high (N = 337, RR= 87%, data not shown). Importantly, this result also indicated that including de-novo junctions increased the number of differentially spliced LSVs that could be detected by over 30% (337\u2009vs. 447), while retaining equivalent reproducibility. Defining differential splicing reproducibility by RT-PCR as LSVs for which |\u0394\u03a8<sup>RT</sup>|&gt;20% resulted in 95% reproducibility. The higher reproducibility by RT-PCR can be expected given the lower experimental variability compared to RNA-Seq. Notably, the LSVs tested by RT-PCR were selected to cover a wide spectrum of read depth. We found that while higher coverage allowed more differential LSVs to be detected and steadily increased reproducibility by RNA-Seq, MAJIQ\u2019s reproducibility by RT-PCR was stable across read coverage depth, pointing to the robustness of the method (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Finally, we note that the above RT-PCR evaluation concentrated on binary LSVs to allow comparison to currently available methods, but we observed similar accuracy for the quantification of complex LSVs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

Naturally, this analysis is affected by how well a species transcriptome is annotated, and how permissive the database used is. In human for example, complex LSVs constitute 20.6% to 33.7% of the LSVs in annotated transcripts by RefSeq and Ensembl respectively, but only 1.86% in opossum\u2019s Ensembl annotation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Next, we expanded the set of annotated transcripts with novel junctions detected from RNA-Seq junction spanning reads. Limiting our analysis to only 5\u20136\u2009similar tissues in all species and conservative junction detection still increased the total number of LSVs in human by 11% and the fraction of complex LSVs from 33.7% to 37.1% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In species not as well annotated the effect of adding RNA-Seq data was more dramatic, jumping in opossum for example from 1,610\u2009to 10,228\u2009LSVs, of which 10% were complex. In summary, while LSV analysis across species was confounded by read coverage and transcriptome annotation we find that non-classical and complex LSVs make up a substantial fraction of observed transcriptome variations. Such complex LSVs are likely to be removed, undetected, or mislabeled by algorithms that only quantify binary AS events from previously annotated transcripts."

This allowed us to analyze 12\u2009tissues with an average of over 120M reads per sample, produced by a single lab (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). This data included three brain subregions, eight samples per tissue, and matching RNA for RT-PCR validations, leading to a total of 100,512\u2009LSVs detected. First, we used this data to assess the usage of LSVs across tissues. In order to minimize LSVs that result from false junctions identified by the mapper we only included junctions with multiple uniquely mapped staggered reads across multiple biological replicates (see Material and methods). Next, we tested the maximal inclusion level of the second, third, or the least used junction in an LSV across twelve mouse tissues. We detected a switch behavior where a different junction becomes dominant at 50% inclusion or more in approximately 5% of the classical binary LSVs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, grey), compared to 12% for the second most used junction in complex LSVs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, light green). Setting a conservative threshold of \u03a8 &gt; 10% to denote splice junctions that are less likely to be splicing noise or database errors we find that for the classical binary LSVs approximately 32%, or 9,516\u2009pass that threshold, compared to 57% and 19% of the complex LSVs that pass that threshold for the second and third most used junction respectively. These correspond to a total of 6,338\u2009and 2,112\u2009LSVs in our datasets, pointing to the importance of complex LSVs in transcriptome analysis. Even when testing for the least used junction in complex LSVs (e.g. the ninth in a nine junction LSV), we still find almost 10% pass the 10% inclusion threshold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, dark green). Finally, for intronic LSVs we find almost 11,000\u2009cases where an intron is retained at least 50% in one tissue, and 3,844\u2009cases where the intron is almost always retained with \u03a8 &gt; 99% (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This observation of widespread intron retention\u00a0(IR), especially in brain tissues, is in line with a recent study across many more tissues and cell lines (<a href=\"#bib8\">Braunschweig et al., 2014</a>), though our overall estimate of IR prevalence is more conservative."

Gene splice graphs can also be thought of as networks with exons as nodes and spliced junctions as edges. In this interpretation, LSVs can be thought of as small network motifs and used to shed light on the transcriptome complexity and commonly reoccurring sub-structure. Comparing the frequency of exonic LSV types (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) we find that the more common non classical LSVs involve 3\u2009to 5\u2009exons, combine exon skipping with an alternative 3\u2019/5\u2019 splice site, or involve alternative transcript start/end at the LSV\u2019s reference exon. In contrast, intronic LSVs are much less diverse, with classical intron retention making 68% of the cases (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> shows that for exonic LSVs 14% involve more than 2\u2009exons, 30% of the single source and 20% and of the single target LSVs involve a reference exon with two or more 5\u2019/3\u2019 splice sites, respectively. Overall, complex (non-binary) LSVs comprise 36.2% of the transcriptome variations detected in the data and 27.5% of the variations deemed quantifiable (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), yet spliceosome decisions still appear localized, with few LSVs involving more than 6\u2009exons or junctions. When analyzing LSVs usage, we found that the biochemical 'proximity rule', by which the splice site nearest to the reference exon is preferred (<a href=\"#bib37\">Reed and Maniatis, 1986</a>), is commonly not reflected at the genomic level. Defining 'dominant' junctions as those included at least 60%, we found proximal junctions appear dominant in approximately two thirds of the cases involving binary LSVs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) while more complex LSV tend to have more evenly distributed inclusion levels with no dominant junction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, left bars). This more evenly distributed usage of exons and junctions in complex LSVs further supports possible functionality of multiple isoforms."

Brain regions have a higher average of 927 (Cerebellum) to 840 (brainstem) changing LSVs compared to non-brain tissues. The number of LSVs changing between brain subregions varies between 36% and 57% of those changing between CNS and non-CNS tissues, with hypothalamus standing out as more similar to the two other CNS tissues (average of 937\u2009and 343\u2009changing LSVs when compared to non brain and other brain sub-regions, respectively).

To probe possible function we mapped exons in LSVs into their matching protein domains (see Material and methods). We then grouped LSV junctions based on whether they were part of binary or complex LSVs and whether they were differentially included across tissues. In line with previous works (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellis et al., 2012</a>), we find that binary LSVs, such as cassette exons, which are also differentially included across tissues, more frequently affect low-complexity, disordered regions when compared to non-changing binary LSVs (<i>p</i>&lt;1x10<sup>-4</sup>, corrected Fisher\u2019s exact test). Interestingly, differentially included complex LSVs are similarly enriched for such low-complexity regions (<i>p&lt;1</i>x10<sup>-4</sup>), but also show enrichment for specific protein families (<i>e.g.</i> spectrin/filamin) and domains (e.g. RNA recognition motifs) when compared to non-changing complex LSVs. These families and domains are largely distinct from those enriched in binary LSVs (e.g. WW domains or coiled coils). The complete list of enriched protein features can be found in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. Overall, this analysis suggests that regulated alternative splicing of both binary and complex LSVs can affect protein interactions via unstructured protein regions, or affect the inclusion of distinct protein domains in specific families."

Regulated alternative splicing that introduce PTCs is a common theme among numerous splicing factors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ni et al., 2007</a>) and exclusion of <i>Ptbp1</i>\u2009exon 16 (exon 11\u2009in the literature) has already been identified and shown to induce NMD (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wollerton et al., 2004</a>).

AVISPA\u2019s map of regulatory motifs pointed to a number of Rbfox binding sites downstream of exon 14 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These motifs, perfectly conserved between mouse and human, suggested enhancement of inclusion by the Rbfox family (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lovci et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this regulatory hypothesis, MAJIQ analysis of RNA-seq data from one month old nestin-specific <i>Rbfox1</i>\u2009KO mice revealed a marked decrease in inclusion of exon 14\u2009from ~16% in wild type mice to nearly undetectable in the KO (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) and similar decreased inclusion was observed upon <i>Rbfox2</i>\u2009KO (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lovci et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

These include near 100% skipping of exons 21\u2009through 23\u2009in all non brain or muscle tissues (known in the literature as isoform C or Camk2\u03b4C, (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2005</a>)), high relative inclusion of NLS containing exon 21\u2009in heart (isoform B or Camk2\u03b4B), and high levels of isoform A (Camk2\u03b4A), which includes exons 22\u2009and 23, in the brain regions examined (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This result is consistent with previous reports of <i>Camk2d</i> splicing patterns and isoform A being neuronal-specific (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2005</a>). Importantly though, MAJIQ also detects isolated inclusion of exon 23\u2009in the heart (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, green junction), which is supported by both the RT-PCR experiment and analysis of an independent dataset across heart development (see below). Previous studies focused on splicing regulation of <i>Camk2d</i> in the heart used junction spanning primers that preclude detection of this highly utilized splicing choice (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ye et al., 2015</a>)."

In the brain there is a switch in the splicing of <i>Camk2d</i> between the C and the A isoforms, reaching over 80% use of the A isoform by postnatal day 15, corresponding to a time of intense synaptogenesis and plasticity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, top). In the heart we see a more modest decrease in isoform C and increase in exon 23\u2009only during postnatal heart development (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, bottom, compare purple with green), consistent with results from RT-PCR from eight week old mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Notably, other CAMK2\u2009subunits also displayed developmental dynamics in both tissues, such as inclusion of NLS containing exons in <i>Camk2g</i> and <i>Camk2a</i> (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">2</a>), an unannotated mouse cassette exon in <i>Camk2g</i> regulated by the Rbfox family (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013G</a>), and a complex LSV in the variable domain of <i>Camk2b</i> that affects autophosphorylation and is regulated by Ptbp2 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Strikingly, in <i>CAMK2D</i> we observe a marked decrease of ~38% of the neuronal specific isoform of the complex, developmentally-regulated mouse LSV we validated above, with reciprocal increase in the all exclusion, isoform C in AD brains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We also observe changes in a <i>CAMK2G</i> LSV that corresponds to an unannotated mouse exon (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Importantly, these exons are perfectly conserved between mouse and human at the amino acid level, further suggesting physiologic importance of the novel splicing variations detected by MAJIQ. Finally, we validated that the observed CAMK2\u2009splicing changes in AD brains can be reproduced in a second independent study. We used data from the AMP-AD Target Discovery Consortium (doi:10.7303/syn2580853) involving a larger cohort of 157\u2009samples from AD patient\u2019s brains and 128\u2009control samples, across three different brain sub regions (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Overall, we detected approximately 200\u2009LSVs that are reproducibly differentially spliced between AD and normal brains (see Methods) and enriched in GO terms such as cytoskeleton, GTPase regulator activity, and synapse organization (data not shown). This set constitutes approximately 12% of the changing LSVs detected in the original dataset, a fraction that grows to 21% but only 164\u2009LSVs if stricter filtering is applied to both datasets (data not shown). This relatively low percentage of reproducible changes across the two datasets can be at least partially attributed to the small number of samples in the original study combined with an average of 1.8\u2009fold lower coverage in the second, larger dataset. Notably though, among the reproducible set of differentially spliced LSVs 79\u2009are complex, a significant, 1.2-fold enrichment compared to their relative proportion among all LSVs detected (p=0.04, binomial test). While the validation and experimental follow up on these LSVs is beyond the scope of this paper these results and the related CAMK2\u2009analysis demonstrate the usefulness of our combined approach for LSV detection, quantification, and visualization for disease studies."

Several previous works aimed to address the apparent representational gap between full transcripts and the classical binary AS events. For example, (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nagasaki et al., 2006</a>) developed an efficient bit array representation for the various exonic segments that make up different gene isoforms, and (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sammeth et al., 2008</a>) suggested an elaborate notational system that allowed them to catalogue all the splicing variations in a given transcriptome, comparing the frequencies of different AS types across 12\u2009metazoa. More recently, (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pervouchine et al., 2013</a>) developed bam2ssj, a package implementing a general intron centric approach to estimate AS from RNA-Seq data that can capture non classical AS variations. bam2ssj gives a BAM-file\u2013processing pipeline that counts junction reads to compute the ratio of inclusion levels either from the 5\u2019 or the 3\u2019 end of an intron, denoted <i>\u03a8<sub>5</sub></i>and <i>\u03a8<sub>3</sub>.</i>A different, graph based, approach was taken by (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hu et al., 2013</a>) where a splice graph is divided into subunits termed alternative splicing modules (ASMs). ASMs are hierarchically structured, each capturing all the possible paths along a splice graph between specific start (<i>\u2018single entry\u2019</i>) and end (<i>\u2018single exit\u2019</i>) points. The matching algorithm, DiffSplice, then aims to identify cases of differential transcription of ASMs between two experimental conditions. All of these works differ substantially in the formulation of splicing variation, the underlying algorithms, and visualization approach, yet all share the effort to capture non classical AS types. In comparison, MAJIQ offers a unique approach that spans formulation, detection, quantification and visualization of splicing variations. Unlike ASMs, LSVs can be inferred directly from junction spanning reads and result in quantitative PSI and dPSI estimates, while MAJIQ\u2019s probabilistic model offers significant accuracy boost for PSI and dPSI estimates compared to alternative methods."

Complex LSVs are also enriched for regulated splicing when analyzing over thirty datasets across different tissues, developmental stages, splice factor knockdowns and neurodegenerative disease. In addition, LSV formulation can be used to investigate substructures of the transcriptome. We found that the biochemically-based proximity rule is commonly overcome at the genomic level and that complex LSVs are less likely to have a dominant splice junction. As for LSVs possible function, our results indicate that tissue dependent binary and complex LSVs both tend to occur in unstructured regions known to affect protein-protein interactions, as well as in specific yet distinct protein domains and families."

For each gene defined in the database it determines all its known exons, associated 3\u2019/5\u2019 splice sites, and the splice graph edges (i.e. splice sites spliced together). It then scans the BAM files to find which of those edges are supported by RNA-Seq reads, and which de-novo splice sites and edges should be added based on junction reads. A user-controlled filter defines which edge is considered 'reliable' to be included in the splice graph. The default is set to \u201cappears in the database or has at least two reads from two different positions\u201d. In order to create the splice graph, MAJIQ combines the known transcriptome with the reliable de-novo junctions. If de-novo 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 splice sites are found outside the boundaries of any annotated exons, they are connected to the proximal upstream or downstream exon, respectively. If such a de-novo 3\u2019 splice site is followed by a de-novo 5\u2019 splice site then the area in between is denoted as a putative de-novo exon. However, de-novo exonic regions added to the splice graph are not allowed to exceed a user-defined threshold. The default threshold is set to 500bp, which corresponds to approximately the 95\u2009percentile of known exons length in the mouse genome. In cases where a de-novo exonic extension might have exceeded this threshold it is instead used to create an 'open ended' putative de-novo exonic region with its boundaries marked accordingly. All the de-novo junctions and exonic regions are marked in green in VOILA\u2019s output (see for example <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Finally, for retained introns, an additional filter is added for the average coverage in consecutive windows across the intron. The default is set to 1.5 (see Supplementary <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A, B</a>) but it is important to adjust this threshold depending on the coverage depth and how permissive one wants to be when calling retained introns."

Intuitively this setting retains only LSVs for which there is evidence for expression of at least some gene isoforms involved in that LSV though not all edges involved in the LSV will necessarily be found in the data.

These fractions are inferred from short sequence reads that span across junctions (junction reads), whose distribution can be affected by many factors. Consequently, MAJIQ quantifies PSI and dPSI not as a point estimate but as a posterior distribution over possible fractions in the range [0,1]. Importantly, the quantifier screens the builder\u2019s list of LSVs for those that are deemed 'quantifiable' by a user-defined filter. Intuitively, the sparsity of RNA-Seq data results in many LSVs being reliably detected by RNA-Seq yet lacking sufficient read coverage to accurately quantify PSI or to confidently infer significant changes in PSI across conditions.

Note that here the position\u2019s read rate corresponds to reads that start/end at that position, not reads that overlap it. The estimation of each junction\u2019s read rate involves three components: A global parametric model per experiment for read count variability; a stack removal procedure; and a local estimator for read rate derived from bootstrapping over each junction\u2019s relevant positions. For the global parametric model MAJIQ uses the zero truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) distribution. The dispersion parameter <i>r<sub>t</sub></i> is optimized per experiment <i>t</i> by bootstrapping over non-zero positions in a randomly selected set of up to 10,000\u2009quantifiable junctions. Next, given the derived negative binomial model with dispersion <i>r</i>, MAJIQ performs a screening step to detect possible read stacks. A read stack is defined as a position i in junction j with an observed read rate x<sub>j,i</sub> which is highly unlikely given <i>r</i> and the average read rate in other non zero positions in the junction. After experimentation with the effect on reproducibility, a conservative threshold of p-val \u2264 10<sup>\u22127</sup>\u2009was set as the default to flag possible read stacks. Flagged positions and their respective reads are then removed from further consideration. Finally, we noticed that even after fitting a global dispersion parameter per experiment <i>r<sub>t</sub></i> and discarding read stacks the data still exhibits variability not fully accounted for by this model (data not shown).

This allowed us to also assess dPSI reproducibility for a wide range of dPSI values (see below). Next, for each LSV the total number of reads starting at positions within all the LSV\u2019s junctions in each replicate were summed together for each tissue. Then, the LSVs were binned by the average total read coverage in the two tissues. Bins were defined to be: 10\u201330, 30\u201340, 40\u201380, 80\u2013200, and above 200\u2009reads. From each such bin, a set of LSVs was randomly selected for RT-PCR validation. Each RT-PCR was executed in triplicates (see below). Finally, the average PSI by RT-PCR and the expected PSI by either MAJIQ or MISO were used to produce <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.

One complication as a result of that is that while redundant LSVs are removed (see above) different LSVs may still partially overlap. A good example for that are cassette exons. In the LSV formulation a differentially included cassette exon may have two LSVs that support it, corresponding to different lines of experimental evidence (junction reads from the up and downstream exons) but other methods/tools will only count this exon as a single event. This in turn may bias both the reproducibility ratio (RR) and detection power (N) in favor of MAJIQ. In our experiments, when we ignored such possible overlap of LSVs the reproducibility ratio remained the same but the number of differentially spliced LSVs detected was significantly higher (RR=86%, N = 752, data not shown). In order to avoid such a bias in favor of MAJIQ we implemented a conservative approach where the ranked LSVs are filtered so that no LSV contained overlapping exons with another LSV. We note this is a conservative filter as there may be complex LSVs that involve multiple differentially spliced exons, or cases where the same exone involves different variations (<i>e.g.</i> skipping the exon but also alternative 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 splice sites). In such cases only a single LSV would pass that filter while the methods we compared to would still be able to retain separate AS events for those."

Next, we annotated each LSV junction by PF that overlap its reference exon and its target/source exon, discarding junctions in non-coding regions. Because the overlap of a LSV junction region and a protein feature can be partial, we considered a PF to be associated with a junction when there was at least a 20% overlap. Lastly, we labeled as changing junctions those that had an estimated delta psi greater than 20% in any two tissues."

For each PF we computed the p-value by Fisher\u2019s Exact Test (FET) for its distribution between the two junction groups compared. To correct for multiple hypotheses testing while accounting for the high correlation between some PF we applied a permutation based testing procedure (Column M). Specifically, we shuffled the labels (e.g. changing, unchanging) but controlled for the LSV origin of each junction. Thus, junctions from the same LSV were randomly switched with junctions from an LSV with the same number of junctions. This procedure guarantees that the number of labeled junctions remains the same, helps control for correlation between PF of junctions in the same LSV and for the distribution of LSV types. We repeated this process 10000\u2009times and then calculate an empirical corrected FET p-value. The results from this analysis are included in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>."

There is indeed a need to understand the full complexity of transcript variants in most biological/pathological settings, and therefore sensitive methods for their detection and quantification, particularly using standard sequencing depth datasets, can be very valuable. The performance of the package, which combines various softwares into a single pipeline, appears to be excellent and all tools are available."

The authors seem to imply that theirs is the first method that attempts to systematically classify and categorize AS events, beyond merely, exon skipping, alternative usage of splicing sites or intron retention. But, in my opinion, this is incorrect. The authors appear to ignore a large body of previous literature that actually attempts to address exactly this problem. Worth mentioning in this regard is the work of Nagasaki et al. (2005, <a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/10/1211.full\">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/10/1211.full</a>) or Sammeth et al. (2008, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000147\">http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000147</a>). In the latter work, in particular, analysis similar to those presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in Vaquero-Garcia et al., regarding the frequency of complex LSVs depending on the annotation used and the species considered, are presented. Moreover the methods developed by Sammeth et al. have actually been used to categorize AS events in a number of publications (<a href=\"https://scholar.google.es/scholar?cites=8586199022962348855&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en\">https://scholar.google.es/scholar?cites=8586199022962348855&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en</a>). Also single source and single target LSVs are quantified in their recent work by Pervouchine et al. (2013, <a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long\">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long</a>). The authors also claim that they obtain splicing information by combining the annotation and RNA-seq evidence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). It is not clear if they use only splice junctions, or also exons and transcript models. The latter is important for the definition of LSV. Indeed, if \"the reference exon may include multiple 3' splice sites (ST-LSV) or 5' splice sites (SS-LSV)\", as it is said in Materials and methods, it would be necessary to know novel exons as continuous units. If this is the case, a lot more has to be explained in Materials and methods regarding the procedure of exon discovery from RNA-seq. In summary, in contrast to the claims by Vaquero-Garcia et al., complex LSVs have received wide attention within the field."

It would be useful, in this regard, to analyze the range and frequency distribution of \u0394PSI values associated with complex LSVs compared to more standard alternative splicing events. Analysis of the conservation level of the predictably more relevant events could also be helpful."

The manuscript would greatly benefit from additional efforts to more broadly illustrate the utility of the tool, for example to show how the approach is advantageous for explaining the impact of genetic variation using publicly available data from the GTEx project (e.g. pilot samples), ENCODE, modENCODE, etc."

(2013, <a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long\">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273.long</a>). The authors also claim that they obtain splicing information by combining the annotation and RNA-seq evidence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). It is not clear if they use only splice junctions, or also exons and transcript models. The latter is important for the definition of LSV. Indeed, if \"the reference exon may include multiple 3' splice sites (ST-LSV) or 5' splice sites (SS-LSV)\", as it is said in Materials and methods, it would be necessary to know novel exons as continuous units. If this is the case, a lot more has to be explained in Materials and methods regarding the procedure of exon discovery from RNA-seq. In summary, in contrast to the claims by Vaquero-Garcia et al., complex LSVs have received wide attention within the field.</i> "

Second, we added a genome wide analysis of LSVs that are consistently differentially spliced between brain samples from patients and controls in the two datasets (included in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> described above). We very much agree this work is still just the tip of the iceberg and we believe much more can be done with the AD datasets and many others. Specifically, the suggested analysis of genetic variations with MAJIQ is a great direction to pursue in future work. However, we are very much aware that a careful analysis of this sort is beyond the scope of this paper."
