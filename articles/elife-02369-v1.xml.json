Viruses need to get inside cells and hijack their systems in order to reproduce, while cells have an immune response to detect and eliminate viruses and other pathogens. The first line of defence against viruses is the innate immune response, which strikes indiscriminately at any pathogen it encounters. A pathway called the type-I interferon (IFN-I) signalling pathway has a central role in beginning the innate immune response. This pathway starts with the viruses being detected by sensors inside the cells, and ends with the production of interferons\u2014proteins that create antiviral conditions around the virus-infected cells."

These complexes then engage with proteins called mitochondrial antiviral signalling proteins, or MAVS proteins for short, that are found on the surface of mitochondria within the cell. This causes the MAVS proteins to form filaments, which have an important role in activating the transcription factors that ultimately lead to the production of the interferons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Hou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Belgnaoui et al., 2011</a>). However, the structure of the filaments formed by the MAVS proteins has long been a mystery. Now, Qiu-Xing Jiang, Zhijian Chen, Xuewu Zhang and co-workers at the UT Southwestern (UTSW) Medical Center and the Janelia Farm Research Campus\u2014with Hui Xu as the first author\u2014have used cryo-electron microscopy to show that these filaments have a novel three-stranded structure (<a href=\"#bib10\">Xu et al., 2014</a>)."

A sensor called RIG-I binds to RNA molecules that contain an exposed 5\u2032-triphosphate and terminal dsRNA structure, while MDA5 binds to long dsRNA molecules (<a href=\"#bib4\">Goubau and Deddouche, 2013</a>). The complexes formed by the RNA molecules and the sensors then activate MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling) proteins that are found on the surface of mitochondria. This occurs in the presence of polyubiquitin, which serves to bridge and stabilise the complexes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Jiang et al., 2012</a>). Binding between the complexes and the MAVS proteins occurs at regions on each named CARDs (caspase activation and recruitment domains). In the figure, the RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs are shown as stars, and the MAVS CARDs by the red, blue and green circles. This binding organises the MAVS proteins into filaments to form a signalling platform that activates transcription factors (IRF3 and IRF7), which go on to stimulate the transcription of antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) genes. Xu et al. report that each MAVS filament contains three intertwined helical strands (shown in red, blue and green). The structure is maintained by interactions between the MAVS CARDs: each CARD in a filament interacts with two other CARDs in the same strand and two CARDs in neighbouring strands. Interactions between strands are hydrophobic (cyan dashed lines), and interactions within a strand are electrostatic (yellow dashed lines)."

For example, some regions have electrostatic charges, whereas others are hydrophobic. Xu et al. found that each CARD interacts with four other CARDs\u2014two from the same strand and two from neighbouring strands. The CARDs belonging to the same strand appear to be held together by hydrophobic interactions, while the CARDs from different strands are held together by electrostatic interactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Further work should focus on determining the minimum size or number of these complexes that are required to start a filament. In the case of RIG-I, it is known that the length of the double-stranded region of RNA determines the number of RIG-I molecules that bind to the RNA, which consequently dictates the degree of interferon activation. So, it will also be interesting to discover whether the size or the number of activated RIG-I/MDA5 complexes dictates the length or the number of MAVS filaments formed in the cell. Subsequently, does this determine the magnitude of interferon activation?"

It would seem inefficient in terms of both energy and materials to break down the filaments into their original constituents. Thus, it is possible that other mechanisms such as autophagy, which involves recycling of unnecessary or damaged components of the cell, plays a role in discarding mitochondria containing MAVS filaments. Again, detailed mechanistic studies will be needed to answer these questions."
