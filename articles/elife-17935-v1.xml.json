We showed previously that SMOC inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling downstream of its receptor via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In contrast, the most prominent effect of the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue, <i>pentagone</i> (<i>pent</i>), is expanding the range of BMP signaling during wing patterning. Using SMOC deletion constructs we found that SMOC-\u2206EC, lacking the extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain, inhibited BMP2 signaling, whereas SMOC-EC (EC domain only) enhanced BMP2 signaling. The SMOC-EC domain bound HSPGs with a similar affinity to BMP2 and could expand the range of BMP signaling in an in vitro assay by competition for HSPG-binding. Together with data from studies in vivo we propose a model to explain how these two activities contribute to the function of Pent in <i>Drosophila</i> wing development and SMOC in mammalian joint formation."

We showed previously that SMOC inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling downstream of its receptor via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In contrast, the most prominent effect of the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue, <i>pentagone</i> (<i>pent</i>), is expanding the range of BMP signaling during wing patterning. Using SMOC deletion constructs we found that SMOC-\u2206EC, lacking the extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain, inhibited BMP2 signaling, whereas SMOC-EC (EC domain only) enhanced BMP2 signaling. The SMOC-EC domain bound HSPGs with a similar affinity to BMP2 and could expand the range of BMP signaling in an in vitro assay by competition for HSPG-binding. Together with data from studies in vivo we propose a model to explain how these two activities contribute to the function of Pent in <i>Drosophila</i> wing development and SMOC in mammalian joint formation."

One family of growth factors called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate the formation of bone and many other tissues in the embryo. BMPs are released from cells, diffuse away and are then detected by other cells. When BMPs attach to docking station-like structures on the cell surface, called receptors, they stimulate a signaling process inside the cell. In 2009, researchers found that a protein called SMOC blocks BMP activity in animals with backbones by triggering an interfering signal inside the cell. In flies, however, the equivalent protein can make BMP diffuse further from the cell that releases it."

These experiments revealed that one end of SMOC can stick to molecules on the cell surface that are not receptors but are molecules where BMP can also bind. When this end of SMOC attaches to these sites, BMPs cannot bind and so diffuse further away."

Establishing temporospatial gradients or restricted distributions of BMP signaling is important for many of these processes, which are regulated by a number of mechanisms: ligand binding by extracellular BMP antagonists (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brazil et al., 2015</a>), intracellular feedback inhibition downstream of the BMP receptor (<a href=\"#bib27\">Massagu\u00e9 et al., 2005</a>), spatially restricted proteolytic processing (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thomas et al., 2006</a>), and promotion or restriction of diffusion by interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen type IV (<a href=\"#bib58\">Umulis et al., 2009</a>) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matsumoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Belenkaya et al., 2004</a>). In addition, BMP signaling is also influenced via communication with other signaling pathways, particularly those that act through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPK-directed phosphorylation of BMP receptor-regulated Smad 1/5/8 in the linker region inhibits BMP signaling by blocking Smad translocation to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alarc\u00f3n et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sapkota et al., 2007</a>)."

In <i>Xenopus</i> ectodermal explants (animal caps), SMOC was shown to activate MAPK signaling and inhibit Smad 1/5/8-mediated BMP signaling downstream of the constitutively active BMP receptor, BMPR1B (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>). Although the exact mechanism is not known, the activity was lost in the presence of non-phosphorylatable linker-mutant Smad, suggesting that BMP inhibition results from activation of MAPK signaling and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of Smad following linker Smad phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sapkota et al., 2007</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, the SMOC orthologue <i>pentagone (pent)</i> is expressed in developing wing imaginal discs and has also been shown to inhibit BMP signaling (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). However, Pent did not appear to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of the constitutively active zebrafish BMPR1 receptor, Alk8 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). Structurally, SMOC and Pent are similar, containing an N-terminal follistatin-like domain (FS), followed by two thyroglobulin-like domains separated by a non-homologous domain, and a C-terminal extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vannahme et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). Although Pent contains an additional EC domain located between the two thyroglobulin-like domains, their phylogenetic conservation would predict similar functions. In <i>Drosophila,</i> Pent binds to the cell surface HSPG, Dally, which is required <i>for Pent to extend the range of BMP signaling during Drosophila</i> wing patterning (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). While SMOC has also been shown to bind to HSPGs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klemen\u010di\u010d et al., 2013</a>), there have been no reports of SMOC promoting BMP signaling at a distance from its source. Indeed, the dual function of SMOC/Pent as a BMP inhibitor and an expander of BMP signaling have not been reconciled. Here, we present the first evidence showing how different domains within SMOC function either to inhibit BMP signaling locally or expand its range of effect."

As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>), compared to controls, flies homozygous for <i>pent</i> mutations display a characteristic truncation of the L5 longitudinal vein of the adult wing (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When <i>pent</i> was expressed in its normal location during wing development, using the Gal4/UAS system, the mutant phenotype was rescued completely, demonstrating that the <i>pent</i> construct had full biological activity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Initial injections of <i>pent</i> mRNA into <i>Xenopus</i> embryos produced no apparent effects (not shown); however overexpression of a synthetic <i>pent</i> mRNA (<i>co-pent</i>) optimized for codon usage and translation efficiency in <i>Xenopus</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Villegas and Kropinski, 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) produced a dorsalized phenotype indistinguishable from that observed following overexpression of <i>Xenopus</i> SMOC-1 (<i>X</i>SMOC-1) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The ability of Pent to inhibit BMP signaling downstream of the BMP receptor was analyzed in <i>Xenopus</i> ectodermal explants (animal caps) following co-injection of mRNAs for <i>co-pent</i> and constitutively active BMP receptor1B (caBMPR1B); the caBMPR1B, containing an intracellular activating mutation (Q203D), promotes phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 and subsequent BMP signaling events independent of ligand binding (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zou et al., 1997</a>). As expected, <i>XVent</i>, a direct downstream target of BMP signaling (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gawantka et al., 1995</a>), was strongly expressed in animal caps from embryos injected with caBMPR1B alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, <i>XVent</i> was markedly reduced in caps from embryos co-injected with caBMPR1B and either <i>co-pent</i> or <i>X</i>SMOC-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>); these results suggested that, as we had shown previously for SMOC (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>), Pent can inhibit BMP signaling downstream of the BMPR1B receptor. It is unclear why, in a previous report (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>), Pent was able to rescue ventralization caused by overexpression of Bmp2b in <i>Zebrafish</i>, but not following overexpression of the <i>Zebrafish</i> caBMPR1, Alk8. As both BMPR1B (Alk6) and Alk8 are type I BMP receptors that activate Smad 1/5/8, a possible reason could be the amounts of mRNA injected and/or the amounts of protein produced. In our previous study (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>), SMOC transfected NIH3T3 cells were able to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of excess BMP2 (100 ng/ml); where the limiting factor would be the number of BMP receptors on the cells. Conversely, in order for SMOC/Pent to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of caBMPR1B, SMOC/<i>pent</i> needed to be overexpressed at a 2:1 ratio (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>); SMOC was not able to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of an excess of caBMPR1B (not shown)."

To address this possibility we developed assays using SMOC expressed in bacteria and refolded together with two SMOC deletion mutant constructs; <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206EC lacking the EC domain, and <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC containing the EC domain only. The EC domain was of interest as hSMOC-1 binds to heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) via the EC domain (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klemen\u010di\u010d et al., 2013</a>) and the expander function of Pent is associated with binding to the cell surface-associated HSPG, Dally (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). For expression of <i>X</i>SMOC-1 in bacteria, the predicted signal peptide (2-24) was omitted and a C-terminal hexahistidine-tag added. When first expressed, two predominant induced proteins were observed on SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); one migrating at 49 kDa, the other at approximately 24 kDa. Protein sequencing revealed the 49 kDa protein to be <i>X</i>SMOC-1, whereas the 24 kDa protein was a partial <i>X</i>SMOC-1 sequence beginning at V235.

Analysis by S-200 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed a mixture of poorly separated peaks, one of which had a calculated molecular weight of 45.5 kDa, approximate to the predicted 49.6 kDa of monomeric <i>X</i>SMOC-1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, when tested in the <i>Xenopus</i> animal cap assay the protein was inactive (not shown). As occupancy of the calcium binding sites may be necessary for biological activity, we modified the refolding buffer to include 2 mM CaCl<sub>2.</sub> With this change, in addition to poorly-separated higher molecular weight material, both <i>X</i>SMOC-1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206EC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) migrated as single, symmetrical peaks. Their calculated molecular weights of 95.4 kDa and 53 kDa, respectively, were approximately twice the predicted monomeric sizes (49.6 kDa and 32.3 kDa). This suggested that <i>X</i>SMOC-1 and <i>X</i>SMOC-\u2206EC refolded in the presence of calcium form dimers. Furthermore, hSMOC-1, shown previously to elute as a monomer (<a href=\"#bib38\">Novinec et al., 2008</a>), also migrated as an apparent dimer under these conditions with a calculated molecular weight of 90.3 kDa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>); no peak was observed at the expected monomeric size of 46.6 kDa. In contrast, <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC eluted at the calculated molecular weight of 23.7 kDa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), consistent with that predicted for a monomer (18.4 kDa). Dimeric <i>X</i>SMOC-1 could not be dissociated by chelation of Ca<sup>++</sup> ions and continued to elute as a dimer following dialysis in the presence of 10.5 mM EDTA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, a dimer was still observed in the presence of 50 mM EDTA and 1 mM nitriloacetic acid (not shown).

RT-PCR demonstrated the induction of anterior neural markers in the presence of <i>X</i>SMOC-1 and <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206EC, but not <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>); hSMOC-1 was also effective in this assay (not shown). For these studies, the optimal concentration of SMOC was found to be 100 \u03bcg/ml, which appears relatively high. However, SMOC is a matricellular protein and though it is difficult to estimate the effective concentration in vivo, its affinity for HSPGs suggests that its diffusion will be restricted unless HSPG sites are saturated. Consequently, it may remain concentrated near the site of secretion and thus achieve high levels locally. Temporal analyses showed that a two-hour pulse of <i>X</i>SMOC-1 or <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206EC protein was sufficient to commit the na\u00efve ectoderm of the <i>Xenopus</i> animal cap to an anterior neural fate sixteen hours later (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); a one-hour pulse was not. This suggests that, following a two hour exposure to SMOC, a duration of exposure (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rogers and Schier, 2011</a>) is reached whereby sufficient changes in gene transcription occur in SMOC-responsive cells to convert their fate from epidermal to neural. While it is well established that inhibition of endogenous BMP activity in <i>Xenopus</i> ectodermal explants promotes a neural fate (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vonica and Brivanlou, 2006</a>) and a number of genes have been implicated in neural fate specification (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kishi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ueno et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Milet et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Green and Vetter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gammill and Sive, 2001</a>), the sequence of events resulting in commitment to the neural lineage is not known. It should now be feasible to design an unbiased genome-wide screen to identify the early transcriptional changes, following a two hour exposure to SMOC, that initiate neural differentiation."

The effect on BMP inhibition was analyzed in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos following overexpression of mRNAs for each deletion construct and caBMPRIB. Analysis of animal caps following co-injection of <i>Xenopus</i> embryos with caBMPRIB and <i>X</i>SMOC-1, <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206FS, or <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206EC showed inhibition of BMP signaling, indicated by the suppression of <i>X</i>Vent expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Whereas these data suggest that the FS and EC domains are not required for BMP inhibition overexpression of <i>X</i>SMOC-1Tg1, containing the Tg1-like domains only, did not inhibit BMP signaling in this assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>); deletion of the Tg1-like domains (<i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206Tg1) produced a similar result. While we believe the Tg1-like domains to be important for BMP inhibition, by process of elimination, the effects of large deletions on protein folding are difficult to predict; in experiments of this type, where protein function is lost, improper folding is common (<a href=\"#bib59\">Valastyan and Lindquist, 2014</a>). Consequently, we consider misfolding of the protein produced by <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206FS\u2206EC as the most likely reason for the\u00a0inability of this construct to block BMP signaling. Additional evidence for the importance of the Tg1-like domains in SMOC comes from studies of human Ophthalmo-Acromelic (Waardenburg Anophthalmia) Syndrome, an autosomal disorder caused by mutations in SMOC-1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rainger et al., 2011</a>). The phenotype of anopthalmia, oligodactyly, and joint abnormalities was found to be the same in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations and those with missense mutations in the second Tg1-like domain (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rainger et al., 2011</a>). As the nonsense and frameshift mutations were predicted to result in a complete loss of SMOC-1 function, the two pedigrees harboring two different single amino acid missense mutations in the Tg1-like domain suggests this domain is indeed essential for SMOC-1 function. Alternative approaches will be required to elucidate the exact role of the Tg1-like domains in BMP inhibition. Many proteins contain Tg1-like domains, including thyroglobulin, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) 1\u20136, the proteoglycan testican, and the basement membrane associated protein nidogen/entactin (<a href=\"#bib37\">Novinec et al., 2006</a>). However, there have been no reports of any of these proteins inhibiting BMP signaling."

The binding of SMOC/Pent and BMP2/4 to HSPGs is known, as evidenced by the co-purification of SMOC and BMPs following heparin affinity chromatography of bovine cartilage extracts (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 1994</a>), and the binding of BMP2/4 and the EC domain of hSMOC/Pent to heparin/HSPGs (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Klemen\u010di\u010d et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ruppert et al., 1996</a>). In addition, the basic amino acid-rich putative heparin-binding region identified within the EC domain of SMOC (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klemen\u010di\u010d et al., 2013</a>) is highly conserved in Pent (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine (PHYRE), an unsupervised homology model for <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC was constructed based on the structure of the EC domain of the related family member BM-40 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hohenester et al., 1996</a>). <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC aligned well with the BM-40-EC model (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and the electrostatic surface potential map predicted an area of positive charge similar to that reported in the EC domain of hSMOC1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Klemen\u010di\u010d et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As monomeric hSMOC-1, refolded in the absence of calcium, was used in previous heparin-binding studies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klemen\u010di\u010d et al., 2013</a>), we first determined whether dimeric <i>X</i>SMOC-1 can bind heparin. <i>X</i>SMOC-1 and <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC bound to heparin Sepharose in the presence of 0.5M NaCl, whereas <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206EC did not (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), confirming the EC domain to be the site of HSPG binding. Comparison of the heparin-binding affinities of <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC and BMP2 showed a striking similarity, with both eluting between 0.65M and 0.7M NaCl (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The possibility that <i>X</i>SMOC-1 and BMP2 bind to each other was discounted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>); when BMP2 was incubated with <i>X</i>SMOC-1 or <i>X</i>SMOC-1 EC, pre-bound to heparin-Sepharose, BMP2 was only present in the unbound fraction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; lanes 2 and 5) and did not co-elute with <i>X</i>SMOC-1 or <i>X</i>SMOC-1 EC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; lanes 3 and 6). The lack of interaction of SMOC with BMP2 agrees with an analogous finding observed for Pent and the <i>Drosophila</i> BMP, decapentaplegic (Dpp) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). This, combined with SMOC and BMP2 having similar heparin-binding affinities, suggests that <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC could compete with BMPs for HSPG binding on HEK293 cells and thereby increase BMP bioavailability."

BMP4-soaked beads represented a cellular source of BMPs and agarose gels (0.7%) containing heparan sulfate (HS) (10 \u03bcg/ml) represented an extracellular matrix (ECM) capable of binding SMOC and BMPs. Chamber slides containing BMP4-soaked beads embedded in the agarose/HS/<i>X</i>SMOC-1EC matrices were seeded with the stable reporter cell line C33A-2D2-09, harboring luciferase under the control of a BMP response element (BRE). After 24 hr, immunohistochemical analysis of cells in fields of view adjacent to the matrices showed many luciferase positive cells (59%) adjacent to the agarose-only gel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,D</a>), whereas when HS was present only a few (8%) were detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,E</a>). In contrast, when the matrix contained both HS and <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC, the number of BMP-responsive cells (64%) was similar to that observed in the absence of HS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,F</a>). The result showed that only a relatively small amount of BMP4 diffused through the HS-containing agarose gel, activating luciferase expression in only a few BMP-responsive cells. When <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC was present, sufficient BMP4 diffused through the HS-containing matrix to activate a greater number of cells. The assay demonstrated that binding of BMPs to HSPGs restricts their range of effect and that BMP diffusion can be enhanced by the binding of SMOC to HSPGs, effectively expanding the range of effect."

Animal caps, removed at stage nine from embryos co-injected with mCherry and/or SMOC mRNAs, were grafted onto the animal poles of BMP2 mRNA-injected embryos from which the caps had been removed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The conjugates were allowed to heal for two hours before the ectoderm from the entire animal half of the chimeric embryos was removed for immunostaining for phospho-Smad 1/5/8 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013F</a>). In non-injected controls, no pSmad signal was detected either in the host tissue or the mCherry mRNA-injected donor tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). When host embryos were injected with a high concentration of BMP2 mRNA (300 pg), pSmad signaling was observed throughout the host and donor graft tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Following a series of titration experiments we found that injection of 30 pg BMP2 mRNA at the two cell stage (15 pg into each blastomere) was sufficient to induce BMP signaling in the host tissue, while pSmad was observed only at a few cell diameters into the donor graft (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This amount of BMP2 mRNA was used in subsequent experiments\u00a0to test whether SMOC can extend the range of BMP signaling. Next, donor animal caps from embryos injected with different amounts of SMOC mRNA were grafted onto the animal poles of embryos injected with 30 pg BMP2 mRNA. Donor caps from embryos injected with a low amount of SMOC mRNA (10 pg) had an increased number of pSmad positive nuclei compared to non-SMOC injected caps (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Conversely, donor caps from embryos injected with a high amount of SMOC mRNA (300 pg) were devoid of pSmad (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The results demonstrate that, in an intact tissue, low concentrations of SMOC can promote diffusion of BMP from its source of synthesis, thereby extending its range of effect, whereas high SMOC concentrations inhibit BMP signaling. These data would be consistent with low levels of SMOC binding to HSPGs, but not inhibiting BMP signaling, and high amounts of SMOC both binding HSPGs and inhibiting BMP signaling. Closer examination of the host tissue surrounding the donor grafts expressing the highest level of SMOC showed BMP signaling was both absent in the graft and decreased in the BMP2-expressing ectoderm immediately adjacent to the SMOC expressing graft (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). This would be consistent with SMOC inhibiting BMP signaling within the graft and also diffusing into the immediate adjacent tissue at levels sufficient to inhibit BMP signaling."

During <i>Drosophila</i> wing development, while <i>dpp</i> expression is restricted to a stripe of medial cells in the wing disc, the morphogenetic gradient expands across the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nellen et al., 1996</a>). Long-range Dpp signaling in the wing has been shown to involve both <i>pent</i> and the cell membrane-anchored HSPG, <i>dally</i> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fujise et al., 2003</a>); the absence of either causes severe contraction of the range of Dpp signaling, and wing patterning defects (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). However, the mechanism by which Pent and Dally cooperate to expand the range of Dpp signaling is not clear. It has been speculated that the Pent/Dally interaction may reduce the affinity of Dpp for its receptor, Thickveins, leading to an increase in Dpp diffusion (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ben-Zvi et al., 2011</a>). However, the results we obtained from cell culture studies suggest that this is not the case. When <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC is added to HEK293 cells at 50 \u03bcg/ml, in serum-free media it will bind to the\u00a0many cell surface HSPG binding sites. Consequently, following the subsequent addition of BMP2, any impairment of BMP2/receptor affinity caused by SMOC/HSPG binding would result in a reduction of BMP signaling. Instead, a potentiation of BMP signaling was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Based on the expression patterns of <i>dpp, pent, and dally</i>, their known biological activities, and the new information presented here, we propose the following model (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>)."

Indeed, we showed previously that SMOC can diffuse across many cell diameters in <i>Xenopus</i> animal caps (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>). At the lateral border, Dpp signaling will be inhibited by a combination of the expression of <i>pent</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and the BMP repressor, <i>brinker</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Minami et al., 1999</a>). As Pent diffuses across the wing disc it will create a lateral-medial gradient and compete with Dpp for Dally binding. Dpp, diffusing in an opposing medial-lateral gradient, will encounter gradually increasing levels of Pent. At low levels, Pent will occupy some Dally binding sites, promoting further Dpp diffusion; at high levels, Pent will occupy many Dally binding sites and also inhibit Dpp signaling downstream of its receptor (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This model is supported by the observations made either in the absence of <i>pent</i> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>), or the absence of <i>dally</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fujise et al., 2003</a>), where there is a\u00a0contraction of the Dpp signaling gradient. In the absence of <i>pent</i>, medial-lateral diffusion of Dpp will be restricted by Dally because there is no Pent to compete for Dally binding sites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The resulting high level of medially localized Dpp signaling, indicated by Mad phosphorylation (pMad) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>), has been shown to induce expression of the inhibitory Smad, <i>daughters against dpp</i> (<i>dad</i>), promoting a negative feedback loop to limit the range of Dpp signaling (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tsuneizumi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ogiso et al., 2011</a>). In the absence of <i>dally</i>, Dpp diffusion will also be restricted as Dally-binding is required to establish both Dpp and Pent gradients (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</a>). Medially, <i>dally</i> mutant discs show abnormally high levels of pMad (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fujise et al., 2003</a>), which would promote a negative feedback loop in Dpp signaling similar to that observed in the absence of <i>pent</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Our proposed mode of action of Pent in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc is consistent with the role of glypicans in the \u2018restricted extracellular diffusion\u2019 model for establishing a Dpp signaling gradient (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwank et al., 2011</a>); the inclusion of the Pent/glypican interaction provides for further diffusion of Dpp to expand the morphogenetic field. During the review of this manuscript a study was published (<a href=\"#bib36\">Norman et al., 2016</a>) showing that binding of Pent to Dally in <i>Drosophila</i> induces endocytosis of the complex, effectively reducing the amount of Dally on cell surfaces. Although it remains to be determined whether binding of SMOC to HSPGs also induces endocytosis, this finding is consistent with the model we propose: both competitive binding of SMOC/Pent to HSPGs and removal of HSPG binding sites for BMP/Dpp by endocytosis would promote BMP/Dpp diffusion. This idea is further supported by the observation that removal of the heparin binding site within BMP4 has also been shown to promote the\u00a0BMP diffusion in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ohkawara et al., 2002</a>)."

The interaction of Wg with Dally is known to potentiate Wg binding to its receptor Frizzled (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tsuda et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lin and Perrimon, 1999</a>); therefore, the sequestration of Dally by Pent would be consistent with a reduction in Wg signaling. These data could also provide an explanation for our previous observation that SMOC activates MAPK signaling and inhibits BMP signaling via a mechanism requiring phosphorylation of Smad in the linker region (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>). Linker Smad phosphorylation at MAPK sites has been shown to be followed by phosphorylation at Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) sites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fuentealba et al., 2007</a>), resulting in Smad ubiquitination and degradation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sapkota et al., 2007</a>). As the activity of GSK3 is inhibited by Wnt signaling, a reduction in Wnt signaling by Pent/SMOC could potentiate GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of linker Smad."

SMOC-1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Okada et al., 2011</a>), the cartilage-specific BMP called growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Storm and Kingsley, 1996</a>) or cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-1 (CDMP-1) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 1994</a>), BMP2/4 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Francis-West et al., 1999</a>), and HSPGs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Koyama et al., 1995</a>) are all expressed at the sites of future joint interzones; the absence of any one of these results in dysmorphogenesis of autopod joints (<a href=\"#bib41\">Okada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rainger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Storm and Kingsley, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mundy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Thomas et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">1997</a>). Joint development in the digits occurs by segmentation of existing cartilage anlagen in regions where BMP signaling is inhibited by the BMP antagonist Chordin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Francis-West et al., 1999</a>) and, based on our studies, by SMOC. Once formed, the joint interzone acts as a signaling center to promote appositional growth of the opposing cartilage epipheses (<a href=\"#bib3\">Archer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ray et al., 2015</a>). Based on information from existing in vivo mutational analyses and the data presented here, we propose the following model for the role of SMOC in promoting joint formation and subsequent appositional epiphyseal growth (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). Within the interzone, Chordin and SMOC will both bind to HSPGs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klemen\u010di\u010d et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jasuja et al., 2004</a>) such as syndecan-3 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Koyama et al., 1995</a>), allowing diffusion of GDF5 and BMP2/4 into the epiphyses, where BMP signaling promotes chondrocyte proliferation and appositional epiphyseal growth (<a href=\"#bib10\">Francis-West et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ray et al., 2015</a>) via the BMP receptor BMPR1B (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baur et al., 2000</a>). This hypothesis is consistent with the skeletal and joint abnormalities observed in the absence of HS following conditional knockdown of the glycosyltransferase, Ext1, in joint interzones (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mundy et al., 2011</a>). Ext1 is essential for HS synthesis and binding of Chordin to HSPGs and is necessary for its BMP inhibitory activity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jasuja et al., 2004</a>). Consequently, in the absence of HS within the interzone, the BMP antagonist activity of Chordin will be reduced. While SMOC will still contribute to the inhibition of BMP signaling, the imbalance caused by the reduced Chordin activity is consistent with the increase in BMP signaling (pSmad) observed within the interzone in the absence of HS (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mundy et al., 2011</a>); as a result, in response to BMP signaling, the interzone cells undergo chondrogenesis and the joint does not form (synostosis). In the absence of SMOC, we predict that the increased availability of HSPG binding sites will restrict diffusion of GDF/BMPs out of the interzone. In addition, the imbalance in BMP inhibition within the interzone will lead to an increase in BMP signaling resulting in chondrogenesis and failure of joint formation. This hypothesis is supported by oligodactyly and joint synostosis observed in patients with Ophthalmo-Acromelic (Waardenburg Anophthalmia) Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib41\">Okada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rainger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abouzeid et al., 2011</a>)."

SMOC/Pent can inhibit BMP signaling locally, downstream of the BMP receptor, probably via the region containing the two Tg1-like domains. In addition, binding of SMOC/Pent to cell surface HSPGs via the C-terminal EC domain prevents BMP binding, promoting BMP diffusion, thereby expanding its morphogenetic field."

Prior to testes collection, male frogs were euthanized by anesthesia in a 2% solution of tricaine methane-sulphonate, a protocol approved by the ACUC. Frog embryos were manipulated using standard methods (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gurdon, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sive et al., 2000</a>) and euthanized by anesthesia when the required developmental stage was reached (the study was approved by the ACUC). Injection of mRNAs was performed by standard procedures as described previously (<a href=\"#bib32\">Moos et al., 1995</a>). Perturbations of axial patterning were quantified by Dorso-Anterior Index (DAI, (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kao and Elinson, 1988</a>)) and dark field images of embryos were photographed with low angle oblique illumination and a Zeiss Stemi-6 dissecting microscope. For animal cap assays, animal caps were removed from stage nine embryos and cultured in 0.7 x Marc\u2019s Modified Ringer\u2019s (MMR) solution (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sive et al., 2000</a>), 1 mg/ml BSA/50 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin until non-injected siblings reached stage 20. Where indicated, caps were incubated in 0.7 X MMR containing <i>X</i>SMOC-1, <i>X</i>SMOC-1\u2206EC, or <i>X</i>SMOC-1EC, at molar equivalent amounts, for different time periods."

Previously, the authors uncovered a role for Smoc in MAPK- dependent phosphorylation of the Smad linker, thus an indirect entry into the BMP signaling. However, data from vertebrates and <i>Drosophila</i> argue for a role for Smoc in modulating BMPs availability outside the cells. For example, the <i>Drosophila</i> Pent, appears to expand the range of BMP signaling and to promote signaling at a distance. In this manuscript, the authors test whether Smoc has dual activities onto the BMP signaling and address how different functional domains of Smoc inhibit BMP signaling at short-range while promoting long-range signaling. The authors take a biochemical approach and generate recombinant Smoc variants and refold biologically active proteins. Using these variants in multiple and creative experimental settings, they conclude that the EC domain of Smoc mediates its binding to glypicans and competes with BMPs for glypicans occupancy. From the data presented, it is less clear whether Smoc domain(s) could mediate glypican-independent inhibition of BMP signaling."

Using recombinant wt and truncated SMOC, Thomas et.al. demonstrate that the C-terminal heparin sulphate(HS)-binding domain is dispensable for cell fate conversion and SMOC-mediated repression of BMP signalling. In contrast, the SMOC HS-binding domain is sufficient to promote BMP signalling and to compete with BMP2 for heparin sepharose binding. Furthermore, the authors show that competition for HSPG-binding between BMP2 and the HS-binding domain of SMOC can result in increasing range of BMP2 signalling in a cell culture assay. Based on the finding that SMOC potentially competes with BMPs for HSPG binding, the authors suggest a model for SMOC/Pent function."

This might be done by implanting SMOC-soaked beads close to a BMP source and monitor the effect on BMP signalling range."

After two hours the entire animal hemispheres of the host/donor conjugates were fixed and immunostained for pSmad 1/5/8 to detect BMP signaling. mCherry was used to distinguish the SMOC-injected donor tissue from the BMP2-expressing host tissue. The use of ACs in this assay was supported by the observation that endogenous pSmad signaling is not present in stage 9 to 9.5 ACs (Faure et al., 2000, Development 127, 2917-2931). As background pSmad staining was absent in the control conjugates, cells positive for pSmad in the donor AC tissue would be indicative of diffusion of BMP from the surrounding host tissue."

It was found that injection of <i>Xenopus</i> embryos at the two cell stage with 30pg BMP2 mRNA was sufficient to obtain pSmad staining in the host tissue, but insufficient diffuse into the donor Wt caps after two hours. When higher amounts of BMP2 mRNA were used (300pg) pSmad was detected throughout the donor AC tissue, demonstrating that two hours was sufficient time for BMP to diffuse into the donor AC and induce pSmad. The ability of SMOC to extend the range of BMP signaling was tested by conjugating donor ACs from <i>Xenopus</i> embryos injected with different amounts SMOC mRNA to hosts injected with 30pg of BMP2. We found that much lower amounts of SMOC mRNA were required (10 to 30pg) than that used previously to inhibit BMP signaling (300pg). When high amounts of SMOC mRNA (300pg) were used, there was no pSmad staining in the donor AC or within the first few cell diameters of the adjacent host tissue, indicating BMP inhibition.
