In this study, we show in Drosophila S2 cells that amino-acid starvation also leads to the inhibition of another major anabolic pathway, the protein transport through the secretory pathway, and to the formation of a novel reversible non-membrane bound stress assembly, the Sec body that incorporates components of the ER exit sites. Sec body formation does not depend on membrane traffic in the early secretory pathway, yet requires both Sec23 and Sec24AB. Sec bodies have liquid droplet-like properties, and they act as a protective reservoir for ERES components to rebuild a functional secretory pathway after re-addition of amino-acids acting as a part of a survival mechanism. Taken together, we propose that the formation of these structures is a novel stress response mechanism to provide cell viability during and after nutrient stress."

In this study, we show in Drosophila S2 cells that amino-acid starvation also leads to the inhibition of another major anabolic pathway, the protein transport through the secretory pathway, and to the formation of a novel reversible non-membrane bound stress assembly, the Sec body that incorporates components of the ER exit sites. Sec body formation does not depend on membrane traffic in the early secretory pathway, yet requires both Sec23 and Sec24AB. Sec bodies have liquid droplet-like properties, and they act as a protective reservoir for ERES components to rebuild a functional secretory pathway after re-addition of amino-acids acting as a part of a survival mechanism. Taken together, we propose that the formation of these structures is a novel stress response mechanism to provide cell viability during and after nutrient stress."

Starving fruit fly cells of amino-acids causes the cells to form protective stress assemblies incorporating the proteins associated with the \u2018exit sites\u2019 that release proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. These assemblies are called Sec bodies, and when amino-acid starvation ends, these bodies release the exit site components unharmed. This allows the cell to quickly resume protein transport and so speeds the cell's recovery. If the Sec bodies do not form, the cells are more likely to die during amino-acid starvation."

In mammals, one third of the proteome encounters this pathway (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stevens and Arkin, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Almen et al., 2009</a>), such as the proteins delivered to the extracellular medium, the plasma membrane, or other cellular membrane compartments with the exception of mitochondria and the nucleus. After their synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum, proteins exit the ER at specialized ER exit sites (ERES) defined by a cup-shaped ER overlaying COPII-coated vesicles in which newly synthesized proteins are packaged. They then reach the Golgi apparatus where they are further modified, sorted, and dispatched to their correct final localization. The COPII coat assembly requires 6 proteins, including the transmembrane protein Sec12 that acts as a GEF for the small GTPase Sar1. GTP-bound Sar1 recruits Sec23/Sec24, the inner COPII coat that in turn recruits Sec13/31, the outer coat (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bard et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">d'Enfert et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Oka et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rothman and Wieland, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schekman and Orci, 1996</a>). In addition, the large hydrophilic protein Sec16 has been found to play a major role in the COPII assembly and regulation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ivan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hughes et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Connerly et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kung et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bharucha et al., 2013</a>) and Sec16 mutation or loss of function leads to a severe impairment in trafficking through the secretory pathway."

For instance, energy deprivation and osmotic shock also block secretion at the level of the ER exit and the cis Golgi, a response mostly triggered by impaired dynamics of the COPI coat, which mediates retrograde transport (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jamieson and Palade, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cluett et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lee and Linstedt, 1999</a>). Interestingly, GBF1, the GEF of Arf, the small GTPase required for COPI assembly, is phosphorylated and consequently inactivated by AMPK under conditions of nutrient starvation and energy depletion, leading to a block in secretion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miyamoto et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, biosynthesis of PI4P in yeast that was shown to play a key role in coordinating trafficking from the Golgi with cell growth seems to also be sensitive to nutrient conditions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Piao et al., 2012</a>). Last, ER stress that elicits the so-called \u2018unfolded protein response\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shamu et al., 1994</a>) directly impedes on the functional organization of ERES in Drosophila S2 cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kondylis et al., 2011</a>) and reduces COPII subunits assembly in human cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amodio et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, we have recently reported that serum starvation of Drosophila S2 cells also results in a distinct change in the ERES organization, namely Sec16 cytoplasmic dispersion away from ERES, in a conserved ERK7-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</a>) that leads to protein secretion inhibition."

Sec bodies do not represent terminal aggregates. They are reversible, act as a reservoir for ERES components to reconstruct a functional secretory pathway upon re-feeding and are critical for cell survival during stress and upon stress relief. Furthermore, they display properties similar to those of Stress Granules, which place them in the rapidly growing class of cytoplasmic mesoscale assemblies and more specifically, the category of liquid droplets."

In cells grown in Schneider's, Delta reaches the plasma membrane, whereas in KRB, it is retained intracellularly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Amino-acid starvation also results in the formation of novel Sec16-positive spherical structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition to Sec16, these structures also contain COPII subunits Sec23, the two Sec24 orthologs Sec24AB (CG1472, Hau) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Norum et al., 2010</a>) and Sec24CD (CG10882, Sten) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Forster et al., 2010</a>), and Sec31, and we therefore name them \u2018Sec bodies\u2019.

They are defined as non-membrane bound, spherical, reversible structures, the components of which diffuse easily within the droplet but are in slower exchange with the cytoplasm. Furthermore, liquid droplets are known to contain proteins that are prone to engage in weak protein\u2013RNA or protein\u2013protein interactions as their components display a high level of low complexity sequences (LCS, defined as regions of low amino-acid diversity) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kato et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 6\u2014Source data 1</a>).

We focused on Sec24AB as the LCSs are clustered to the first 415 amino-acids at the N-terminus (Sec24AB LCS) and compared their Sec body recruitment to this of its nonLCS region (aa 416\u20131184) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). LCS-sfGFP is largely recruited to ERES under normal growth conditions although not as efficiently as full-length Sec24AB. Under starvation conditions, it localizes to Sec bodies as full-length Sec24AB and seems to lead to their enlargement. This demonstrates that the LCS rich region of Sec24AB is sufficient to mediate recruitment to Sec bodies. Conversely, the nonLCS region is mostly cytoplasmic and remains largely so upon starvation, although a small pool is recruited to the Sec bodies. This shows that the LCS rich N-terminus region of Sec24AB plays a key role in recruitment of Sec24 to Sec bodies."

To do so, cells were depleted of endogenous Sec24AB (resulting in the formation of Sec16 positive smaller structures) followed by the expression of Sec24AB LCS. If this is sufficient, we expect that Sec bodies would form. However, although Sec24AB LCS is recruited to the smaller structures, Sec bodies did not significantly form (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This suggests that either the nonLCS region of Sec24AB participates to Sec body formation, even though on its own, it is only slightly recruited, or that one or multiple other factors are involved in driving Sec body formation."

When a fraction of such an assembly (GFP marked) is photobleached, the recovery is quick as the molecules within mix instantaneously. However, when entirely photobleached, the recovery is slower as the exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm is not as efficient. We used Sec16-sfGFP and GFP-Sec23 that are efficiently incorporated to Sec bodies. When Sec bodies are partially bleached, the recovery is very fast for both GFP-Sec23 and Sec16-sfGFP, and the maximum intensity is approximately 50% of the original one. After complete photobleaching, however, Sec bodies recover more slowly and only to 10% of the initial fluorescence intensity, showing an inefficient exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,A\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). This is comparable to FRAP properties of Stress Granules that are well-documented liquid droplets. When entirely bleached, Stress Granules recover more than Sec bodies and when partially bleached, they recover slightly less (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,B\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>. This indicates that the Sec23 and Sec16 diffuse more quickly within Sec bodies than FMR1 in Stress Granules, but that their phase transition barrier is higher."

The second is that in depleted cells, this level is not maintained upon starvation. Sec31 level is decreased instead of being stabilized as in mock-depleted cells. Sec23 behaves similarly to Sec31. In Sec24AB-depleted cells, however, its level is reduced even in cells incubated in full medium, suggesting that Sec23 turnover depends on the presence of Sec24AB. Altogether, this experiment suggests that starvation leads to ERES component stabilization that is inhibited when Sec bodies do not form.

To do so, we exploited the fact that only one of the two Sec24 proteins is required for Sec body formation. Indeed, Sec bodies do not form in starved Sec24AB-depleted cells, whereas they do in Sec24CD-depleted cells (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). As mentioned above, depletion of either of the Sec24 isoforms is effective but does not affect proliferation very much when cells are grown in normal medium (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, dashed lines and see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). However, upon amino-acid starvation, the number of Sec24AB-depleted cells decreases twice as much as the mock- (ds GFP) and Sec24CD-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, compare solid green to light blue, violet lines). As expected, the double depleted Sec24AB and CD cells also decline more quickly (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, solid orange line). When reverted to full medium, control and Sec24CD-depleted cells started to proliferate again, whereas the number of Sec24AB-depleted cells continues to diminish (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>)."

To test this, we monitored the transport of Delta to the plasma membrane of starved mock-, and Sec24AB-depleted cells upon re-feeding for 90 min (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Mock-depleted cells efficiently transport Delta whether starved or not (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Conversely, the efficiency of transport of Sec24AB-depleted cells after starvation is largely compromised, suggesting that formation of Sec bodies is critical for proper transport resumption. However, this result could simply be due to the depleted Sec24AB whose absence compromises transport even in cells kept in Schneider\u2019s."

As you will see, the reviewers felt that the discovery of a starvation induced Drosophila Sec body that sequesters core COPII components represents a significant advance that will be of interest to a broad cell biological audience. While the characterization of the Sec body is of high quality, the reviewers felt that the functional significance of this structure needs to be addressed more fully before the manuscript is suitable for publication. The reviewers have two suggestions for experiments that would address this concern. Both reviewers suggest an analysis of mutations in the Sec body component Sec24AB that selectively perturbs Sec body formation, such as in the disordered region of postulated to contribute to lipid droplet Sec body properties. Such selective mutations will test the model presented in the manuscript and could be used to more accurately assess Sec body function. In addition and/or alternatively, reviewer 2 suggests that more precise assays should be used to test your model that Sec bodies are required to re-build the secretory pathway during recovery from starvation."

To my mind, this is a significant discovery that adds insight into the relatively poorly understood mechanisms of regulation of ER export. The authors thoroughly investigate which components localize to large inclusions that accrue upon prolonged nutrient stress, identifying the core COPII coat components, Sec23/Sec24, Sec31 and Sec16 as both constituents of the structures and drivers of their formation. The timing of Sec body accumulation is monitored alongside autophagy events, which highlights an interesting property: Sec bodies appear after autophagy has declined, which is significant since COPII vesicles are now known to contribute directly to autophagosome formation. Hence, the timing of stress-related events would seem to involve a cascade of trafficking redirection followed by trafficking shutdown. This appealing model is supported by bioinformatic analysis of the COPII coat that identifies disordered regions that may contribute to \u201cliquid droplet\u201d properties of the COPII coat proteins themselves. The one experiment that I would suggest is to directly assess how one of these disordered regions contributes to inclusion formation: since Sec24AB is required for Sec body formation, deleting the disordered N-terminus should have a similar effect. This would be an elegant experiment since yeast experiments with N-terminally truncated Sec24 do not impact secretion in general (our unpublished data), supporting a regulatory role for this domain. In other respects, the study is solid, well-controlled and an exciting new discovery."

The strengths of the study are its careful characterization of this structure by high quality microscopy studies and the exclusion of a wide range of alternative possible structures.
