Around 335 BC, Aristotle noted that many animals grow larger and live longer if they have been castrated, which suggests that reproduction can reduce growth and survival (<a href=\"#bib4\">Leroi, 2014</a>). George C Williams formalized this concept in 1966, arguing that organisms are subject to \u2018trade-offs\u2019 between the energetic demands of reproduction and the energy required to survive (<a href=\"#bib9\">Williams, 1966</a>)."

However, the molecular mechanisms whereby reproduction affects metabolism remain poorly understood. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Irene Miguel-Aliaga at Imperial College London, Maria Dominguez at Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez and co-workers\u2014including Tobias Reiff as first author\u2014have used the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i> as a model to gain insights into the physiology of reproductive investment after mating (<a href=\"#bib5\">Reiff et al., 2015</a>)."

The midgut\u2014which has a similar role to the small intestine of mammals\u2014increases in size due to the division of \u2018progenitor\u2019 cells. Also, genes involved in the metabolism of lipids are up-regulated in enterocytes, which are the cells responsible for absorbing nutrients in the midgut. This remodeling of the midgut mirrors findings from mammals where internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract increase in size during reproduction, perhaps to enhance the uptake of nutrients (<a href=\"#bib8\">Speakman, 2008</a>). But what are the molecular mechanisms that underlie these profound changes in the fly?"

Several of these changes seem to occur because sex peptide increases the production of a hormone called juvenile hormone (<a href=\"#bib1\">Flatt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Yamamoto et al., 2013</a>)."

There is evidence that both sex peptide and juvenile hormone can influence many of these processes. Although sex peptide induces the production and release of juvenile hormone, it is not clear whether all the effects of sex peptide on the females are due to the release of this hormone. Reiff et al. add to this model by showing (highlighted in red) that remodeling of the midgut, increased lipid metabolism, egg production and other important changes in female flies depend upon juvenile hormone signaling, which increases after mating (<a href=\"#bib5\">Reiff et al., 2015</a>)."

By silencing the genes for these receptors (called <i>Met</i> and <i>gce</i>) in the midgut using a technique called RNA interference, Reiff et al. find that juvenile hormone signals directly to the cells of the midgut. This, in turn, stimulates the progenitor cells to divide and increases lipid metabolism in enterocytes. But how does the remodeling of the midgut impact on reproduction?"

Similarly, Reiff et al. show that female flies that have been genetically sterilized increase the size of their midgut and accumulate more fat after mating than virgin females. Remarkably, the same effect is observed when unmated sterile females are treated with a compound that mimics juvenile hormone. Thus, even when reproduction is abolished, juvenile hormone is sufficient to increase midgut size and fat storage."

Is altering lipid metabolism the only way that juvenile hormone enhances reproductive success? Does juvenile hormone signaling in the midgut affect immune responses and other juvenile hormone-dependent processes? Recent evidence suggests that juvenile hormone can alter gene expression and lifespan independently of its effects on reproduction (<a href=\"#bib10\">Yamamoto et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, is it possible to separate the negative effects of juvenile hormone on the body from the benefits to reproduction? And, does the degree of gut remodeling in response to mating vary between flies and populations of flies, or is it always the same?"
