As such, ecological interactions shape the stream of genetic information that flows forward in time, from generation to generation, and manifests itself as Darwinian evolution. Organisms move this genetic stream forward, with their success being measured by the number of successfully fledged grandchildren they have. However, organisms are not passive conduits for this information to flow through: rather, they are the FedEx employees of the genetic stream, finding new ways to make their deliveries to the next generation more successful by making them more timely, more reliable and more economical. And organisms must be successful and pass along their genetic material, otherwise the stream will evaporate and they will become extinct."

While humans have currently attained \u2018peak baby\u2019, with the number of children per woman now declining, it is probable that an additional three billion humans will be added to the world\u2019s population by the end of the century as a consequence of the age structure and reproductive potential of the existing population (<a href=\"#bib3\">Rosling, 2012</a>). Under such pressure from our resource-hungry species, it is hard to imagine that many of the other inhabitants of our planet will still be here unless they either directly feed, clothe, house or provide fuel for humans, or if they parasitize humans and the species we have domesticated."

Moreover, with on-going advances in genomic tools, biologists can argue more forcefully than ever before that Nature is indeed the Mother of Invention. However, we need to recognize the opportunities that are being opened up by new biological techniques and knowledge, and we must do our best not to squander these opportunities."

This biological legacy is a vast and unique library, and if we are not careful, we will end up burning it. The genomics revolution has fundamentally altered how we can exploit the genetic information in this library: it is as if we have replaced the genetic equivalent of a hard copy encyclopaedia with something like Wikipedia, which means that individual genes can now be moved and manipulated in a variety of innovative ways."
