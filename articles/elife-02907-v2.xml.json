                    "text": "Transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II is essential for gene expression during cell growth and differentiation. The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) stimulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating Pol II and antagonizing negative elongation factors. A reservoir of P-TEFb is sequestered in the inactive 7SK snRNP where 7SK snRNA and the La-related protein LARP7 are required for the integrity of this complex. Here, we show that P-TEFb activity is important for the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer progression. Decreased levels of LARP7 and 7SK snRNA redistribute P-TEFb to the transcriptionally active super elongation complex, resulting in P-TEFb activation and increased transcription of EMT transcription factors, including Slug, FOXC2, ZEB2, and Twist1, to promote breast cancer EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Our data provide the first demonstration that the transcription elongation machinery plays a key role in promoting breast cancer progression by directly controlling the expression of upstream EMT regulators."

The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) stimulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating Pol II and antagonizing negative elongation factors. A reservoir of P-TEFb is sequestered in the inactive 7SK snRNP where 7SK snRNA and the La-related protein LARP7 are required for the integrity of this complex. Here, we show that P-TEFb activity is important for the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer progression. Decreased levels of LARP7 and 7SK snRNA redistribute P-TEFb to the transcriptionally active super elongation complex, resulting in P-TEFb activation and increased transcription of EMT transcription factors, including Slug, FOXC2, ZEB2, and Twist1, to promote breast cancer EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Our data provide the first demonstration that the transcription elongation machinery plays a key role in promoting breast cancer progression by directly controlling the expression of upstream EMT regulators."

The start of the transcription process features two milestones. First, an enzyme called RNA Polymerase II starts the process. Shortly afterwards, however, the process pauses and only starts again when other proteins are recruited. This second step, called transcriptional elongation, is essential for gene expression in cells that are growing and specializing into specific cell types. However, it is unclear how important this second step is for the progression of human cancers, such as breast cancer."

However, some of the P-TEFb proteins in the cell's nucleus are unable to do this because they are held within a complex, which also contains an RNA molecule and some other proteins including one called LARP7.

This led to the increased expression of other proteins that switch other genes on or off, including genes that allow breast cancer cells to spread around the body. On the other hand, Ji et al. revealed that freeing the P-TEFb proteins from the complex in the nucleus did not appear to cause new tumors to develop or existing tumors to grow."

In eukaryotes, gene transcription is mainly performed by RNA polymerase (Pol) II and can be controlled at multiple stages including pre-initiation, initiation, elongation, and termination (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shilatifard et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sims et al., 2004</a>). Transcription elongation has recently been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. In Drosophila and human embryonic stem cells, a large number of genes involved in cell growth, renewal, and differentiation are found to be controlled at the elongation stage (<a href=\"#bib9\">Guenther et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Muse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, in mammalian cells, the transcription elongation machinery has also been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou and Yik, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Romano and Giordano, 2008</a>)."

The human positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) reverses this block and stimulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating the two negative elongation factors as well as the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of Pol II. These modification events antagonize the actions of the negative elongation factors and also promote co-transcriptional mRNA processing (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). P-TEFb is a heterodimer composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and its regulatory partner Cyclin T1 or T2 (CycT1 or T2). The activity of P-TEFb is stringently maintained in a functional equilibrium in cells to accommodate transcriptional demands for different biological activities (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou and Yik, 2006</a>). Three P-TEFb-containing complexes have been identified, including the inhibitory 7SK snRNP complex and two active transcription complexes: the Brd4-P-TEFb complex and the super elongation complex (SEC) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2013b</a>)."

Within 7SK snRNP, the 7SK snRNA serves as a central scaffold that coordinates key protein\u2013protein interactions and allows HEXIM1/2 to inhibit CDK9 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yik et al., 2003</a>). The La-related protein LARP7 binds to nearly all the nuclear 7SK snRNA via the 3\u2032-UUU-OH sequence and protects it against exonuclease cleavage (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Krueger et al., 2008</a>). Stable RNAi-mediated knockdown of LARP7 causes an almost complete depletion of 7SK snRNA, leading to disruption of 7SK snRNP and a shift of P-TEFb toward the active state (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2008</a>). Considering that the 7SK snRNP is the primary source of suppressed P-TEFb, the level of LARP7 directly affects the amount of active P-TEFb, thereby playing a key role in controlling P-TEFb activity."

In addition to Brd4, P-TEFb released from 7SK snRNP can also be recruited by a number of gene-specific transcription factors such as the HIV-1 Tat protein and the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins to form the multi-subunit SEC complex to specifically and efficiently activate their target genes (<a href=\"#bib13\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sobhian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2013a</a>)."

For example, several components of the P-TEFb-containing SEC, such as AFF1, AFF4, ELL1, AF9, and ENL, are all translocation partners of MLL and are important for MLL-based leukemogenesis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yokoyama et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Smith et al., 2011</a>). In addition, Brd4 has also been considered a promising therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of its ability to sustain P-TEFb-dependent <i>c-Myc</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blobel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zuber et al., 2011</a>). Finally, several lines of evidence have implicated the control of P-TEFb by the 7SK snRNP in human breast cancer. First of all, HEXIM1 has been proposed as an inhibitor of breast cell growth since its expression is downregulated by estrogens in breast tumors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wittmann et al., 2003</a>). Moreover, microsatellite instability (MSI)-induced frameshift mutations in the LARP7 gene have been detected in a significant population of gastric cancer samples, implicating a potential tumor suppressor role of LARP7 in cancers (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mori et al., 2002</a>). Consistent with this result, we have previously shown that LARP7 knockdown in the mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A disrupts cell polarity and blocks morphological differentiation when cultured in the three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (3D IrECM) (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2008</a>)."

In this study, we investigated the function of the P-TEFb functional equilibrium in controlling the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis of human breast cancer. By knocking down LARP7, we released P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP and stimulated the P-TEFb-dependent transcription of EMT-related genes, resulting in breast cancer EMT and enhanced invasion and metastasis. Our analyses have revealed a strong causative relationship between the invasive phenotypes of human breast cancer and P-TEFb activation by disrupting the 7SK snRNP. Our study has thus provided the first demonstration that the transcription elongation machinery and the P-TEFb network play critical roles in regulating tumor progression, EMT, and metastasis by directly controlling the expression of EMT/metastasis-related genes."

In two independent clinical data sets containing LARP7 information (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Finak et al., 2008</a>), LARP7 expression was markedly reduced in breast cancer tissues, especially in the invasive carcinoma, when compared with the matched normal tissues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Statistical analysis revealed that downregulation of LARP7 correlated with features of advanced cancer progression including estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor size, and metastasis (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In particular, higher LARP7 levels were observed in older (p=0.003) and ER-positive (p=0.002) patients, and lower LARP7 expression was shown in larger (p=0.012), poorly differentiated (p=0.05) and metastatic (p=0.001) tumors. More importantly, high levels of LARP7 were significantly associated with increased overall survival and recurrence-free survival (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, downregulation of LARP7 correlates with breast cancer progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis."

In normal mammary tissues, LARP7 was highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the mammary lobuli and terminal ducts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This high expression was also observed in DCIS samples, but significantly attenuated in the invasive ductal carcinoma samples. These data confirm that LARP7 protein levels are also reduced during breast cancer progression, and thus suggest that LARP7 may play a potential tumor suppressor role in breast cancer."

LARP7 was expressed at relatively high levels in the untransformed mammary epithelial cell lines (MCF10A and EpH4) and noninvasive breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474, T74D, and ZR75B), but was markedly reduced in all four invasive and metastatic cancer lines examined (MDA-MB-468, BT549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This reduction was partially due to a decrease in the LARP7 mRNA levels as shown by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with the demonstration that LARP7 is necessary for the integrity of the 7SK snRNA (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2008</a>), the reduced LARP7 expression in invasive breast cancer cell lines was accompanied by a decrease in 7SK snRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Meanwhile, phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD at Ser2 positions (pSer2) strongly increased in the invasive breast cancer cell lines, indicating an increase in the P-TEFb kinase activity. Since the variations in LARP7 expression did not affect the cellular levels of CDK9 and Cyclin T1, this increase in CDK9 kinase activity is likely due to the release of P-TEFb from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP as a result of reduced LARP7 and 7SK snRNA levels. Interestingly, HEXIM1 expression did not correlate with the malignant features of the breast cancer cell lines; it was moderately reduced in three invasive cancer lines and ZR75B non-invasive cancer line, but remained high in the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Taken together, these data suggest a model that LARP7 is downregulated in invasive human breast cancer cells, leading to a decrease in 7SK snRNA and subsequently 7SK snRNP. This results in release of P-TEFb from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP and an increase in the phosphorylation of the P-TEFb substrates. Thus, active P-TEFb appears to play a key role in promoting breast cancer progression."

The \u03942A mutant was originally found in microsatellite instable gastric cancer and contains a deletion of two adenosines from a microsatellite repeat of 8 A's (nucleotides 1206\u20131213) in the LARP7 C-terminal region, leading to a frameshift deletion of the C-terminal region of LARP7. As a result, the \u03942A mutant cannot bind to 7SK snRNP and fails to suppress P-TEFb activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2008</a>). The transfected cells were selected with puromycin and subjected to a colony formation assay. Interestingly, the LARP7-overexpressing cells formed significantly fewer colonies than those harboring the control vector (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), suggest that re-expression of LARP7 impairs survival of these metastatic breast cancer cells. In contrast, cells expressing the \u03942A mutant formed as many colonies as the vector control cells, suggesting that the ability of LARP7 to assemble 7SK snRNP and suppress P-TEFb is necessary for its tumor suppressor potential. Taken together, these data indicate that LARP7 likely suppresses the survival and progression of malignant breast cancer cells through 7SK snRNP-dependent inhibition of P-TEFb."

Here, we show that in noninvasive human breast cancer cells, disruption of this complex by knocking down LARP7 releases P-TEFb, redistributing it to the transcriptionally active SEC complex. This activation of P-TEFb promotes breast cancer EMT, invasion, cancer stem cell expansion, and metastasis by directly activating the expression of genes involved in EMT and metastasis. Thus, the sequestration of P-TEFb by 7SK snRNP is an effective anti-cancer mechanism, and the key 7SK snRNP component LARP7 is a potential tumor suppressor that specifically blocks breast cancer progression and metastasis. Our data highlight the importance of the transcription elongation machinery in regulating breast cancer EMT and metastasis and suggest a new therapeutic option to combat metastatic breast cancer through blocking P-TEFb activation. Currently, the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol is being evaluated in several phase I and II clinical trials for its anti-cancer effects either as a single agent or in combination with other drugs in treatment of esophageal cancer, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, endometrial carcinoma, recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and most relevantly, previously treated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (<a href=\"http://www.cancernetwork.com/review-article/current-clinical-trials-flavopiridol/page/0/2\">http://www.cancernetwork.com/review-article/current-clinical-trials-flavopiridol/page/0/2</a>).

                        "text": "LARP7 is a member of the LARP family that contains four La domain-containing RNA binding proteins (LARP1, 4, 6, and 7) with distinct RNA target preferences (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bayfield et al., 2010</a>). Among the four members, LARP7 is the only one that binds to 7SK snRNA and is involved in transcription elongation controlled by Pol II. The role of the LARP family proteins in human cancer is so far poorly known, and our study is the first demonstration that LARP7 functions as a potential suppressor of human breast cancer metastasis. This function of LARP7 is additionally supported by the observation that the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of LARP7, multisex-combs (MXC), also acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit cell growth (<a href=\"#bib33\">Remillieux-Leschelle et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, the C-terminal region of LARP7, which is essential for the sequestration of P-TEFb in 7SK snRNP, is required for LARP7's suppression of breast cancer survival and is frequently deleted in human gastric cancer (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mori et al., 2002</a>), suggesting that LARP7 may be a potential tumor suppressor in a broad range of human carcinomas. Finally, an inactivating mutation of LARP7 has been linked to a novel form of familial Primordial Dwarfism characterized by facial dysmorphism and intellectual disability (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alazami et al., 2012</a>). In these patients, the 7SK snRNA is depleted due to the defective LARP7, indicating that LARP7 and 7SK snRNA, through their ability to control P-TEFb activity, also regulate embryonic development. Although it is formally possible that the LARP7 KD may also affect other yet-to-be-identified pathways in a P-TEFb-independent manner, our observation that both flavopiridol and siCDK9s efficiently rescued the increased cell migration of LARP7 KD cells lends a strong support to the notion that the observed effects of LARP7 KD on EMT and invasion are indeed mediated by P-TEFb activation."

These four proteins are well known EMT transcription factors that function as decisive early drivers of EMT. While FOXC2 orchestrates the mesenchymal component of the EMT program (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mani et al., 2007</a>), Slug, ZEB2, and Twist1 repress E-cadherin expression, a fundamental event in EMT, as well as the expression of proteins of tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes, contributing to the de-differentiated state of tumor cells and facilitating EMT (<a href=\"#bib31\">Peinado et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sanchez-Tillo et al., 2012</a>). In addition, these proteins are also closely linked to breast cancer stem cell properties and implicated in resistance to drug and radio-therapies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Voulgari and Pintzas, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Singh and Settleman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hollier et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, these EMT early drivers also activate the expression of other EMT transcription factors. For example, Twist1 can induce Snail (<a href=\"#bib39\">Smit et al., 2009</a>), and Slug can upregulate Twist2 and ZEB1 expression (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wels et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). Thus, by directly activating the expression of these EMT early drivers, P-TEFb is capable of orchestrating the EMT program to drive malignant progression. Since P-TEFb and its associated factors are expressed in most cell types, it is possible that the ability of P-TEFb to promote tumor progression may not be restricted to breast cancer but also true for other malignant tumors. Indeed, the active P-TEFb-Brd4 complex has been linked to AML and CML (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dawson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mertz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zuber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Herrmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Winter et al., 2012</a>), while multiple SEC components are direct targets of MLL-fusion proteins that are linked to various forms of leukemia (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yokoyama et al., 2010</a>)."

The expression levels of two SEC components AF9 and ELL2 are also markedly upregulated, allowing more SEC formation. Since ELL2 is another key catalytic component of SEC besides P-TEFb, its increase is likely to further enhance transcriptional elongation of target genes. We found that the Brd4-P-TEFb complex was also increased moderately upon LARP7 KD (data not shown), suggesting the possibility that Brd4 may also play a role in facilitating the P-TEFb-dependent breast cancer progression."

Our data that P-TEFb and SEC are associated with the genes encoding decisive EMT regulators but not non-responsive genes suggest that the direct target EMT genes may contain sequences that display high affinity binding to the SEC-P-TEFb complex. For example, these genes may contain the recently discovered Super-Enhancers that render them highly sensitive to activation by the Mediator and the SEC (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hnisz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Loven et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Whyte et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, previous proteomic and biochemical analyses have identified the Mediator as a SEC binding partner through interaction between the Mediator subunit MED26 and the SEC components ELL-associated factor 1 (EAF1) and EAF2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Takahashi et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that the Mediator may recruit the SEC to target genes and the two complexes may act together to activate genes containing the Super-Enhancers. The SEC has also been linked to the elongating Pol II on chromatin template through interaction between the SEC components ENL/AF9 and the Pol II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) (<a href=\"#bib11\">He et al., 2011</a>). Finally, SEC may be recruited to its target promoters through tissue-specific and sequence-specific DNA binding partners, such as the HIV Tat protein in HIV-infected cells, MLL-fusion proteins in leukemia cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">He and Zhou, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Smith et al., 2011</a>) or retinoic acid receptor in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2011</a>). Besides the positive control exerted by P-TEFb and SEC, another possibility is that the EMT genes are strongly suppressed by negative transcription elongation factors DSIF and NELF, and thus are very sensitive to P-TEFb activation. Future studies will try to determine which of these mechanisms may be responsible for the heightened sensitivity of EMT transcription factors to the elongation control."

From there, the authors demonstrate that depletion of LARP7 in non-invasive breast cancer cells promotes an EMT-like phenotype, as shown by various cellular assays and molecular markers. Mechanistically, the authors show that LARP7 depletion leads to a redistribution of the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb from inactive to active nuclear complexes, concurrently with increased P-TEFb recruitment and RNAPII elongation at genes involved in EMT.

The studies were all carried out in cells and cell lines, not in cancer models. Thus the conclusion that LARP7 is a tumor suppressor is premature, it would be more conventionally characterized from this type of data as a 'potential tumor suppressor', especially in the absence of data that LARP mutations give rise to specific cancer types in mice and promote tumor growth or metastasis in tumor xenografts. The identification of some LARP7 mutations in some gastric cancers does not show causality. On this topic, the existing clinical trials that have evaluated flavopiridol for efficacy in metastatic solid tumors should be mentioned."

As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, these non-responsive genes do not show increased binding of P-TEFb, phosphorylated Pol II and ELL2. Thus, one mechanism underlying the selectivity of P-TEFb for the upstream EMT regulators over other Pol II-dependent genes is the more efficient or selective binding of the P-TEFb complex to the former. As for what factors determine the efficiency/selectivity of P-TEFb binding, it is one of the most actively researched questions in the field. Recruitment of P-TEFb to its target genes probably involves Brd4 via its bromodomain, or more likely in our case, the SEC complex via several possible mechanisms such as the Mediator bound to the newly discovered Super enhancers or the Pol II-associated PAF complex. Finally, certain genes that are strongly associated with negative elongation factors NELF and DSIF may become especially sensitive to P-TEFb activation. We have included a brief discussion of these possibilities in the Discussion."

The studies were all carried out in cells and cell lines, not in cancer models.
