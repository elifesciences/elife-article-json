This photo-induced Sph-driven calcium release requires the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1) residing on endosomes and lysosomes. Further, uncaging of Sph leads to the translocation of the autophagy-relevant transcription factor EB (TFEB) to the nucleus specifically after lysosomal calcium release. We confirm that Sph accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes of cells derived from Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) patients and demonstrate a greatly reduced calcium release upon Sph uncaging. We conclude that sphingosine is a positive regulator of calcium release from acidic stores and that understanding the interplay between Sph homeostasis, calcium signaling and autophagy will be crucial in developing new therapies for lipid storage disorders such as NPC."

This photo-induced Sph-driven calcium release requires the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1) residing on endosomes and lysosomes. Further, uncaging of Sph leads to the translocation of the autophagy-relevant transcription factor EB (TFEB) to the nucleus specifically after lysosomal calcium release. We confirm that Sph accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes of cells derived from Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) patients and demonstrate a greatly reduced calcium release upon Sph uncaging. We conclude that sphingosine is a positive regulator of calcium release from acidic stores and that understanding the interplay between Sph homeostasis, calcium signaling and autophagy will be crucial in developing new therapies for lipid storage disorders such as NPC."

Two proteins on the surface of lysosomes called TPC1 and TPC2 are believed to act as channels that can release calcium ions from lysosomes.

The next challenge is to find out exactly how sphingosine opens the calcium ion channels."

While Cer and S1P have been extensively studied and reviewed (<a href=\"#bib22\">Futerman and Hannun, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Spiegel and Milstien, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pyne and Pyne, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arana et al., 2010</a>), only limited information on the signaling mechanisms or cellular targets of Sph is available (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jefferson and Schulman, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Smith et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jarvis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chang et al., 2001</a>). In cells, Sph can be generated in lysosomes, the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as the Golgi complex by hydrolysis of Cer through the action of ceramidases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernardo et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hwang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sun et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Xu, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mao et al., 2001</a>). In a physiological context, Sph is reported to mediate cell growth arrest and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cuvillier, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>) and is involved in the pathophysiology of the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). In this progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is caused by mutations in the lysosomal proteins NPC1 or NPC2, Sph accumulates alongside other lipids such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids (<a href=\"#bib72\">te Vruchte et al., 2004</a>). Specifically, Sph storage is the first detectable biochemical change following inactivation of NPC1 leading to chronically lowered calcium concentration in the acidic compartment, as well as subsequent secondary lipid storage (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, the calcium release from acidic stores was recently monitored by a genetically encoded calcium indicator directly fused to endolysosomes which showed reduced calcium release from NPC patient cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shen et al., 2012</a>) in agreement with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>) but found that the calcium content in the lysosomes remains unchanged and that the calcium release is blocked by the accumulated lipids. This is in contrast to previous studies showing that the defect in calcium levels in NPC disease is likely due to a store filling defect and that intraluminal calcium levels were reduced using an intra-lysosomal calcium probe (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the interplay between calcium uptake and release from the endolysosomes and how this mechanism is deregulated in the NPC disease."

Second messengers such as <i>myo</i>-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) or cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) open well-characterized calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the muscle sarcomere, the main intracellular calcium store (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berridge et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fliegert et al., 2007</a>). The intraluminal calcium concentrations in the ER varies from 100\u2013800 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burdakov et al., 2005</a>). Since the endosomal/lysosomal system was identified as an important source of intracellular calcium (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haller et al., 1996</a>), the luminal calcium concentrations of acidic vesicles was determined to range between 400\u2013600 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#bib15\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>). The mechanisms responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>filling and release from these acidic stores are not yet fully understood. The main players involved in lysosomal calcium release and signaling are transient receptor potential (TRP) channels such as mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pryor et al., 2006</a>) and two two-pore channels (TPC1 and TPC2), which are thought to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels activated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), Mg<sup>2+</sup>or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brailoiu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ruas et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brailoiu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rybalchenko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pitt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pitt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jha et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ruas et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jentsch et al., 2015</a>). A very recent study showed that lysosomal calcium signaling regulates autophagy through the actions of the phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor EB (TFEB) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Medina et al., 2015</a>) which places the lysosome at the center of this very important signaling hub and underlines the importance of understanding the regulation of lysosomal calcium signaling."

Caged lipids are biologically inactive as long as they are covalently attached to certain photolabile groups (\u201ccage groups\u201d), which prevent recognition and metabolism inside cells. The active species is then released inside cells by short irradiation with a flash of light, which induces a cleavage reaction in the cage group (<a href=\"#bib30\">H\u00f6glinger et al., 2014</a>). In this manner, it is possible to rapidly elevate the intracellular concentration of the lipid with precise spatiotemporal resolution. It is currently difficult to know the physiological and spatial distribution of sphingosine generated under physiological conditions, particularly inside the lysosome where the majority of sphingosine is generated via the action of acidic ceramidases. This tool therefore provides a very useful system with which to probe sphingosine cell biology in greater detail."

We further pinpoint the endosomal/lysosomal channel TPC1 to be a main contributor to this response and demonstrate that Sph-induced calcium release leads to the nuclear translocation of TFEB. We also show that the calcium release in NPC patient cells is reduced while the Sph levels in the lysosomal compartments are increased. These findings will be helpful in elucidating the pathogenic cascade of NPC and will generally further our understanding of the function of the acidic compartments in calcium homeostasis."

                                "text": "Next, we checked whether the caged Sph was taken up by cells and if it was stable in the cellular environment. To this end, HeLa cells were incubated with 2 \u00b5M Sph-Cou for different times and subjected to +/- UV uncaging. In +UV cases, the whole dish of labelled cells was exposed to UV light from a mercury arc source for a comparably long time of 2 min to ensure complete uncaging of all cells. Cellular lipids were then extracted and coumarin-containing lipids were visualized by thin layer chromatographic analysis (TLC, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We showed that caged Sph was taken up by cells and that its photo-induced cleavage was successful inside the cells. This experiment also demonstrated that caged Sph did not participate in lipid metabolism during up to 60 min of incubation, as no additional fluorescent bands could be detected on the TLC plate. The drawback of this analysis was that only lipids equipped with a coumarin cage could be visualized via TLC. In order to gain a more accurate estimate of the uptake, stability, and successful uncaging of Sph-Cou as well as the negative control compound dhSph, we investigated control HeLa cells, Sph-Cou and dhSph-Cou treated HeLa cells by lipidomic analysis. <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> shows the relative amounts of Sph, S1P, dhSph and dhS1P detected in control, non-UV treated (caged) and UV-treated (uncaged) conditions for uncaging Sph-Cou as well as dhSph-Cou. The stability of the caged Sph (and caged dhSph) in the cells was confirmed because comparable levels of sphingoid bases were measured in control and caged conditions, indicating that no cleavage of the carbamate-linked cage group took place. Additionally, incubation with Sph-Cou or dhSph-Cou did not appear to perturb the long chain base homeostasis in the cells as all endogenous sphingoid bases showed similar concentrations compared to control conditions. Under the exaggerated illumination conditions used in the TLC and lipidomics experiments, Sph levels were found to increase 3.4 fold relative to control conditions in cells incubated with Sph-Cou, indicative of successful uncaging. This increase was specific for Sph and was not observed for dhSph (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). The levels of S1P also increased in UV-treated conditions, albeit only at a minute level (0.2% of Sph). We attributed this increase to ongoing metabolism during and after uncaging reaction. It seems that the long time of illumination as well as time for the following steps (collection of the cells and extraction of the lipids) was long enough for phosphorylation to occur on a very small fraction of Sph (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The negative control dhSph was also uncaged successfully, as indicated by a 13.9\u00a0fold increase of dhSph in uncaged cells compared to control (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). This greater increase is explained by the fact that the caged lipids were added at the same concentrations, even though the endogenous levels of dhSph are 5 to 8 fold lower compared to Sph (according to our mass spectrometric data). Finally, it is important to consider that the TLC and mass spectrometric experiments were performed to show that the uncaging reaction is successful in a cellular environment. They should not be interpreted as quantitative measures of the amount of released Sph. Very long illumination conditions were necessary to uncage enough cells so that these analyses were made possible. All following live-cell experiments were performed on a dual scanner confocal microscope with local uncaging of a subcellular area in the cell with simultaneous fluorescence recording. The uncaging area and uncaging times could therefore be kept to a minimum. In this manner, a greatly reduced release of Sph as well as minimal phosphorylation can be expected."

We performed uncaging experiments using a confocal microscope by recording Fluo-4 fluorescence before and after brief irradiation (3 s\u20136 s) of a local circular area (~9 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) within the cell. Cells reacted with an immediate (1\u20135 s), but transient increase in cytosolic calcium after uncaging either variant of caged Sph (Sph-Cou or Sph-NB, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). We calculated the mean calcium traces for each lipid and found a pronounced transient increase for both caged Sph variants, whereas the negative control compound dhSph-Cou gave no significant change in calcium levels under exactly the same delivery/uncaging conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), indicating that the signal was specifically due to sphingosine. To analyze single cell responses, we calculated the maximum amplitude of each calcium trace and visualized their distribution in a histogram (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). We defined individual cells with more than 20% increase over the average baseline fluorescence as responding cells. While all cells responded when Sph-Cou/+UV treated, less than 15% (4 out of 29 cells) responded under control conditions (dhSph-Cou/+UV). Moreover, under control conditions, the few responding cells gave rise to markedly reduced amplitudes."

We performed uncaging experiments in the presence of two inhibitors of the sphingosine kinases: <i>N,N</i>-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Edsall et al., 1998</a>) is a Sph analogue, which acts by competing for the binding of Sph. The second inhibitor, SKI-II acts as a mixed inhibitor of Sph and ATP binding (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lim et al., 2012</a>). When performing uncaging experiments in presence of these inhibitors, we found only slight differences of the calcium response compared to basal conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These differences might be explained by cell-to-cell variability as well as a general perturbation of the cells when using these inhibitors. We conclude that the observed calcium signals were caused by the rapid, photoinduced Sph release rather than S1P formation. Interestingly, external addition of free Sph to the medium of the cells did not evoke changes in calcium levels (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). The reasons for this are not fully resolved, but we speculate that Sph is more rapidly metabolized after entering cells than it is delivered. Sufficiently high doses of externally applied Sph (&gt; 5 \u00b5M) are then cytotoxic. The rapid increase in Sph after uncaging overcomes this problem and hence leads to calcium signaling. We also added free Sph prior to the uncaging experiment and found again no difference in the calcium response. (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>)."

The initial (5 s) calcium increase was the same as for control conditions, demonstrating that plasma membrane calcium channels were not initially involved in this response.

This likely accounts for the reduced amplitudes and response rates in PM block conditions."

In WT MEFs, uncaging of Sph led to an immediate cytosolic calcium increase in the same way as was observed in HeLa cells, indicating that this effect is not cell-type specific (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Due to the different morphology and size of the fibroblasts, the amplitudes of the calcium transients were less pronounced in MEFs than in HeLa cells, since the area of uncaging was kept identical. This prompted us to set the threshold for responders to 10% increase over baseline. TPC2 knockout MEFs also gave rise to calcium transients with comparable amplitudes. Employing TPC1 knockout fibroblasts, however, resulted in a large reduction of the mean calcium response. Under these conditions, only 6 of 25 cells exhibited amplitudes greater than the response threshold and even those were markedly decreased compared to WT conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a and b</a>). This striking effect shows the specificity of Sph-induced calcium release via the TPC1 channel. To confirm this, we also employed MEF from the TPC1/TPC2 double knockout mouse. Under these conditions, only 9 of 31 cells gave calcium signals with greater amplitudes than the threshold, much like in the TPC1-KO conditions. We conclude that there is a connection between an increase in cellular Sph and the release of calcium from the acidic compartments through the action of TPC1, which is known to be localized to early, recycling, and late endosomes as well as lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brailoiu et al., 2009</a>)."

We used a fibroblast cell line derived from a patient suffering from mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sun, 2000</a>). This disease is characterized by a loss-of-function mutation in the acidic store calcium channel TRPML1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bargal et al., 2000</a>). Again, control human fibroblasts gave an immediate calcium response upon release of Sph (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). MLIV patient fibroblasts also responded with an immediate and even higher calcium response suggesting that the observed effect is specific to TPC1 and that a loss of TRPML1 function does not interfere with Sph-induced calcium signaling. In fact, the loss of TRPML1 might even increase the importance of calcium efflux through TPCs as the only remaining way of maintaining acidic compartment calcium concentrations. Since two-pore channels are known to be critically involved in NAADP-dependent calcium signaling (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brailoiu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tugba Durlu-Kandilci et al., 2010</a>), we also tested the effect of a pharmacological antagonist of NAADP, Ned-19 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Naylor et al., 2009</a>), on Sph-induced calcium release in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Ned-19 treated HeLa cells did not exhibit a markedly different calcium response after Sph uncaging, which is in line with previous observations that TPC1 is unresponsive to Ned-19 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pitt et al., 2014</a>). Several questions still remain on the interface between Sph and TPC1. It is unclear if there is direct interaction or if there are additional, yet unidentified mediators in this response. Also, the interaction with other TPC1 ligands such as NAADP needs to be investigated."

We investigated Sph-dependent calcium signaling in this disease by performing uncaging experiments on human fibroblast cell lines derived from a healthy subject (control) and from a patient suffering from NPC1. Control cells reacted with an immediate increase in cytosolic calcium, showing again the broad applicability of these caged compounds across different cell types (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a and b</a>). In these cells, we also reduced the response threshold to 10% due to the size of the fibroblasts compared to HeLa cells. NPC1 patient cells have been shown to have reduced calcium levels in the acidic stores due to a store filling defect (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>). Using our setup, we could confirm that calcium transients in NPC1 cells after Sph uncaging exhibited significantly lower amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a and b</a>). This observation corroborated our finding that Sph releases calcium from lysosomes and is consistent with other studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>) showing that in NPC disease these vesicles are filled with less calcium compared to control.

This Sph analogue is equipped with two modifications on the hydrophobic tail: a photo-crosslinkable diaziridine moiety and a functionality that allows for click reactions, used for staining Sph in cells with a fluorophore after fixation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Using pacSph we could, for the first time, visualize the subcellular localization of Sph in individual control and NPC1 fibroblasts. After a short (10 min) pulse of 4 \u00b5M pacSph, it was localized in endosomal and lysosomal vesicles in both cell types (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>) as confirmed by co-localization studies with a LAMP1 antibody (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and quantification by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>).

This corresponds to the rapid efflux and transport of Sph to other cellular compartments for further metabolism (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</a>).

To test if Sph-induced calcium release also reproduces this effect, we performed uncaging experiments in HeLa cells overexpressing TFEB-GFP. Indeed, uncaging Sph and the subsequent calcium release (as monitored by the genetically encoded red calcium sensor, R-GECO (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>)) induced rapid translocation of TFEB-GFP to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>) in 14 out of 19 cells. This was not the case when calcium was released by directly uncaging caged calcium to a similar extent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). Only one in 11 cells showed a slight translocation of TFEB to the nucleus in the 15 min timeframe of the experiment. This further supports the findings that vital cellular signaling pathways are distinctly initiated on the lysosome surface. Medina et al. (<a href=\"#bib41\">Medina et al., 2015</a>) found the mucolipin channel TRPML1 to be involved in activating calcineurin and translocating TFEB, while our findings suggest a contribution of TPC1. This could suggest a certain redundancy in lysosomal calcium release and requires further attention. It can be speculated that reduced calcium levels in NPC patients might fail to properly regulatetranscription through TFEB and that the subsequent differences in lysosomal maintenance and autophagy couldcontribute to the NPC phenotype."

Thus, we interfered with sphingolipid metabolism minimally and were able to investigate resulting effects of elevated sphingosine levels. Dihydrosphingosine, although structurally very similar, served as a good negative control compound and underlined the high structural specificity of the interacting partners of Sph. We applied these tools to a variety of cell types, ranging from cultured HeLa cells to primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human patient fibroblasts and showed that in all those cells, an acute increase in Sph was always followed by an immediate release of calcium from GPN-sensitive acidic stores. We also showed that plasma membrane and ER calcium channels were not initially involved in this calcium response. Furthermore, we could pinpoint TPC1, an endosomal/lysosomal channel of the two-pore channel family to be essential in this newly found signaling pathway. When employing embryonic TPC1 knockout fibroblasts, no calcium increase upon uncaging of Sph was observed. TPC2 knockout fibroblasts, however, reacted similarly to WT fibroblasts, confirming the specific requirement of the TPC1 isoform for Sph induced calcium signaling. The involvement of the other main acidic compartment calcium channel TRPML1 was also tested. Loss-of-function in TRPML1 led to a slight increase in Sph-induced calcium release, which might be explained by some redundancy between TRPML1 and TPCs in the regulation of lysosomal calcium concentrations."

Our knowledge of the machinery involved and its regulation, however, remains incomplete. The two-pore channels (TPCs) are the subject of current controversies regarding ion selectivity and dependencies on activating ligands. While many reports agree that TPC channels are NAADP-regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brailoiu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brailoiu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pitt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Calcraft et al., 2009</a>), others indicate a broader ion specificity of TPCs (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rybalchenko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Peiter et al., 2005</a>) or alternative ligands such as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cang et al., 2013</a>).

A very recent study confirmed that TPCs conduct both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions and that they are activated by NAADP as well as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ruas et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jentsch et al., 2015</a>). The biological relevance of two-pore channels was recently highlighted by a report showing that TPCs are crucial to successful infection of host cells by the Ebola virus and that disruption of TPC function leads to halted virus trafficking (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sakurai et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, the progression of Ebola infection is also dependent on the NPC1 protein, which was shown to be necessary for viral escape from the lysosomal compartment <a href=\"#bib28\">(Herbert, et al., 2015</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">Carette, et al., 2011</a>). These recent findings will certainly encourage further efforts to understand the link between lysosomal calcium signaling and the defects in Niemann-Pick disease. In our study, we could confirm that NPC patient fibroblasts responded with lower amplitudes of the calcium transients after Sph uncaging, which is indicative of a reduced pool of calcium in the acidic compartments of these cells, in accordance with other studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shen et al., 2012</a>)."

NPC1 has been shown to be involved in the transport of amines (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kaufmann and Krise, 2008</a>), but conclusive data on the transport of Sph and other potential substrates are absent as there is no direct functional assay for NPC1. A study using radiolabelled sphingolipids to follow metabolism and transport in NPC disease concluded that Sph efflux from endolysosomes is not restricted in NPC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blom et al., 2012</a>). However, these data were obtained using long, 1\u20134 h chase times during which the precursor lipid was likely metabolized to a high degree and incorporated into other lipids, leaving only a small fraction of Sph for quantitative analysis. This and other obstacles to the study of lipids affirm the need for new tools, which circumvent the lipid metabolic machinery and give a faithful representation of the subcellular lipid localization. With our tools and shorter chase times in the range of 10\u201320 min, we observed reduced acidic compartment calcium release as well as increased Sph storage and a failure in Sph efflux in NPC disease cells."

TFEB was shown to up-regulate transcription of genes which support autophagosome formation and lysosomal biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Settembre et al., 2011</a>) and could therefore be a considered a novel target to promote lysosomal clearance in lipid storage and neurodegenerative disorders. TFEB overexpression has already been shown to be beneficial in attenuating the storage phenotype in several storage disorders such as Batten disease (<a href=\"#bib42\">Medina et al., 2011</a>) or Pompe disease (<a href=\"#bib63\">Spampanato et al., 2013</a>). Similar overexpression strategies showed promising results even in mouse models of more common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease (<a href=\"#bib18\">Decressac et al., 2013</a>), Alzheimer disease (<a href=\"#bib50\">Polito et al., 2014</a>) or Huntington disease (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tsunemi et al., 2012</a>).

Our results further highlight the importance of elucidating the interplay between lysosomal calcium signaling and Niemann-Pick type C disease. This interplay might also be important for the progression of diseases caused by Ebola or Marburg virus infection. Sph should be considered as a new and important player in this field and understanding the regulation of its signaling will likely further our understanding of these named diseases."

This is highly suggested by this study, but the study relies primarily on a 'pharmacologic' albeit novel and powerful approach using the delivery of caged sph. As such, the role of endogenous sph is not established. In this regard, the 3.5 fold increase in intracellular sph after uncaging may represent a supraphysiologic response (one reviewer was not aware of physiologic conditions where intracellular sph increases by that much). The study would be much stronger if there were ANY additional results to implicate endogenous sph in this mechanism and this pathway."

The present manuscript makes an interesting and potentially important observation that SPH releases calcium from endolysosomes via the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1). The authors developed photoactivatable SPH, caged sph, which was taken up by cells and was converted to free SPH upon photoactivation. This allowed the authors to study how free SPH transiently activates the release of calcium from different cellular compartments. The authors provide evidence that free SPH on its own, not through its metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate, can induce the release of calcium to the cytosol from intracellular calcium stores. More importantly, the authors demonstrate that the calcium release is specific to SPH but not to its naturally occurring analogue dihydrosphingosine that differs from SPH by a single double bond. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism by which SPH mediates biological responses."

In the Introduction, the authors refer to a study where Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> store was reduced in NPC but in that study (Shen; 2012), lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content was unchanged and rather lipid accumulation was proposed to block Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through TRPML.

Because the subject is calcium release, the reviewers (and also the readers) expect to see an effect similar to IP<sub>3</sub>-induced calcium release from the ER. We believe that the effect of Sph on intralysosomal calcium levels is more subtle yet not less important. As our results on monitoring TFEB translocation clearly demonstrate, simple elevation of intracellular calcium by uncaging calcium does not induce translocation. The major effect of Sph on calcium homeostasis therefore is not likely to be the cytosolic calcium increase, but rather the emptying of the lysosomal compartment. Consequently, chronically elevated levels of Sph in NPC cells are responsible for lowered lysosomal calcium levels due to their effect on TPC1 channels. The physiological role is therefore only observable in a pathologic situation. We do NOT demonstrate a classical second messenger system where physiological Sph levels are elevated rapidly and a rapid response results."

In the live cell microscopy experiments, we illuminate only a region of 9 \u00b5m2 within a single cell for 3 sec, before we start monitoring cytosolic calcium levels in the entire cell.

Measuring lysosomal calcium directly in living cells is complicated by the fact that all calcium sensors are strongly pH-dependent. Ideally, we would generate a new construct of TPC1 fused to an extralysosomal calcium indicator such as a genetically-encoded calcium indicator.

It simply served to show that Sph was not released until illumination and that \u201cendogenous\u201d Sph was released. Nevertheless, we tried to measure intracellular Sph levels after addition of exogenous Sph as suggested. However, this is quite challenging as most of the exogenous Sph simply associates with the PM and cannot be washed away. This has been previously seen by the Riezman lab when radiolabeling cells using 3H-sphinganine. This rapid cell association leads to overestimation of the \u201cinternal\u201d Sph levels. A crude estimate of how much Sph was taken up by the cells can be gained from measuring S1P-levels, which increased quite slowly in a time-dependent manner (much slower than the calcium signal happens after uncaging Sph, see inserts). We are aware that a quantification of Sph after addition to cells is not useful because excess Sph cannot be washed away. Due to these complications, we decided not to include the data in the manuscript, but we add it for the reviewers only."

Since TPC1 expression levels are quite low and any potential interaction could easily be missed in such a complex experiment, we tried crosslinking on lysosomal purifications and detection by Western Blot. Unfortunately, we could not reliably detect any such interaction. We also tried to overexpress a new TPC1-FLAG construct followed by crosslinking with pacSph. Again, Western Blot experiments were not successful with this construct. We are now considering the possibility that Sph, analogous to NAADP, exerts its function on TPC1 via an adaptor protein. The search for such proteins will unfortunately exceed the scope of this manuscript (as mentioned by the reviewers).
