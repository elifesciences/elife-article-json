We designed selections for recombination between co-resident mitochondrial genomes in various heteroplasmic <i>Drosophila</i> lines. In four experimental settings, recombinant genomes became the sole or dominant genome in the progeny. Thus, selection uncovers occurrence of homologous recombination in <i>Drosophila</i> mtDNA and documents its functional benefit. Double-strand breaks enhanced recombination in the germline and revealed somatic recombination. When the recombination partner was a diverged <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> genome or a genome from a different species such as <i>Drosophila yakuba</i>, sequencing revealed long continuous stretches of exchange. In addition, the distribution of sequence polymorphisms in recombinants allowed us to map a selected trait to a particular region in the <i>Drosophila</i> mitochondrial genome. Thus, recombination can be harnessed to dissect function and evolution of mitochondrial genome."

Most of the information stored in the DNA is stored in duplicate, with one copy inherited from the individual's mother via the egg, and the other from the father via the sperm. This duplicate storage allows a very important damage repair process to occur, where undamaged sequences in one copy can be used to repair damage in the other. This process of homologous repair uses mechanisms that are also used in another important genetic process. When sperm and egg cells are formed, the parental DNA goes through a process called homologous recombination, in which DNA molecules are cut and reassembled into new arrangements. This recombination process \u2018shuffles\u2019 genetic combinations, making every individual unique\u2014a process of great evolutionary importance that allows natural selection to act on distinct traits."

One experiment tracked how a mutation that makes flies less healthy at high temperatures spread as flies were bred for several generations. When the mutation was associated with a mitochondrial genome that had a strong drive towards replication, the mutation became more widespread over time, and in most cases, this eventually resulted in the mutation killing the flies. In rare cases, however, a few flies survived, giving rise to a healthy population. Molecular analyses revealed that, in these survivors, the defective genome had recombined with the other mitochondrial DNA to produce a new genome that lacked the mutation but retained the high replicative drive. This new recombinant genome worked normally and was able to resist the spread of the defective genomes."

In addition to removing a restriction site, these selected changes often also alter an encoded gene product (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). One of the variants that lost a XhoI site is a temperature-sensitive lethal mutation of <i>mt:CoI</i> that can be counter-selected at high temperature (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hill et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, one can transfer cytoplasm between early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos of different mitochondrial genotypes to create heteroplasmic lines that carry both the recipient and donor genomes for multiple generations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Matsuura et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). In addition to these tools, characterization of diverged mitochondrial genomes has revealed marked differences in their abilities to compete for transmission when combined in heteroplasmic combinations, a feature that we have been able to use as another selectable trait.

Each of the genomes of this heteroplasmic line has a defect complemented by the other so that the line is healthy but neither genomes is lost, a balancing selection (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). Recombination should produce wild-type genomes distinguished by the presence of both restriction sites and consequent production of a \u223c1.6-kb fragment upon cutting with both BglII and XhoI. Even after maintenance of this line for more than 60 generations, this 1.6 kb band was not detected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

To give recombinant genomes an advantage, we produced a heteroplasmic line wherein one genome was compromised by a temperature-sensitive mutation and the other was compromised in its ability to compete for transmission. A temperature-sensitive genome with two mutations, <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup>, was introduced into a strain with a genome named <i>ATP6[1]</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Celotto et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2011</a>). High temperature, 29\u00b0C, selected against the <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup> allele, and in previously analyzed heteroplasmic lines where the partner genome was a closely related wild-type genome, this selection resulted in a multi-generational decline of the temperature-sensitive genome and its eventual elimination (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). To our surprise, when in competition with the <i>ATP6[1]</i> genome, which is distinguished by numerous sequence polymorphisms and a shorter AT-rich region, the temperature-sensitive genome displaced the <i>ATP6[1]</i> genome over a few generations at 29\u00b0C, even though the flies homoplasmic for <i>ATP6[1]</i> are relatively healthy and apparently more robust than <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup> flies at both temperatures. The decline of <i>ATP6[1]</i> leaves the temperature-sensitive genome without complementing <i>mt:CoI</i> activity, and the entire population dies after several generations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

To do this, we made a heteroplasmic line containing the wild-type genome and the temperature-sensitive double-mutant <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup>, and used expression of restriction enzyme to select against wild-type genome and used the temperature-dependent selection against the double mutant. When we expressed mito-BglII in the germline while keeping the flies at 29\u00b0C, about 14.6% of the F1 females were viable and fertile (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). PCR analysis and restriction digestion showed that the progeny had lost the wild-type allele of <i>mt:ND2</i>, which was targeted by the restriction enzyme, but they were heteroplasmic for a new <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> genome and the double-mutant parental <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup> genome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Apparently, the wild-type mtDNA was cut and homologous repair or exchange using the mutant <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> sequence led to loss of the site. Initially, the abundance of the newly generated <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> genome was very low in all the progeny (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), probably because only a small fraction of the wild-type genomes underwent homologous exchange. However, because a low level of the recombinant genome is sufficient to rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup>, this low level of recombinant genome supported production of fertile heteroplasmic flies. Since the more functional <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> genome has a selective advantage at 29\u00b0C, its abundance increased over subsequent generations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and in some lineages, the <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup> genome was completely eliminated after 18 generations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>)."

To achieve this, we examined recombination between the diverged mitochondrial genomes of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>Drosophila yakuba</i>. We made a heteroplasmic <i>D. melanogaster</i> line in which the <i>D. yakuba</i> mtDNA is sensitive to BglII and the <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome is sensitive to XhoI (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Within the coding sequences, the <i>D. yakuba</i> genome shared about 93% sequence identity with <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup>, while the non-coding AT-rich sequence was highly diverged and reduced to about 1 kb in length. We introduced DSBs into both genomes by germline expression of mito-BglII and mito-XhoI and found that about 10% of the females were fertile. Progeny homoplasmic for recombinant genomes were recovered. All propagating recombinants contained the AT-rich region of the <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome (assessed by Southern analysis, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which we expected because <i>D. melanogaster</i> genomes outcompete <i>D. yakuba</i> genomes very quickly when co-resident (H Ma and PH O'Farrell, unpublished). We characterized the mitochondrial genomes of three progeny lines by PCR and standard sequencing. All the recombinant genomes had one crossover point very close to but upstream of the XhoI site of the <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> genome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). A second crossover is considerably downstream: in two of the recombinants, the other crossover occurred between markers at mt3124 and 3184, and between markers at mt3379 and 3445. In the third case, the other crossover is further downstream and we obtained mixed sequencing signals for a region between mt5524 and mt6291 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Flies were likely to be heteroplasmic for that particular region as if multiple recombinants are carried in this line. Based on these recombinants, we concluded that homology-based repair of DSBs promoted exchange of a substantial uninterrupted stretch of sequence. We also note that there were no discontinuities in the mapped region of exchange as might occur if repair randomly converted mismatches in heteroduplex in one direction or the other (see below for more discussion)."

In contrast, some of the more thoroughly characterized homology-dependent mechanisms such as those catalyzed by RecB-C and RecF require significantly greater homology (23\u201327 bp and 44\u201390 bp, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shen and Huang, 1986</a>).

It is not clear whether both exchanges occur at the same time: since the genomes are circular, some types of exchange will produce a dimer circle that might resolve by an intramolecular recombination event at a later time. Our finding that one of our recombinant lines carried more than one recombinant genome with a common point of exchange near the XhoI cleavage site but different downstream points of exchange is consistent with this possibility. If separated in time, propagation of the unresolved product of the first recombination could give a population of molecules and independent resolution events could give a mixed population. While these analyses give us only a limited perspective on the mechanism of recombination, it is notable that the abundant SNPs suggest that each of the characterized events involved exchange of a substantial segment without interruptions (at least 1 kb), rather than restricted local repair."

In homoplasmic flies, accurate repair using sibling molecules will leave no trace. Only misaligned intra-molecular recombination between repeats would give a clear signature.

In <i>Drosophila</i>, mtDNA varies in size from 16 to 20 kb (<a href=\"#bib45\">Solignac et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Townsend and Rand, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rand, 2011</a>), mainly due to the variation in the length of the noncoding region, which contains two types of tandemly repeated elements (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lewis et al., 1994</a>). Rand has shown that spontaneous changes in length in populations as if repeats can come and go at a relatively rapid pace (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rand, 2011</a>). While accurate repair using sibling molecules is likely to be the main purpose of mitochondrial recombination, more rare non-allelic events can have a major impact on the production of variants, and exchanges between distinctly marked genomes, as reported here, provide a means to characterize the process."

However, animal mtDNA is restricted in the types of exchange that can occur because uniparental inheritance prevents intermingling of genomes. The mitochondrial genome of each female is sheltered from encounters with foreign genomes and will be passed on in an isolated lineage or clone. Genetic exchange between distantly related genomes might occur as a result of occasional paternal transmission that introduces a foreign genome (e.g., <a href=\"#bib24\">Kraytsberg, 2004</a>), but the significance of such violations of uniparental inheritance are matters of an ongoing debate. For the most part, the integrity of mitochondrial haplotypes suggests that the contribution of exchange among distantly related genomes is relatively small (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elson et al., 2001</a>)."

It has become increasingly apparent that organisms can carry more than one mitochondrial genotype, that is, they are naturally heteroplasmic because of new mutations, stably transmitting heteroplamic combinations, or a breakdown of uniparental inheritance (<a href=\"#bib44\">Solignac et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ladoukakis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsang and Lemire, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Payne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ye et al., 2014</a>). In this sense, the situation we created by introducing the temperature-sensitive genome into the <i>ATP6[1]</i> line, might be a model for things that can happen naturally. Emergence of a new genome with strong selfish drive, but with a defect in function, or introduction of such genome from another lineage will create a natural situation analogous to our experiment. The outcome of our experimental manipulation shows that this situation has generally detrimental consequences. Indeed, the temperature-sensitive mutation together with the drive advantage created a sort of \u2018population time bomb\u2019: the lineage remained healthy for multiple generations allowing the population to expand greatly, and then it collapsed upon elimination of the functional mt genome. Even rare recombination can uncouple a positively selected drive mutation from detrimental mutations, and as in our experiment, selection can then restore health. Thus, even occasional genetic exchange would prevent rogue genomes from wiping out lineages."

Initially, in order to make a <i>D. melanogaster</i> line with the wild-type <i>D. yakuba</i> mitochondrial genome, cytoplasm from <i>D. yakuba</i> embryos was transplanted into the temperature lethal mutant (<i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup>) embryos, and eclosed adults were kept at 29\u00b0C to select for flies with the <i>D. yakuba</i> genome. By doing this, two independent lines were established and both stably transmitted <i>D. yakuba</i> mitochondrial genome (3\u20134%) from generation to generation at 29\u00b0C. Secondly, a mitochondrially targeted restriction enzyme, mito-PstI, was expressed in the germline mitochondria of the two heteroplasmic lines to eliminate the <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup> + <i>mt:CoI</i><sup><i>T300I</i></sup> genome, as PstI site was only present in the <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome. Through this, several lines with only wild-type <i>D. yakuba</i> mtDNA were established. Surprisingly, <i>D. melanogaster</i> flies homoplasmic for <i>D. yakuba</i> mtDNA were as healthy as wild-type flies at both 22\u00b0C and 29\u00b0C. Similar to the <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome, wild-type <i>D. yakuba</i> mtDNA has one BglII site and one XhoI site. The BglII site is located in the same place as in <i>D. melanogaster's</i> genome (mt:ND2), whereas the XhoI site, unlike the <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome (which is in the mt:CoI coding region), is located in the mt:ND1 coding region further downstream. Thirdly, expression of mito-XhoI enzyme in the germline of flies with the wild-type <i>D. yakuba</i> genome was used to select a mutant derivative with an allele <i>mt:ND1</i><sup><i>R274W</i></sup> that removed the XhoI site. This led to a line that is sensitive to BglII cut but not to XhoI. Finally, this line was then used as a recipient for making the <i>mt:ND2</i><sup><i>del1</i></sup><i>/mt:ND1</i><sup><i>R274W</i></sup> heteroplasmic line."

The reviewers also unanimously agreed that the development of a system that overcomes the existing mtDNA haplotype \u201cbarrier\u201d represents a significant advance in the field. However, the mechanistic basis of the genetic exchange observed was not sufficiently elucidated. In addition, the reviewers noted that the genetic exchange events observed in the studies were rare and the frequency of such events was only observed under conditions of strong selection, raising the concern that the system does not inform the mechanism of native events. On a related note, the reviewers also noted that that most of the recombination observations reported in the manuscript have been previously published, which was not adequately acknowledged. Given these points, it was decided that the advance lies in the development of a workable system for studying mtDNA genetic exchange, which could be used, for example, to map regions that are causative of disease in an animal by the community. As such, the consensus was to ask the authors to revise their study as a \u201cTools and Resources\u201d manuscript."

Biol. Evol., 28: 1847-1859), at a very low rate. On a related note, the reviewers also request that the Discussion be revised, specifically to eliminate overstatements of significance. The reviewers noted that a significant fraction of the Discussion was dedicated to a potential explanatory mechanism of exchange that may not actually be occurring in a native system as the double-strand break model engineered with restriction enzymes is highly artificial, and may not actually be analogous to the natural mechanism."

Recombination has been studied for decades by selection for recombinant genotypes and in many circumstances the events are rare (e.g. somatic recombination leading to loss of heterozygosity and cancer progression is fortunately particularly rare). For reasons that are not clear to us, our application of a genetic approach raises a heretofore never mentioned concern \u201cthat the system does not inform the mechanism of native events\u201d. Is this an indictment of the field of genetics or just our work? We fail to understand the logic. Neither rarity nor detection by genetic selection should disqualify recombination from being a natural event. Recombination is often a rare event, but nonetheless has profound consequences and is thought to be an essential to avoid genomic deterioration by \u201cMuller\u2019s ratchet\u201d (<a href=\"#bib35\">Muller, 1932</a>). Furthermore, selection is usually thought to act on pre-existing events, which should qualify as natural, after all Darwin called it natural selection. Nonetheless, the possibility that stress would induce recombination is real, but it adds to, rather than diminishes, the biological impact of the process. Recombination among fully functional genomes can generate non-allelic events that cause mutageneic rearrangements, so it might be something to avoid in the absence of problems. In contrast, recombination can restore function to genomes with distinct defects and so might be productively induced under circumstances of insufficient function or DNA damage. We consider this further below in responding to a specific comment in the review."

This is what is reported in the manuscript. Like recombination, gene conversion has a genetic definition: when the products of meiosis reveal allele frequencies that are inconsistent with Mendel\u2019s rules, one allele is said to be converted to another. Gene conversion represents a type of recombination, i.e. nonparental combinations of alleles are found in progeny. For example, Chen et al. (Nature, 2007) state: \u2018In eukaryotes, gene conversion constitutes the main form of homologous recombination that is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks.\u2019 Additionally, according to Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition (Bruce Alberts et al): \u2018In the process of gene conversion, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a> sequence information is transferred from one DNA helix that remains unchanged (a donor sequence) to another DNA helix whose sequence is altered (an acceptor sequence). There are several different ways this might happen, all of which involve the following two processes: (1) a homologous recombination event that juxtaposes two homologous DNA double helices, and (2) a limited amount of localized DNA synthesis, which is necessary to create an extra copy of one <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4800/\">allele</a>.\u2019 The fact that recombination is a term that encompasses gene conversion is nicely highlighted by the fact that Robin Holliday\u2019s presentation of his model for recombination (1964 Genet. Res., 5, pp. 282\u2013304) was entitled \u201cA mechanism for gene conversion in fungi\u201d. We thus do not agree with the reviewers\u2019 concern about revising the title."

Homologous recombination refers to events in which the products are joined in regions of homology. The precise allelic junctions in the multiple recombinants isolated show that these recombinants are the result of homology directed exchange. We believe that this is clear. If the issue is that we have not defined the detailed enzymology and mechanism, we agree, but do point out that in those systems where recombination has been studied for decades, mechanisms were worked out over many years by many laboratories, and still recent work is refining our views of mechanism in even the most studied systems. Additionally, we emphasize that recombination is not defined by a unique mechanism. Indeed, it occurs by multiple mechanisms. For example, bacteriophage Lambda recombination, which is one of the pillars of modern genetic engineering by recombination, recombineering (e.g. Pines et al., 2015), does not use the same mechanism as <i>E. coli</i> RecA mediated recombination. Lambda relies heavily on a processive exonuclease that produces extended tracks of single stranded DNA that interact, while RecA mediates pairing between duplex molecules. We argue that we have made unprecedented advances in documenting and characterizing animal mitochondrial recombination and acknowledge that the system is in its infancy and there is still more to learn."

This focus on gene conversion appears to be based on misunderstanding that gene conversion is a mechanism. As mentioned above, gene conversion is defined by change of one allele into another, and it can occur by multiple mechanisms. For example, translation of Holliday junction results in heteroduplex formation with mismatches at points of sequence discordance: Mismatch repair can rectify the mismatches, most frequently by excision and repair, resulting in the loss of one allele (Holliday, 1964). Alternatively, in double-strand break induced recombination, heteroduplex can also be produced in other ways and similarly be repaired by mismatch repair mechanisms (Kobayashi, 1992). Additionally, a synthesis dependent strand annealing mechanism (McMahill et al., 2007) provides yet another mechanism\u2019s generating heteroduplex. In sum, gene conversion is not defined by mechanism, and there exist multiple mechanisms leading to conversion. Furthermore, the mechanisms do not have a simple one to one relationship with genetic outcomes, with one producing recombination and the other gene conversion. Importantly, all events leading to recombinant genomes are appropriately referred to as recombination. In reviewing our text, we realized that in several places we unintentionally suggested the dichotomy between recombination and gene conversion that we now challenge. We have re-written several paragraphs and changed a section subtitle in the Discussion to avoid this."

For this reason, we do not feel that the suggested analysis would be valid. Nonetheless, it is true that the commonly studied forms of gene conversion have relatively short track lengths and we have considered whether our results are congruent with other cases of gene. The mean tract length for meiotic gene conversation has been estimated by several experimental studies for organisms including yeast, human and <i>Drosophila</i> to be in the range of 350-2000bp (Padhukasahasram and Rannala, 2013, Chen et al, 2007). In <i>Drosophila</i>, it is estimated to be \u223c352bp (Hilliker et al., 1994). The recombinants we isolated between <i>D. mel</i> and <i>D. yak</i> all involve at least 1kb of continuous exchange. Furthermore, the recombinant we isolated between the temperature sensitive mutant and <i>ATP6[1]</i> showing exchange of a continuous 7.5kb fragment, which is well above the mean tract length of nuclear meiotic gene conversion (using the data and model of Hilliker et al., 1994 for meiotic nuclear events, the probability of a gene conversion track of this length would be less than 10<sup>-9</sup>). More recently, by following more lines heteroplasmic for <i>ATP6[1]</i> and temperature sensitive genomes, we recovered two more recombinants (this finding and sequence data have been added to the manuscript as part of <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), both involved exchange of a long stretch of continuous sequence (5-12kb), again well outside of the range characteristic of most gene conversion systems. However, since different mechanisms of homologous recombination produce products that are conservative exchange events as well as products that convert one allele to another, we suggest that efforts to distinguish these processes without the genetic test that defines them is not terribly important. Instead, the important aspects that we report are the features of the recombination products. We have re-written the Discussion to maintain a more direct connection to the data provided and believe that these data provide meaningful insights into processes involved in generating the recombinants that we describe."

However, their data disagree with the previously proposed strand-displacement model for mtDNA replication, which is based on transmission electron microscope imaging of replicative forms (e.g. Goddard and Wolstenholme, 1978).

Nonetheless, we examined this issue. Most of our sites of recombination have not been localized near an origin of replication, but this might be influenced by rapid divergence of sequences around the replication origins so that homology is reduced. None of the most accurately mapped sites of recombination, those between <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. yakuba</i>, map to any of the mentioned sites. However, the location of sites of recombination in these cases might be special because sites are restricted by the frequent interruptions of homology in this pairing. One junction of the recombinant between <i>ATP6[1]</i> and the temperature sensitive genome was mapped within a 531 bp region (1154-12085) that encompasses a mTERF binding site downstream of ND1. Additionally, one of two other newly isolated recombinants between these genomes was mapped within a 631 bp region (5978-6619) that encompasses the other site of mTERF binding at 6314. While possibly consistent with a role of replication fork stalling near mTERF sites in triggering recombination in two cases, the correlation is weak and several steps of inference are involved in making such a suggestion.

At 22\u00b0C there is little selection against the temperature sensitive genome and presumably little stress as the flies are healthy. At generation 5 (when the average abundance of the <i>ATP[1]</i> genome had dropped to about 10% in most lines), populations growing at 22\u00b0C were transferred back to 29\u00b0C and kept there for the subsequent generations. We had reasoned that if the recombinants were pre-existing, then one would expect the same outcome whether the selection was imposed from the beginning or only after the decline the <i>ATP6[1]</i> genome. Perhaps supporting such a notion, none of the lines that were initially at 22\u00b0C produced survivors, suggesting the possibility of induced recombination by negative physiological consequences at high temperatures. However, as we considered events during the selection, we realized the finding might be explained without assuming induced recombination. Because there is huge growth of the population during the early generations, we can only analyze a small fraction of the potential progeny (we cull the population at each generation). Hence, the temperature might also have had an affect on the efficiency of recovery of preexisting recombinants by giving them an early selective advantage so that they were less likely to be culled in the early generations. Since the above experiment does not provide a definitive conclusion, we did not include it in the manuscript. Thus, the idea while perhaps weakly supported by our experiment, remains hypothetical. As emphasized in our comments above, stress-induction of recombination might add greatly to its impact. Consequently, it is a factor we do not want to ignore but will continue to investigate."

We reported this experiment because we suspect that that there is little difference between systems other than the fact that we developed uniquely powerful tools that allowed us to go beyond this limited experiment to do heretofore never reported experiments directly selecting and isolating animals with recombinant mitochondrial genomes."

Sato et al. made heteroplasmic tissue culture cells and heteroplasmic mice and retrieved mitochondrial genomes from the heteroplasmic lines by cloning. Many independent clones were sequenced. In one of three experimental settings, they identified two rare clones having short stretches of sequence with SNIP markers from the complementary genotype. This paper nicely shows rare somatic recombinant molecules that include between 36 bp to 120 bp of transferred sequence. Notably, the sequences transferred are short. There is no demonstration of germline events, no transmission of the recombinants and no enrichment of the recombinant. Furthermore, the rare events they detect have no demonstrated functional consequence. Outside of an evolutionary time scale, we consider this the clearest published experimental test for recombination in animals prior to our work, but none of the reported experiments resemble ours and their results are more limited and different."

In addition to uncertain validity, this study only detected genomes with big deletions close to the cut site and all but one of the apparent deletions was interpreted as intramolecular. Instead of full genomes resulting from exchange of sequence between the parental genomes, rearranged (deleted) sequences that were recovered by PCR support this recombination event. There is no evidence of germline transmission, no evidence of functional contribution, and uncertainty about the contribution of multiple restriction sites to the generation of the reported fragments.

A single lizard was found to have a genome with a somewhat intermediate sequence. Analysis of the distribution of polymorphisms in this intermediate genome suggests an evolutionary connection to the two dominant haplotypes, where one segment was highly related to one haplotype and the other segment was related to the other haplotype. This strongly suggests that a recombination event occurred at some time in the evolution of the intermediate haplotype. However, numerous sequence differences indicate that the dominant existing haplotypes were not the immediate parents of the intermediate haplotype. Thus, the study does not identify the parental genomes, but infers that a recombination event at some time in evolution (apparently long ago) was the source of the exceptional genome. Such population studies of wild populations, while of value and supporting the idea that some genetic exchange exists, bare little resemblance to our analysis, and do not report observations that we have made."

The male mitochondrial genome contributes only to the mitochondria in the male germline. The separation between the female lineage and male lineage is so thorough that they evolve along different paths and have dramatic differences in sequence suggesting isolation for hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Nonetheless, some populations have male genomes with segments having a high similarity to the female genome, a finding that is taken as indication of recombination event in more recent evolutionary history. This is a very interesting biological system and the study supports rare recombination in this unusual setting.

In accord with the idea that different types of selection can occur at different times, we find that replicative drive imparts a selective advantage at stages other than oogenesis (Ma and O\u2019Farrell, submitted).

We now know that mitochondria can recombine and hopefully we can uncover the factors that modulate their capacity to do so."
