In vertebrates, calcium transients generated by neuronal activity can influence neurotransmitter specification during development and in adults (<a href=\"#bib53\">Spitzer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Borodinsky et al., 2014</a>). One mechanism of generating Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients is non-canonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling initiated by membrane bound Frizzled receptors and a trimeric G-protein (<a href=\"#bib52\">Slusarski et al., 1997</a>). Such calcium signals are known to affect neuronal polarity, migration as well as synapse assembly in the developing and mature vertebrate brain (<a href=\"#bib61\">Varela-Nallar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ciani et al., 2011</a>). Wnt signaling was first identified in <i>Drosophila</i> where multiple genes encode Wnt and Fz proteins (<a href=\"#bib59\">van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009</a>). However, the role of non-canonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during neural development and circuit maturation is poorly understood in invertebrates and its ability to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during circuit maturation is unknown. In a screen for G-protein coupled receptors required for flight circuit maturation in <i>Drosophila</i> we identified <i>dFrizzled2</i> (<i>dFz2</i>) and found that flight deficits upon <i>dFz2</i> knockdown can be suppressed by over-expression of the intracellular endoplasmic reticular Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor dSTIM (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2013</a>). Adult neural circuits in <i>Drosophila</i>, including the flight circuit, form in the pupal stages (<a href=\"#bib10\">Consoulas et al., 2002</a>), and it is known that maturation of the <i>Drosophila</i> flight circuit requires intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banerjee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2013</a>). To understand the molecular and cellular basis for such flight deficits, we set out to map neurons that require dFz2 receptor signaling in the context of flight circuit maturation."

This computation and integration presumably occurs in central neurons and allows for control of initiation, maintenance and cessation of voluntary flight bouts (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gotz, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Strauss, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Strausfeld and Hirth, 2013</a>). Recent work has shown that central dopaminergic neurons in the ventral ganglion modulate a pair of direct flight muscle motor neurons required for wing coordination during flight initiation and cessation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sadaf et al., 2015</a>). In addition, central neurons that compute sensory information in real time and control the timing of a flight bout must exist but remain unknown. Most complex insect behaviors, including flight, are modulated by various monoamines and neuropeptides and in <i>Drosophila</i>, flight can be modulated by octopamine, serotonin and dopamine as well as several neuropeptides (<a href=\"#bib57\">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sadaf and Hasan, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Van Breugel et al., 2014</a>). Here, we show for the first time that dFz2 signaling drives the expression of <i>Tyrosine Hydroxylase</i> (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003</a>), during circuit maturation, in a specific set of central brain dopaminergic neurons, called the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) neurons. The PAM cluster consists of approximately 90 dopaminergic neurons, which project to different regions of a higher brain structure called the mushroom body (MB). PAM-MB connectivity has been studied for its role in olfactory associative learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) where it is thought to signal reward reinforcement. More recently, a PAM-MB circuit was shown to control negative geotaxis behavior in flies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Riemensperger et al., 2013</a>). Our studies demonstrate the presence of a novel PAM-MB flight circuit and support a role for PAM-MB synapses in dopaminergic re-inforcement of flight bouts."

Amongst the neuronal domains tested, significant flight deficits were observed upon knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in aminergic neurons (60% flight time; <i>DdcGAL4</i>) and in dopaminergic neurons (45% flight time; <i>THGAL4)</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)<i>.</i> Because, <i>DdcGAL4</i> drives expression in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, we tested flies with knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in serotonergic neurons (<i>TRHGAL4</i>). These flies exhibit normal flight bouts in the tethered flight assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Similarly, normal flight bouts were observed in flies with knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> by <i>OK371GAL4</i> (mainly glutamatergic neurons), <i>GADGAL4</i> (many GABA-ergic neurons), and <i>P386GAL4</i> (a peptidergic neuron subset that expresses in cells with the neuropeptide processing enzyme <i>amontillado</i>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, dFz2 function is required primarily in flight circuit neurons, which express GAL4 under control of the <i>pale</i> (<i>ple</i>) gene promoter that codes for TH. TH catalyzes a rate-limiting enzymatic step in the synthesis of dopamine (<a href=\"#bib16\">Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003</a>). Therefore, expression of this enzyme is considered a reliable marker of dopaminergic neurons. The <i>THGAL4</i> strain marks a high proportion of TH-positive neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system (<a href=\"#bib17\">Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003</a>)."

                                "text": "An earlier study demonstrated that pan-neuronal knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in pupae leads to flight deficits. However, <i>dFz2</i> knockdown in adults did not affect flight (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2013</a>). Existing larval progenitor neurons undergo extensive re-modeling of their axonal and dendritic arbors during pupal stages to form synaptic connections of the mature adult flight circuit (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fernandes and VijayRaghavan, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Consoulas et al., 2002</a>). We therefore determined the developmental stage at which dFz2 function is required in dopaminergic neurons for flight. For this purpose, we used the TARGET (temporal and regional gene expression targeting) system (<a href=\"#bib32\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>). TARGET regulates GAL4 expression by a temperature sensitive GAL80<sup>ts</sup> element, which can be expressed and repressed at 18\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, respectively (<a href=\"#bib33\">McGuire et al., 2004</a>). Experimental animals of the genotype <i>THGAL4,GAL80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup><i>;dFz2-IR</i> were shifted to the permissive GAL4 expression temperature (30\u00b0C) either during pupal or adult stages. This allowed stage-specific knockdown of <i>dFz2</i>. Upon knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in <i>TH</i>-expressing neurons through pupal development a significant reduction of flight time was observed, whereas normal flight bouts, as measured for 30 s, were observed upon knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Flight deficits upon knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in pupae were equivalent to those observed upon knockdown throughout post-embryonic development confirming that dFz2 requirement for flight is primarily in pupal dopaminergic neurons during circuit maturation. A physiological correlate of flight is rhythmic patterns of action potentials recorded from the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) during tethered flight. A reduction in duration of flight patterns was observed upon knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in <i>TH</i>-expressing neurons during pupal development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). <i>dFz2</i> knockdown at pupal and adult stages in <i>TH</i>-expressing neurons was confirmed by qPCR. As a control, we also confirmed <i>dFz2</i> knockdown in serotonergic neurons targeted by <i>TRHGAL4</i> where no flight deficits were observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The specificity of flight deficits obtained upon <i>dFz2</i> knockdown was tested by expression of three additional RNAi strains for <i>dFz2 (BL27568, BL31390</i>, and <i>BL31312</i>). Significant flight defects ranging from 67% to 72% were obtained upon knockdown through post-embryonic development (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The difference in flight deficits between <i>dFz2-IR</i> and the three other RNAi strains is very likely due to a difference in their efficacy of knockdown (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> with <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Therefore, the <i>dFz2-IR</i> strain was used for all subsequent analyses."

In addition <i>TH</i>-expressing neurons are present in each segment of the ventral ganglion (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mao and Davis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sadaf et al., 2015</a>). In the brain, two neuronal clusters referred to as PAM and PAL (Protocerebral Anterior Lateral) are located in the anterior region, whereas five neuronal clusters, PPM1, 2, and 3 (Protocerebral Posterior Medial), PPL1 and 2 (Protocerebral Posterior Lateral) are located in the posterior region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In order to identify <i>TH</i>-expressing neurons that require dFz2 function for flight, three independent GAL4 strains (<i>THC\u2019</i>, <i>THC1</i>, and <i>THF2</i>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2012</a>), with differential expression in central brain clusters and the ventral ganglion, were tested (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Significant flight deficits were observed upon expression of <i>dFz2-IR</i> under control of <i>THC1GAL4,</i> but not with <i>THC\u2019GAL4</i> and <i>THF2GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)<i>.</i> These data suggested that either all or some neurons in the PAM, PPM1, and T3 regions, marked by <i>THC1GAL4,</i> but poorly marked or not marked by <i>THC\u2019GAL4</i> and <i>THF2GAL4,</i> form part of the flight circuit and require dFz2 signaling during pupal development<i>.</i> Next, we tested two strains (<i>NP6510GAL4</i> and <i>R58E02GAL4</i>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Riemensperger et al., 2013</a>) which drive expression uniquely in the PAM neurons (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Significant flight deficits were observed in flies with knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> by either <i>NP6510GAL4</i> or <i>R58E02GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) implicating these dopaminergic neurons as part of a central brain flight circuit. These data do not rule out a role for additional central neurons or ventral ganglion neurons in the regulation of flight. Expression of dFz2 was confirmed in adult PAM neurons by immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Knockdown by <i>dFz2-IR</i> in PAM neurons resulted in significant loss of dFz2 immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, in support of the pupal requirement for dFz2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), PAM neurons marked by <i>R58E02GAL4</i> do not express TH in the larval stages (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that TH immunoreactivity in these neurons is acquired during pupal maturation, as observed by co-localization of TH immunostaining with <i>R58E02GAL4</i>-driven GFP in pupae (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). With this we concluded that PAM neurons require dFz2 signaling during functional maturation of the flight circuit in pupae."

In order to identify molecules that function downstream of Fz2 for development of the adult flight circuit, interactions of candidate genes were tested. Reports from vertebrates suggest that dFz2 activates downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling through non-canonical mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib52\">Slusarski et al., 1997</a>). We tested flight in animals with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown in combination with both canonical (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and non-canonical (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) candidate genes. In the canonical signaling pathway dFz2 along with its co-receptor lipoprotein receptor related-protein 5/6 (LRP5/6, encoded by <i>Arrow</i> in <i>Drosophila</i>) activates Dishevelled. Activated dishevelled functions to stabilize \u03b2 catenin (<i>Drosophila armadillo</i>) and hence promote \u03b2 catenin entry into the nucleus followed by enhanced transcription of downstream target genes. We over-expressed wild-type Dishevelled, a point mutant (G64V) in the DIX-domain of Dishevelled (specifically activates the canonical pathway; <a href=\"#bib40\">Penton et al., 2002</a>) and a constitutively active form of Armadillo (<i>UAS-armS10</i>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Morel and Arias, 2004</a>) in the background of <i>dFz2</i> down-regulation either in dopaminergic neurons or across all neurons. The resultant progeny were tested for flight. Up-regulation of canonical signaling molecules did not rescue flight deficits of <i>dFz2</i> down-regulation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, normal flight times were observed in flies with RNAi knockdown of canonical dFz2 pathway components like LRP5/6, Dishevelled, and GSK3\u03b2 in either the pan-neuronal domain or in dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). RNAi strains for dishevelled and GSK3\u03b2 were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whereas RNAi for LRP5/6 was validated by ubiquitous expression with <i>Act5CGAL4</i> that resulted in embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dietzl et al., 2007</a>). These results do not support a role for canonical dFz2 signaling in dopaminergic neurons for maturation of the flight circuit in pupae."

Therefore, we tested the requirement of other heterotrimeric G-proteins from <i>Drosophila</i>. Constitutively, active forms of the \u03b1 subunits of Gs (<i>UASAcGs</i>), Go (<i>UASAcGo</i>), and Gi (<i>UASAcGi</i>) were tested in flies with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown in pupal stages.

In <i>Drosophila</i>, neuronal activity can be increased by over-expression of a voltage-gated sodium channel, <i>NaChBac</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nitabach et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, we tested flight in organisms with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown and increased neuronal activity by <i>NaChBac</i> expression. Flight was restored close to 100% upon expression of <i>NaChBac</i> in dopaminergic neurons (<i>THGAL4</i>) and more specifically in PAM neurons (<i>NP6510GAL4 and R58E02GAL4</i>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Moreover, raising neuronal activity during pupal development in parallel with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown compensated for loss of flight observed in the knockdown condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These data suggest that Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can contribute to the synaptic activity of dopaminergic PAM neurons in pupae. The requirement for synaptic activity in maturing PAM neurons was tested directly by expression of a temperature sensitive mutant of the dynamin orthologue, <i>shibire</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> (<i>Shi</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup>). Expression of <i>Shi</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> blocks vesicle endocytosis at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kitamoto, 2001</a>) and its expression during pupal development, either in TH neurons (<i>THGAL4</i>) or exclusively in PAM neurons (<i>NP6510GAL4 and R58E02GAL4</i>) resulted in significant loss of flight (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Temporal expression of <i>Shi</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> in adult PAM neurons also resulted in a flight deficit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), supporting the requirement of active synaptic transmission in PAM neurons for adult flight."

TH levels in PAM neurons marked by <i>R58E02GAL4</i>, appear reduced upon <i>dFz2</i> knockdown as judged by immunohistochemistry (compare anti-TH panels in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Expression of <i>NaChBac</i> with <i>dFz2-IR</i> restored TH expression close to wild-type levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,C</a>). Quantification of TH immunostaining across multiple samples revealed a significant reduction upon <i>dFz2</i> knockdown which was restored by expression of <i>NaChBac</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Furthermore, <i>TH</i> transcript levels were significantly reduced by <i>dFz2</i> knockdown and were restored upon expression of <i>NaChBac</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, altered TH levels corroborated well with flight deficits and their rescue in various genotypes. Numbers of TH-positive neurons in the PAM cluster were not significantly different between the three genotypes as judged by anti-TH immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Surprisingly, <i>R58E02GAL4</i>-driven GFP expression was also reduced upon expression of <i>dFz2-IR</i> and was restored back upon expression of <i>NaChBac</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consequently, there was an apparent reduction in the numbers of GFP positive cells upon <i>dFz2-IR</i> expression which was restored by <i>NaChBac</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Because the number of <i>TH</i>-expressing cells of the PAM cluster remained unchanged upon <i>dFz2</i> knockdown and after <i>NaChBac</i> rescue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), we hypothesized that dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling regulates <i>TH</i> expression in PAM neurons during pupal development. Moreover, our data support a role for dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in regulating expression of the <i>R58E02GAL4</i> transgene where GAL4 is under control of the <i>fumin</i> gene encoding a Dopamine Transporter, DAT (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2012</a>)."

Unlike <i>R58E02GAL4</i>, <i>THGAL4</i>-driven mGFP marks a small subset of PAM neurons. This consists of two clusters of 6\u20137 neurons each (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Riemensperger et al., 2013</a>). <i>THGAL4</i>-driven expression of <i>dFz2-IR</i> resulted in significant loss of GFP expression in PAM neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, GFP expression in five TH-positive neurons of the PAL cluster remained unaffected by knockdown of dFz2, suggesting that dFz2 regulation of TH expression maybe PAM specific (data not shown). Over-expression of either <i>dSTIM</i><sup>+</sup><i>, IP</i><sub><i>3</i></sub><i>R</i> or <i>NaChBac</i> in the background of <i>dFz2</i> knockdown could partially rescue loss of GFP expression in the PAM neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, <i>THGAL4</i>-driven GFP expression in PAM neurons correlated with flight deficits and their rescue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A, 3C, 4A</a>). Quantification of <i>TH</i> immunoreactivity in PAM cells by <i>THGAL4</i>-driven dFz2 knockdown was technically not possible because the few <i>THGAL4</i>-positive cells of the PAM cluster could not be identified in the <i>dFz2</i> knockdown condition. Taken together these data support the idea that dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PAM neurons drives transcription of two key dopamine synthesis and uptake molecules, TH and DAT. The transcriptional regulation extends to GAL4 transgenic constructs containing TH and DAT regulatory sequences. As controls we tested TH immunoreactivity of PAM neurons in flies with dFz2 knockdown in glutamatergic neurons (<i>OK371GAL4</i>). Both TH immunoreactivity of PAM neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and flight patterns (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were similar to controls."

Over-expression of a neuronal-specific TH cDNA transgene (<i>UASDTH1)</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003</a>) in flies with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown by <i>PAMGAL4</i> strains (<i>NP6510GAL4 and R58E02GAL4</i>) could rescue flight deficits significantly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Moreover, knockdown of TH in PAM neurons affected <i>R58E02GAL4</i>-driven GFP expression suggesting feedback regulation of dopamine transporter (DAT) by dopamine levels.

These data suggest that rescue of flight by over-expression of <i>DTH1</i> by passes the transcriptional regulation of <i>DAT</i> by dopamine and of endogenous <i>TH</i> by dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.

This idea was tested by silencing specific MB neuropil lobes with <i>mb186bGAL4</i> and <i>mb247GAL4</i> drivers. <i>mb186bGAL4</i> is a recently generated split GAL4 strain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014</a>) whose expression is restricted to the \u03b1\u2032 \u03b2\u2032 lobes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vogt et al., 2014</a>), whereas <i>mb247GAL4</i> is expressed in the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 lobes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zars, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Krashes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pech et al., 2013</a>). Synaptic release in MB neurons of adult flies was inhibited by expression of a temperature sensitive dominant negative dynamin transgene (<i>UAS-Shi</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup><i>)</i> under control of either <i>mb186bGAL4</i> or <i>mb247GAL4</i> drivers. Blocking synaptic release in \u03b1\u2032, \u03b2\u2032 lobes resulted in a strong flight deficit, whereas silencing of the \u03b1, \u03b2 , and \u03b3 lobes did not have a significant effect on flight, for 30 s (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Reduced flight bouts were accompanied by loss of rhythmic spiking in the DLMs of flies with silenced \u03b1\u2032, \u03b2\u2032 lobes neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These data support a requirement for post-synaptic dopamine receptors in MB neurons that function for maintenance of acute flight. We tested this requirement further by RNAi-mediated knockdown of the four dopamine receptors\u2014<i>DopECR (CG18314), Dop1R1 (CG9652)</i>, <i>Dop1R2 (CG18741)</i>, and <i>Dop2R (CG33517)</i>, in either the \u03b1\u2032, \u03b2\u2032 neurons (<i>mb186bGAL4</i>) or the \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 neurons (<i>mb247GAL4</i>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A reduction in the length of flight bouts was observed specifically upon knockdown of Dop1R2 in the \u03b1\u2032, \u03b2 \u2032 neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The role of \u03b1\u2032 \u03b2\u2032 lobes, in flight was supported by another GAL4 driver, <i>c305GAL4</i>, which expresses in the \u03b1\u2032 \u03b2\u2032 lobes and faintly in the \u03b3 lobe (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krashes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pech et al., 2013</a>). Blocking synaptic activity or knockdown of Dop1R2 using <i>c305aGAL4</i> resulted in significant flight deficits (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "Unlike dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral ganglion, which directly modulate flight motor neuron function as demonstrated recently (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sadaf et al., 2015</a>), the PAM\u2013MB circuit described here is not known to project to flight motor neurons in the ventral ganglion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Riemensperger et al., 2013</a>). Rather, PAM-MB circuits function to reinforce both aversive and appetitive olfactory responses (<a href=\"#bib66\">Waddell, 2013</a>). To test possible re-inforcement of flight time by the PAM-MB circuit, we monitored longer flight bouts in several genotypes. Knockdown of <i>dFz2</i> in PAM neurons (<i>R58E02GAL4&gt;dFz2-IR)</i> significantly reduced the duration of flight bouts, monitored up to 15 min, from an average of 13.04 \u00b1 0.4 min in controls to 0.85 \u00b1 0.3 min in the knockdowns (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Maintenance of flight bouts was rescued significantly upon increasing neuronal activity by expression of <i>NaChBac</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These data were analyzed further by binning flight bouts in 20-s intervals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Flight time of <i>dFz2</i> knockdown flies clustered towards the left among shorter flight bouts, whereas control flies clustered towards the right with longer flight bouts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Distribution of flight times in <i>NaChBac</i>-rescued flies appeared intermediate. All rescued flies flew for longer than 20 s and a small percentage flew for longer than 10 min. Interestingly, <i>DTH1</i>-rescued flies exhibit shorter flight bouts as compared with <i>NaChBac</i>-rescued organisms (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). This difference in rescue abilities may in part be due to the previous observation that <i>NaChBac</i> rescue restores TH immunoreactivity to PAM neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), whereas TH rescue very likely cannot restore the excitability deficit of PAM neurons. Long flight bouts were also tested in flies with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown by <i>THGAL4</i>, followed by rescue with <i>dSTIM</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>, <i>itpr</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>, and <i>NaChBac</i> (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The <i>NaChBac</i> rescue profile was very similar to that observed by <i>NaChBac</i> rescue of PAM-specific <i>dFz2</i> knockdown, whereas, <i>dSTIM</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> and <i>itpr</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> rescue profiles resembled the <i>DTH1</i> rescue in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a> (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These data support a role for the PAM-MB circuit in maintenance of long flight bouts through dopaminergic synapses on \u03b1' \u03b2' MB lobes."

We demonstrate a requirement for dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for maintaining TH levels in a subset of central brain dopaminergic neurons\u2014the PAM cluster. Our results support transcriptional regulation of <i>TH</i> and very likely the dopamine transporter (DAT) by dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the PAM neurons. A significant compensation of the flight deficit was observed in flies with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown in PAM neurons upon over-expression of the sodium channel <i>NaChBac</i>, indicating that dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling also affects neural activity of PAM neurons. Moreover, flight deficits were observed upon expression of <i>Shi</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> in PAM neurons during the pupal stages, supporting a role for neural activity and synaptic transmission in their development. Increased <i>TH</i> transcripts and TH immunoreactivity after rescue by <i>NaChBac</i> suggests that dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can in part be compensated by raised neural activity, and possibly the two signaling mechanisms function in parallel for maintaining <i>TH</i> transcription in PAM neurons. It is likely that in addition to TH and DAT, dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals exert their influence on other transcripts in PAM neurons. Transcriptional profiling of the PAM neurons is necessary to address this possibility. Interestingly, despite an increase in the number of PAM neurons during pupal maturation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), we do not observe an affect of dFz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling on the number of PAM neurons. Knockdown of dFz2 by <i>DdcGAL4</i> that marks &gt;60 PAM neurons resulted in flight time of \u223c65% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), whereas a stronger flight deficit was observed with <i>NP6510GAL4</i> which marks just 15 PAM neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, the flight deficit obtained with <i>R58E02GAL4</i> which marks \u223c100 PAM neurons was similar to the flight deficit obtained with <i>NP6510GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, the numbers of PAM neurons that express <i>dFz2-IR</i> do not correlate with the extent of observed flight deficits, suggesting that flight is regulated by a subset of PAM neurons and their projections to the MB. Further, analysis with GAL4 strains that mark PAM neuronal sub-domains would be helpful in identifying such flight specific PAM neurons."

Rescue of flight deficits in flies with <i>dFz2</i> knockdown in PAM neurons either by over-expression of a sodium channel (<i>NaChBac</i>) or a transgene encoding TH (<i>UAS-DTH1</i>) supports a requirement for both neural activity and dopamine release from the PAM neurons for maintenance of longer flight bouts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).
