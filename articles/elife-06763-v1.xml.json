                    "text": "Sumoylation during genotoxic stress regulates the composition of DNA repair complexes. The yeast metalloprotease Wss1 clears chromatin-bound sumoylated proteins. Wss1 and its mammalian analog, DVC1/Spartan, belong to minigluzincins family of proteases. Wss1 proteolytic activity is regulated by a cysteine switch mechanism activated by chemical stress and/or DNA binding. Wss1 is required for cell survival following UV irradiation, the smt3-331 mutation and Camptothecin-induced formation of covalent topoisomerase 1 complexes (Top1cc). Wss1 forms a SUMO-specific ternary complex with the AAA ATPase Cdc48 and an adaptor, Doa1. Upon DNA damage Wss1/Cdc48/Doa1 is recruited to sumoylated targets and catalyzes SUMO chain extension through a newly recognized SUMO ligase activity. Activation of Wss1 results in metalloprotease self-cleavage and proteolysis of associated proteins. In cells lacking Tdp1, clearance of topoisomerase covalent complexes becomes SUMO and Wss1-dependent. Upon genotoxic stress, Wss1 is vacuolar, suggesting a link between genotoxic stress and autophagy involving the Doa1 adapter."

Wss1 and its mammalian analog, DVC1/Spartan, belong to minigluzincins family of proteases. Wss1 proteolytic activity is regulated by a cysteine switch mechanism activated by chemical stress and/or DNA binding. Wss1 is required for cell survival following UV irradiation, the smt3-331 mutation and Camptothecin-induced formation of covalent topoisomerase 1 complexes (Top1cc). Wss1 forms a SUMO-specific ternary complex with the AAA ATPase Cdc48 and an adaptor, Doa1. Upon DNA damage Wss1/Cdc48/Doa1 is recruited to sumoylated targets and catalyzes SUMO chain extension through a newly recognized SUMO ligase activity. Activation of Wss1 results in metalloprotease self-cleavage and proteolysis of associated proteins. In cells lacking Tdp1, clearance of topoisomerase covalent complexes becomes SUMO and Wss1-dependent. Upon genotoxic stress, Wss1 is vacuolar, suggesting a link between genotoxic stress and autophagy involving the Doa1 adapter."

The experiments show that Wss1 helps to remove the SUMO-modified complexes from the DNA by forming a complex with Cdc48 and the Cdc48-adaptor protein Doa1. Wss1 is a protease, an enzyme that can break down proteins, but it is inactive under the normal conditions inside a cell. Wss1 is found in the cell's nucleus (which contains most of the cell's DNA) until it senses DNA damage, which it does by recognizing damage-specific forms of DNA (such as single stranded DNA) and the SUMO tag."

This indicates that Wss1 can also act as a ligase\u2014an enzyme that helps to assemble polymeric SUMO. The polymeric SUMO in turn leads to the accumulation of more Wss1 and activates its protease activity. The protease cleaves the associated proteins in the repair complex, thus helping to extract the SUMO-modified proteins from the DNA. DNA damage also results in the transfer of Wss1 into a compartment inside the cell, called a vacuole. This suggests that autophagy\u2014a mechanism used by cells to break down damaged cellular components\u2014is one way that proteins are removed from the nucleus."

Eukaryotic cells evolved a DNA damage response (DDR) to sense, evaluate, and repair chromosome and DNA lesions or to direct cells for destruction when the harm is irreparable (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</a>). This dynamic process is under precise spatiotemporal control, requiring posttranslational modifications (PTM); phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and sumoylation, to name a few (<a href=\"#bib54\">Polo and Jackson, 2011</a>). Compared to phosphorylation, bulky modifications with ubiquitin (Ub), and SUMO provide additional scaffolding for regulation of composition, function, and stability of protein assemblies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jackson and Durocher, 2013</a>). Both modifiers are conjugated to target proteins by the concerted action of activating enzymes (E1), conjugating enzymes (E2) and ligases (E3) and both form chains through repeated cycles of self-conjugation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kerscher et al., 2006</a>). The effects of modification depend on its position on the target protein, chain length, and type of lysine (K) linkage. Conjugation is reversible; specific proteases ensure regeneration of the modifier pool and regulate the PTM by reversing the modification, or remodeling the chains (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eletr and Wilkinson, 2014</a>)."

Assembly of repair complexes during genotoxic stress requires clearing the damaged and stalled chromatin components from the site of DNA damage. During or at the completion of repair, the assembled repair complexes must be disassembled. Ub-dependent protein degradation by the 26S proteasome is a major mechanism of protein clearing, involving Cdc48-promoted disassembly of chromatin-bound complexes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vaz et al., 2013</a>). Cdc48, an AAA-ATPase chaperone long-thought to be Ub-specific, also interacts with sumoylated substrates via one of its multiple cofactors, Ufd1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nie et al., 2012</a>). This interaction is required to protect cells from Topoisomerase (Top1)-induced DNA damage. The Cdc48/Ufd1/Npl4 complex is also targeted to sumoylated Rad52 and negatively regulates its interaction with Rad51, inhibiting excessive recombination (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bergink et al., 2013</a>). Thus, Cdc48 plays a central role in DDR, acting as a Ub and SUMO-dependent segregase assembling and disassembling macromolecular complexes."

To test this we synthesized a new ligand, SUMO-PA, where C-terminal Gly was replaced by amino-methyl-phosphonic acid (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Replacement of the C-terminal carboxyl by phosphonic acid should strengthen the coordination of the active site Zn, stabilizing a complex between metalloprotease and peptide substrate (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mucha et al., 2010</a>). The SUMO-PA ligand was then linked to beads and used to measure Wss1 binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To further increase the selectivity, pull-downs were done in the presence of 1% Tx-100 to attenuate the hydrophobic SIM-SUMO interaction. Under these conditions no Wss1 was bound to SUMO, while SUMO-PA beads still retrieve significant amount of the protein. Pointing to the role of Zn, the binding to SUMO-PA was inhibited by o-phenanthroline (OPA) and WLM* mutation, while ablation of SIMs had only a minor effect. Thus, the WLM domain appears to bind the C-terminus of SUMO and introduction of the phosphonic acid moiety enhances this interaction. The double SIM mutant showed diminished binding and the N-terminal-Wss1 fragment didn't bind SUMO-PA at all, indicating that SIM-SUMO interaction still contributed to the binding. On the other hand, the phosphonic acid moiety alone was not sufficient to insure binding since no Wss1 was retrieved with Ub-PA beads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Because we observed that GFP-Wss1 formed nuclear foci (see below) and others have reported activation by DNA (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stingele et al., 2014</a>), we examined whether Wss1 protease activity can be triggered by nucleic acids and other negatively charged macromolecules. Recombinant Wss1 was purified under denaturing conditions and refolded in the presence of heparin, SDS, plasmid DNA, or ssDNA. Unexpectedly, we found that refolding in the presence of ssDNA-induced autocatalytic cleavage of the Wss1 protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Uncleaved Wss1 and one fragment (N-Wss1) precipitated along with the DNA while the other (C-Wss1) was soluble. Sequencing of the latter revealed cleavage at V189 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

The oligomers are thiol-sensitive suggesting that they are disulfide linked (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> below). We hypothesize that in Wss1 protein, the active site Zn is linked to a cysteine residue, which is released by OPA and promotes the formation of intermolecular crosslinks. This observation raises an interesting possibility that Wss1 is regulated by a cysteine-switch mechanism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chakraborti et al., 2003</a>). The metalloproteases regulated by a cysteine-switch mechanism can be activated by thiol-reacting reagents. By screening a panel of different electrophiles, we found that thiram (<a href=\"#bib1\">Balakirev and Zimmer, 1998</a>), a compound that reversibly modifies cysteine residues, efficiently induces Wss1 self-cleavage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Importantly, the cleavage pattern was the same as in refolding experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Thiram belongs to the thiuram disulfide class of reactive compounds that modify protein sulfhydryl groups via thiol-disulfide exchange reaction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Neims et al., 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Vallari and Pietruszko, 1982</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because thiram also inhibited OPA-induced Wss1 oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), it seems that it targets the same cysteine residue that is involved in Zn binding. In parallel, we found that toxic organomercury compound APMA, classically used for matrix metalloproteases activation, also produces Wss1 self-cleavage and inhibits OPA-dependent protein oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>)."

Displacement of the cysteine from the active site Zn induces autoproteolytic cleavage and may serve to release an inhibitory protein fragment. Wss1 has three cysteine residues, two of which, though located within the WLM domain, are far from the active site (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Moreover, their orientation suggests that they may form a disulfide bridge, though the estimated distance of 5.6 \u00c5 implies a conformational change would be necessary. The third cysteine, C226, is located in a negatively charged C-terminal part of the protein that was released by self-cleavage. This residue is conserved within the WLM family (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and is a perfect candidate for the regulatory cysteine. Unfortunately, we were unable to produce soluble C226S protein, probably because of rapid auto-proteolysis of this construct. To examine the role of V189-cleavage site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) in C-terminal fragment release and activation of Wss1, we produced a Wss1 mutant where the GKG residues preceding V189 were replaced by AQA (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Upon thiram treatment, the AQA mutant efficiently self-processed, though producing different proteolytic fragments (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This result suggests that the primary sequence within this protein region is not essential for Wss1 activation."

While thiram greatly accelerated this reaction, thiols, particularly 10 mM glutathione, significantly inhibited DNA-induced Wss1 proteolysis. This result implies that, in cells, spontaneous activation of Wss1 by DNA may be inhibited by intracellular/nuclear thiols. Conversely, oxidative damage would be expected to deplete thiols and increase ssDNA lesions, resulting in activation of the latent protease activity of Wss1."

Preformed chains were incubated with Wss1 in the presence of DNA or thiram, and the reaction products were analyzed by anti-SUMO western blot (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). While there was a reduction in the apparent molecular weight of the chains, we did not observe accumulation of low molecular weight SUMO species expected from chain disassembly and seen with Ulp1. Also, in contrast to Ulp1, Wss1 failed to cleave a SUMO1-FP isopeptide substrate (<a href=\"#bib15\">Geurink et al., 2012</a>) and was unable to process a linear His6-Ub-SUMO-HA substrate (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that Wss1 is not an isopeptidase. Instead, we found that Wss1 treatment increases the intensity of high molecular weight SUMO able to penetrate the separating gel (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Because this reaction coincided with auto-proteolysis of Wss1 and was suppressed by OPA, it was probably catalyzed by Wss1 metalloprotease activity. Thus, it is likely that Wss1 proteolysis generated SUMO species that more easily entered the gel matrix and produced an apparent increase in SUMO signal."

Notably, Ulp1 cleavage clearly showed that the majority of HMW-SUMO species did not enter the gel and accumulated on the well bottom (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, lane 8). Wss1 treatment produced a distinct smear on the top of the gel suggesting more SUMO species entered the gel matrix. This corroborates the western blot data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, top panel). The time course of HMW-SUMO processing was similar to Wss1 auto-proteolysis, both being inhibited by OPA. Interestingly, SUMO chains accelerated thiram-induced Wss1 auto-proteolysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, lane 2 and lane 6). Thus, similarly to DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) HMW-SUMO stimulates Wss1 cleavage, perhaps by promoting Wss1 oligomerization."

To see whether the release of Zn increases sumoylation, we produced Wss1 apoprotein by OPA titration and analyzed its auto-sumoylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Increasing OPA concentration promotes sumoylation of WT-Wss1. This effect was not due to stimulation of SUMO E1\u2013E2 enzymes because OPA did not increase the sumoylation of the WLM* mutant. At 3 mM OPA, WT, and WLM* formed a similar level of SUMO conjugates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). It seems therefore that extraction of Zn from metalloprotease active site somehow promotes Wss1-dependent sumoylation. Although the mechanism of this effect is not completely clear, it could be explained by our finding that OPA induces Wss1 oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The oligomers can be seen by non-reducing gel electrophoresis and disappear in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) suggesting that they are disulfide linked (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These data suggest that in the absence of Zn the regulatory cysteine 226 (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) induces intermolecular disulfide crosslinks, multiplication of SUMO-binding sites and increase in SUMO ligase activity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

(<b>C</b>) Interaction of Wss1 with preformed Cdc48 complexes confirms ternary 1:1:1 Wss1/Doa1/Cdc48 complex. The Cdc48 complexes were preformed from purified GST-Cdc48 with a double molar excess of the indicated protein adaptors. Next, MBP-Wss1 was added in stoichiometric amount and Cdc48 complexes were separated on glutathione beads. The bound complexes were analyzed by PAGE with Coomassie staining, and quantified by ImageJ. The bottom picture shows the models of Cdc48 complexes resulted from ImageJ measurements. (<b>D</b>) Mass spectrometry analysis of Doa1-interacting proteins identifies Wss1. Purified HF-Doa1 protein was mixed with whole cell lysate and retrieved, along with the partner proteins, on Ni-NTA resin (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In the control experiment, the lysate was passed through the resin without HF-Doa1. The proteins specifically retrieved with HF-Doa1 were identified by mass spectrometry. Top seven interactors are shown in the table (see also <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> for complete list). (<b>E</b>) Wss1-dependent binding of Cdc48 and Doa1 to SUMO beads. Purified of His6-Cdc48 and his6-Flag (HF)-Doa1 proteins were pulled down with SUMO beads with (right part of the blots) or without (left part) HA-Wss1 protein. The input (I) and bound (B) fractions were analyzed by western blotting. Input: 20%."

Wss1 proteins were expressed from a pYepGAP vector, and sumoylation of cellular proteins was analyzed by western blotting. Contrary to the accepted role of Wss1 as a protease, but consistent with its role as a SUMO ligase, Wss1 expression results in a marked buildup of high molecular weight SUMO conjugates at the top of the gel and two major species at 120 kD and 140 kD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). A similar effect was observed with WLM*, but not with the \u0394SIM2 mutant, demonstrating that SUMO-binding and not protease activity was involved. None of the known SUMO ligases was required for stimulation of sumoylation by Wss1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggesting that the observed activity was due to Wss1 directly. Most strikingly, Siz1 appears to be responsible for most sumoylation under basal conditions, and Wss1 expression partially rescued the decreased SUMO conjugation seen in <i>siz1\u0394</i> cells."

To test if this band was derived from the Wss1 interactors, Doa1 (80 kD) and Cdc48 (92 kD), we expressed TAP-tagged Doa1 or Cdc48 and analyzed sumoylation profiles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). While the pattern of sumoylation in <i>DOA1-TAP</i> cells was similar to untagged strains, the major sumoylated band in <i>CDC48-TAP</i> cells was shifted upward by the expected 20 kD (the size of TAP-tag), suggesting that this conjugate was mono-sumoylated Cdc48. This was confirmed by anti-TAP western blot (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Sumoylation of Cdc48 by Wss1 required the SIM2 motif (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Wss1 mutants deficient in Cdc48 binding (R218/219S and F2R, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>) failed to sumoylate Cdc48, yet still produced HMW-SUMO conjugates.

To ask if this suppression required the SUMO ligase or protease activity of Wss1, we probed the role of Wss1 in <i>smt3-331</i> cells. The <i>ts</i>-suppression required both correct SUMO binding via SIM2 and an intact protease domain, but not binding to Cdc48 mediated by R218, R219, and F152 of Wss1. The expression of a C-terminal Wss1-GFP fusion (at much lower levels) showed nearly the same suppression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Looking at sumoylation, we found that <i>smt3-331</i> has negligible monomeric SUMO and an elevated level of HMW-SUMO conjugates, pointing to a defect in SUMO metabolism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

Several observations suggest that the proteolytic activity of Wss1 might be specifically activated in <i>smt3-331</i> cells. Thus, we found that in <i>smt3-331</i> strain the level of exogenously expressed HA-Wss1 and, particularly, HA-WLM* protein was greatly decreased in <i>WSS1</i> compared to <i>wss1\u0394</i> cells pointing to a mechanism involving Wss1-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Assuming similar rates of transcription, the massively higher level of \u0394SIM2-Wss1 observed in the steady state suggests that this degradation was SUMO dependent. Therefore, consistent with our observations in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), Wss1 appears to undergo autoproteolytic activation and degradation stimulated by interaction with HMW-SUMO. Corroborating this conclusion, Wss1 protein was destabilized in <i>smt3-331</i> compared to <i>SMT3</i> cells and its degradation depended on the presence of the native protease and SIM domains (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). At the same time, we found that <i>wss1\u0394</i> increased the level of Cdc48 protein in <i>smt3-33</i>1 mutant, but not in <i>SMT3</i> strain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). In complementation assays, only WT Wss1 was able to reduce the level of Cdc48 protein in <i>wss1\u0394</i> cells. These data suggest that Wss1 degrades itself and Cdc48 in <i>smt3-331</i> cells, and that this activity requires its protease domain, SUMO-interaction and Cdc48 binding. Because Wss1 binding to Cdc48 is not required for <i>ts</i>-suppression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), the degradation of Cdc48 by WT-Wss1 seems to be a sort of collateral damage induced by activation of the Wss1 protease by increased HMW-SUMO in <i>smt3-331</i> cells. Loss of Cdc48 itself would be detrimental to the cell and the lack of this degradation in F2R-Wss1 could explain why F2R-Wss1 is a better <i>ts</i>-suppressor than WT Wss1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>)."

All Wss1 constructs, except \u0394SIM2, co-purified with SUMO-conjugates. Interestingly, all Wss1 complexes, except the F2R mutant (which cannot bind Cdc48) also contained ubiquitylated proteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, middle panel). Because the presence of Ub-conjugates correlated with Cdc48 binding, we assume that these species were bound to Cdc48. The WLM* complex showed the highest level of ubiquitinylated species. Previous study proposed that Wss1 cleaves mixed Ub-SUMO chains (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mullen et al., 2010</a>), perhaps explaining the higher level of Ub conjugates in the protease-deficient WLM* complex. However, like others (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stingele et al., 2014</a>) we could not detect such activity in Wss1 complexes using a specific Ub-SUMO substrate (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). On the other hand, as WT and \u0394SIM2 complexes had the similar level of Ub-conjugates, it seems that the majority of these species were not sumoylated and interacted with Wss1 primarily through Cdc48. Cdc48 and Wss1 were partially fragmented in WT and <i>\u0394</i>SIM2, but not WLM* cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>)."

Similarly to what we observed for in vitro-processing of SUMO chains by recombinant Wss1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the isolated WT protein complex accumulated sumoylated species of intermediate size as a result of the proteolysis of HMW-SUMO (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Proteolysis was likely not the result of cysteine, serine, or threonine proteases because of the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in the lysis buffer and the lack of inhibition by PMSF. In contrast, OPA inhibited SUMO processing, suggesting that metalloprotease activity is involved. In the WLM* complex, an intense ladder of sumoylated protein was present and no degradation of sumoylated species was observed. Notably, both Cdc48 and Wss1 are processed in the WT complex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>) in a reaction inhibited by OPA, but not by NEM or PMSF. Neither Cdc48 nor Wss1 proteolysis were affected by MG132 proteasome inhibitor, again pointing to metalloprotease activity. The degradation of Cdc48 coincided with the stepwise truncation of Wss1 protein (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), reminiscent to what we observed with recombinant proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The size of the primary N-terminal Wss1 fragment (25 kD) corresponded to cleavage at V189 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The 25 kD N-terminal fragment underwent further truncation to a 20-kD protein. Sequence analysis suggests that this corresponds to cleavage near the GG sequence in the SHP box (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Because the WLM* mutant remained stable over time, it seems that this proteolysis was a result of Wss1 self-processing and reflected initial steps of protease activation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chakraborti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gomis-Ruth, 2003</a>). As both Wss1 cleavage sites are conserved in WLM family members (<a href=\"#bib23\">Iyer et al., 2004</a>), this may represent a general regulatory mechanism employed by WLM proteases. Wss1 self-cleavage produces an N-terminal activated protease and a C-terminal protein fragment which contains SIMs and VIM motifs and probably still bridges Cdc48 and SUMO-substrates. These mechanisms could serve for spatiotemporal control of the substrate processing, especially if the proteolytic fragments remain associated."

A previous large-scale survey revealed significant negative genetic interaction between <i>WSS1</i> and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (<i>TDP1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dixon et al., 2008</a>). Tdp1 cleaves stalled topoisomerase I (Top1) cleavage DNA complexes (Top1cc) formed upon DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pommier et al., 2006</a>). In the absence of Tdp1, the removal of Top1cc becomes SUMO dependent (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heideker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nie et al., 2012</a>). As this manuscript was being prepared, <a href=\"#bib66\">Stingele et al. (2014)</a> reported that Top1cc was a direct substrate for the protease activity of Wss1. Except where noted, we agree with these authors and have confirmed their results. The <i>wss1\u0394 tdp1\u0394</i> double mutant is very sick, sensitive to Top1 inhibitor camptothecin CPT (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), partially cured by reducing Top1 levels (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and completely cured by expressing active WT Wss1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>).

The model stains expressing MBP-tagged Top1 protein under control of GAL promoter were constructed on BY4742 and MBY24 (WSS1-GFP) genetic backgrounds (MBY42-44,49 and MBY46,47 correspondingly, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). The cells were spotted on selective media and incubated at 30\u00b0C. The bottom western blots for each panel show the corresponding expression of MBP-Top1 protein detected with MBP-specific antibody. As expected, no MBP-Top1 protein was detected in cells grown on glucose medium. (<b>C</b>) Wss1 prevents accumulation of HMW-SUMO conjugates in UV-irradiated cells (BY4742 and MBY15 strains, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Single UV dose (254 nm, 200 J/m<sup>2</sup>) induces increase in sumoylation of cellular proteins as shown by western blotting with SUMO-specific antibodies (80 \u03bcg of protein per lane for each sample). Both whole cell lysate (WCL) and chromatin fraction were analyzed. Asterisk indicates HMW SUMO conjugates. Histograms represents ImageJ quantification of total (blue) or HMW (purple) SUMO conjugates, normalized to the maximum value. Bottom panel: Wss1 protects cells from UV-induced DNA damage. WSS1 (BY4742) and wss1\u0394 (MBY15) cells were spotted on YPD plates, exposed (UV) or not (<b>C</b>) to a single UV dose (254 nm, 100 J/m<sup>2</sup>), and incubated for 2 days at 30\u00b0C."

In a <i>wss1\u0394 tdp1\u0394</i> strain, expression of Wss1 reduced both Top1 levels as well as sumoylated Top1, suggesting protease activation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Consistent with this, when WLM* was expressed, there was an even more severe growth defect and a strong accumulation of SUMO-Top1 as well as other SUMO species that might represent sumoylated Top1 fragments and/or associated proteins. Wss1 suppressed CPT-sensitivity of <i>wss1\u0394 tdp1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). Unexpectedly, \u0394SIM2 was also a suppressor, while F2R had much weaker effect.

We demonstrated that Wss1 proteolysis can be activated by thiol-modifying reagents such as thiram and APMA as well as by ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, polySUMO binding enhances the proteolysis of recombinant protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and SIM2 is required for both Wss1 and Cdc48 cleavage under conditions of stress. Thus, binding to DNA is not absolutely required for Wss1 proteolytic activity. Moreover, our observations that Wss1 can process itself, sumoylated proteins and Cdc48 demonstrate that Wss1 substrates are not limited to DNA-bound proteins, as previously suggested by <a href=\"#bib66\">Stingele et al. (2014)</a>. DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and SUMO chains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) may play a cofactor role by inducing Wss1 oligomerization and bringing together the protease and its substrates (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Our data in vitro and in vivo strongly suggest that polysumoylated proteins are the substrates for Wss1. Although the exact mechanism of how Wss1 processes SUMO conjugates remains unclear, one possible scenario may be the activation of metalloprotease and cleavage within a hinge region of the polysumoylated proteins. Alternatively, our finding that Wss1 binds to SUMO-PA, self-cleaves at C-terminus and produces a ladder of proteolytic fragments upon activation by ssDNA may suggest that it functions as a SUMO-targeted carboxypeptidase."

Sumoylation depended on tandem SIMs at the C-terminus of Wss1 and is probably the result of juxtaposed SUMO binding sites that bring SUMO thiol ester in proximity to an acceptor SUMO. Interestingly, among other known non-canonical SUMO E3-ligases, including RanBP2, polycomb Pc2, topors, Slx5, and Rad18, all, except RanBP2, catalyze sumoylation by SIM-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ii et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perry et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Merrill et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Parker and Ulrich, 2014</a>).

The extension of a SUMO-chain by Wss1 may signal assembly of Wss1 complexes required for substrate processing, as well as target these complexes to specific cellular locations.

We show that Wss1-dependent proteolysis is activated under conditions that damage DNA and is SUMO dependent. Although we too observed that Wss1-\u0394SIM2 could suppress CPT sensitivity of <i>wss1\u0394 tdp1\u0394</i> cells, competent SUMO binding is required for the clearing of HMW-SUMO conjugates as well as Wss1 targeting to <i>tdp1\u0394</i>-induced foci. Moreover, because cellular Wss1-\u0394SIM2 remained stable under various DNA-damaging conditions, it seems that SUMO binding is essential for Wss1 auto-proteolysis as well. The partial effects seen with SIM mutants may be masked by the fact that, as we have shown, the WLM domain also contributes to SUMO binding."

Indeed, their response to various genotoxic threats places Wss1 and STUbL in the same \u2018nucleotide-excision-repair\u2019 (NER) epistasis group.

Chromatin-associated proteolysis involving STUbL pathways has been linked mostly to the Cdc48/Ufd1/Npl4 complex and the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vaz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sriramachandran and Dohmen, 2014</a>). Alternatively, autophagy is implicated in Wss1-mediated processes; a third of our best-rated MS hits were proteins associated with vesicle transport and the vacuole, indicating a possible role of Cdc48/Wss1/Doa1 complex in vacuolar degradation. Doa1 has been implicated in regulation of two main vacuolar pathways, autophagy and vesicle sorting (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ren et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2010</a>). We have demonstrated that various genotoxic conditions induce accumulation of Wss1 within the vacuole. Moreover, under genotoxic stress Wss1 was found associated with autophagic vesicle-like structures in the cytoplasm and on the vacuolar membrane.

Thus, exposure of ssDNA and/or initial sumoylation of proteins at the sites of DNA damage could provide binding sites for Wss1. Its intrinsic ligase activity could then sumoylate other proteins, extending SUMO chains, become proteolytically activated. Wss1 would also recruit Doa1/Cdc48 to disassemble proteins from the damage site(s) and target the complexes to the vacuole. The proteolytic activation of Wss1 both down regulates Wss1 mediated action and fragments other proteins to induce their dissociation. Thus, we propose that autophagy processes poor proteasome substrates formed as a result of DNA damage, that is, protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleic acid crosslinks, irreversibly trapped enzymes and abnormal nucleic acid intermediates (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>).

Like Wss1, DVC1/Spartan protects cells from UV damage, probably by removing promiscuous TLS-polymerases from the chromatin. DVC1/Spartan has a putative metalloprotease domain SprT appended to a SHP motif, a PCNA-interacting PIP box and a Ub-binding Zn-finger domain UBZ4. No proteolytic activity has been observed for the proteins of the SprT family, yet the putative protease active site is essential for DVC1/Spartan function (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Mutations in DVC1/Spartan SprT domain result in genomic instability (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lessel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Maskey et al., 2014</a>) and have recently been linked to a new progeroid syndrome with early onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lessel et al., 2014</a>).

Moreover, DVC1/Spartan has several cysteine residues, one of which, conserved C205, seems not to be involved in disulfide bonds and is a potential candidate for protease regulation by a cysteine-switch mechanism. Thus, DVC1/Spartan may also be a functional protease that assists Cdc48 in removing chromatin components upon DNA damage stress. While Wss1 is targeted to SUMO, DVC1/Spartan binds PCNA and Ub, reflecting probably the differences in DDR regulation in higher and lower eukaryotes. Notably, in DVC1/Spartan from <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and other species PIP box is replaced by SIM upstream of UBZ4 domain, while some WLM proteins have both SIM and NZF (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This suggests that these proteins could have dual Ub-SUMO binding specificity and that in higher eukaryotes the SIM function is substituted by PIP motif."

Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (25,000\u00d7<i>g</i>, 0.5 hr, Avanti J-26XP Beckman Coulter). The supernatant was filtered through sterile 0.2-\u03bcm filter and added to 200 \u03bcl of pre-equilibrated anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, France).

RMN data were acquired at 278 K on an Agilent VNMRS 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance HCN cold probe and pulsed field gradients. The 1H frequencies assignment was achieved with the combined use of 1H-1H- DQF-COSY, TOCSY (mixing time 80 ms) and NOESY (mixing time: 250 ms) spectra. CYANA 2.1 was used to calculate the structure of Wss1-VIM peptide (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guntert et al., 1997</a>), using NOE restraints measured from the 1H-1H NOESY spectrum. From the observation of NOE cross peaks characteristic of alpha helical conformation daN(i,i+2) daN(i,i+3) and dNN(i,i+2) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wuthrich, 1986</a>) and the chemical shift analysis of the Ha chemical shifts of the peptide using the program TALOS (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shen et al., 2009</a>) showing helical propensities for all residues, we applied PHI and PSI dihedral angles restraints corresponding to canonical helix values along the peptide backbone. The automatically assigned NOEs were calibrated within CYANA according to their intensities. After seven rounds of calculation (10,000 steps per round), 120 cross-peak NOE assignments were used in the final calculation. The 10 lowest energy conformations of the peptide have no constraint violations and show a backbone root-mean-square deviation of 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5 and a heavy atom root- mean-square deviation of 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5."

Both by in vivo and in vitro experiments show that Wss1 promotes SUMOylation and is also responsible for clearing high molecular weight SUMO conjugates by forming a ternary complex with Cdc48 and its adaptor Doa1. The study systematically characterized the SUMO binding by Wss1 in an elegant way especially analyzing the contribution of WLM domain towards SUMO binding. Wss1 can bind to poly SUMO conjugates and also act as a SUMO ligase to promote SUMO chain formation. Proteolytic activity of Wss1 was tested in vivo and once again they showed that the metalloprotease activity is indeed SUMO-dependent during genotoxic stress. In addition, Wss1 is localized in vacuoles upon genotoxic stress in a SUMO-dependent manner indicating to the link between SUMO-dependent DDR and autophagic events."

Although we didn\u2019t address this question in detail, it seems plausible that, like for some other metalloproteases, the protease domain itself oligomerizes. Oligomerization increases the number of SUMO-binding sites and hence may further promote SUMO ligase activity (new <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). Corroborating this conclusion we found that induction of Wss1 oligomerization by OPA treatment stimulates its auto-sumoylation (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, D</a>). Finally, It may be that the SUMO binding by WLM is necessary to form a functional catalytic site, especially since SIMs present such a small interacting surface and may not be able to properly orient the SUMO for optimal catalysis."

It is already known that DDR induces autophagy and DDR components are degraded by the vacuole/lysosome (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dotiwala et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Robert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Vessoni et al., 2013</a>), and that sumoylated Cdc48 is targeted to the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib35\">Makhnevych et al., 2009</a>). Thus, it may not be surprising that Wss1 complexes with Doa1 and Cdc48 would co-localize with substrates in the vacuole."
