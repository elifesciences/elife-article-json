                    "text": "The coordination of activity across neocortical areas is essential for mammalian brain function. Understanding this process requires simultaneous functional measurements across the cortex. In order to dissociate direct cortico-cortical interactions from other sources of neuronal correlations, it is furthermore desirable to target cross-areal recordings to neuronal subpopulations that anatomically project between areas. Here, we combined anatomical tracers with a novel multi-area two-photon microscope to perform simultaneous calcium imaging across mouse primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory whisker cortex during texture discrimination behavior, specifically identifying feedforward and feedback neurons. We find that coordination of S1-S2 activity increases during motor behaviors such as goal-directed whisking and licking. This effect was not specific to identified feedforward and feedback neurons. However, these mutually projecting neurons especially participated in inter-areal coordination when motor behavior was paired with whisker-texture touches, suggesting that direct S1-S2 interactions are sensory-dependent. Our results demonstrate specific functional coordination of anatomically-identified projection neurons across sensory cortices."

Understanding this process requires simultaneous functional measurements across the cortex. In order to dissociate direct cortico-cortical interactions from other sources of neuronal correlations, it is furthermore desirable to target cross-areal recordings to neuronal subpopulations that anatomically project between areas. Here, we combined anatomical tracers with a novel multi-area two-photon microscope to perform simultaneous calcium imaging across mouse primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory whisker cortex during texture discrimination behavior, specifically identifying feedforward and feedback neurons. We find that coordination of S1-S2 activity increases during motor behaviors such as goal-directed whisking and licking. This effect was not specific to identified feedforward and feedback neurons. However, these mutually projecting neurons especially participated in inter-areal coordination when motor behavior was paired with whisker-texture touches, suggesting that direct S1-S2 interactions are sensory-dependent. Our results demonstrate specific functional coordination of anatomically-identified projection neurons across sensory cortices."

Cortico-cortical connections are formed between columnar microcircuits via long-range axons of pyramidal neurons in superficial layer 2/3 (L2/3) and deeper layer 5. A given cortical area typically establishes connectivity patterns not only with one particular area but with multiple target areas in a distributed and often reciprocal fashion (<a href=\"#bib37\">Markov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Oh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zingg et al., 2014</a>). Thus, in order to fully understand the cortical interactions underlying behavior, it is necessary to disentangle how neuronal subpopulations defined by both their functional properties and their specific anatomical projections contribute to local computation and long-range communication."

Present methods to study large-scale cortical dynamics either lack cellular resolution and sensitivity to low numbers of action potentials (e.g., human fMRI; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hutchison et al., 2013</a>; or wide-field functional imaging in mice, <a href=\"#bib24\">Ferezou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Minderer et al., 2012</a>) or they are restricted to poorly defined neuronal subsets as for extracellular recordings (<a href=\"#bib39\">Melzer et al., 2006</a>). The main limitation for these recording approaches is the reliance on correlated activity patterns to infer information flow without the additional ability to attribute such activity to anatomically-defined neuronal subsets. Consequently, it has not been possible to definitively determine whether the underlying measured inter-areal dynamics could reflect: i) direct cortico-cortical interactions; ii) indirect cortico-thalamocortical pathways; iii) or synaptic drive from common input areas. To dissect these possibilities new technologies are needed to monitor inter-areal dynamics with cellular resolution while at the same time identifying subsets of neurons that project across areas. Two-photon microscopy is well suited to monitor action potential firing across neuronal populations, mainly using calcium imaging, as well as to optically identify molecularly or anatomically-defined cell types (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013a</a>). So far, standard two-photon microscopes have been limited to imaging long-range activity within one cortical area (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Glickfeld et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jarosiewicz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Petreanu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sato and Svoboda, 2010</a>). New systems have recently been developed that enable simultaneous imaging of neuronal populations across cortical areas across increasingly larger fields of view (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lecoq et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Stirman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Here, we present a novel 'multi-area' two-photon microscope for simultaneous measurements across primary and higher sensory areas of mouse neocortex. We have combined this system with anatomical labeling strategies to identify feedforward and feedback projection neurons between reciprocally connected cortical areas to image their functional interactions. In order to investigate the role of direct cortico-cortical interactions among other potential sources of correlated activity, we have applied this approach in the whisker primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices, two areas that are anatomically coupled through reciprocal connections, cortico-thalamocortical pathways, and other common inputs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deschenes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Suter and Shepherd, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Theyel et al., 2010</a>). Expanding our recent work on the activity of divergent projection pathways originating in S1 during a texture discrimination task (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2015</a>), we sought here to examine how population activity in S1 and S2 evolves over time during such tactile whisker-based behavior. Whisking behavior spans a range of time scales, from individual whisk cycles of about 100-ms duration, to bouts of whisking over a second, and to prolonged whisking, for example during locomotion (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kleinfeld and Deschenes, 2011</a>). Our multi-area imaging approach enabled us to analyze the slower aspects of whisking envelope changes and whisker-touch contacts whereas analysis of neuronal dynamics on the rapid time scale of tens of milliseconds was precluded by our limited temporal resolution. Our main goal was, however, to take advantage of the ability to simultaneously image in S1 and S2 and to investigate how the subsets of reciprocally projecting neurons contribute to the coordination of activity across these areas and to the coding of sensory and behavior information."

To achieve this goal we coupled two laser beams through a galvanometric scanner system into a low-magnification, high-NA objective (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a> and Materials and methods). Specifically, we chose a 16x water-immersion Nikon objective (NA 0.8) as core element, which supports imaging in a FOV of 1.8-mm maximum side length with cellular resolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We split laser light from a Ti:sapphire laser (80 MHz pulse repetition rate) into two excitation beams using a 50:50 beam splitter and delayed the laser pulse train of one beam by 6.25 ns, half of the inter-pulse interval, to interlace the two pulse trains so that the two sub-areas receive alternating laser excitation pulses. For disambiguating the fluorescence signal generated by the two laser foci, we adopted a rapid de-multiplexing approach (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>). For typical 2\u20134 ns fluorescence lifetimes of fluorescent proteins (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akerboom et al., 2013</a>), the 6.25-ns time windows are sufficiently long to capture mainly fluorescence photons generated by the last excitation pulse. Some crosstalk between areas may remain but can be corrected for post hoc using spatial linear unmixing (Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>)."

The detected signal in the non-illuminated sub-area is due to crosstalk caused by the exponential fluorescence decay (shown amplified by a factor of 10 for better visibility). The crosstalk can be quantified by the ratio of both images after background subtraction (the background was estimated from a ROI placed in the dark blood vessels). The percent crosstalk estimates are averages over 10000 pixels excluding blood vessels with standard deviation. As CFP is quenched by YFP in the F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) interaction between both fluorophores, the lifetime of the CFP emission is shortened, which leads to a lower crosstalk."

Independent positioning is achieved by coupling the FPU output beams to the scanner unit via small fold mirrors that sit at the end of cantilever arms. Lateral x/y-movement of each FPU introduces an offset of the respective beam from the optical axis of the first scan lens, which converts this offset into a pivoting angle of the beam around the scan mirrors. In the remaining optical path, this pivoting angle is translated into lateral movement of the corresponding imaging sub-area below the objective. Independent focusing is achieved with electrically tunable lenses (ETLs) in the FPUs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grewe et al., 2011</a>). Each ETL is combined with an offset lens to allow tuning the beam from divergent to convergent. These divergence changes translate into axial shifts of the intermediate foci at the FPU output and in between scan and tube lens, corresponding to down- and upward shifts of the excitation focus along the optical z-axis below the objective. In combination with a 6-mm pair of scan mirrors, ETL focusing provides a z-range of up to 600 \u00b5m."

Processing of tactile information at the cortical level is thought to occur through interactions between S1, S2, as well as primary motor cortex (M1) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aronoff et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bosman et al., 2011</a>). In order to investigate direct interactions between S1 and S2, we sought to apply the multi-area two-photon microscope to simultaneously monitor activity in feedforward neurons in S1 projecting to S2 (S1<sub>S2</sub>) and feedback neurons in S2 projecting to S1 (S2<sub>S1</sub>) in wild-type adult mice during tactile whisker behavior. To distinctly label these projection neurons in a mutually exclusive manner across the reciprocally connected areas we employed a viral strategy making use of orthogonal recombinase systems. To label S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons, we delivered a retrogradely-infecting AAV6 expressing Cre recombinase (AAV6-<i>pgk-Cre</i>) into S1 along with S2-injection of an AAV1 expressing Cre-dependent nuclear tdTomato (AAV1-<i>EF1\u03b1-dio-NLStdTomato</i>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). S1<sub>S2</sub> neurons were labeled by delivering an AAV6 expressing Flpe (AAV6-<i>syn-Flpe</i>) into S2 along with S1-injection of an AAV1 expressing Flpe-dependent nuclear LSSmKate2 (AAV1-<i>EF1\u03b1-fio-H2BLSSmKate2</i>). In addition to these viruses, we broadly expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator YC-Nano140 in S1 and S2 using AAV1-<i>EF1\u03b1-YCNano140</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Horikawa et al., 2010</a>). For targeting viral injections as well as for selecting regions for later two-photon imaging, we employed optical intrinsic signal imaging to identify areas within S1 and S2 corresponding to the same principal whisker (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and Materials and methods)."

Animals were habituated to head-fixation and trained to perform a whisker-based go/no-go texture discrimination task (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2015</a>).

Using this approach, we imaged in 7 mice ~150 neurons per sub-area (distributed over three imaging planes at different cortical depths) across ~1800 trials over 5\u20136 experimental sessions. Combinatorial hopping between three imaging planes in each area resulted in simultaneous imaging of 9 combinations of planes per animal, for which ~200 trials were acquired per pair of planes, still sufficient for our analysis. In total, 228 S1<sub>S2</sub>, 817 S1<sub>ND</sub>, 193 S2<sub>S1</sub>, and 750 S2<sub>ND</sub> neurons were imaged in 63 pairs of focal planes across S1 and S2.

We first assessed for each cell class how calcium signals relate to behavioral aspects using a general linear model (GLM) against vectors for whisker-touch onset, whisking envelope amplitude, and licking onset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Miri et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pinto and Dan, 2015</a>). S1<sub>ND</sub> and\u00a0S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons showed better overall GLM fits to these behavioral parameters compared to their neuronal counterparts in their respective areas (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; S1<sub>ND</sub> vs. S1<sub>S2,</sub>p&lt;0.002; S2<sub>ND</sub> vs. S2<sub>S1,</sub>p&lt;0.005, KS-test).

While no specific differences were observed for cell classes in S1, S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons showed higher GLM coefficients than S2<sub>ND</sub> neurons for whisking and licking onset (p&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures).

Single-cell ROC analysis of Hit vs. CR trials revealed that a larger fraction of S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons compared to other neuronal classes (72%) was able to discriminate these two conditions above chance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>; p&lt;0.002, <i>\u03c7</i><sup>2</sup> test). Differences between Hit vs. CR trials could reflect encoding of sensory information, decision, or decision-related actions such as licking. To disambiguate these possibilities, we also performed ROC analysis of FA vs. CR trials, which were previously shown to consist of similar whisking and sensory conditions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Again, a larger fraction of S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons (50%) was able to discriminate these two conditions above chance (p&lt;0.05, <i>\u03c7</i><sup>2</sup> test), suggesting that this greater discrimination power of S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons represents decision- or action-related information. As an additional control, we assessed sensory-related responses by ROC analysis of P280 vs. P1200 textures on CR trials and found that S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons were not more likely to discriminate these trial types compared to other cell types (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Overall, we find that S2<sub>S1</sub> were more likely to encode for non-sensory aspects of task-related behavior compared to other neurons in S2 and S1."

To investigate how activity is coordinated across S1 and S2, we first sought a measure of population activity for each area that would capture the diverse response properties of individual neurons and allow us to determine if their dynamics evolve similarly across time. To this end, we characterized population activity in S1 and S2, respectively, by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fisher, 1936</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Safaai et al., 2013</a>). For <i>n</i> neurons in an imaging area, LDA finds for each time point an axis in <i>n</i>-dimensional space so that the distributions of population responses for two chosen trial conditions \u2013 projected onto this axis \u2013 are best separated (Materials and methods). Similar to the ROC analysis, we selected not only Hit vs. CR but also various other pairs of trial conditions that would allow us to disambiguate sensory- and behavior-related dynamics (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The dimensionality reduction resulting from this approach effectively extracts time-dependent \u2018linear discriminant\u2019 variables LD(<i>t</i>) as one-dimensional representations of neuronal population activity with respect to the chosen trial conditions. For illustration purposes, we exemplify this LDA procedure for measurements from only two neurons in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, whereas typically populations of active neurons within an imaging area were used for analysis."

We termed this cross-areal correlation LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub>, which during task performance increased immediately following whisker-touch onset for both Hit and CR trials. 500 ms after touch onset, however, LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub> remained elevated for Hit trials relative to CR trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures).

LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub> increased and peaked at licking onset and remained elevated thereafter, further suggesting that coordination of activity across S1 and S2 could be associated with such behavior."

LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub> showed an increased level prior to whisker-touch onset specifically for the subset of trials with early licking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,</a>p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures). This suggests that population activity in S1 and S2 can be coordinated during licking behavior both in the presence and absence of sensory stimulation."

During texture discrimination, animals adopted a high-amplitude, rhythmic whisking strategy prior to whisker-touch onset in anticipation of the delivered texture, which drives texture-specific kinematics and is absent in non-task sessions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2015</a>). During task conditions, we measured LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub> from population responses for CR trials (i.e. same texture, no licking) projected along the high- vs. low-amplitude whisking axis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). Similar to the results for licking behavior, high-amplitude whisking trials were associated with higher LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub> prior to and after whisker-touch onset when compared to low-amplitude whisking trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,</a>p&lt;0.02, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures), demonstrating another motor-related component of S1-S2 coordination. By using LDA for other pairs of trial conditions, we found that stimulation with distinct textures did not result in elevated LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub>, suggesting that S1-S2 coordination is not stimulus-specific (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together, this demonstrates that the coordination of population activity across S1 and S2 can be associated with licking and whisking behavior that is independent of sensory stimulus."

In order for direct cortico-cortical interactions to be present, such correlations should exist in neurons that project between those areas.

We have used this approach to investigate the contribution of cortico-cortical projection neurons to the coordinated activity patterns across these areas. While the acquisition rate of the imaging system and the kinetics of the expressed calcium indicator (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>) used in this study precludes our ability to capture the 4\u201310 ms spike latencies reported across mouse cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ferezou et al., 2007</a>) for examining spike-timing and monosynaptic relationship of long-range cortical dynamics, we nevertheless observe that population activity across S1 and S2 is coordinated during relevant task periods in a behavior-dependent manner. We took a simplified view of the population activity by performing dimensionality reduction with LDA, which is a supervised method to project high-dimensional dynamics onto a single axis. Specifically, through the analysis of correlated population responses across S1 and S2 along multiple LDA axes, we find that inter-areal coordination is associated with both goal-directed licking as well as whisking behavior and that it can occur independent of sensory stimuli. In the absence of tactile stimuli, S1<sub>S2</sub> and S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons do not show a special contribution to motor-related coordination, suggesting that this coordination does not necessarily reflect direct cortico-cortical interactions. S1 and S2 receive common input from M1 and POm, conveying efferent and re-afferent motor information (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deschenes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Suter and Shepherd, 2015</a>), and are additionally coupled by thalamic relays through POm (<a href=\"#bib61\">Theyel et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We speculate that motor-related S1 and S2 coordination could be a result of common drive or cortico-thalamocortical pathways through these shared areas. In contrast, we find a special contribution of identified S1<sub>S2</sub> and S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons to inter-areal coordination occurring during whisker-texture touch, indicating that their participation particularly depends on sensory stimuli. This contribution is most prominent when sensory stimuli and motor behavior are paired, such as upon licking onset on Hit trials, which further suggests that such cortico-cortical interactions could be involved in a form of 'active sensation'. However, we reason that this interaction does not necessarily reflect motor behavior. Given that these neurons also specially contribute to inter-areal coordination during whisker-touch periods in CR trials, we propose that these direct cortico-cortical interactions more likely represent the exchange of sensory- or decision-related activity."

Such specificity points towards distinct but potentially synergistic roles for how different inputs may be involved in information flow across the cortex. The division between direct and indirect interactions along sensory and motor parameters, respectively, is in line with theories that indirect cortico-thalamocortical pathways are more involved in relaying motor, rather than sensory, signals (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sherman and Guillery, 2011</a>). Additionally, both frontal cortical areas such as M1 and higher-order thalamic nuclei such as POm have been implicated in gating and coordinating activity across somatosensory areas (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pais-Vieira et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Theyel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zagha et al., 2013</a>). In the visual system, the pulvinar, a higher-order thalamic nuclei involved in attention, has been identified in coordinating activity between visual areas (<a href=\"#bib52\">Saalmann et al., 2012</a>). Our findings support the notion that nuclei that also drive motor-related or attention-related activity might help to coordinate primary and higher sensory areas in a manner that facilitates sensory-related direct cortico-cortical communication upon stimulus presentation."

It has been suggested that feedback inputs from higher sensory areas provide contextual information to help extract relevant sensory features provided by feedforward inputs in primary areas (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gilbert and Li, 2013</a>). We find that S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons exhibit prominent licking and decision-related activity, which is in line with recent evidence that behavior-related activity in S1 can be inherited from S2 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yang et al., 2016</a>). Coordinated activity between S1<sub>S2</sub> and S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons during texture discrimination may reflect sensory processing involved in several functions. One function may be associated with decision making, as exemplified by correlations increasing upon whisker touch onset and peaking upon licking onset on Hit trials. Another function may be associated with the reinforcement of particular aspects of the sensory signal that might strengthen or stabilize sensory representations through goal-directed learning, exemplified by the persistent coordinated activity after licking onset on Hit trials (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Future work to dissect S1<sub>S2</sub> and S2<sub>S1</sub> neuronal dynamics using projection-targeted multi-area calcium imaging will help to resolve these possibilities."

Several different approaches have been implemented for imaging across brain areas. While the use of multiple miniature objectives does not limit the maximum distance between areas that can be imaged (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lecoq et al., 2014</a>), the physical size and working distance of such objectives does limit the proximity between areas and depth that can be imaged noninvasively. The use of multiple beams through a single large-FOV, long-working distance objective thus provides a complementary approach. The multi-area two-photon miscroscope described here shares similar design principles as reported in <a href=\"#bib58\">Stirman et al. (2014)</a>. The core principles and modularity of these designs readily allows for improvements in temporal resolution through resonant, free-line, or random-access scanning systems (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bathellier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grewe et al., 2010</a>), increasing the number of simultaneously imaged areas and cortical layers with low repetition rate lasers (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Quirin et al., 2014</a>), and imaging across larger FOVs with different optical configurations (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stirman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>)."

Recombinant serotype 1 AAV particles were produced by co-transfecting AAV-293 cells with the shuttle plasmid and the pDF1 packaging plasmid. Cell lysates were subjected to purification on iodixanol density gradients followed by HPLC with HiTrap Heparin column for AAV2 or by anion exchange HPLC for AAV1 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) using standard procedures. The viral suspension obtained was concentrated using Centricon centrifugal filter devices with a molecular weight cut-off of 100\u2009kDa (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the suspension medium replaced with PBS. Vector titres were determined by measuring the number of encapsidated genomes per ml by real-time PCR."

Barrel column centres for stimulated whiskers were located by averaging intrinsic signals (15 trials), median-filtering (5-pixel radius), and thresholding to find signal minima. Reference surface vasculature images were obtained using 546-nm LED illumination and matched to images acquired during 2-photon imaging. Prior to behavior training, all whiskers excluding the principal and first-order surround whiskers corresponding to the expression area were partially trimmed to a length out of reach from texture contact during the task.

Average whisker angle across all imaged whiskers was measured using automated whisker tracking software (<a href=\"#bib31\">Knutsen et al., 2005</a>). Because our limited temporal resolution of imaging (7\u2009Hz) precluded analysis of rapid dynamics within individual whisking cycles, we based our analysis on the envelope amplitude of whisking calculated as the difference in maximum and minimum whisker angle along a sliding window equal to the imaging frame duration (142 ms). The slower dynamics of the envelope amplitude represents both rhythmic and non-rhythmic forms of whisking behavior. For comparison between high- vs. low-amplitude whisking trials, the mean whisking amplitude during the 1-s period prior to whisker-touch onset was calculated for each animal and high- and low-amplitude trials were identified as those whose amplitude during the same period was greater or less than the mean, respectively. For all trials, the first and last possible time point for whisker to texture contact was quantified manually through visual inspection."

Tensor decomposition is a method used for dimensionality reduction, which can be viewed as a generalization of singular value decomposition of data represented as tensors rather than matrices (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hitchcock, 1927</a>). While calcium imaging recordings are often described as two-dimensional matrices comprised of neurons and time dimensions, it can additionally be described along a third dimension representing trial conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). For such data, tensor decomposition can be used as a form of single-trial denoising by assuming that calcium signals across neurons, time, and trial conditions are not independent and that multi-linear relationships across dimensions therefore can be exploited. Through tensor decomposition, background noise that does not match the assumed multi-linear structure can be reduced if present. Single-trial denoising of calcium transients is desirable when analyzing conditions with low trial counts such as FA trials (7.4% of all trials) in order to improve statistical analysis of such conditions."

While the accuracy and precision of the estimated spikes may vary depending on noise in the raw trace (<a href=\"#bib35\">L\u00fctcke et al., 2013</a>), the multi-linear relationships across each tensor dimension is preserved. The estimated spike trains are then convolved using YC-Nano140 parameters to produce ideal simulated calcium transients. The degree of noise under experimental conditions is estimated by assuming that any variance in calcium signal present in inactive neurons reflects non-neuronal noise. For each inactive neuron, a normal distribution was fit to raw calcium traces to obtain \u03c3 representing the degree of noise for that neuron.

Each regressor was down sampled to match the calcium imaging frame rate. Touch onset was selected to best reflect touch-related responses given previously reported neuronal adaptation in neuronal firing upon repeated touches (<a href=\"#bib43\">Musall et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yamashita et al., 2013</a>). Whisking envelope amplitude was previously observed to best reflect periods of whisking and non-whisking behavior in order to identify whisking-related neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>). Given the slow kinetics of calcium indicators and given that the imaging rate is well below the Nyquist rate of the natural whisking frequency (~10\u2009Hz) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kleinfeld and Deschenes, 2011</a>), whisking-related signals measured here do not reflect whisking frequency. Licking onset was selected due to the observation that licking behavior in task-performing mice typically proceeds in licking bouts. Introducing additional behavioral regressors such as licking offset and touch offset to the GLM did not improve model fit (data not shown). In order to capture a physiologically realistic range of response delays to behavioral events as previously observed (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2015</a>), regressors for each behavioral parameter were generated across a range of delays from <i>i = \u2212</i>3 (<i>t</i> = 0.43\u2009s before behavior event) to <i>i =</i> +6 (<i>t</i> = 0.85\u2009s after behavioral event). Only delays from <i>i = \u2212</i>2 to <i>i</i> = +5 were included for cell type analysis.

To assess GLM fit, a coefficient of determination (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>) was calculated by comparing the predicted and the original traces. To reduce the effect of the particular choice of test trials on <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>, test trials were bootstrapped 1000 times to obtain a final <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> reflecting GLM fit. To assess the significance of individual <i>B<sub>i</sub></i>, a shuffled distribution for each <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> was obtained by permutation test after shuffling calcium traces for time points within each trial 1000 times. <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> whose value was greater than the 95 percentile of the shuffled distribution was identified as significant. GLM does not require normal distribution of the data set. Comparisons of <i>B<sub>i\u00a0</sub></i>across cell types was performed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA.

To determine the specific contribution of S1<sub>S2</sub> or S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons to cross-areal coordination, a one-dimensional modified discriminant LD\u2019(<i>t</i>) was obtained for each area by shuffling the trial-by-trial calcium responses of S1<sub>S2</sub> or S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons, respectively, and then projecting the population vector onto the LDA axis determined from the non-shuffled population response. Cross-correlation of LD\u2019<sub>S1</sub> and LD\u2019<sub>S2</sub> yielded LDCC\u2019<sub>S1:S2</sub>. Shuffling was repeated 1000 times to obtain mean and standard error for LDCC\u2019<sub>S1:S2</sub> values. The change in S1-S2 correlation (\u2206LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub>) was calculated as the mean LDCC\u2019<sub>S1:S2</sub> minus the unshuffled LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub>. Reductions in correlation strength thus show up as negative values. To control for trial shuffling of S1<sub>S2</sub> or S2<sub>S1</sub> neurons, trial shuffling was performed on an equal number of S1<sub>ND</sub> or S2<sub>ND</sub> neurons, repeated 1000 times, and \u2206LDCC<sub>S1:S2</sub> was calculated from the average cross-correlation."

In brief, monitoring of whisker movements was performed at high temporal resolution (500 Hz, which is sufficiently high to prevent aliasing). We then calculated the envelope of whisking amplitude as the difference in maximum and minimum whisker angle along a sliding window equal to the imaging frame duration (142 ms). All subsequent analysis was based on this whisking envelope amplitude. We realize that our use of \u2018whisking amplitude\u2019 may have caused confusion and was insufficiently introduced.
