                    "text": "NCOA4 is a selective cargo receptor for the autophagic turnover of ferritin, a process critical for regulation of intracellular iron bioavailability. However, how ferritinophagy flux is controlled and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood. Through analysis of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, we demonstrate that direct association via a key surface arginine in FTH1 and a C-terminal element in NCOA4 is required for delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes. Moreover, NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. This work reveals the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and explains how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting."

However, how ferritinophagy flux is controlled and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood. Through analysis of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, we demonstrate that direct association via a key surface arginine in FTH1 and a C-terminal element in NCOA4 is required for delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes. Moreover, NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. This work reveals the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and explains how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting."

However, iron can also trigger the formation of harmful molecules that can damage cells. It is therefore crucial that the amount of iron in cells is tightly controlled and that any extra iron is safely stored away. Most of the iron in the body is stored within a protein called ferritin, which is then broken down to release iron as it is needed, in a process known as ferritinophagy."

During autophagy, a bubble-like structure called an autophagosome engulfs proteins that need to be removed and delivers them to a compartment in the cell where they can be broken down. In 2014, researchers showed that a protein called NCOA4 on the surface of autophagosomes targets ferritin for destruction. When iron levels are high in the cell, the amount of NCOA4 on the autophagosomes is low. This leads to fewer ferritin molecules being broken down. In contrast, low iron levels lead to an increase of NCOA4 on autophagosomes, which promotes ferritinophagy and increases the amount of iron in the cell."

The experiments show the amount of NCOA4 varies depending on whether it interacts with another protein called HERC2, which targets proteins for destruction by a structure called the proteasome. HERC2 only binds to NCOA4 when iron levels are high, which leads to NCOA4 being broken down by the proteasome. When iron levels are low, HERC2 does not interact with NCOA4. The presence of more NCOA4 then leads to more ferritinophagy, and so increases the amount of iron in the cell."

However, the levels of free iron in a cell must be tightly controlled to avoid the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the Fenton reaction (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dixon and Stockwell, 2014</a>). As such, iron metabolism is a tightly regulated process controlled by a network of iron-dependent proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pantopoulos et al., 2012</a>). The cell has evolved mechanisms whereby iron can be sequestered and released from protein complexes in response to changing iron levels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson et al., 2012</a>). One such protein is ferritin, which forms a complex of 24 subunits (consisting of a mixture of ferritin heavy and light chains, FTH1 and FTL, respectively) capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arosio et al., 2009</a>). When iron levels in the cell are low, ferritin is degraded allowing the release of iron for use by the cell. Ferritin is degraded in the lysosome and recent evidence implicated autophagy, a conserved catabolic cellular pathway, in the \u2018ferritinophagy\u2019 process (<a href=\"#bib30\">Radisky and Kaplan, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Asano et al., 2011</a>). Through quantitative proteomic analysis of purified autophagosomes, we recently identified NCOA4 as the selective autophagy receptor that targets ferritin to the autophagosome, providing the first mechanistic explanation of how ferritinophagy occurs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mancias et al., 2014</a>). We further showed that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is important for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. NCOA4 was subsequently identified as an ubiquitylation target when the VPS34 autophagy activator is inhibited and also was found to promote ferritinophagy (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dowdle et al., 2014</a>)."

Interestingly, NCOA4 has been reported to bind FTH1, but not FTL, in cell extracts (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dowdle et al., 2014</a>); however, the biochemical basis of this specificity is unclear, especially given that FTH1 and FTL are 53% identical and 66% similar in primary sequence. In most cell types, ferritin complexes are composed of both heavy and light chains. The identification of point mutants that specifically abolish these interactions could facilitate a further dissection of NCOA4 function."

                        "text": "Second, given that NCOA4 levels appear to control flux through the ferritinophagy pathway, what mechanisms control the abundance of NCOA4? We previously reported that NCOA4 levels are altered by intracellular iron status (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mancias et al., 2014</a>); when iron levels are high, NCOA4 abundance is low, thereby promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture. But when iron is low, NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these processes is limited and is complicated by the fact that the pool of NCOA4 participating in targeting ferritin to autophagosomes is apparently degraded within lysosomes. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that control NCOA4 abundance could help unravel the physiological underpinnings of flux through the ferritinophagy pathway, with implications for understanding iron utilization. Our recent work revealed HERC2, a large multi-domain homologous to E6AP carboxy terminus (HECT) E3 ubiquitin ligase, as an NCOA4-interacting protein (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mancias et al., 2014</a>). HERC2 is reported to associate with numerous proteins and likely has multiple ubiquitylation targets, including E6AP and proteins linked to DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Martinez-Noel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Moroishi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Galligan et al., 2015</a>). Intriguingly, HERC2 associates with the SCF<sup>FBLX5</sup> ubiquitin ligase (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tan et al., 2013</a>) and has recently been implicated in the basal turnover of FBXL5 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Moroishi et al., 2014</a>), a key iron-sensing protein that promotes turnover of the ferritin translational repressor IRP2 (Iron Regulatory Protein 2, also known as IREB2) when iron is high (<a href=\"#bib33\">Salahudeen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Vashisht et al., 2009</a>). However, the precise role that HERC2, iron, and the ubiquitin system play in regulating NCOA4, and how this is related to NCOA4 autophagic turnover during ferritinophagy remains unexplored."

Moreover, recent transcriptomic analysis shows significant upregulation of <i>NCOA4</i> at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation in humans, the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis, a highly iron dependent process (<a href=\"#bib2\">An et al., 2014</a>). Prior studies have demonstrated defects in erythroid differentiation upon deletion of canonical autophagy genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2015</a>); however, these studies focused on an inability to clear mitochondria during erythroid maturation due to dysfunctional mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mortensen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li-Harms et al., 2015</a>). While it is clear that iron obtained via holo-transferrin endocytosis is used for heme synthesis during erythroid differentiation, there is debate as to the intracellular itinerary of this iron once liberated from transferrin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lane et al., 2015</a>). There is evidence that transferrin-liberated endosomal iron is transferred directly to mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sheftel et al., 2007</a>); however, additional studies show that ferritin-sequestered iron is also utilized for heme synthesis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vaisman et al., 1997</a>)."

                        "text": "Here, we use in-depth biochemical and cell culture studies, as well as the zebrafish system to dissect the roles of NCOA4, Ferritin, and HERC2 in mediating ferritinophagy and the role of ferritinophagy in erythropoiesis. We show that NCOA4 interacts directly with FTH1 via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1. Mutation at these binding sites abrogates binding in vivo and abolishes ferritinophagy. We show that the HERC2 ligase uses its \u2018CUL7-homology domain\u2019 to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby reducing the steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture. Surprisingly, we find that this same C-terminal domain within NCOA4 binds iron and the iron-bound state of NCOA4 determines HERC2 binding, suggesting an iron-dependent switch in NCOA4 turnover. Finally, we show that NCOA4 is important for erythropoiesis in vivo given its role in mobilizing iron from ferritin for use in heme synthesis. This study establishes the importance of NCOA4 as a critical regulator of cellular and organismal iron metabolism and reveals the mechanistic underpinnings of its iron-dependent regulation."

                                "text": "There is little structural information available for NCOA4 apart from predicted coiled coil domains at the N-terminus. While NCOA4 orthologs exist throughout metazoans, there is minimal sequence homology within the proteome. Sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction, and tertiary structure prediction were used to design NCOA4 fragments for identification of the ferritin-binding domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The N-terminus of NCOA4 consists of predicted coiled coil domains that have been previously shown to mediate oligomerization of NCOA4 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Monaco et al., 2001</a>). This domain is present in both NCOA4 splice variants, encoding a 614-residue \u03b1 isoform and a 287-residue \u03b2 isoform (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alen et al., 1999</a>). We therefore tested binding of purified apoferritin from horse spleen (containing both FTH1 and FTL) in vitro to recombinant full-length Myc-tagged NCOA4\u03b1, NCOA4\u03b2 (to rule out a folded motif consisting of the N-terminus and a short portion of the C-terminus), NCOA4-N-terminus (NCOA4<sup>1\u2212245</sup>), and NCOA4-C-terminus (NCOA4<sup>235\u2212614</sup>). Ferritin associated with both NCOA4\u03b1 and the NCOA4 C-terminal fragment but not with NCOA4\u03b2 or the NCOA4 N-terminal fragment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Further truncation constructs were designed based on secondary structure prediction and ferritin binding in vitro was mapped to NCOA4 amino acids 383\u2013522 (NCOA4<sup>383\u2212522</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C,D</a>). This portion of NCOA4 is predicted to contain four \u03b1-helices and constitutes a discrete sub-domain of NCOA4 not present in NCOA4\u03b2. To determine if a discrete portion of this region binds ferritin, we made further truncation constructs and demonstrated binding to amino acids 475\u2013522 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). There was a significant loss of binding efficiency to ferritin when further truncation constructs were tested; however, residual binding was seen with amino acids 485\u2013509 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Given the overlapping nature of truncation constructs in this experiment, we tested whether deletion of amino acids 490\u2013499 within the NCOA4<sup>383\u2212522</sup> construct affected binding in vitro. This construct completely abrogated binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Alanine scanning mutagenesis across this region identified W497 and to a lesser extent I489, S492, L494, and L498 as important residues for ferritin binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Mutation of I489 and W497 (NCOA4<sup>I489/W497A</sup>) in the context of NCOA4<sup>383\u2212522</sup> abrogated binding to ferritin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, NCOA4 associates directly with ferritin in vitro and employs sequences in a predicted helical domain for this interaction."

We initially identified both FTH1 and FTL as binding partners of NCOA4 and confirmed a reciprocal interaction by FTH1 pulldown (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mancias et al., 2014</a>). While Dowdle et al. recently showed that NCOA4 appears to selectively recognize the FTH1 subunit of ferritin in vivo (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dowdle et al., 2014</a>), it remains unclear whether the NCOA4-ferritin interaction occurs in a direct manner or requires intermediate factors for binding. While the above experiments with purified ferritin from horse spleen and recombinant NCOA4 suggested a direct interaction, we subsequently produced recombinant FTH1-only and FTL-only ferritin complexes and tested for direct interactions with recombinant NCOA4. NCOA4 specifically recognizes recombinant FTH1, confirming the prior specificity and also demonstrating that NCOA4 recognizes FTH1 directly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As NCOA4 interacts with the 450 kDa ferritin complex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dowdle et al., 2014</a>), we predicted that NCOA4 binds to the surface of ferritin and that differences in FTH1 vs FTL surface residues dictate NCOA4 specificity for FTH1.

Since aberrant degradation of ferritin in lysosomes would be deleterious to the cell when intracellular iron is high, we next sought to elucidate the mechanism whereby cells suppress NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy under iron-replete conditions. We previously noted that NCOA4 levels are altered by iron status; when iron is high, NCOA4 abundance is low thereby promoting ferritin accumulation, and when iron is low, NCOA4 levels are high, thereby promoting ferritinophagy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mancias et al., 2014</a>). We noted that previous interaction proteomics revealed the large HECT E3 ligase HERC2 as a high confidence NCOA4 interacting protein (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mancias et al., 2014</a>). We hypothesized that HERC2 may regulate NCOA4 levels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Indeed, previous proteomics experiments identified multiple ubiquitylation sites on NCOA4 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dowdle et al., 2014</a>). We further reasoned that the iron-dependent regulation of NCOA4 levels may be a result of iron-dependent recognition of NCOA4 by HERC2. Therefore we first examined the binding of endogenous HERC2 to NCOA4 in cells under iron replete and deficient conditions. Cells were treated with iron chelator (DFO), or loaded with excess iron (FAC) followed by HERC2 or NCOA4 immunoprecipitation (IP). Immunoblot analysis of endogenous NCOA4 revealed an interaction with HERC2 under basal cell culture conditions where iron is replete and that this interaction was enhanced under excess iron conditions. Conversely, HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was severely attenuated following iron chelation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We also examined endogenous HERC2 binding to stably expressed NCOA4-FLAG-HA (CTAP) tagged protein under iron replete and deficient conditions. Immunoblot analysis of endogenous HERC2 revealed an interaction in iron replete and excess iron conditions, while HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was attenuated following iron chelation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Our previous work revealed a reduction in NCOA4 protein expression upon excess iron loading (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mancias et al., 2014</a>). Knockdown of HERC2 using two independent siRNAs resulted in accumulation of NCOA4 protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated HERC2 depletion promoted a significant increase in NCOA4 half-life (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). Further supporting a role for HERC2 in regulating NCOA4 stability in the presence of high intracellular iron, overexpression of HERC2<sup>F3\u22126</sup> abrogated NCOA4 loss following excess iron loading likely through interfering with the binding of NCOA4 to endogenous HERC2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). Similarly, HERC2 knockdown stabilized NCOA4 following FAC treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Notably, HERC2 depletion did not result in complete stabilization of NCOA4 turnover. Consistently, pre-treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Btz) only partly rescued NCOA4 turnover in response to cycloheximide (CHX) treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Likewise, pre-treatment of cells with the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin (Baf) only partly rescued NCOA4 turnover in response to CHX treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We determined that in addition to HERC2-dependent turnover, NCOA4 also undergoes turnover via basal autophagy. Under iron deficient conditions, despite continued autophagic turnover, the apparent lack of HERC2 action on NCOA4 leads to a net increase in NCOA4 protein level thereby promoting ferritinophagy to release iron from ferritin for use by the cell."

Efforts to map the interaction to a sub-domain of NCOA4<sup>383\u2212522</sup> were unsuccessful and suggest that the binding requires a folded epitope on NCOA4. Notably, mutation of residues I489 and W497 had no effect on binding to HERC2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) suggesting a HERC2 binding site distinct from that for FTH1. We further mapped the binding on HERC2 to the minimal CUL7 domain (amino acids 2553\u20132639; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Similar to in vivo studies, this interaction was dependent on a chelatable iron ion as DFO attenuated binding in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The dependence of the HERC2-NCOA4 interaction on iron levels suggests that either the complex or the individual components bind an iron molecule. While neither NCOA4 nor the HERC2 CUL7 domain have predicted iron binding sites (<a href=\"#bib29\">Passerini et al., 2011</a>), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis showed that iron co-purified with a recombinant fragment of NCOA4<sup>383\u2212509</sup>, but not the HERC2 CUL7 domain or buffer alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

This interaction appears to be present basally in all cells examined suggesting that some basal level of ferritinophagy is necessary to maintain iron homeostasis under standard tissue culture conditions. As discussed below, higher levels of NCOA4 during periods of iron depletion increase ferritinophagy, suggesting that flux through the ferritinophagy pathway is controlled by NCOA4 abundance. While we have not directly ascertained the stoichiometry of the NCOA4-FTH1 complex, our data utilizing the FTH1<sup>R23A</sup> mutant in control cells suggests it is far less than a 1:1 stoichiometry. Lentiviral-based expression of FTH1<sup>R23A</sup> in HCT116 cells leads to expression of FTH1<sup>R23A</sup> above endogenous FTH1 levels, with the predominance of ferritin complexes being composed of primarily the FTH1<sup>R23A</sup> subunit and sub-stoichiometry levels of endogenous wild type FTH1 that remains competent to bind NCOA4. Despite this, GFP-FTH1<sup>R23A</sup> labeled ferritin complexes still localized to punctate lysosomes suggesting that one or a few wild type FTH1 molecules in the complex is sufficient for targeting. This would be consistent with a model whereby a single NCOA4 molecule (or more likely two NCOA4 molecules given the oligomerization-mediating N-terminal coiled coil domain in NCOA4) is sufficient for targeting one 24-subunit ferritin complex for degradation. This finding is significant given the varying composition of ferritin complexes in different cell types including cell types with predominantly FTL expression (e.g., spleen and liver) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arosio et al., 2009</a>). The expectation is that even in cells predominantly expressing FTL, NCOA4 would be able to function to promote ferritinophagy. This finding also suggests that even small changes in the pool of NCOA4 would be sufficient to alter ferritinophagy levels. Further delineation of the binding determinants of the NCOA4-FTH1 complex will require structural approaches."

While the sheer size of HERC2 precludes traditional in vitro studies, we demonstrate that HERC2 ablation or overexpression of HERC2<sup>F3\u22126</sup> (amino acids 2540\u20132700 containing the NCOA4 binding site) stabilizes endogenous NCOA4 under iron-replete conditions. We noted that NCOA4 remains unstable, albeit with significantly slower kinetics, upon HERC2 depletion, and pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib rescues, but does not completely restore NCOA4 protein expression following CHX treatment. Likewise, blockade of autophagy only partially stabilizes NCOA4. These data indicate that NCOA4 levels are under the control of dual autophagic and proteasomal systems, and both are operative in the setting of intermediate iron levels as observed under typical cell culture conditions. Turnover through autophagy could be linked specifically to its capture during the process of ferritinophagy, although we cannot rule out the possibility that NCOA4 also has additional cargo that may also contribute to its flux through the autophagy system. When iron is available, the iron bound pool of NCOA4 can be targeted for ubiquitylation by HERC2, leading to NCOA4 turnover through the proteasome. When iron levels are low, such as modeled here by chelation, a pool of NCOA4 is liberated from the grasp of HERC2 and may then participate in trafficking of ferritin to the lysosome. Inappropriate depletion or accumulation of FTH1 may also provide insight into the dynamics of NCOA4 turnover. While FTH1 knockout leads to a marked decrease in NCOA4 levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), likely due to an increase in free iron thereby activating HERC2-mediated turnover, over-expression of wild type FTH1 leads to a marked accumulation of NCOA4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This may be due to an over-abundance of ferritin complexes chelating free iron (as suggested by a rise in IRP2 levels, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>); however, as re-expression of FTH1<sup>R23A</sup> in FTH1-null cells leads to only a modest increase in NCOA4 there is likely some ability of ferritin complexes to sequester NCOA4 from degradation via HERC2 and even autophagy. A model that depicts multiple modes of regulation of NCOA4 is provided in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. The structural determinants of NCOA4 iron binding and how iron is loaded onto NCOA4 have yet to be determined but we do note the presence of multiple conserved cysteine residues throughout NCOA4 that may play a role in iron binding."

One of the defining aspects of erythroid differentiation is the requirement for massive amounts of iron to support the synthesis of increasing amounts of hemoglobin in the late stages of erythroblast maturation (<a href=\"#bib2\">An et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, of the approximately 3\u20135 g of iron in the human body, greater than 2 g is present as heme in hemoglobin of erythrocytes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pantopoulos et al., 2012</a>). While it is clear that iron is delivered to erythroblasts via circulating transferrin and that this iron is required for heme synthesis in the mitochondria, the intracellular itinerary of iron once liberated from transferrin is unclear in the developing erythroblast. Prior studies suggest either direct delivery of endosomal iron to the mitochondria vs an intermediate storage step in ferritin followed by lysosomal degradation of ferritin with subsequent iron release (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vaisman et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sheftel et al., 2007</a>). Our findings suggest that in the developing zebrafish and during hemin-induced erythroid-like K562 differentiation, the majority of iron obtained via endocytosed holo-transferrin is stored in ferritin before release via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy. In support of this model is a recent transcriptome analysis showing a significant upregulation of <i>NCOA4</i> mRNA into the top 25 highest expressed genes at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation, the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis (<a href=\"#bib2\">An et al., 2014</a>). While <i>FTL</i> mRNA remains within the top 25 mRNAs expressed throughout all terminal erythroid differentiation steps, <i>FTH1</i> mRNA peaks at the final two stages (polychromatic erythroblast and orthochromatic erythroblast). As NCOA4 specifically recognizes FTH1 and not FTL, this could suggest that during erythroid development there is a switch in the composition of ferritin complexes from predominantly FTL favoring storage of iron to a mix of FTH1-FTL. At later stages when iron is required for heme biosynthesis, NCOA4 could then more efficiently and with better kinetics target for degradation ferritin complexes with this higher FTH1-FTL ratio. The modulation of <i>NCOA4</i> transcript levels during erythroid differentiation suggests an additional layer of regulation of <i>NCOA4</i> at the transcriptional level that we do not yet understand beyond the post-translational roles of HERC2 and autophagy."

The authors do not specifically note a defect in erythropoiesis in their mice; however, as splenic macrophages play an important role in turnover of senescent red blood cells and a role in maintaining erythropoiesis during pathological erythropoiesis states, this suggests some defect in erythropoiesis for which splenic macrophages may be compensating (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ramos et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, the role of NCOA4 in erythropoiesis could be limited to the setting of embryonic development and stress erythropoiesis which our zebrafish and K562 model systems are best suited to evaluate. Further study of NCOA4 in vivo in specific tissue compartments, including the erythropoietic compartment, will be necessary in order to decipher the role of NCOA4 in not only erythropoiesis but also overall organismal iron metabolism."

In this process, NCOA4 captures ferritin with bound iron and directs it into the autophagy pathway where it is degraded, liberating bound iron. In the present manuscript, they make some key discoveries. First, the C-terminus of NCOA4 binds directly to FTH1 through a critical surface-exposed R residue. Second, not only autophagy, but also the ubiquitin pathway controls NCOA4 levels via iron binding and HERC2-directed degradation. Third, NCOA4 is important for erythroid differentiation in two different models, establishing the physiological context where this process is important."

While this additional optional experiment using the K562 system would be of interest, we feel that the current data of rescue with wild-type vs mutant NCOA4 or FTH1 in the HCT116 knockout cell lines provided clear evidence that mutant NCOA4 or FTH1 cannot facilitate ferritinophagy. Therefore, these additional experiments would not add significantly to the conclusions of the paper. We previously sought to address wild-type vs mutant NCOA4 function in K562 cells by deleting NCOA4 as we did in the HCT116 system followed by reconstitution with mutant NCOA4; however, we were unable to obtain viable NCOA4 knockout clones. Attempts to knockout FTH1 in K562s were similarly unsuccessful. This supports our data showing the importance of iron/ferritinophagy in this cell type as it is unable to tolerate complete knockout and the pressure of repopulating from a single cell clone. As such we used a previously validated RNAi approach to modulate NCOA4 expression. In addition to the K562 experiments, we used independently designed RNAi to zebrafish NCOA4 and obtained similar results, strengthening our argument with respect to the importance of NCOA4 in erythropoiesis."
