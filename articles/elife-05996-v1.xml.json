Here, through a genome-wide genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i>, we uncover a highly complex Notch-dependent genetic circuitry that profoundly affects proliferation and consequently hyperplasia. We report a novel synergistic relationship between Notch and either of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src42A and Src64B to promote hyperplasia and tissue disorganization, which results in cell cycle perturbation, JAK/STAT signal activation, and differential regulation of Notch targets. Significantly, the JNK pathway is responsible for the majority of the phenotypes and transcriptional changes downstream of Notch-Src synergy. We previously reported that Notch-Mef2 also activates JNK, indicating that there are commonalities within the Notch-dependent proliferation circuitry; however, the current data indicate that Notch-Src accesses JNK in a significantly different fashion than Notch-Mef2."

Here, through a genome-wide genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i>, we uncover a highly complex Notch-dependent genetic circuitry that profoundly affects proliferation and consequently hyperplasia. We report a novel synergistic relationship between Notch and either of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src42A and Src64B to promote hyperplasia and tissue disorganization, which results in cell cycle perturbation, JAK/STAT signal activation, and differential regulation of Notch targets. Significantly, the JNK pathway is responsible for the majority of the phenotypes and transcriptional changes downstream of Notch-Src synergy. We previously reported that Notch-Mef2 also activates JNK, indicating that there are commonalities within the Notch-dependent proliferation circuitry; however, the current data indicate that Notch-Src accesses JNK in a significantly different fashion than Notch-Mef2."

Given that Notch defines an essential, ancient, and highly pleiotropic developmental pathway, it is plausible that the genetic circuitry that has evolved to influence the biological outcome of Notch signals is complex. The present analysis highlights the complexity and, significantly, the subtlety of Notch signal synergies. We focused our attention here on N/Src synergy partly because the proliferation phenotype we monitor depends, like our previously reported N/Mef2 synergy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pallavi et al., 2012</a>), on the activation of JNK signals. Importantly, however, we demonstrate that N/Src both accesses and interprets JNK signals in a manner distinct from that of N/Mef2. This sort of differential access to the same pathway to effect developmental outcomes may serve as a paradigm of the integration of a pleiotropic signal, such as Notch, with diverse, context-dependent factors. In turn, understanding the mechanisms of signal integration has profound implications for both normal development and disease."

We also did not score combinations that were 100% lethal. Therefore, we do not expect to find every member of a complex or pathway or all redundant genes. In light of the above information, we presume that the true number of genes that can modify Notch-induced proliferation phenotypes is far greater (perhaps at least double) than the 360 we have identified in this work, indicating a surprising complexity and diversity of the potential genetic circuitry that can, in conjunction with Notch signals, affect proliferation."

This finding is corroborated by the observation that nanos can directly repress <i>Cyclin B (CycB)</i> in the germline, thereby preventing mitosis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kadyrova et al., 2007</a>). However, we also identified <i>c04775</i>, a predicted disruption of <i>Cyclin B3 (CycB3)</i>, as an enhancer; the evidence would suggest that loss of mitotic cyclins should, like <i>nanos</i> GOF, suppress rather than enhance hyperplasia. It is conceivable that this may point to a context-specific feedback regulation that, if indeed true, may have implications for oncogenesis. Such an interesting possibility, however, awaits experimental corroboration especially in view of the fact that additional analysis would be necessary to ensure that <i>c04775</i> is indeed a true loss-of-function mutation of <i>CycB3.</i>"

Given that the majority of N/Src phenotypes and changes in almost 70% of the transcriptional targets can be effectively reversed upon JNK inhibition it seems clear that the major target of the N/Src synergy is the JNK pathway. Our previously reported N/Mef2 synergy activates JNK via the TNF ligand <i>egr</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pallavi et al., 2012</a>), which is clearly not the case for N/Src, which actually causes suppression of both <i>egr</i> and its receptor. Additionally, N/Src causes a great deal of apoptosis, whereas N/Mef2 does not, and only N/Src is capable of differentially upregulating <i>E(spl)m\u03b3</i>. Finally, although both combinations activate JAK/STAT ligands, the degree of upregulation is more than an order of magnitude greater for N/Src vs N/Mef2. These observations suggest that while JNK activation may be a common thread in Notch-related hyperplastic phenotypes, there may be multiple routes through which a single pathway (JNK) is activated, and this difference in access may subsequently contribute to differential downstream outputs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

Our observation of differential regulation of the <i>E(spl)</i> complex genes supports the notion that Src modulates the target specificity of Notch.

Like ESCs, N/Src cells remain in an actively proliferating state rather than undergoing G1 arrest followed by differentiation. Therefore, this raises the very interesting possibility that N/Src synergy may interfere with cell fate determination, conferring pluripotency. This could have important implications for tumorigenicity as well as for the maintenance of a differentiated state. A recent report found that Src42A and Src64B in <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal stem cells (ISCs) could stimulate the expansion of a transit-amplifying population of Notch-positive cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kohlmaier et al., 2014</a>).

However, invasiveness is only one part of the oncogenic equation. Once they have migrated into a tissue, metastatic cells also need to grow and proliferate, preferably in an unchecked fashion. Our work suggests that the addition of Notch promotes hyperplastic growth while still retaining and perhaps even enhancing Src-driven invasive behavior. Strikingly, this occurs even in the presence of significant amounts of apoptosis. Should an additional mutation or gene activation occur that suppresses this cell death, the N/Src cells may become even more malignant.

AlexaFluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were used at 1:1000.

All positive hits were rescreened a second time to eliminate false positives; furthermore, they were crossed to E1Gal4 alone to eliminate Notch-independent effects. We identified 332 Exelixis lines that either enhanced or suppressed the large eye phenotype. The determination of genes predicted to be affected by each Exelixis line was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sen et al., 2013</a>). In some cases, more than one gene may be affected either due to multiple insertions or to insertion of an element in or near overlapping or neighboring genes. Mapping of <i>Drosophila</i> genes to human orthologs was performed using tables generated by Mark Gerstein's group at Yale University, where <i>Drosophila</i>-human ortholog pairs were identified based on three sources\u2014InParanoid, OrthoMCL and TreeFarm (<a href=\"http://info.gersteinlab.org/Ortholog_Resources\">http://info.gersteinlab.org/Ortholog_Resources</a>).
