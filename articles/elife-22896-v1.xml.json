It is unknown whether such sensitivity to spatial patterns can be accomplished in simpler nervous <i>systems</i> that lack long-range sensory modalities such as vision and hearing. Here we show that the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can discriminate spatial patterns in its surroundings, despite having a nervous system of only 302 neurons. This spatial pattern selectivity requires touch-dependent dopamine signaling, including the mechanosensory TRP-4 channel in dopaminergic neurons and the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3. We find that spatial pattern selectivity varies significantly among <i>C. elegans</i> wild isolates. Electrophysiological recordings show that natural variations in TRP-4 reduce the mechanosensitivity of dopaminergic neurons. Polymorphic substitutions in either TRP-4 or DOP-3 alter the selectivity of spatial patterns. Together, these results demonstrate an ancestral role for dopamine signaling in tuning spatial pattern preferences in a simple nervous system."

It is unknown whether such sensitivity to spatial patterns can be accomplished in simpler nervous <i>systems</i> that lack long-range sensory modalities such as vision and hearing. Here we show that the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can discriminate spatial patterns in its surroundings, despite having a nervous system of only 302 neurons. This spatial pattern selectivity requires touch-dependent dopamine signaling, including the mechanosensory TRP-4 channel in dopaminergic neurons and the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3. We find that spatial pattern selectivity varies significantly among <i>C. elegans</i> wild isolates. Electrophysiological recordings show that natural variations in TRP-4 reduce the mechanosensitivity of dopaminergic neurons. Polymorphic substitutions in either TRP-4 or DOP-3 alter the selectivity of spatial patterns. Together, these results demonstrate an ancestral role for dopamine signaling in tuning spatial pattern preferences in a simple nervous system."

Animals with complex nervous systems utilize multiple sensory modalities such as vision, touch, and hearing to perceive spatial patterns that reflect the physical structure of their environment. But can animals with much simpler nervous systems detect and discriminate spatial patterns in their environment as well? To address this question, we investigated the roundworm <i>C. elegans,</i> which feeds and reproduces in decomposing fruits and plant stems (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barri\u00e8re and F\u00e9lix, 2014</a>). <i>C. elegans</i> has only 302 neurons and lack vision and hearing, mainly relying on smell and touch to sense their environment. <i>C. elegans</i> uses the sense of touch (or mechanosensation) to detect physical contact with external objects. For example, touch to the worm body or nose elicits reflex withdrawal responses (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chalfie and Sulston, 1981</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Chalfie and Wolinsky, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sulston et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Way and Chalfie, 1989</a>), which allows the\u00a0worms to quickly avoid potential danger. Beyond reflex, mechanosensation could also provide important information about the physical structure of the environment, aiding in navigation and spatial orientation. Indeed, mechanosensory detection of food elicits a slowing in <i>C. elegans</i> locomotion, increasing the time spent where food is present (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sawin et al., 2000</a>). However, it remains unknown whether <i>C. elegans</i> mechanosensation is limited to such binary distinctions between the presence and absence of food, or whether it enables more general and refined perception of particular spatial patterns, and if so, how this depends on context and experience. These questions are important for determining to what extent a simple animal can sense the spatial arrangement of physical features in its surroundings, providing general insights about how animals perceive spatial patterns."

This spatial pattern selectivity is not a fixed behavior. Instead, it is modified by experience and by internal states such as starvation. Among <i>C. elegans</i> wild isolates, the absolute degree of spatial pattern preference is tuned by natural variations in the mechanosensory channel TRP-4 and the dopamine receptor DOP-3, leading to differential behavioral responses to identical environmental settings. These results suggest that the sense of the physical surroundings may undergo rapid evolutionary expansion to diversify the choice of preferred habitat, and perhaps to benefit the survival of the species."

Pillar density increased in the four patterns from zero pillars (Pattern I) to the highest density of pillars (Pattern IV). We found that the Bristol N2 strain exhibits a strong preference for pattern IV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Approximately 63% of N2 worms were found in the section containing pattern IV 60 min after entering the chamber. By contrast, we observed only 9\u201315% of worms in each of the other sections I, II and III (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) with lower pillar densities. The strong preference for pattern IV was also indicated by a high positive value of a spatial pattern preference index (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; Methods). To investigate the robustness of this pattern selectivity, we quantified N2 preference for pattern IV at various time points (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Pattern IV preference was very stable between 60 and 90 min, but was reduced at 120 min. This decrease was likely due to starvation, as addition of food (OP50 bacteria) into the chamber prolonged the preference for pattern IV, which lasted at least 180 min (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Consistent with this notion, worms that had already been starved prior to the experiment exhibited a significant reduction in pattern IV preference (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), indicating that feeding state (starvation) can override an inherent preference for pattern selectivity."

Single-worm pattern preference index values were similar to those obtained in population experiments (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), indicating that pattern selectivity is an individual rather than group behavior. To identify the sensory modality used for pattern selection, we analyzed mutant worms that have defects in either oxygen or touch sensation. <i>C. elegans</i> exhibits aggregation behavior at optimal oxygen levels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheung et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2004</a>). We thus examined whether oxygen sensation might play a role in the observed clustering within pattern IV. To this end, we tested mutant worms that lack the GCY-35 soluble guanylate cyclase and are defective in oxygen-dependent aggregation, bordering, and social feeding behaviors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheung et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2004</a>). However, these mutant <i>gcy-35</i> worms continued to show preference for pattern IV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), indicating that pattern IV selectivity was independent of possible variations in oxygen levels and oxygen sensing. By contrast, mutant worms with dysfunctional MEC-10 DEG/ENaC channels showed a significant reduction in their preference for pattern IV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To understand where MEC-10 functions, we performed cell-specific rescue experiments. As expected, single-copy <i>Pmec-10::mec-10</i> transgenes that drive MEC-10 expression in the six touch receptor neurons and in PVD and FLP neurons fully restored the preference for pattern IV. Expression of MEC-10 under <i>Pegl-44</i> in FLP and HSN neurons (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wu et al., 2001</a>) also rescued the defects in <i>mec-10(tm1552)</i> mutant worms. By contrast, MEC-10 expression in the six touch receptor neurons (driven by <i>Pmec-18</i>) did not recover the preference for pattern IV. Together, these data indicate that MEC-10 acts in the polymodal nociceptive FLP neurons to support the selection of pattern IV."

First, we considered local effects occurring at the boundaries between adjacent patterns. We tracked worms that left pattern IV and entered into the less desired pattern III (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and found that these worms re-crossed back into the preferred pattern IV at a much higher rate than worms already within pattern IV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We also found an increase in both reversal and turning rates when worms cross the IV-to-III boundary (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Therefore, worms sense local changes in pattern density, and respond quickly to unfavorable changes by reorientation, reinforcing our finding of their ability to make decisions based on comparisons of spatial density. Second, we examined whether worm locomotion within pattern IV was affected by the presence of neighboring patterns. We hypothesized that preceding experience of alternative spatial configurations would have a lasting impact on worm behavior within preferred pattern IV. To test this hypothesis, we designed an additional chamber (designated uni-chamber; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) containing only\u00a0a pattern IV pillar configuration throughout its surface and no other patterns. We compared the speed and pause rates of worms within pattern IV in both quad- and uni- chambers. We found that worms in pattern IV of the quad-chamber moved more slowly and paused more than worms in the uni-chamber (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>). Such slowing and pausing could prolong the stay of worms in pattern IV. Together, these data suggest that the clustering of worms in pattern IV is due to both real-time responses to pattern changes upon boundary crossing and to longer-lasting effects caused by the experience of other less desired patterns. Thus, without vision or hearing, <i>C. elegans</i> can take advantage of mechanosensory information to compare and select between spatial patterns in its environment."

Several features of this behavior prompted us to investigate the contribution of dopamine signaling. In <i>C. elegans</i>, dopamine regulates a variety of behaviors including locomotion, mechanosensation, food availability, touch habituation, and the swim-to-crawl transition (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calhoun et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chase et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hills et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kindt et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sanyal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sawin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Vidal-Gadea et al., 2011</a>). In particular, dopamine signals decrease locomotion rates when worms enter a food source (a lawn of bacteria) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sawin et al., 2000</a>), and increase returning frequency when worms leave the bacteria lawn (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hills et al., 2004</a>). To test whether dopamine is required also for spatial pattern selectivity, we examined <i>cat-2(e1112)</i> animals, which lack the CAT-2 tyrosine hydroxylase and are defective in dopamine biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lints and Emmons, 1999</a>). We observed that <i>cat-2</i> mutant animals have disrupted pattern selectivity, as they showed reduced preference for pattern IV in the quad-chambers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Addition of exogenous dopamine restored the accumulation of <i>cat-2</i> mutants within pattern IV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), demonstrating that the defect in spatial pattern selectivity of <i>cat-2</i> mutants is due to the lack of dopamine. To determine the dopamine receptor responsible for the selectivity, we analyzed mutant worms with impaired dopamine receptors. We found that disrupting the D2-like receptor DOP-3, but not other dopamine receptors (DOP-1, DOP-2, and DOP-4), led to a reduced preference for pattern IV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). DOP-3 is expressed in a variety of neurons in the head, ventral cord and tail (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chase et al., 2004</a>). The site-of-action of DOP-3 for pattern selection is unknown."

The physical structure of the environment is another important feature that varies with habitat. We therefore hypothesized that <i>C. elegans</i> strains from different natural habitats might differ in their selectivity of spatial patterns. We thus examined a wild isolate of <i>C. elegans</i>, Hawaiian CB4856 (designated HW) in the spatial pattern preference assay. Interestingly, we found that unlike N2, HW worms failed to aggregate in pattern IV of the quad-chambers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>), and their returning behavior at boundaries was significantly reduced in comparison to N2 worms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

The <i>trp-4</i> gene is located on chromosome I in <i>C. elegans</i>. An N2/HW hybrid strain that carries the HW Chromosome I in an N2 background behaved like the HW strain in the spatial pattern preference assay. However, hybrid strains that carry other HW chromosomes in the N2 background were indistinguishable from N2 worms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), with the exception of those with HW Chromosome X, which showed a minor but significant reduction in the preference for pattern IV. These data are consistent with a role of <i>trp-4</i> in determining the natural variation in spatial pattern selectivity. They also suggest that other gene(s) on Chromosome X may contribute to the polymorphic behavior. Next, we isolated recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a cross between N2 and N2/HW hybrids that carry the HW Chromosome I. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, two RIL strains behaved differently in the spatial pattern preference assay; one that carries the N2 <i>trp-4</i> gene showed preference for pattern IV, but another one with HW <i>trp-4</i> did not. To confirm the role of TRP-4 in spatial preference polymorphism, we performed rescue experiments using single-copy transgenes expressing either N2 or HW <i>trp-4</i> cDNA in dopaminergic neurons. N2 <i>trp-4</i> cDNA fully restored the selectivity defects of the <i>trp-4(ok1605)</i> mutant worms. By contrast, HW <i>trp-4</i> cDNA showed only low levels of rescue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These data confirm that N2 TRP-4 is required for the spatial pattern preference observed in the Bristol strains. To test whether N2 TRP-4 is sufficient for endowing the HW strains with spatial pattern selectivity, we overexpressed N2 TRP-4 in HW worms. Because TRP channels are expected to form tetramers, we reasoned that overexpression of N2 TRP-4 might replace the HW TRP-4 channels. Indeed, we found that N2 TRP-4 but not HW TRP-4 overexpression caused HW worms to show spatial pattern selectivity similar to that of N2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

In flies, the Ankyrin repeats of NOMPC (the TRP-4 homologue) directly bind microtubules, and they are essential for mechanogating of the NOMPC channels (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). To understand whether the three residue substitutions alter TRP-4 properties, we recorded electrophysiological responses of the dopaminergic CEP neurons to small mechanical displacements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kang et al., 2010</a>). The mechanoreceptor current in CEP neurons is mediated by TRP-4, and the amplitude of the current depends on the strength of the applied mechanical force. In agreement with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kang et al., 2010</a>), a displacement of 0.5 \u03bcm was sufficient to elicit TRP-4 mediated current in N2 worms, and the current was saturated at 3 \u03bcm displacement (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Interestingly, the sensitivity of HW TRP-4 to mechanical stimuli was significantly reduced. Larger mechanical displacement was required to generate currents with similar amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>). These results are consistent with the findings that the N-terminal region of the TRP-4 homologue NOMPC is required for mechanogating in flies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). It is worth noting that, when mechanical stimuli are sufficiently strong, the HW TRP-4 is fully active (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Consistently, we found that an even higher density of pillars (novel pattern V) enhanced the enrichment of HW worms, but not of <i>trp-4(ok1605)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Together, these findings indicate that amino acid substitutions in HW TRP-4 reduce the sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, which could subsequently alter spatial pattern perception in HW worms. Interestingly, whereas a single-copy HW TRP-4 transgene failed to restore spatial preference (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), it completely rescued swimming/crawling transition in the <i>trp-4(ok1605)</i> mutant worms (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that various types of TRP-4 dependent behaviors are tuned to different levels of mechanogating sensitivity."

The most parsimonious explanation is that the G41S substitution is the key residue that modulates TRP-4 mechanosensitivity.

Upon editing the <i>dop-3</i> gene in N2 worms using CRISPR/Cas9 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Friedland et al., 2013</a>), we found that the edited worms with the A273G substitution lost their spatial pattern selectivity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These experiments indicate that the DOP-3 A273G mutation is sufficient to impair spatial pattern preference even with fully functional TRP-4.

Previous studies have shown that nematodes can evaluate their environment by sensing food (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calhoun et al., 2015</a>) and chemicals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht and Bargmann, 2011</a>). Our findings add a new dimension to the \u2018mind\u2019 of the worm by demonstrating a capability to perceive physical patterns in the environment. In many animal species, touch perception plays a key role in guiding exploration of the physical world. For example, insects carry antennae to collect tactile information during locomotion, rodents use whiskers to detect spatial settings, and sea mammals use facial hairs to trace changes in water flow patterns caused by swimming fish. Using a substantially simpler nervous system, <i>C. elegans</i> is able to detect spatial patterns, and to use mechanosensory information about the overall environment to form spatial pattern preferences. While primitive, this sense of physical space in worms is highly dynamic \u2013 it is tightly regulated by experience (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), spatial context (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>), and food availability (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>).

In higher animals, the existence of sensory modalities such as vision and hearing and associated brain structures, substantially expand the richness and quality of available information about the physical structure of their environment. Nevertheless, together with previous findings implicating dopamine in spatial attention (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bellgrove et al., 2007</a>) and spatial memory (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murphy et al., 1996</a>), as well as in disorders such as agoraphobia in humans (<a href=\"#bib27\">Perna et al., 2011</a>), our study suggests that the coupling between dopamine signaling and a sense of spatial features is an ancestral feature of animal nervous systems."

Just before the pipette touched the cell membrane for the seal, the \u2018Auto V0\u2019 was used again to make sure the junction potential was well corrected. The currents were amplified and acquired using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Germany). The signal was digitized at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using Patchmaster (HEKA, Germany). A glass stimulus probe was mounted to a piezo-driven actuator (Physik Instrumente, Germany) held by a micromanipulator. Displacement was triggered and controlled by the piezo amplifier E625 (PI), which is synchronized with programmed signals from HEKA Patchmaster software. A voltage step of 222 mV was used to trigger each 1 \u00b5m displacement of the probe. Series resistance was compensated to 70%.

First, <i>mec-10</i> is expressed in three classes of mechanoreceptor neurons, the touch receptor neurons (TRN), PVD and FLP. Which neurons are responsible for this effect? Second, the <i>ok1104</i> allele has very mild effects on TRN-mediated mechanosensation. In fact, Arnadottir et al. (J Neurosci, 2011) showed that <i>ok1104</i> mutants retain nearly normal behavioral responses to touch and mechanoreceptor currents. Additionally, the <i>ok1104</i> allele deletes 143bp of the gene and allows for the transcription of at least a single transcript encoding an abberant protein. Thus, the <i>ok1104</i> allele is unlikely to be null. Thus, the observed defects in behavioral assays could be due to the expression of a defective protein in the TRNs, PVD, or FLP. At a minimum, the authors need to communicate this complexity and uncertainty to readers. It would be better, however, to evaluate additional alleles, including <i>tm1552</i>, a different deletion in <i>mec-10</i> and <i>u253</i> a deletion in <i>mec-4</i> that eliminates mechanosensory currents in the TRNs and behavioral sensitivity."

Indeed, we have stated in the previous manuscript that \u201cother gene(s) on Chromosome X may contribute to the polymorphic behavior\u201d."
