                    "text": "Ras superfamily GTPase activation and inactivation occur by canonical nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis mechanisms. Despite conservation of active-site residues, the Ras-related Rab GTPase activation pathway differs from Ras and between different Rabs. Analysis of DENND1-Rab35, Rabex-Rab5, TRAPP-Rab1 and DrrA-Rab1 suggests Rabs have the potential for activation by distinct GDP-release pathways. Conserved active-site residues in the Rab switch II region stabilising the nucleotide-free form differentiate these pathways. For DENND1-Rab35 and DrrA-Rab1 the Rab active-site glutamine, often mutated to create constitutively active forms, is involved in GEF mediated GDP-release. By contrast, in Rab5 the switch II aspartate is required for Rabex mediated GDP-release. Furthermore, Rab1 switch II glutamine mutants refractory to activation by DrrA can be activated by TRAPP, showing that a single Rab can be activated by more than one mechanistically distinct GDP-release pathway. These findings highlight plasticity in the activation mechanisms of closely related Rab GTPases."

                    "text": "Ras superfamily GTPase activation and inactivation occur by canonical nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis mechanisms. Despite conservation of active-site residues, the Ras-related Rab GTPase activation pathway differs from Ras and between different Rabs. Analysis of DENND1-Rab35, Rabex-Rab5, TRAPP-Rab1 and DrrA-Rab1 suggests Rabs have the potential for activation by distinct GDP-release pathways. Conserved active-site residues in the Rab switch II region stabilising the nucleotide-free form differentiate these pathways. For DENND1-Rab35 and DrrA-Rab1 the Rab active-site glutamine, often mutated to create constitutively active forms, is involved in GEF mediated GDP-release. By contrast, in Rab5 the switch II aspartate is required for Rabex mediated GDP-release. Furthermore, Rab1 switch II glutamine mutants refractory to activation by DrrA can be activated by TRAPP, showing that a single Rab can be activated by more than one mechanistically distinct GDP-release pathway. These findings highlight plasticity in the activation mechanisms of closely related Rab GTPases."

A Rab protein is always bound to another molecule, which determines whether it is inactive or active. Binding to a molecule called GDP makes the Rab protein inactive, while binding to GTP makes it active. Proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors, or GEFs for short, activate the Rab protein by promoting the release of GDP and the binding of GTP. Other proteins\u2014known as GAPs\u2014lead to the inactivation of the Rab protein. Together these proteins form a molecular switch that can be turned on and off."

The fact that the detailed structure of this domain (at the level of individual amino acids) has been conserved over evolution is often taken as an indication that its mechanism has also been conserved. Langemeyer et al. have now tested this assumption with four different types of GEFs\u2014three from humans and one from the bacteria that cause Listeria\u2014and found that the story is more complicated than expected."

Specific regulators controlling nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis promote kinetic proofreading of vesicle and target organelle membrane surfaces by Rab GTPases, and therefore permit accumulation of active Rabs only at the required sites (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barr and Lambright, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barr, 2013</a>). The mechanistic details of how such regulators control Rab activation is therefore important for understanding the regulation of membrane identity and vesicle transport. Activation of Ras superfamily GTPases is thought to proceed by a general nucleotide exchange mechanism (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bos et al., 2007</a>). In the Ras-SOS GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) complex the Ras P-loop lysine interacts with a conserved glutamate intrinsic to the Ras active site switch II region, thereby stabilising the GEF bound nucleotide-free form of the GTPase (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998</a>). Mutation of this glutamate therefore reduces GEF-stimulated GDP-release, and compromises Ras activation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gasper et al., 2008</a>). Because of the high degree of sequence conservation in the Ras superfamily and Rab subfamily (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klopper et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rojas et al., 2012</a>), this mechanism might be expected to be the same in the Rab subfamily of GTPases. However, at odds with this simple idea mutation of the conserved Rab switch II glutamate residue to alanine has little effect on the rate of GEF-mediated nucleotide exchange (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gasper et al., 2008</a>)."

Mutation of either residue therefore prevents GTP hydrolysis. This has great biological relevance since the Ras switch II glutamine is frequently mutated in cancers creating a constitutively active oncogenic form of the protein. In Rabs, although the switch II glutamine is conserved, crystal structures of Rab33 and Rab1 with TBC domain Rab GAPs, Gyp1p and TBC1D20, respectively, reveal that it does not play a direct role in GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gavriljuk et al., 2012</a>).

In both DENND1 and DrrA complexes, the Rab P-loop lysine 21 interacts with the switch II glutamine 67 and aspartate 63 of the target GTPase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Examination of other Rab GEF complexes provides further support for the view that Rab activation differs from Ras. In the case of Rab1 bound to TRAPP there is no interaction of the Rab P-loop lysine with switch II residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Instead, a glutamate at position 192 is contributed to the Rab active site by the C-terminal extension of the TRAPP Bet3 subunit (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This could be considered mimicry of the Rab switch II region glutamate by the GEF. For the Rab5 family GTPase Rab21 in complex with the Vps9 domain of the Rabex exchange factor, a conserved aspartate 74 in the switch II region of the Rab interacts with the P-loop lysine 32 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delprato et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Delprato and Lambright, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Analogous to TRAPP an acidic residue is also contributed by Rabex, in this case an aspartate at position 313 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

Rab35 switch II glutamine 67 mutation to alanine (Q67A) greatly reduced DENND1-stimulated nucleotide exchange towards Rab35 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) was reduced from 2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> similar to previous measurements using wild type Rab35 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wu et al., 2011</a>) to \u223c7.5 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> for the Q67A mutant. Importantly, the glutamine to alanine mutation had little effect on basal GEF-independent nucleotide exchange. In the case of Rab35 there is a specific requirement for glutamine at this position since alteration of the switch II glutamine to glutamate resulted in a form of Rab35 Q67E that was not activated by DENND1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In addition, mutation of the switch II glutamate 68 (E68A) required for nucleotide exchange in the canonical Ras activation pathway had little effect on DENND1-stimulated nucleotide exchange by Rab35 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, the Q67A switch II mutation greatly reduced DrrA-mediated nucleotide exchange towards Rab1 from a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> of 6.0 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> to 5.3 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Mutation of the switch II glutamate (E68A) in Rab1 had little effect on DrrA-mediated nucleotide exchange, k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> 6.0 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Removal of the switch II aspartate 63 contacting the P-loop lysine residue resulted in increased basal release for both Rab35 and Rab1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), consistent with its role in nucleotide binding. For DENND1 this substitution resulted in a small reduction in k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> to 1.7 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), while for DrrA k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> increased over threefold to 2 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These results suggest that the switch II glutamine in these Rabs plays a crucial and previously unsuspected role in GDP-release during Rab activation. By contrast, the switch II aspartate contributes to nucleotide binding and therefore limits GDP-release (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pai et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">John et al., 1993</a>)."

As reported previously, mutation of the Rabex aspartate to alanine D313A abolished the activity of the GEF (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Delprato et al., 2004</a>). In support of the role of the Rab switch II aspartate in this alternative exchange pathway, mutation of the Rab5 conserved aspartate D76A greatly reduced Rabex-mediated nucleotide exchange (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Because the numbering of Rab5c is increased by two amino acids with respect to the Rab21, the same residue is D74 in the Rab21 structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Catalytic efficiency was reduced from 2.5\u00d710<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> in agreement with previous measurements using wild type Rab5 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delprato et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Delprato and Lambright, 2007</a>) to \u223c2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> for the D76A mutant.

Interestingly, mutation of Rab5 switch II glutamate 81 (Rab21 E79 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) resulted in an increase in the rate of Rabex-stimulated GDP-release from a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> of 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> to 4.6 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This increase is possibly due to removal of the negative charge on the switch II favouring entry of Rabex aspartate 313 into the vicinity of the P-loop lysine. Rab5 activation by Rabex therefore proceeds via an alternative pathway in which the conserved switch II aspartate interacts with the P-loop lysine to promote GDP-release.

For Rab1-DrrA complexes, the Rab1 P-loop lysine contacts the switch II aspartate 63 and glutamine 67 residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This is different to the structure of Rab1 with its longin domain GEF TRAPP where there are no obvious contacts between switch II and the P-loop lysine 21 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Instead, the structure suggests an alternative pathway where the Rab1 P-loop lysine interacts with an acidic glutamate finger residue E192 provided by the Bet3 subunit of the TRAPP GEF complex. The Rab1 switch II glutamine mutation is therefore predicted to have no effect on TRAPP mediated nucleotide exchange. In agreement with this idea, the switch II glutamine mutation Q67A that greatly reduced DrrA-mediated nucleotide exchange towards Rab1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) had little effect on the activity of budding yeast TRAPP towards Rab1/Ypt1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). As for DrrA, removal of the Rab1 switch II aspartate 63 contacting the P-loop lysine residue resulted in increased basal and TRAPP-stimulated GDP-release (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Interestingly, mutation of switch II glutamate 68 increased the rate of TRAPP-stimulated GDP-release over 10-fold from a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> of 1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>. This was possibly due to removal of the negative charge on the switch II favouring entry of Bet3 glutamate 192 into the vicinity of the P-loop lysine. To confirm the requirement for the Bet3 acidic C-terminal region, TRAPP complexes containing a Bet3 E192A/D193A mutant were produced. These showed a fourfold reduction in GEF activity towards Rab1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This is similar to the result obtained with Rabex, which also inserts an acidic residue to coordinate the P-loop lysine during GDP-release. Rab1 activation by TRAPP therefore proceeds via a pathway in which the P-loop lysine does not interact with switch II, but is stabilised by an acidic residue from the GEF thereby promoting GDP-release."

Crystal structures of Rab33 and Rab1 with TBC domain Rab GAPs, Gyp1p and TBC1D20, respectively, show that the GAP rather than the cognate GTPase contributes the glutamine residue important for nucleotide hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gavriljuk et al., 2012</a>). In these cases the only contribution of the switch II glutamine appears to be in contacting the peptide backbone of the GAP. Therefore it may stabilise the Rab-GAP complex rather than playing a direct role in catalysis. The TBC domain Rab GAPs acting on Rab35, Rab5 and Rab1 were then analysed (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haas et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fuchs et al., 2007</a>). Switch II glutamine mutation of Rab35 and Rab1 greatly reduced GTP hydrolysis stimulated by TBC1D10A and TBC1D20, respectively, but had less than \u223c1.5-fold effect on basal GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). By contrast, the switch II glutamine mutation had no effect on the activity of RUTBC3 towards Rab5, but caused a greater than fivefold reduction in basal GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Consequently, depending on the Rab, the switch II glutamine is important for Rab inactivation by GAP-stimulated or basal hydrolysis reactions."

This is best understood for Rab5 where such mutants promote endosome fusion (<a href=\"#bib33\">Stenmark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rybin et al., 1996</a>). The results presented here indicate that this may not apply to other Rabs, since the same mutation can interfere with GEF stimulated GDP-release and hence Rab activation. This suggests that in some Rabs switch II glutamine mutations will be uncoupled from their GEF and hence inactive rather than dominant active when expressed in cells. This idea was tested using Rab35 and the plasma membrane to Golgi trafficking pathway with Shiga toxin B as cargo protein. These experiments confirmed that wild type Rab35 supported delivery of cargo to the Golgi (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, 90 min timepoint), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fuchs et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Yoshimura et al., 2010</a>). Under the same conditions the switch II mutant Rab35<sup>Q67A</sup> did not actively interfere with Shiga toxin transport (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, 90 min timepoint). This indicates it does not act as a dominant negative inhibitor of transport. However, in the absence of the endogenous protein, Rab35<sup>Q67A</sup> failed to support efficient Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Instead, Shiga toxin accumulated in small punctate structures and was not efficiently delivered to the Golgi even after 90 min (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This reduced accumulation in the Golgi was not due to altered binding of Shiga toxin to the cell surface, since this was equivalent in all the conditions used (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, 0 min timepoint). Quantitation showed transport efficiency was over 80% for wild type Rab35, whereas Rab35<sup>Q67A</sup> did not rescue transport above the level seen in the absence of Rab35 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

For Rab5 the Q80A/L switch II mutation (Q78 in Rab21, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) did not alter activation by the GEF Rabex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and accordingly had no effect on the rate of recovery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), suggesting it is rapidly recruited to membranes like wild type Rab5.

                                "text": "The structural and biochemical analysis presented in this study identifies distinct pathways for Rab activation used by different RabGEF families. These can be divided into two main groups depending on the role played by the switch II region. For the first class of Rab GEFs, exemplified by DrrA and the DENN family member DENND1, GDP-release is promoted by interaction of the P-loop lysine with the conserved glutamine residue intrinsic to switch II (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Some details of this mechanism remain unresolved, particularly the question of how charge neutralization of the Rab P-loop lysine occurs remains unclear. The Rab\u2013RabGEF complex structures suggest this is possibly due to the negatively charged switch II aspartate, however mutation of this residue does not reduce GEF mediated GDP-release. Future work, analysing structures of such mutants will therefore be necessary. For the second class of GEFs represented by the Vps9 family member Rabex and TRAPP, the Rab P-loop lysine interacts with a negatively charged residue, either aspartate or glutamate, provided by the GEF and extrinsic to the Rab (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This latter group can be further subdivided, since stabilisation of the P-loop lysine in Rab1 bound to TRAPP appears not to involve direct interaction with any residues in switch II. All these cases are different to the general nucleotide exchange mechanism proposed for the Ras family, in which formation of the nucleotide-free form of the GTPase is promoted by interaction of a glutamate intrinsic to the switch II region with the P-loop lysine (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gasper et al., 2008</a>). For Ras, this results in discrete requirements for conserved glutamate and glutamine residues in switch II for GEF-mediated activation and GAP-stimulated inactivation, respectively. However, for DENND1 and DrrA, the switch II glutamine of the target Rabs interacts with the P-loop lysine to promote conversion of the Rab GDP form to a nucleotide-free intermediate that then binds GTP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Mutation of this glutamine therefore reduces the rate of GDP release by the Rab. In addition, the same glutamine interacts with the GAP and aides the GTP hydrolysis reaction converting the GTP to a GDP bound Rab (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), thereby inactivating the Rab. This results in activation and inactivation processes with a shared requirement for the switch II glutamine residue. The glutamine side chain swings from an \u2018in\u2019 conformation where it contacts the P-loop lysine during nucleotide exchange (activation), to an \u2018out\u2019 conformation where it contacts the GAP during GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). DENND1, the Rab35 GEF studied here, is a member of the DENN and DENN-related proteins that form the largest family of Rab nucleotide exchange factors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yoshimura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barr, 2013</a>). Therefore, these findings are likely to be broadly applicable to many other Rab GTPases. As a consequence they have wide significance for future studies of membrane trafficking and GTPase regulation in other systems."

For Rab1/Ypt1 activated by TRAPP, switch II mutants slow but do not prevent the GAP-stimulated GTPase reaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), possibly explaining the subcritical reduction in transport efficiency reported previously (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Antoni et al., 2002</a>).

For Rab5 the switch II glutamine mutation results in a form that displays near wild type properties in terms of GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, yet strongly compromised basal GTP hydrolysis. Results obtained previously for Rab33B and its GAP RUTBC1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nottingham et al., 2011</a>) show this is true for at least one other Rab. However, for Rab1 and Rab35 tested here the same mutation greatly reduces GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. These results have implications for the interpretation of published work on Rab5 regulation. While removal of the Rab5 GAP RUTBC3 results in moderately enlarged endosomes and a delay in endocytic trafficking, expression of Rab5 glutamine mutants causes formation of grossly enlarged vacuolar early endosomes and blocks the pathway at this stage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Stenmark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haas et al., 2005</a>). Together these findings indicate that in cells basal hydrolysis is an important determinant of Rab5 lifetime and turnover. This agrees with the idea that the major regulatory determinants of Rab5 levels at endosomal membranes are inputs driving GEF activity such as ubiquitylated cargo and PI-lipids rather than GAP activity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Del Conte-Zerial et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barr, 2013</a>).

Importantly, switch II mutations that compromise one pathway do not necessarily affect other activation routes. Thus, Rab1 switch II glutamine mutants can be activated by TRAPP, yet are refractory to activation by DrrA. These findings raise the possibility that small molecule inhibitors could be developed to target these mechanistically discrete pathways and associated switch II conformations."

Starting from a survey of available crystal structures and sequence information, the authors noted that different GEFs may use distinct residues (Q, E/D, or S, sometimes in the Rab Switch II loop and sometimes supplied by the GEF) for activation of Rab, and the same Rab (e.g., Rab1) may use distinct residues for activation by different GEFs. This is experimentally tested in the cases of Rab35 (Q), Rab5 (D), and Rab1 (Q- or E-) for GEF-mediated nucleotide exchange and GAP-mediated GTPase activation. These experiments also show that the same glutamine in Rab35 and Rab1 is important for both GEF-mediated activation and GAP-mediated inactivation, hence the notion of 'coupled' 'pathways' for activation and inactivation. The importance of the glutamine for activation of Rab35 in vivo is further verified in a Shiga toxin B uptake assay."

The experiments are done well and made the points summarized above, but by themselves they are not highly novel if not placed in the context of the authors' hypotheses."

The idea of a single residue being responsible for, and is hence the 'key' for activation, is incompatible with the principles of macromolecular activity, which is almost always the result of a collective network of interacting residues. For example, will Q67 explain GEF-induced displacement of Switch I loop and active site Mg2+? Are all other mechanisms of disrupting the Rab-GDP interaction the same for GEFs? If the authors cared to mutate other residues around the Rab or GEF active site, will they identify other mutations that disrupt GEF-mediated activation? (The answer is almost certainly yes.) Given this, what justifies placing paramount importance on the Q or D/E in Switch II of Rab? Second, such a classification offers no predictive power, as both Q and E residues are conserved in the Rab Switch II loop, but only one of them are used, and sometimes neither is used. Most researchers will have to begin with a null hypothesis with or without knowing that GEFs can be Q, D/E or S family. Thirdly, the available data are not sufficiently comprehensive to support, for example, the presence of the 'S-family' or that the Ypt1is a D/E family member."

'Coupled' in this paper has changed meaning, and refers to a requirement for the Switch II glutamine. To what extent is this concept valuable? Only when this glutamine is mutated, and one thus disrupt both sets of Rab regulation. Pragmatically, I agree with the authors that this gives researchers in the field a warning not to assume that mutating the Switch II glutamine only disrupts GAP activity and to make wrong interpretations, but that seems all there is \u2013 I can not come up with more examples in which this 'coupled' concept would be useful.

It had been suggested earlier that a common feauture of such GTPase:GEF complexes is an interaction of this lysine with a glutamate residue in the switch II region immediately following the catalytic glutamine. Comparing the structures discussed in the manuscript, it is clear that this does not apply generally, in particular here for the Rab proteins. The authors define 4 classes of GEFs, which they call the D, E, Q or S GEFs, where the single letter refers to the type of residue that interacts with the P-loop lysine in the Rab:GEF structure."

Of special interest, and this is the origin of the title of the manuscript and of several statements made throughout the manuscript to the effect that there is coupling between GTPase activation and inactivation, are the Q GEFs. The origin of this statement is the fact that in the Q GEFs, the lysine interacts with the conserved catalytic glutamine in the Rab:GEF complexes for DENND1 and DrrA, GEFs for Rab35 and Rab1, respectively. This is an interesting observation, and mutational analysis (referred to as alanine scanning analysis, which it doesn't appear to be) confirms that in these cases, this glutamine is important not only for GTPase activity, as already known, but also for GEF activity. However, and this is my main criticism of the manuscript, this has nothing to do with coupling of activation and inactivation of Rabs, whatever this is supposed to mean. The fact that the same glutamine residue is important for the GEF reaction and the GTPase reaction does not imply coupling in any manner. Thus, after displacement of GDP and generation of the Rab:GEF complex, there will be immediate binding of GTP and dissociation of the GEF, but what happens next, or better, the time scale of what happens next depends on the rate of the intrinsic (basal) GTPase reaction and the availability and activity of a cognate GAP, but this has nothing to do with the question of whether the P-loop lysine interacted with a glutamine, a glutamate, an aspartate or a serine in the nucleotide-free Rab:GEF complex, and where this residue is in which sequence."

This approach to generating stable GTPase:GTP complexes for cell biological studies is known to be flawed in the case of Rabs because the effect on GAP activation is much less than for other GTPases because TBC domain containing GAPs supply a glutamine to take over the role that the switch II glutamine plays in other classes of GTPases. The work presented here demonstrates that the approach is flawed for a further reason, i.e., because in the case of the Q Rabs activation will be inhibited.

If the P-loop lysine interacts with a neutral sidechain (glutamine, serine), the question arises as to charge neutralization of the protonated lysine amino group. Looking at the Rab1:DrrA structure, it is clear that there is a strong interaction with D63 from the Rab molecule (reported in the Schoebel et al. paper in Mol.Cell, 2009), in fact probably much stronger than the one with with Q67 discussed in this manuscript, where there is a bond length of 3.6 Angstroms. D63is the highly conserved aspartate in the WDTAGQE sequence, and is in fact the equivalent residue to D74 in Rab5 that was identified in this manuscript (and earlier, of course) as the Rab residue interacting with the P-loop lysine in the complex with Vps9. Looking at the DENND1:Rab35 structure, we see the same constellation (i.e., interactions of the lysine with D63 and Q67). So should DrrA and DENND1 be called D/Q Rabs? And Rab5 a D/E Rab? In the case of Sec2:Sec4, examination of one structure in the pdb does indeed show an interaction of the lysine with Ser161. A quick look for an acidic residue for charge neutralization did not reveal an obvious partner, although D101 of Sec4 is quite near. The GEF molecule is too far away to interact. In another Sec2:Sec4 structure in the PDB, the lysine is far removed from Ser161, but interacts with an inorganic phosphate group bound to the complex. These are all points that need discussion in the manuscript."

This raises questions about the quality of GTP hydrolysis measurements in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. I am puzzled by the data. First, the units reported denote mass (pmol), whereas a hydrolysis rate or rate constant should be reported in time units (s-1 or min-1). Secondly, the basal GTP hydrolysis activity is presumably the y-intercept in the main panels, but these values do not match those in the inset that reports 'basal GTP hydrolysis'. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> the basal GTP hydrolysis activity is in fact higher than the GAP-activated hydrolysis. Thirdly, I would assume that a proper 'GTP hydrolysis' measurement involves a time course (as all the arguments are about kinetics of hydrolysis), but re-reading the Methods section, I am less sure this time how these hydrolysis rate constants were measured and analyzed. PLEASE CLARIFY. Even if all the measurements are accurate, the author's statement \u201c in cells basal hydrolysis is a more significant determinant of Rab5 lifetime and turnover than GAP-mediated turnover\u201d is highly speculative.

As I alluded to in previous comments, mutation of this aspartate is problematic, since it has a negative effect on nucleotide binding, making the interpretation of the results difficult. Thus, the question arises as to whether we should be comparing kcat/Km values for wt and mutant, or perhaps the acceleration of the GDP release rate at saturating GEF concentrations. From <a href=\"#fig2\">Fig. 2b</a>, it looks as if the rate constant for uncatalyzed GDP release from Rab1b with the aspartate removed is ca. 0.001/s, about 100 times faster than for wt-Rab1b. Thus, what is interpreted here as an increase of efficiency of GDP release catalyzed by DrrA on removing the aspartate might turn out to be a reduction if the acceleration ratio is considered. In addition, there is still the question of how charge neutralization of the P-loop lysine occurs without a negatively charged interaction partner, even if, as the authors point out, it is not clear whether the lysine is protonated or not. To my knowledge, without having checked exhaustively, there is always such an interaction in binary GTPase-GEF complexes, either in cis or trans (apart from the relatively poorly defined Sec2:Sec4 structure that has fortunately now been removed from the discussion in the present paper). I wonder whether there might be a change of mechanism with the aspartate mutant? It would be interesting to see which residues the lysine interacts with in the binary complex when the conserved aspartate has been removed. However, I am not suggesting that this structure should be solved before acceptance of this paper.\u201d"

The origin of this statement is the fact that in the Q GEFs, the lysine interacts with the conserved catalytic glutamine in the Rab:GEF complexes for DENND1 and DrrA, GEFs for Rab35 and Rab1, respectively. This is an interesting observation, and mutational analysis (referred to as alanine scanning analysis, which it doesn't appear to be) confirms that in these cases, this glutamine is important not only for GTPase activity, as already known, but also for GEF activity. However, and this is my main criticism of the manuscript, this has nothing to do with coupling of activation and inactivation of Rabs, whatever this is supposed to mean. The fact that the same glutamine residue is important for the GEF reaction and the GTPase reaction does not imply coupling in any manner. Thus, after displacement of GDP and generation of the Rab:GEF complex, there will be immediate binding of GTP and dissociation of the GEF, but what happens next, or better, the time scale of what happens next depends on the rate of the intrinsic (basal) GTPase reaction and the availability and activity of a cognate GAP, but this has nothing to do with the question of whether the P-loop lysine interacted with a glutamine, a glutamate, an aspartate or a serine in the nucleotide-free Rab:GEF complex, and where this residue is in which sequence</i>."

This approach to generating stable GTPase:GTP complexes for cell biological studies is known to be flawed in the case of Rabs because the effect on GAP activation is much less than for other GTPases because TBC domain containing GAPs supply a glutamine to take over the role that the switch II glutamine plays in other classes of GTPases.

If the P-loop lysine interacts with a neutral sidechain (glutamine, serine), the question arises as to charge neutralization of the protonated lysine amino group. Looking at the Rab1:DrrA structure, it is clear that there is a strong interaction with D63 from the Rab molecule (reported in the Schoebel et al. paper in Mol.Cell, 2009), in fact probably much stronger than the one with with Q67 discussed in this manuscript, where there is a bond length of 3.6 Angstroms. D63is the highly conserved aspartate in the WDTAGQE sequence, and is in fact the equivalent residue to D74 in Rab5 that was identified in this manuscript (and earlier, of course) as the Rab residue interacting with the P-loop lysine in the complex with Vps9. Looking at the DENND1:Rab35 structure, we see the same constellation (i.e., interactions of the lysine with D63 and Q67). So should DrrA and DENND1 be called D/Q Rabs? And Rab5 a D/E Rab? In the case of Sec2:Sec4, examination of one structure in the pdb does indeed show an interaction of the lysine with Ser161. A quick look for an acidic residue for charge neutralization did not reveal an obvious partner, although D101 of Sec4 is quite near. The GEF molecule is too far away to interact. In another Sec2:Sec4 structure in the PDB, the lysine is far removed from Ser161, but interacts with an inorganic phosphate group bound to the complex.

The protonation state will be important to estimate any strength of interaction. However, the crystal structures do not provide any data on this issue and it is therefore hard to come to any firm conclusion about the strength of interactions of the participating amino acid side chains. Still, the glutamine is important because the experiments we present clearly show this for DENN and DrrA GEFs. The glutamine is therefore involved either in stabilizing the lysine directly or in organizing its stabilization. The discrete distances in the various complexes don't resolve this issue unambiguously since they only provide a static snapshot. The argument we put forward is that the glutamine is located at the heart of the nucleotide-Rab-interaction in the case of DrrA- and DENND1-complexes and therefore contributes to the exchange reaction. It has been shown in other instances that the lysine requires stabilization during the transition through the nucleotide-free GTPase-GEF complex and therefore amino acid residues contributing to this stabilization must be important. We have also tested the role of the switch II aspartate in GDP-release for all the Rab-GEF pairs tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Only in the case of Rabex is it required for GEF stimulated GDP-release. For the other Rabs it either results in an increase in basal release, consistent with the role in nucleotide binding. This suggests that the aspartate does not play an essential role in lysine stabilization during the GEF stimulated GDP-release reaction."

In addition, there is still the question of how charge neutralization of the P-loop lysine occurs without a negatively charged interaction partner, even if, as the authors point out, it is not clear whether the lysine is protonated or not.

                    "text": "We briefly explain that the conserved aspartate in switch II has a role in nucleotide binding. This is indirect and the aspartate does not make direct contact with the bound metal ion. For example, in Rab1 the P-loop serine (S22) and threonine (T40) in the (TIGVD motif) make direct contact with the bound metal ion. In addition, the beta- and gamma-phosphates of the bound GTP contact the metal ion. All these interactions fall in one plane around the magnesium ion. Finally, there are two water molecules positioned above and below the metal ion. The aspartate (D63 in Rab1) may influence the environment and possibly contact of one of these water molecules as well as the P-loop serine (S22). The same water molecule is also predicted to interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of the polypeptide back at threonine 65 in the switch II region. Many studies of Ras superfamily GTPases use a serine to asparagine (S22N) mutation in the P-loop since this prevents magnesium binding, and hence stable GDP or GTP binding. Removal of the aspartate as we have done will reduce the affinity for Mg:GDP or GTP, but does not abolish binding in the same way."

The biological activity of a GEF is only fulfilled if it produces a sufficient number of active Rab molecules in a given time. It is therefore the absolute amount of activity (Rab GTP created), not a ratio that is the relevant parameter. We were careful in wording the text to avoid making the statement made by the referee: \u201cwhat is interpreted here as an increase of efficiency of GDP release catalyzed by DrrA\u201d. Our text states that GDP release was increased and we don\u2019t say this was because the GEF is more efficient. In fact, we suggest that this because removal of the aspartate contributes to nucleotide binding (via the coordination of the metal ion), and therefore limits GDP-release."
