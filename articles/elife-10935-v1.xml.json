Excess light chains are in equilibrium between dimers and less stable monomers which can undergo irreversible aggregation to the amyloid state.

Here we identify ligands that inhibit amyloid formation by stabilizing the Mcg light chain variable domain dimer and shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer."
