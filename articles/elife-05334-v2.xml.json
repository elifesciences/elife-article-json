Both LPS and PG are essential cell envelope components that are synthesized independently and assembled by dedicated transenvelope multiprotein complexes. We have identified a point-mutation in the gene for O-antigen ligase (WaaL) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> that causes LPS to be modified with PG subunits, intersecting these two pathways. Synthesis of the PG-modified LPS (LPS*) requires ready access to the small PG precursor pool but does not weaken cell wall integrity, challenging models of precursor sequestration at PG assembly machinery. LPS* is efficiently transported to the cell surface without impairing OM function. Because LPS* contains the canonical vancomycin binding site, these surface-exposed molecules confer increased vancomycin-resistance by functioning as molecular decoys that titrate the antibiotic away from its intracellular target. This unexpected LPS glycosylation fuses two potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)."

Both LPS and PG are essential cell envelope components that are synthesized independently and assembled by dedicated transenvelope multiprotein complexes. We have identified a point-mutation in the gene for O-antigen ligase (WaaL) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> that causes LPS to be modified with PG subunits, intersecting these two pathways. Synthesis of the PG-modified LPS (LPS*) requires ready access to the small PG precursor pool but does not weaken cell wall integrity, challenging models of precursor sequestration at PG assembly machinery. LPS* is efficiently transported to the cell surface without impairing OM function. Because LPS* contains the canonical vancomycin binding site, these surface-exposed molecules confer increased vancomycin-resistance by functioning as molecular decoys that titrate the antibiotic away from its intracellular target. This unexpected LPS glycosylation fuses two potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)."

The search revealed that a mutation in a gene called <i>waaL</i> increases <i>E. coli'</i>s resistance to vancomycin, but not to other antibiotics<i>.</i> The gene encodes an enzyme, and the mutant form of the enzyme attaches some peptidoglycans to the surface of the outer membrane instead of incorporating them into the cell wall. The stray peptidoglycans on the cell's surface act as decoys, binding to vancomycin and keeping the drug from reaching its true target\u2014the cell wall. The decoy strategy is similar to a mechanism used by Gram-positive bacteria\u2014which lack a protective outer membrane\u2014to resist vancomycin treatment, which also involves creating sites that bind the drug and keep it from its target."

The cell wall is directly exposed to the extracellular milieu in Gram-positive bacteria, but is shielded in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and other Gram-negative species by a highly selective permeability barrier formed by the outer membrane (OM). The OM prevents influx of antibiotics, such as vancomycin, restricting their access to intracellular targets (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eggert et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ruiz et al., 2005</a>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) forms the surface-exposed outer leaflet of the OM and is key to the barrier function (<a href=\"#bib24\">Osborn et al., 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kamio and Nikaido, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nikaido, 2003</a>). LPS is a glycolipid consisting of a \u2018lipid A\u2019 anchor within the bilayer, and a set of covalently attached distal \u2018core\u2019 saccharides (<a href=\"#bib28\">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</a>). LPS is made at the cytosolic leaflet of the inner membrane (IM) before being flipped to the periplasmic leaflet (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhou et al., 1998</a>). A transenvelope complex of seven <span class=\"underline\">l</span>ipo<span class=\"underline\">p</span>olysaccharide <span class=\"underline\">t</span>ransport proteins (LptABCDEFG) delivers LPS from the IM to the OM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ruiz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chng et al., 2010a</a>). A sub-complex of the \u03b2-barrel LptD and lipoprotein LptE resides within the OM and accomplishes the final step of inserting LPS into the outer leaflet (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chng et al., 2010b</a>)."

To better understand the basis of the <i>lptE613</i> defect, we isolated spontaneous suppressors that restored antibiotic resistance. One such vancomycin-resistant suppressor mapped to the <i>waaL</i> gene, the product of which is an IM glycosyltransferase that attaches O-antigen (O-Ag) oligosaccharides to LPS (<a href=\"#bib12\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ruan et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, the suppressed strain is certainly no more vancomycin sensitive than is the corresponding wild-type control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, this suppressor (<i>waaL15</i> herein) was not specific for <i>lptE613</i> or even for LPS transport defects. The <i>waaL15</i> mutation increases vancomycin resistance in strains carrying <i>bamB</i> or <i>bamE</i> null mutations that disrupt the OM barrier by causing defects in \u03b2-barrel protein assembly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ricci and Silhavy, 2012</a>). Moreover, <i>waaL15</i> also increases vancomycin-resistance even in the wild-type strain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The suppressor does not qualitatively improve the OM barrier, since it did not increase resistance against other antibiotics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). So, <i>waaL15</i> provides a vancomycin-specific resistance mechanism across different strains."

Thus, the WaaL15 mutant O-Ag ligase, which contains an F332S substitution, must have an altered activity. Silver-staining of isolated LPS confirmed that WaaL15 modifies LPS with additional sugars to produce an additional glycoform (LPS*), detected as a higher molecular-weight band that is absent in <i>waaL</i><sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). WaaL can use two minor saccharide substrates to modify LPS in <i>E. coli</i> K-12: enterobacterial common-antigen (ECA) and colanic acid (CA). ECA-modified LPS is a minor constituent of the OM (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schmidt et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Meredith et al., 2007</a>). Production of CA is regulated by the Rcs phospho-relay stress response system, and CA-modified LPS (called \u2018M-LPS\u2019) is only detectable during severe envelope stress (<a href=\"#bib22\">Meredith et al., 2007</a>). Perhaps <i>waaL15</i> had improved the utility of one, or both, of these substrates. However, LPS silver-staining revealed that LPS* remained detectable when we inactivated biosynthesis of ECA (<i>rff</i>), CA (<i>cpsG</i>), or both these polysaccharides (<i>rff cpsG</i>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Moreover, if we increase the amounts of a competing substrate by introducing the <i>rcsC137</i> mutation to activate expression of the genes for CA biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gottesman et al., 1985</a>), we actually observed lowered LPS* abundance at the expense of increased M-LPS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Notably, the decrease in LPS* correlated with a significant reduction in vancomycin-resistance, providing evidence that LPS* molecules directly mediate the resistance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Similarly, if O-antigen biosynthesis is restored by introducing a wild-type <i>wbbL</i> gene, we observe lowered LPS* at the expense of wild-type LPS and vancomycin resistance is reduced. We conclude that WaaL15 is able to use a new substrate and thereby generate a previously uncharacterized LPS glycoform that provides a specific mechanism for vancomycin resistance."

It was not immediately apparent to us that any of these strategies could be employed in <i>E. coli</i> since virtually all of the terminal D-Ala residues of DPP are removed either by cross-linking or by the carboxypeptidases. However, we show that the <i>waaL15</i> mechanism is comparable since it also increases the number of free D-Ala-D-Ala targets that can tie up vancomycin. Moreover, by displaying D-Ala-D-Ala at the cell surface the <i>waaL15</i> mutation titrates vancomycin away from the true drug target, in an altogether different cellular compartment. Therefore, LPS* confers resistance by acting as a molecular decoy for vancomycin. Given that Gram-negative bacteria are inherently resistant to vancomycin this decoy mechanism may not be of clinical significance. However, the increased resistance it does confer clearly demonstrates the tremendous adaptability of bacteria under antibiotic stress."

Lipid II in <i>E. coli</i> is extremely scarce, its steady-state abundance is thought to be only 1000\u20132000 molecules per cell (<a href=\"#bib41\">van Heijenoort et al., 1992</a>). Insertion of new PG is thought to occur via large multiprotein morphogenic complexes: the elongasome and the divisome, responsible for PG synthesis along the lateral cell body and at the septum, respectively. In order to overcome the scarcity of lipid II and limit its diffusion away from sites of PG growth, both complexes are suggested to include at least some of the lipid II biosynthetic enzymes, and the presumed flippases that deliver lipid II from the site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the site of cell wall assembly in the periplasm (<a href=\"#bib37\">Szwedziak and L\u00f6we, 2013</a>). In this model, the substrate for PG synthesis would be isolated physically from the LPS assembly pathway. LPS is inserted into the OM of each cell at a rate exceeding 70,000 molecules per minute (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lima et al., 2013</a>) and we approximate that one-third of LPS is modified by WaaL15 with lipid II-sourced DPP. Clearly, WaaL15 has ready access to lipid II and this is inconsistent with a model of diffusion-limited lipid II sequestered at the elongasome or divisome complexes. Recent evidence also points to wider lipid II availability (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sham et al., 2014</a>). Our data indicate that the re-charging of the lipid carrier with new DPP must also be extremely efficient to maintain such a robust pool of PG precursor."

In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 when colonic acid is overproduced M-LPS is made from an intitating Glc residue. The F332S mutation broadens substrate specificity of the WaaL glycosyltransferase allowing it to efficiently accept a significantly more bulky initiating MurNAc with an attached oligopeptide stem. The only other glycosyltransferase that is known to use lipid II as a substrate is PglL from <i>Neisseria</i> and the use required overproduction of the enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Faridmoayer et al., 2008</a>). It is also remarkable that we detect no OM biogenesis defect in strains carrying <i>waaL15</i>, demonstrating that the Lpt system is fully competent for the transport and assembly of LPS* despite the addition of both unnatural sugars and peptide stems. Both LPS and PG are pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that potently activate innate immune responses via distinct pathways, and it seems sensible for Gram-negative bacteria to keep these entities separated. We suggest that the F332S substitution has inactivated an exclusion mechanism that prevents WaaL from utilizing the lipid II pool."

All experiments were performed using a Biacore X100 instrument at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl/min with 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl buffer. Different concentrations of vancomycin were injected for 400 s and dissociation was recorded for another 500 s to return to baseline. No binding was observed to the reference channel. The equilibrium signal in the difference channel was fitted to f = Bmax*abs(x)/(Kd + abs(x)) with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.88. Standard deviation was measured for 0.6 \u00b5M and 1.2 \u00b5M vancomycin in triplicate and did not exceed 1 RU."

However, the increased resistance it does confer clearly demonstrates the tremendous adaptability of bacteria under antibiotic stress.\u201d"
