Here we report a near atomic structure of the active human apoptosome determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting model gives insights into cytochrome c binding, nucleotide exchange and conformational changes that drive assembly. During activation an acentric disk is formed on the central hub of the apoptosome. This disk contains four Apaf-1/pc-9 CARD pairs arranged in a shallow spiral with the fourth pc-9 CARD at lower occupancy. On average, Apaf-1 CARDs recruit 3 to 5 pc-9 molecules to the apoptosome and one catalytic domain may be parked on the hub, when an odd number of zymogens are bound. This suggests a stoichiometry of one or at most, two pc-9 dimers per active apoptosome. Thus, our structure provides a molecular framework to understand the role of the apoptosome in programmed cell death and disease."

Here we report a near atomic structure of the active human apoptosome determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting model gives insights into cytochrome c binding, nucleotide exchange and conformational changes that drive assembly. During activation an acentric disk is formed on the central hub of the apoptosome. This disk contains four Apaf-1/pc-9 CARD pairs arranged in a shallow spiral with the fourth pc-9 CARD at lower occupancy. On average, Apaf-1 CARDs recruit 3 to 5 pc-9 molecules to the apoptosome and one catalytic domain may be parked on the hub, when an odd number of zymogens are bound. This suggests a stoichiometry of one or at most, two pc-9 dimers per active apoptosome. Thus, our structure provides a molecular framework to understand the role of the apoptosome in programmed cell death and disease."

Cheng et al. went on to reveal a disk-like structure made from the parts of four Apaf-1 proteins that interact with the protein-cutting enzymes. This disk forms a spiral that sits atop the central hub of the wheel-like apoptosome. Finally, the findings suggest that, although the wheel like complex has seven spokes, at any one time the active apoptosome may only need two (or at most four) copies of the protein-cutting enzyme to trigger the cascade of events that lead to cell death"

In humans, intrinsic cell death signals converge on mitochondria to release pro-apoptotic factors through outer membrane pores formed by Bcl-2 family members (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brunelle and Letai, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tait and Green, 2010</a>). These factors include cytochrome c, which up-regulates assembly of the Apoptotic protease activation factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 1997</a>). Other released factors, such as Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib51\">Tait and Green, 2010</a>), are pro-apoptotic and interact with inhibitory proteins to unblock procaspases \u20139, \u20133 and \u20137. This multi-pronged pathway allows activation of procaspase-9 on the apoptosome and subsequent proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 and \u20137, which results in selective proteolysis of target proteins and cell death (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bratton and Salvesen, 2010</a>)."

When released, cytochrome c binds to \u03b2-propellers in Apaf-1 and may trigger nucleotide exchange with ATP/dATP replacing bound ADP/dADP (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zou et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">1999</a>). This leads to the assembly of a heptameric apoptosome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acehan et al., 2002</a>). Caspase recognition domains (CARDs) are present as N-terminal effector domains in both Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 (pc-9). Thus, CARD-CARD interactions target inactive pc-9 monomers to the apoptosome (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). During this step, a CARD 'disk' is formed that sits above the central hub, and is attached by linkers to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2013</a>). The nature of the disk is not known but a recent hypothetical model suggests that two CARD-CARD interfaces may be used to form a quasi-helical stack, akin to structures in Death Domain complexes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). Local proximity of procaspase-9 monomers on the apoptosome leads to protease activation. However, the precise mechanism of pc-9 activation after recruitment to the apoptosome is still being debated. Catalytic domains may associate in solution or they may interact with the apoptosome to form an active protease (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Bratton and Salvesen, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boatright et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">W\u00fcrstle and Rehm, 2014</a>)."

This work provides a model of Apaf-1 in an extended conformation with bound dATP and shows monomer interactions within the apoptosome. Improved clarity reveals interactions of cytochrome c with \u03b2-propellers in the V-shaped sensor domain. For the first time, molecular details are provided of a tilted, acentric disk formed by N-terminal CARDs from four Apaf-1 and three or four pc-9 molecules. In brief, the disk contains four pairs of Apaf-1/pc-9 CARDs in one turn of a spiral with the fourth pc-9 CARD being present at lower occupancy. This arrangement creates a mismatch between the CARD spiral in the disk and the c7 symmetry of the platform. We also verified that a pc-9 catalytic domain may be parked on the central hub (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>), adjacent to a pc-9 CARD in the disk. In addition, three Apaf-1 CARDs are excluded from the disk but may retain a limited ability to bind pc-9 molecules, depending upon steric constraints. Stoichiometry measurements have suggested that 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules may be recruited by Apaf-1 CARDs on the apoptosome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malladi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). Hence, at any instant one or two pc-9 dimers may be tethered to the apoptosome. Implications for Apaf-1 assembly and apoptosome function are discussed."

Procaspase-9 apoptosomes were run on a linear glycerol gradient and visualized by SDS-PAGE to reveal the expected components (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also used a fluorescence assay to monitor the LEHDase activity of pc-9 apoptosomes used in this work (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). For single particle work, we froze freshly assembled samples on holey carbon grids and collected super-resolution movies on a Titan-Krios electron cryo-microscope equipped with an energy filter to remove inelastically scattered electrons and provide better contrast for alignments (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). After movie frame corrections for global movements during imaging (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2013</a>), ~135,000 particles were extracted from the resulting micrographs and processed by 2D and 3D classification in RELION (<a href=\"#bib47\">Scheres, 2012</a>) to identify the best particles (~93,000). These particles were 'polished' and refined with seven-fold symmetry (c7) in RELION to produce a map with a global resolution of 4.1\u2009\u00c5, as determined with a gold standard FSC (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Scheres, 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2012</a>). However, the resolution is not isotropic. As estimated by ResMap (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</a>) the central hub is at a nominal resolution of 3\u20134\u2009\u00c5 and this is supported by the visibility of larger side chains. The extended arm and peripheral sensor domains are in the range of 4.5\u201310\u2009\u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). A sharpened and normalized 3D map from the global 3D refinement was rendered as an iso-surface to show the wheel-like geometry of the apoptosome, which has dimensions of 270 x 270 x ~75\u2009\u00c5. Many rod-like \u03b1-helices are visible in the map that dominate the central hub and seven arms, while a cylindrical CARD disk sits atop the platform and shows little structural detail (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and inset). A previous model of an extended Apaf-1 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>; PDB 3J2T) was docked into the map with some rebuilding (Materials and methods) and pertinent statistics are summarized in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>."

This prompted us to re-analyze this region in our map of the active apoptosome with focused 3D classification in RELION, coupled with local remodeling (<a href=\"#bib47\">Scheres, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>; Materials and methods). To complete our analysis, we used focused 3D classification to reveal the architecture of the acentric CARD disk at ~5.8\u00a0\u00c5 (Materials and methods). A model for the disk was constructed by rigid-body docking of\u00a0individual Apaf-1 and pc-9 CARDs from a crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>; PDB 4RHW) into the improved 3D map with Chimera (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). A composite 3D map for the active apoptosome was constructed by zoning with appropriate domain models in global and local maps with Chimera, and these density maps were combined for display (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). Gold standard FSC curves were computed from independent half volumes using the entire global map, and for local maps containing the sensor domain with cytochrome c and the unblurred CARD disk. This provided estimated resolutions of ~4.1, 6.1 and 5.8\u2009\u00c5, respectively. Model versus map FSC curves suggest that over-fitting is not a major issue.

In addition, the disk and a single Apaf-1 molecule are highlighted in the active apoptosome without the map (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and a close-up is shown of the disk within the map (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

We also created a sequence alignment in Chimera (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>) for Apaf-1, Dark and CED-4 apoptosomes (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This alignment provides detailed information on secondary structure motifs and is a useful guide when discussing this large structure. The heptameric platform appears to be mostly unchanged during pc-9 activation relative to the ground state, with an rmsd of 1.7\u2009\u00c5 for C\u03b1's, when comparing Apaf-1 and cytochrome c in the two complexes (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>; this work). However, the active apoptosome contains an acentric disk formed by Apaf-1 and pc-9 CARDs, with a catalytic domain of pc-9 bound to the central hub in some particles (as discussed later; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2013</a>).

This surface is formed in part by possible interactions between Ser356 and Ser358 in the HD1-WHD loop to Asp271 and Ser272 in an extended region, which follows strand \u03b24 in the NBD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). However, some of these interactions are in the 4.5\u20135\u2009\u00c5 range and thus, could be mediated in part by water molecules that have not been resolved. Overall, the large number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between domains and subunits may be responsible for the tendency of the apoptosome to disassemble at higher salt concentration.

The a-strand of each \u03b2-sheet is near the central pore while the d-strand is located at the outer surface of the cylinder. Individual blades of 7- and 8-blade \u03b2-propellers are well resolved in the map (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Starting at the distal end of the HD2 arm, a cleft is present at the base of the V-shaped sensor domain which accommodates four helices of HD2 (\u03b129-\u03b132) to form an interface reminiscent of a ball and socket joint, as viewed from front and back (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a> and inset). The socket is formed by loops between blades 6 and 7 (Ser1169-Gly1178) and between blades 7 and 8 in the 8-blade \u03b2-propeller, along with the outer surface of blades 7 and 1 in the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller. In the HD2 arm, helices \u03b130 and \u03b131 and the loop between them are inserted into this interface, while helix \u03b129 makes contact with blade 1 of the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller. The HD2 arm is connected to the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller by an unusual linker (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>) that is present in an Apaf-1 crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>). The HD2-\u03b27 linker starts at helix \u03b132 of the HD2 arm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, traced by black dots) and runs along the C-terminal blade of the 8-blade \u03b2-propeller, where it replaces the outermost d-strand. The polypeptide chain then crosses over to the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller to form the outer d-strand of the last blade (Asp589-Thr615) and then starts the innermost a-strand of blade 1. The interaction between blades 7 and 1 closes the cylindrical fold of the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller. Clear density is present for both of the linkers between \u03b2-propellers, including a short turn of \u03b1-helix in the linker between the 7- and 8-blade \u03b2-propellers (see asterisk, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure\u00a02\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

An overlay of 7-blade \u03b2-propellers without and with bound cytochrome c shows a symmetric radial displacement with an rmsd of 1.9\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

Side chain resolution in the central hub allowed us to identify molecular interactions as shown by a cross-section from the density map of the dATP binding site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; for clarity only a few hydrogen bonds are shown). In particular, the adenine base is bound in a deep hydrophobic pocket lined by NBD residues Pro120, Pro123, Phe126, Val127, Val162, Leu163, Leu286, Lys290, Ileu294 along with Pro321 from HD1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The adenine base is in an <i>anti</i> configuration relative to the deoxyribose ring and makes hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl and amide of Val127 to help position the fused rings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). A conserved arginine (Arg129) is located above the adenine base at the 'top' of the pocket and plays a structural role. We note that the <i>anti</i> orientation of the adenine base is present in crystal structures of Apaf-1 with bound ADP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Riedl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>) and in near atomic structures of Dark and CED-4 apoptosomes (Cheng et al., unpublished; <a href=\"#bib37\">Qi et al., 2010</a>).

The <i>syn</i> orientation of the adenine base is a higher energy conformer. Therefore, we re-fit the Apaf-1 subunit (PDB 3JBT) into the published density map for the ground state apoptosome using the <i>anti</i> conformer of dATP without a Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion.

Both tyrosine side chains in the loop are in good density with Tyr359 forming a hydrogen bond to the \u03b3-phosphate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). Thus, Tyr359 in the HD1 may act as a sensor for dATP akin to sensor I (Arg265) in the NBD. In addition, the oxygen in the deoxyribose ring may form a hydrogen bond to the amide of Leu322. Importantly, the side chain of Ser325 in helix \u03b118 is located within ~4\u2009\u00c5 of the 2\u2019 carbon of the deoxyribose ring, and is held in position by hydrogen bonds with the 3\u2019 OH in the sugar ring and the backbone carbonyl of Leu322 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). In addition, Ser325 may interact with the 2' OH of the ribose ring when ATP is bound instead of dATP, as found in the crystal structure of Apaf-1 with ADP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Riedl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The close apposition of Ser325 to the 2\u2019 carbon of the deoxyribose ring may be responsible for the higher affinity exhibited by Apaf-1 for dATP over ATP (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jiang and Wang, 2000</a>). This effect is more obvious at lower nucleotide triphosphate concentrations (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reubold et al., 2009</a>). Remarkably, a similar interaction occurs in the Dark apoptosome where a close approach of the Ser325 side chain to the 2' carbon of the sugar ring may be responsible for the absolute preference for dATP during nucleotide-dependent assembly (Cheng et al., unpublished; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yu et al., 2005</a>). Thus, Ser325 may act as a modulator that defines the relative affinity for dATP and ATP during assembly of Apaf-1 and Dark apoptosomes."

In particular, Lys160, Ser161 and Val162 interact with \u03b1 and \u03b2 phosphates. The side chain of the absolutely conserved Lys160 interacts with the \u03b3 phosphate via three hydrogen bonds. In addition, the side chain of Arg265 (sensor I) makes three potential hydrogen bonds to the terminal phosphate and is stabilized in this position by interactions with Glu366 in the WHD. In the Walker B motif, carboxyl side chains of Asp243 and Asp244 are hydrogen bonded to Trp184 and Trp246, respectively. In addition, Aspartate 243 makes a hydrogen bond to Ser161 in the Walker A motif, and the side chain of Ser161 then interacts with the \u03b2 phosphate.

In the closed state, ADP is bound by residues in Walker motifs in a manner similar to the extended state with bound dATP, except that Arg265 (sensor I) is too far removed from the \u03b2-phosphate of ADP to make a salt bridge interaction. However, a major rotation of the NBD-HD1 pair occurs when dATP is bound, such that the HD1-WHD loop rotates into position at the bottom of the nucleotide pocket. This is coupled with a large rotation of the NBD-HD1 pair about the WHD (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), which positions the NBD, HD1 and WHD to form lateral contacts in the inner and outer rings of the central hub (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2013</a>). This large rotation also breaks a hydrogen bond between His348 in helix \u03b124 of the WHD and the \u03b2-phosphate, which may help stabilize the closed configuration (<a href=\"#bib8\">Danot et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Riedl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Hence, the HD1-WHD loop effectively replaces helix \u03b124 in the transition from a closed to an extended conformation. In addition, a carboxyl triad in the closed state comprises side chains from Asp244 in the Walker B motif, along with Asp392 and Asp439 in the WHD. This side chain grouping should be strongly repulsive but is partially neutralized by Arg265 (sensor I; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>). As a result of conformational rearrangements during nucleotide exchange, Asp244 in the Walker B motif becomes hydrogen bonded to Trp246, Asp439 in the WHD forms hydrogen bonds with Lys318 (HD1) and Lys391 (WHD), while Asp392 remains in close proximity to Asp439. As predicted, Arg265 does not have to move much in order to interact with the \u03b3-phosphate of dATP during nucleotide exchange and thus, is unlikely to play a direct role in triggering the conformational change (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Danot et al., 2009</a>)."

This is in stark contrast to AAA+ ATPase family members that function as processive machines and catalyze multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis. Instead, nucleotide exchange may trigger conformational changes in Apaf-1 that allow the platform to assemble. Experimentally, it has been shown that nucleotide hydrolysis does not occur in the apoptosome (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reubold et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2005</a>). In support of this data, no arginine finger is contributed by an adjacent monomer in the apoptosome to promote catalysis. Furthermore, a bound Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion also plays an important role in catalysis by AAA+ ATPases. By comparison with the crystal structure of the CED-4 apoptosome, Ser161 and Asp243 in the Walker A motif are predicted ligands for a possible Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion in the nucleotide binding site of Apaf-1 but a third ligand, equivalent to Lys191 in CED-4, is replaced by Ser186 in Apaf-1, and this side chain is not able to interact with a cation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Qi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Importantly, no clear density is present in our map of the human apoptosome for a Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion and modeling with this ion in a previous structure appears to have distorted the model for dATP (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). Also note that Buffer A in the frozen pc-9 apoptosome sample contained 1.5\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1. 0\u2009mM EDTA and 1.0\u2009mM EGTA. Hence, some free Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion would have been available for binding to Apaf-1. Intriguingly, a bound Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion is present in chain A of CED-4 and causes a kink in the triphosphate of ATP. However, Tyr369 in the HD1-WHD loop of CED-4 still makes hydrogen bonds to the \u03b3-phosphate and thus, may act as sensor for HD1. In addition, Thr367 in this loop is hydrogen bonded to both the 3' and 2' OH groups on the ribose ring, thereby subsuming the role of Ser325 on helix \u03b118 of Apaf-1, as this serine has been replaced by a methionine in CED-4 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

However, ADP is deeply buried in the binding pocket of the compact monomer in crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib42\">Riedl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>), which suggests that a major conformational change may be required to facilitate nucleotide exchange. To understand this process, we investigated Apaf-1 assembly with native gradient gels, which are sensitive to changes in mass, shape and charge. However, these experiments were complicated by the presence of a ladder with up to seven bands in purified and functional Apaf-1 preparations. This ladder may be due to lateral subunit interactions at the non-physiological protein concentration. Concerted band shifts were visible when Apaf-1 was incubated with increasing amounts of cytochrome c (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lanes 2\u20133), coupled with a depletion of the original Apaf-1 bands. In addition, higher order bands were formed relative to control lanes with Apaf-1 alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lanes 1, 4). This suggests that cytochrome c binding may enhance the ability of Apaf-1 to sample more open conformations and in the absence of nucleotide exchange this may lead to aggregation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lane 3)."

                                "text": "We next studied the effects of nucleotide triphosphate on Apaf-1 in the absence of cytochrome c. Thus, we added dATP at 1\u2009mM to Apaf-1 and used dADP as a control. In this case, there was no apparent band shift with either nucleotide and no sign of higher order aggregation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lanes 4\u20137). When dATP and cytochrome c are both added, the aggregation pathway is by-passed and a high molecular weight band is formed that corresponds to the apoptosome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lane 8). Also note that excess cytochrome c in the assembly reaction also induced upward band shifts of unassembled Apaf-1, while the ladder is greatly diminished in intensity. When taken together, these experiments support a sequential model in which cytochrome c binding is required before nucleotide exchange can occur. This idea is consistent with the nature of the conformational changes observed in the transition from a closed to an extended Apaf-1 conformation (see below)."

                                "text": "The structure of the human apoptosome reveals subunit interactions required for correct assembly. To further investigate the first steps in assembly, we created a consensus model for full-length Apaf-1 from partial and overlapping models of human and mouse Apaf-1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Riedl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>). We then over-layed Apaf-1 structures with and without bound cytochrome c, by focusing the alignment on the WHD and HD2 arm, as these domains remain relatively unchanged during the transition from a closed to an extended conformation. During activation, cytochrome c most likely binds first to the 8-blade \u03b2-propeller since this region is accessible and the resulting interface is quite extensive. At this stage, the 8-blade \u03b2-propeller and helices \u03b129 to \u03b132 of the HD2 undergo a small upwards rotation relative to the core of the HD2 arm (helices \u03b125 to \u03b128), to bring this region into proximity with the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). At the same time, the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller undergoes a large local twist and rotation to clamp cytochrome c between the two propellers. This rotation breaks interactions between the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller, NBD and HD2 arm. However, the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller is not able to complete its rotation without clashing with the NBD (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus, initial movements of the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller may increase domain flexibility in the NOD, as suggested by cytochrome c binding experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This flexibility may facilitate nucleotide exchange as the NBD-HD1 pair rotates into a more extended position, since the ADP molecule would become more accessible (<a href=\"#bib42\">Riedl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reubold et al., 2011</a>)."

To test this idea, we did band shift experiments with native gels in which the Apaf-1 ladder amplified the observed interactions. We added pc-9 or pc-9t (with a thrombin site in the CARD-p20 linker; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>) to Apaf-1 and observed a significant upwards shift of all bands in the ladder (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, left and right hand panels respectively). Thrombin cleavage of the pc-9t linker released the catalytic domains (p20/p10) and the resulting Apaf-1/pc-9 CARD bands were shifted downward on the gel, but were still vertically displaced relative to the corresponding Apaf-1 bands (see lane 1 in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, right panel).

Finally, weaker density is present at position 8p in the average map. However, this region could be visualized in a normalized map at a lower threshold. This density may correspond to a pc-9 CARD, which is present at lower occupancy and thus, would interact with the Apaf-1 CARD in position 7a to complete the fourth CARD pair. The pc-9 molecule at position 8p may be readily exchangeable, while the other pc-9 CARDs make more extensive contacts in the disk."

The linkers in this figure are clearly defined after map segmentation with SEGGER (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pintilie et al., 2010</a>) and are shown at a lower threshold. Molecular models of the linkers have not been built due to the limited resolution of these features. The four Apaf-1 subunits that contribute CARDs to the disk are marked by color-coded arrow heads (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The remaining three Apaf-1 CARDs in the apoptosome are not added to the top of the disk to form a third layer, presumably due to restraints imposed by the length of their CARD-NBD linkers. In addition, steric clashes or increasing distortions in the CARD-CARD interfaces of the quasi-helical spiral (see below) may preclude the addition of a third layer to the disk. We surmise that the three excluded Apaf-1 CARDs are disordered since they are not visible, but they may contribute to the propensity of the particles to aggregate. In addition, band shift experiments with Apaf-1 monomers and pc-9 suggest that excluded Apaf-1 CARDs may, in principle, bind to pc-9 molecules in the absence of steric restraints. However, a measured stoichiometry of 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules per apoptosome under various conditions, places an upper limit on the number of Apaf-1 CARDs that may recruit pc-9 molecules (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malladi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>).

Thus, the C-terminal helix of each Apaf-1 CARD is positioned so that its linker to the NBD is located on the outside of the disk (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Contacts made by Apaf-1 CARDs to NBDs in the central hub vary due to their position in the spiral. At position 1a, the first 10 residues in the N-terminal \u03b1-helix of the Apaf-1 CARD make contacts with helices \u03b18 and \u03b113 in two adjacent NBDs. At position 3a the N-terminal helix of the Apaf-1 CARD may interact with helices \u03b18 and \u03b111 in a single NBD.

This model was based on a crystal structure of a CARD heterotrimer in which a single pc-9 CARD is sandwiched between two Apaf-1 CARDs and used a crystal structure of Death Domain complexes as a template (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferrao and Wu, 2012</a>). However, coordinates for this model are not available. The unusual arrangement of Apaf-1 and pc-9 CARDs in the crystallized heterotrimer creates two interfaces, which were denoted Type I and II, with the Type I interface being similar to the contact surface in the structure of an Apaf-1/pc-9 CARD dimer determined previously (<a href=\"#bib38\">Qin et al., 1999</a>). The disposition of Type I and II interfaces in the disk is shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8B\u2013D</a> with Type II interfaces occurring between CARDs in color-coded pairs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). Two overlays are shown for the relevant CARD pairs centered on Type II and Type I interfaces with color coded pc-9 CARDs, after alignment to the appropriate Apaf-1 CARD in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C,D</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). In general, the interfaces become more distorted in moving clockwise around the disk from position 1a, due to the spiral geometry of the CARDs. The rmsd for C\u03b1 backbones of 'sequential' Apaf-1/pc-9 CARD pairs, aligned with the Apaf-1 CARD of the relevant crystal pair are 3, 3.2 and 5.1\u2009\u00c5 for the Type II interface and 2.1, 1.5 and 3.2\u2009\u00c5 for the Type I interface. The '7a-8p' CARD pair was not included in this analysis since the crystal structure was used to model this pair. The CARD spiral results in a rather open interface between two adjacent pc-9 CARDs at positions 8p-2p, and a novel interface is formed between Apaf-1 CARDs at positions 7a-1a (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>)."

Hence, mutations that disrupt Type I and Type II interfaces are supported by our model of the disk. These mutations would disrupt CARD-CARD interactions and may decrease pc-9 binding and activity on the apoptosome. Two additional Apaf-1 CARD mutations (K58E, K62E) were found to greatly diminish pc-9 activation and occur outside of interfaces I and II (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). These mutations are located on the bottom surface of the disk-like spiral and may interfere with Apaf-1 CARD interactions to the NBD ring. These twin point mutations are not positioned where wild type residues may interact with pc-9 catalytic domains and participate in activation. However, these two point mutations suggest that proper disk formation may be a pre-requisite for proper activation of pc-9 zymogens."

We showed previously that density for catalytic domains of a single pc-9 could be identified on the central hub, adjacent to the disk (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2010</a>). With this in mind, we re-processed our pc-9 apoptosome data with c1 symmetry in EMAN2 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tang et al., 2007</a>) and used e2refinemulti.py for 3D classification (Materials and methods). A similar feature for pc-9 was found on the central hub with this large data set, and the density accommodates a single copy of the p20/p10 domains. However, the density was not modeled precisely due to local flexibility of this feature (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Intriguingly, we could not detect the pc-9 catalytic domain with a focused 3D classification approach in RELION due in part to its small size and local heterogeneity. Refinement with c1 symmetry in EMAN2 uses a density based approach in real space and may reveal the pc-9 catalytic domain at the expense of some blurring of the disk. The success of this approach may also be due to the use of supervised 3D classification, which allowed the identification of particles that may contain bound pc-9 catalytic domains, prior to 3D refinements. We also note that c1 refinement in EMAN2 resolved the platform at \u03b1-helical resolution (not shown). We suspect that pc-9 catalytic domains may also bind at sites adjacent to the one identified on the central hub in some particles, as this might explain, in part, why this small (~40\u2009kDa) feature was lost during focused 3D classification in RELION. We also surmise that pc-9 catalytic domains may be bound in a dynamic manner, since only ~50% of the particles contained the density in the aligned location."

This alignment was guided by the acentric and tilted disk, since the 7 spokes are similar in both maps. Intriguingly, the catalytic domain can be located in two possible positions that are adjacent to a pc-9 CARD at position 2p within the CARD disk. For simplicity, we have shown the position with the highest cross-correlation, while the next most likely candidate with a similar probability, is rotated by one Apaf-1 subunit in the clockwise direction (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). This proximity would allow pc-9 catalytic domains parked on the hub to be connected to CARDs at all positions in the disk due to the long CARD-p20 linker."

We then docked domains from crystal structures into the 3D map to create a model for the apoptosome. This analysis identified plausible conformational changes of Apaf-1 that may drive assembly (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2013</a>), although high resolution details were absent. However, density for the CARD disk was blurred due to a symmetry mismatch with the platform. To extend our studies, we have now determined the first near atomic structure of an active human apoptosome using cryo-EM. In total, we modeled 57 domains in the active apoptosome. Models for the sensor domain with cytochrome c and the CARD disk are based on local maps obtained by focused 3D classification at a resolution of ~6\u00c5. The final structure highlights the unusual architecture of this intrinsic cell death machine, in which a spiral-shaped disk is nucleated from the Apaf-1 platform when pc-9 is bound. In addition, most pc-9 catalytic domains are flexibly-tethered to their respective CARDs in the disk, while catalytic domains from one pc-9 may be parked on the central hub in some particles. Our model provides insights into cytochrome c binding, nucleotide exchange, Apaf-1 assembly, CARD disk formation and pc-9 activation. To our knowledge, this is the first time a CARD disk has been visualized clearly in the context of a platform for apical procaspase activation."

We suggest that cytochrome c binding is a pre-requisite for nucleotide exchange during assembly. In particular, we observed a significant band shift and aggregation of Apaf-1 on native gels when cytochrome c was added, while similar changes could not be detected when dATP was added in a separate reaction. Conformational changes due to cytochrome c binding may involve a small rotation of the 8-blade \u03b2-propeller and the supporting four \u03b1-helices of HD2, along with a much larger rotation of the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller about the base of the HD2 arm, to form the appropriate contact surface within the V-shaped sensor region for cytochrome c (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>). During this reaction, the NBD-HD1 pair must begin to rotate away from the 7-blade \u03b2-propeller to avoid a clash, while allowing nucleotide exchange. Alternatively, a hinge-like rotation of the NBD-HD1 pair relative to the rest of Apaf-1 may be dynamic. Hence, the NBD-HD1 pair could fluctuate between ADP and ATP/dATP bound conformations until they are fixed in place by the binding of both ligands. Thus, cytochrome c and a bound nucleotide triphosphate would predispose Apaf-1 to adopt an extended conformation that promotes lateral assembly of subunits to form the ring. In the absence of nucleotide exchange, binding by cytochrome c leads to a local conformational change (or alternatively to a change in the dynamics of the closed form) and subsequent aggregation of Apaf-1 molecules."

However, as Apaf-1 folds during translation or shortly thereafter, the protein may bind adenine nucleotide diphosphate or adenine nucleotide triphosphate, as both are present in the cytoplasm. If nucleotide diphosphate is bound, then Apaf-1 will be locked into a closed conformation, until cytochrome c is released from mitochondria in response to intrinsic cell death signals. Alternatively, if newly synthesized Apaf-1 binds a nucleotide triphosphate then a limited hydrolysis activity would ensure that the molecule adopts a closed, inactive conformation to prevent aggregation or further assembly into the cell death machine. Moreover, no detectable ATPase activity has been found in apoptosomes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reubold et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2005</a>). This may be correlated with the lack of an arginine finger and the absence of a stably-bound Mg<sup>+2</sup> ion at the nucleotide binding site."

Hence, Apaf-1 and pc-9 may co-assemble to form an active apoptosome. In this case, preformed Apaf-1/pc-9 complexes would bind cytochrome c and undergo nucleotide exchange. Alternatively, Apaf-1 may adopt an extended conformation triggered by cytochrome c and dATP/ATP, and then bind pc-9 as it interacts with other copies of itself during assembly. Remarkably, the concentration of pc-9 and Apaf-1 in HeLa cervical cancer cells is estimated to be ~30 nM and ~340 nM, respectively (<a href=\"#bib56\">W\u00fcrstle and Rehm, 2014</a>). This translates to roughly one pc-9 molecule for every 10\u201311 Apaf-1 molecules and with an assembly efficiency of ~70% this would give a pc-9 to Apaf-1 ratio of roughly 1:7 or 1:8 in active complexes. However, in non-cancer cells the ratio of pc-9 to Apaf-1 may be higher. Even so, this raises the possibility that preformed Apaf-1/pc-9 heterodimers may undergo preferential recruitment to apoptosomes during their assembly, due to the additional cooperativity of disk formation."

Improved structural clarity has revealed the sensor domain and for the first time, we have visualized the packing of CARDs within the acentric disk (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, side and close-up views; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Members of the 6-helix Death Domain family (CARDs and Death Domains) have been tailored to assemble into quasi-helical arrays (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferrao and Wu, 2012</a>), which form the heart of various activation machines.

However, the disk in the human apoptosome uses 7\u20138 CARDs to form a spiral, instead of 10\u201314 domains found in other Death Domain complexes. Various attempts have been made to reconstitute a disk from individual CARDs of Apaf-1 and pc-9. Recently, a meta-stable complex was observed by gel filtration and estimated to contain 7\u20138 CARDs. These studies led to the crystallization and structure determination of a unique CARD heterotrimer (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). In our study, we find that the path of paired Apaf-1/pc-9 CARDs in the disk describes roughly one turn of a spiral. In addition, Type I and II interfaces in the crystal structure of the Apaf-1/pc-9/Apaf-1 CARD trimer (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>; 4RHW) are present in the disk, but with some distortions to accommodate the spiral geometry. Strikingly, only three well ordered pc-9 molecules are recruited to the disk, while a fourth pc-9 is present at lower occupancy."

However, pc-9 forms an unusual dimer when crystallized without the CARD, in which one substrate binding site is occluded and inactive, while a second site is in an active configuration and binds a peptide inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib39\">Renatus et al., 2001</a>). Close inspection of the pc-9 structure suggests that crystal contacts do not play a role in this asymmetry. Recent data have been interpreted to suggest a possible model for pc-9 activation that involves dimerization of p20-p10 catalytic domains (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boatright et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bratton and Salvesen 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pop et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Renatus et al., 2001</a>), which are attached to the apoptosome by flexible CARD-p20 linkers. Alternatively, tethered pc-9 catalytic domains may bind directly to the platform and/or the disk and be activated (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yin et al., 2006</a>). Recent computational modeling favors an allosteric mechanism wherein pc-9 catalytic domains bind to the apoptosome, but could not differentiate between monomers or dimers as the active species (<a href=\"#bib56\">W\u00fcrstle and Rehm, 2014</a>). However, recent experiments have shown that chimeric Apaf-1 CARD/ClpP or Apaf-1 CARD/GroEl complexes, which are thought to form ClpP and GroEl heptamers, respectively, are able to activate pc-9 to a similar extent as the Apaf-1 apoptosome using a fluorescence-based proteolysis assay and by monitoring procaspase-3 cleavage (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). We have verified this remarkable observation for pc-9 added to chimeric ClpP molecules with N-terminal Apaf-1 CARDs (not shown). When taken together, this data would argue against an activation mechanism that requires binding of pc-9 catalytic domains to the central hub formed by Apaf-1 molecules, since this region does not exist in chimeric complexes. These data also suggest that efficient procaspase-3 cleavage can proceed in chimeric complexes in the absence of the Apaf-1 platform. However, these studies do not rule out the possibility that procaspase-3 may interact with Apaf-1 at some point either during or after its activation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a> and references therein)."

One constraint is provided by stoichiometry measurements, which indicate that a range of 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules may be bound to the apoptosome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malladi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). In line with this data, our structure suggests that 3 or 4 pc-9 molecules may be tethered to the disk through CARD-CARD interactions, with the caveat that a pc-9 molecule might also interact with Apaf-1 CARDs that are excluded from the disk. We also identified density in some particles for catalytic domains from a single pc-9 that are 'parked' on the NBD ring of the central hub (this work, <a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>). The two 'most favored' positions for parked pc-9 catalytic domains are next to the pc-9 CARD at position 2p in the disk. Our analysis further suggests that the acentric position of the disk may create the binding site for pc-9 catalytic domains. However, it is unlikely that adjacent parking sites would be occupied at the same time due to steric restraints. One implication of this finding is that parked catalytic domains could be attached to pc-9 CARDs located at all possible positions in the disk, due to the length of the CARD-p20 linker. Hence, the most favored parking sites are generally available to all four pc-9 molecules that may be tethered to the disk. We hypothesize that parked pc-9 catalytic domains may be held in reserve when an odd number of zymogens are bound to the apoptosome. This in turn, may prevent entanglement of linkers between parked pc-9 catalytic domains and flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers anchored to the disk, with the latter representing active proteolytic centers. There is no ordered density in our map for other pc-9 catalytic domains, and these domains can be released by a single clip in the CARD-p20 linker (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>). Thus, we surmise that the remaining pc-9 catalytic domains are flexibly-tethered to the disk through CARD-p20 linkers."

For example, a flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimer may form when three pc-9 molecules are anchored to form a 7 CARD disk, with the pc-9 catalytic domains that are odd man out occupying a parking spot on the central hub (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, left). However, if four pc-9 molecules are bound to the apoptosome they may form an 8-CARD disk with two flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers, while leaving open parking spots on the central hub (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, right). By extension, if 5 pc-9 molecules were bound to the apoptosome then one pc-9 molecule might interact with an Apaf-1 CARD that is not incorporated into the disk. In this case, two flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers may be formed on the apoptosome with an 8 CARD disk and a parked p20/p10 domain would also be present (e.g. <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Since the pc-9 CARD at position 8p in the disk is present at lower occupancy, it is clear that active apoptosomes with three bound pc-9 molecules were formed with a higher likelihood under our in vitro conditions. At the same time, the high protein concentration in our experiments may have aided the formation of an 8 CARD disk in particles with four pc-9 molecules, whereas apoptosomes with a 7 CARD disk and three pc-9 molecules may be favored in vivo. Moreover, the KCl concentration may affect the stability of the pc-9 CARD at position 8p. The lower KCl concentration used in Buffer A, relative to physiological conditions (20\u2009mM versus ~150\u2009mM), may favor electrostatic interactions that predominate at CARD-CARD interfaces. Hence, the transient association of a pc-9 CARD at position 8p may be more favorable in low salt buffer. Also note that it remains an open question whether each putative pc-9 dimer on the active apoptosome may contain one (<a href=\"#bib39\">Renatus et al., 2001</a>) or possibly two active sites."

In this model, auto-processing of pc-9 on the apoptosome triggers activation and subsequent release via exchange with unprocessed pc-9 in solution (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malladi et al., 2009</a>). The rapid nature of the auto-proteolysis reaction suggests that two-chain pc-9 molecules, as used in our structure (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), may account for most of the activity towards procaspase-3 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malladi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). Since there is no uncleaved pc-9 in our assembly reaction, we are not able to comment directly on the proposed turnover of pc-9 in the molecular timer hypothesis. However, the disposition of pc-9 on the apoptosome is similar for both unprocessed and cleaved pc-9 molecules. Indeed, a 3D map of apoptosomes with bound pc-9 CARDs, made by thrombinolysis of a single chain pc-9 with a triple point mutation (E306A/D315A/D330A), also showed the disk, while flexibly-tethered catalytic domains were released from the complexes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>). Our structure of the active apoptosome suggests that flexibly-bound pc-9 catalytic domains are probably not able to affect the stability of the CARD-CARD disk. However, parked p20/p10 subunits of pc-9 could exert some effect on disk stability, to modulate the binding and release of pc-9, although this is speculative. Intriguingly, pc-9 CARDs are located on the top surface of the disk, which would provide a route for pc-9 molecules to dis-associate from the complex, such as occurs at position 8p. This step would down-regulate apoptosome activity until a replacement pc-9 is bound from solution. The major variable in evaluating possible turnover of bound pc-9 molecules is the overall stability of the CARD disk. Given the multiple interactions of pc-9 CARDs in positions 2p, 4p, and 6p, it appears that a CARD at position 8p will be the most likely to exchange, as observed in our analysis. Hence, the turnover of pc-9 at position 8p in the disk would lead to an oscillation in the number of potentially active pc-9 dimers bound to the apoptosome."

This suggests that the CARD-p20 linker may facilitate pc-9 activation by providing a suitable spacer between CARDs in the disk and the catalytic domains. Indeed, the requirement for a somewhat longer spacer may reflect the disposition of the four pc-9 CARD binding sites on the disk. Moreover, the CARD-p20 linker may also stabilize the pc-9 dimer when it is formed. In either case, a single clip in the linker releases the catalytic (p20/p10) domains from the apoptosome and results in a complete loss of proteolytic activity (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2011a</a>).

In brief, the first Euler angle (\u03b1) from the alignment of each original particle image on the whole apoptosome was permutated cyclically by n times in 360\u00b0/7 increments, with n=1 to 6, to create six additional 'virtual particle' line entries in a new alignment data star file. In effect, this rotates each spoke density region within a given 2D image into the mask in the aligned 3D reference volume. The 3D mask covered the HD2, \u03b2-propellers, and cytochrome c in one Apaf-1 subunit. A focused 3D classification in RELION (<a href=\"#bib47\">Scheres, 2012</a>) was done without an alignment search and members of the best class were then used to calculate an improved 3D map using relion_reconstruct, which places each particle projection only in its most probable orientation.

Thus, we used a 3D classification that focused on the disk without local refinement. A soft mask was used that covered the disk and enclosed the NBD ring. In total, we identified seven classes with an asymmetric disk in different orientations, relative to the aligned c7 platform. After applying a soft mask to the disk, an estimated gold standard resolution of ~5.8\u2009\u00c5 was obtained for each of the seven class maps. Sharpened 3D maps from each of the classes were then aligned and averaged in Chimera with vop_resample and equal weighting (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>) to produce a final map of the disk."

The first 3D reference was EMD-1931 (apoptosome with bound pc9 catalytic domains processed with c1 symmetry; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2011a</a>), while the second reference was constructed by removing density for the parked pc9 catalytic domains from the first reference map using Chimera. Particles in the class with bound catalytic domains (39985, ~48.7%) were used for c1 refinement with EMD-1931 as a reference, which was low pass filtered to 30\u2009\u00c5. This produced a map with a gold standard FSC<sub>0.143</sub> of 7.2\u2009\u00c5 with \u03b1-helical rods resolved in the central hub (not shown).

Using this structure, the authors describe the putative interactions that drive oligomerization of Apaf-1, the interaction cytochrome c with the sensor domain, and the spiraling CARD disk at the center of the apoptosome, which interestingly involves association of only 4 of the 7 CARDs. This new structure is coupled with prior apoptosome structures, as well as with native gradient gels to present a model for oligomerization, wherein cytochrome c binding induces conformational rearrangements that allow for nucleotide exchange and apoptosome assembly. The work of the authors significantly extends beyond their prior contributions to the analysis of the intricacies of apoptosome formation, and their model also provides novel insight into how caspase-9 may be activated on this signalling platform. The work also complements recent structural studies published by their international peers.

Can the structural model explain this phenomenon? In particular, can an allosteric contribution by the apoptosome backbone be excluded or substantiated? The authors also briefly touch on and somehow exclude the anti-dogmatic idea that caspase-9 monomers may be activated on the apoptosome backbone. It is not clear to me why that idea is or can be refuted. Would it be possible that both homodimers of active casp-9 can be formed on the apoptosome as well as active monomers? The authors should also explain better whether their structural model is consistent with the finding that the apoptosome can act as a molecular timer. Other than that, data presented in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> would probably be more convincing if the authors added a repeat in which a binding deficient PC9 was used as a negative control. Another suggestion is to comment on whether the data on cyt-c integration into the apoptosome and the contact regions (subsection \u201cSensor \u03b2-propellers and cytochrome c binding\u201d, fourth paragraph) corresponds to cyt-c residues found to be critical for its proapoptotic potential (see e.g. published studies that compared yeast and human cyt-c)."

(2015). Perhaps more interesting is the increased resolution (~5.8 Angstroms) of the APAF-1:caspase-9 CARD disk and the confirmation of a previously postulated interaction of at least one catalytic caspase-9 P20/P10 dimer bound to the NBD ring of the central hub (Yuan et al. 2011). Previously, Akey's model of the apoptosome and caspase-9 (mostly from Yuan et al. 2010 and 2013) described the CARDs to be arranged in an acentric disk above the hub of a seven-spoked wheel of the apoptosome platform. The improved resolution of the disk reveals that it consists of 4 APAF-1 CARDS and 3 to 4 caspase-9 CARDS. Also, although their zipper like packing of APAF-1 and caspase-9 CARD domains differs from the crystal structure of the artificially created CARD disk of Hu et al. 2014, the author's structure is consistent with the existence of a second interface between the CARDs (dubbed type II interface) reported in that work. With one caspase-9 catalytic domain bound to the hub, this leaves the other two catalytic domains flexibly bound, potentially as an active dimer, though there is no evidence to verify this since the dimer is not resolved. The authors conclude that their model is consistent with the idea that the hub merely provides a platform for increasing the effective concentration of caspase-9 which drives dimerization and activation and that the caspase-9 catalytic domain is \"parked\" on the hub. However, their data in no way precludes that an as yet not understood allosteric mechanism accounts for the increased activity of apoptosome bound caspase-9. Indeed, Hu et al. 2015 identified mutations in APAF-1, K58E/K62E which are not found in any of the CARD:CARD interfaces and do not disturb apoptosome formation or recruitment of caspase-9, but severely interfere with the activity of the bound caspase-9. This suggests an allosteric mechanism exists for increased activation of apoptosome bound caspase-9. The author's only comment is that these mutations may affect binding of the CARD disc to the NBD hub. It would be helpful if they could elaborate on that further."

Since we have used well defined crystal structures for regions of lower resolution, we feel that side chains should be left in place as a best estimate for that particular local region, and as a courtesy to biologists and structural groups who may use the pdb files in future. In particular, it is clearly indicated in the paper which regions are supported by higher resolution and the map itself serves as a clear guide. Side chains can easily be turned off in graphics programs, but having them present as they are found in the crystal structure allows one to more readily understand details of the local fold and packing, that might also apply within the larger ensemble. While contact regions between domains that form novel interactions, such as those between the two \u03b2-propellers will differ between the crystal structure and the ensemble, it is still more useful to have the residues present to get a general idea of the chemistry of a local environment. In addition, side chains help to guide the refinement of the protein backbone into the density with MDFF, so it seems reasonable to leave them in the final pdb file. Another approach would be to have two depositions, one in the Protein Data Bank with rather more strict guidelines pertaining to this issue, and a second repository for models, wherein a slightly more liberal, and in our opinion, more useful deposition can be made.

Previously, Akey's model of the apoptosome and caspase-9 (mostly from Yuan et al. 2010 and 2013) described the CARDs to be arranged in an acentric disk above the hub of a seven-spoked wheel of the apoptosome platform. The improved resolution of the disk reveals that it consists of 4 APAF-1 CARDS and 3 to 4 caspase-9 CARDS. Also, although their zipper like packing of APAF-1 and caspase-9 CARD domains differs from the crystal structure of the artificially created CARD disk of Hu et al. 2014, the author's structure is consistent with the existence of a second interface between the CARDs (dubbed type II interface) reported in that work. With one caspase-9 catalytic domain bound to the hub, this leaves the other two catalytic domains flexibly bound, potentially as an active dimer, though there is no evidence to verify this since the dimer is not resolved. The authors conclude that their model is consistent with the idea that the hub merely provides a platform for increasing the effective concentration of caspase-9 which drives dimerization and activation and that the caspase-9 catalytic domain is \"parked\" on the hub. However, their data in no way precludes that an as yet not understood allosteric mechanism accounts for the increased activity of apoptosome bound caspase-9.</i>"

Unfortunately, the resolution of the parked pc-9 p20/p10 domains does not allow us to discern whether it is in an active or inactive conformation and its lower resolution is consistent with it also being rather dynamic, coming on and off the central hub."
