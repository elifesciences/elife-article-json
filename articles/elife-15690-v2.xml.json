                    "text": "Hedgehog signaling plays very important roles in development and cancers. Vertebrates have three transcriptional factors, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. Among them, Gli3 is a very special transcriptional factor which closely resembles <i>Cubitus interruptus</i> (Ci, in <i>Drosophila</i>) structurally and functionally as a \u2018double agent\u2019 for Shh target gene expression. Here we show that Gli3 full-length, but not the truncated form, can be methylated at K436 and K595. This methylation is specifically catalyzed by Set7, a lysine methyltransferase (KMT). Methylation at K436 and K595 respectively increases the stability and DNA binding ability of Gli3, resulting in an enhancement of Shh signaling activation. Furthermore, functional experiments indicate that the Gli3 methylation contributes to the tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that Set7 mediated methylation is a novel PTM of Gli3, which positively regulates the transactivity of Gli3 and the activation of Shh signaling."

                    "text": "Hedgehog signaling plays very important roles in development and cancers. Vertebrates have three transcriptional factors, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. Among them, Gli3 is a very special transcriptional factor which closely resembles <i>Cubitus interruptus</i> (Ci, in <i>Drosophila</i>) structurally and functionally as a \u2018double agent\u2019 for Shh target gene expression. Here we show that Gli3 full-length, but not the truncated form, can be methylated at K436 and K595. This methylation is specifically catalyzed by Set7, a lysine methyltransferase (KMT). Methylation at K436 and K595 respectively increases the stability and DNA binding ability of Gli3, resulting in an enhancement of Shh signaling activation. Furthermore, functional experiments indicate that the Gli3 methylation contributes to the tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that Set7 mediated methylation is a novel PTM of Gli3, which positively regulates the transactivity of Gli3 and the activation of Shh signaling."

When the Hedgehog signaling pathway is not active, Gli3 is able to switch off certain genes in the cells. On the other hand, when the signaling pathway is active, Gli3 changes shape so that it is able to activate its target genes instead. It is thought that this shape change is triggered by the addition (or removal) of chemical tags to Gli3. So far, researchers have reported that several different types of chemical tags can modify the activity of Gli3. However, it is not clear whether another type of chemical tag \u2013 known as a methyl tag \u2013 is involved in regulating Gli3."

Fu et al.\u2019s findings expand our understanding of how chemical tags can alter the cells\u2019 response to Hedgehog signaling activity. Future challenges are to understand exactly how Set7 and Gli3 interact and to develop drugs that can block this interaction, which may have the potential to treat cancer."

Hh pathway is activated when Hh ligands (Shh, Ihh or Dhh) bind to their repressive receptor Patched (Ptc), a twelve-transmembrane protein, leading to alleviation of its repression on the signaling transducer, Smoothened (Smo), a seven-transmembrane protein. The unleashed Smo can then activate the Gli transcription factors, resulting in the expression of downstream target genes, like <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. In vertebrate, there are three Gli proteins, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. While Gli1 acts as a transcriptional activator and amplifies the Shh signal in a positive feedback loop, Gli2 and Gli3 mainly function as the Shh-regulated transcriptional activator and repressor. Among them, Gli3 draws considerable attentions due to its structural and functional similarity to Ci. Like Ci, Gli3 plays critical roles in modulating the switch-on and -off of Shh signaling. In the absence of Shh signaling, Gli3 is partially proteolyzed into a truncated transcriptional repressor (Gli3<sup>R</sup>) to block the expression of downstream target genes. In the presence of Shh signaling, Gli3 is in a full-length transactivation form and activates the expression of downstream genes like <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2002</a>)."

Like many other transcriptional factors, Gli3 is also subjected to various PTMs. Among them, phosphorylation and ubiquitination modifications are well characterized in regulating the transactivity of Gli3. For example, in the absence of Shh signal, Gli3 is phosphorylated by PKA, GSK3 and CKI, and subsequently ubiquitinated by SCF<sup>Slimb/\u03b2-TrcP</sup> for partial proteolyzation to confer it trans-repressive activity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hsia et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Temp\u00e9 et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wang and Li, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>).

Protein methylation typically happens on arginine or lysine residues catalyzed by peptidylarginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) or lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) respectively. So far, near 50 KMTs and 9 PRMTs had been identified in human genome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Biggar and Li, 2015</a>). Among them, Set7 is one of the most studied KMTs, regarding its pivotal role in methylation of non-histone proteins. Although Set7 was first identified as a histone lysine methyltransferase specifically for Histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation, an epigenetic marker associated with transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nishioka et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2001</a>), accumulating evidence indicates that methylation of non-histone proteins including P53, P65, TAF10 and so on is the major biological function of this enzyme (<a href=\"#bib1\">Biggar and Li, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chuikov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ea and Baltimore, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 2009</a>). Set7 mediated methylation of Lys372 in P53 increases its stability, resulting in the induction of P53 target genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chuikov et al., 2004</a>). P65 can be methylated by Set7 at Lys37 which enhances the DNA binding and improves the expression of NF-\u03bab target genes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ea and Baltimore, 2009</a>). Previous sequence alignments of the methylated sites on the initial substrates of Set7 revealed a predicted consensus sequence motif for Set7: (K/R)-(S/T/A)-<b>K</b>-X (<a href=\"#bib6\">Couture et al., 2006</a>). Besides, a recent peptide-array based analysis redefined this recognition motif to: (G/R/H/K/P/S/T)-(K&gt;R)-(S&gt;K/Y/A/R/T/P/N)-<b>K</b>-(Q/N)-(A/Q/G/M/S/P/T/Y/V) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dhayalan et al., 2011</a>), which dramatically expands the putative targets of Set7."

Moreover, the methylation modifications on K436 and K595 respectively increases the stability and the DNA binding capacity of Gli3, resulting in enhanced activation of Shh signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this Set7 mediated Gli3 methylations contribute to the tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and\u00a0in vivo.

                                "text": "Given that the transcriptional activity of Gli3 is orchestratedly regulated by multiple PTMs, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and that protein methylation plays an important role in regulating several key signaling pathways, we sought to examine whether Gli3 can be post-translationally modified by methylation. We performed a mass spectrometry analysis of flag-tagged Gli3 from the cell lysate of HEK293T. This mass spectrometry analysis showed two methylation modifications on Gli3 K436 and K595 residues (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By comparing the flanking sequence of K436 and K595 with reported Set7 substrates, such as ER\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Subramanian et al., 2008</a>), P53 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chuikov et al., 2004</a>), PCAF (<a href=\"#bib27\">Masatsugu and Yamamoto, 2009</a>) and Histone 3 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2001</a>), we found strong similarities among them (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, upper panel), suggesting the possible involvement of Set7 in methylation of these two residues. Interestingly, these methylation signals were exclusively present in the Gli3 full-length but not the truncated repression form according to the mass spectrometry result (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Through sequence alignments, we found that these two sites in Gli3 are evolutionally conserved in many species (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To further test if the methylations on K436 and K595 are catalyzed by Set7, in vitro methylation assays were performed by incubating MBP-tagged peptides of Gli3, MBP-K436 (amino acids from 344 to 463 of Gli3) or MBP-K595 (amino acids from 464 to 666 of Gli3) with GST-Set7 and <sup>3</sup>H-SAM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lower panel). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, Set7 can specifically methylate the peptides, MBP-K436 and MBP-K595, whereas the substitution of K436 or K595 with arginine (K436R or K595R) abolished Set7 mediated Gli3 methylation. In addition, GST pull-down assays further indicated the interaction between Set7 and Gli3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Dot plot assays confirmed the specificity of those antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The methylation signals were decreased upon Set7 knockdown, indicating that methylation on these two sites of Gli3 is mediated by Set7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

Cells with stable expression of individual unrelated Set7 shRNAs showed significantly reduced methylation signals on K436 and K595 of Gli3 compared to cells expressing luciferase control shRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). In addition, the Gli3 arginine substitution mutants, Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>, showed abolished methylation signals when blotted with the matched antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Given that only the full-length Gli3 can be methylated, we began to use a Gli3<sup>PA</sup> mutant, in which the six phosphorylatable serines in the PKA target clusters were mutated to nonphosphorylatable alanines, resulting in the resistance of Gli3<sup>PA</sup> to be processed into Gli3<sup>R</sup> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Niewiadomski et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I'</a>). Similar to the result in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, the methylation signals can be detected in Gli3<sup>PA</sup> but not in its arginine substitution mutants, Gli3<sup>PAK436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>PAK595R</sup> when blotted with respective antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Given the Shh signaling plays an important role in the development of multiple embryonic tissues of mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</a>), we started to examine whether these methylation signals exist in the Gli3 in several responsive mouse embryonic tissues, such as brain, lung, skin, skeleton and gut. Indicated tissues were collected from embryos 14.5 days post coitum (dpc) and Gli3 methylation signals were detected by western blot using anti-Gli3 antibody, Me-K436 antibody and Me-K595 antibody, respectively. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, the methylation signals on Gli3 full length were only detected in embryonic lung tissues. Since Gli3 full-length can be methylated by Set7 in vivo and in vitro, we then examined whether Set7 interacts with Gli3. GST pull-down assays indicated that GST-tagged Set7 can successfully pull down the flag-tagged Gli3 full-length of NIH-3T3 cells in the presence of Shh (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Therefore, we demonstrate that Set7 can methylate the full-length, but not the repression form of Gli3, at K436 and K595 residues, indicating that Gli3 is a novel substrate of Set7."

We performed Shh luciferase reporter assays (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1990</a>) in the condition of Set7 knockdown. In the absence of Shh, downregulation of Set7 had no effect on the luciferase activity. In contrast, Set7 knockdown dramatically decreased the luciferase activity in the presence of Shh, suggesting that Set7 plays a positive role on Shh pathway activation but has no effect on the basal level of Shh signaling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and A\u2019</a>). In line with this finding, overexpression of Set7 but not its inactive mutant Set7<sup>H297A</sup> can significantly enhance the luciferase activity in the presence of Shh (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting that its methyltransferase activity is required for Set7 mediated Shh activation. Furthermore, Set7 mediated increase of luciferase activity was in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We then examined whether Set7 knockdown affects the expression of endogenous Shh target genes, like <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. In the presence of Shh, NIH-3T3 cells expressing Set7 siRNAs showed significant reduction in Set7 protein levels and a parallel decrease in <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i> mRNA levels compared to cells expressing control siRNAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). In addition, Gli1 protein level was also decrease in cells with Set7 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). It\u2019s of interest that either Shh or SAG, the agonist of Shh pathway, directed activation of Shh signaling can upregulate Set7 levels, whereas Gli1 knockdown can lead to a decrease of <i>Set7</i> mRNA levels, suggesting the existence of a potential positive feedback loop between Set7 and Shh signaling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A'</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, NIH-3T3 cells treated with Shh showed greatly increased methylation signals on Gli3 which may be probably due to increased Gli3 full-length or/and Set7 levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2019</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that the methylation signals of Gli3 is regulated by Shh input. Taken together, these findings indicate that Set7 can positively regulate the activation of Shh signaling."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, although Set7 knockdown can suppress the activation of Shh signaling, this inhibition was abolished when the Gli3 level was depleted by RNAi. In contrast, depletion of both Gli1 and Gli2 in MEF cells showed no effect on releasing such inhibition due to Set7 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These findings apparently indicate the requirement of Gli3 on Set7 mediated Shh activation. Furthermore, compared to Gli3<sup>WT</sup>, the mRNA levels of <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i> and the Shh luciferase activity were decreased in cells expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>, suggesting that Set7-directed Gli3 methylation plays an important role in maintaining Shh activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013J</a>). In consistent with this finding, cells expressing the Gli3<sup>PA</sup> point mutants, Gli3<sup>PAK436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>PAK595R</sup>, showed decreased Shh luciferase activity and levels of <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i> transcripts compared to those with Gli3<sup>PAWT</sup> expression (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). To further confirm this notion, Shh luciferase reporter assays were performed. Either Set7 downregulation or upregulation can lead to the reduction or the induction of Shh luciferase activity respectively in cells with Gli3<sup>WT</sup> expression but not in cells expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K and L</a>). Thus, our findings strongly suggested that Gli3 methylation at K436 and K595 sites are required for Set7-mediated enhancement of Shh signaling activation."

In mammal, the primary cilium (cilia) is an essential organelle for Shh signaling transduction. Gli3 traffics in and out of the cilia all the time (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). In the presence of Shh, Gli3 initially accumulates in the cilium tip (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and then functions as Gli3<sup>A</sup> to bind to the promoter of <i>Gli1</i> to further transduce the signaling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>).

As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>, the Gli3 accumulation on the tips of cilia was comparable among those three groups, suggesting that the Set7-related changes of Shh activation are not due to the cilial translocation of Gli3."

Given the importance of Gli3 stability on Shh signaling activation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Temp\u00e9 et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), we then tested whether Set7 can also affect the stability of Gli3. Western blot showed that knockdown of Set7 caused a significant reduction of endogenous Gli3 at protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, left panel), whereas overexpression of Set7 improved the Gli3 protein level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right panel). This Set7 mediated induction of Gli3 seems due to PTMs, because the mRNA level of Gli3 had no change regardless whether Set7 was knocked down or overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To further confirm this point, we then tested whether Set7 can affect the protein levels of the unmethylatable Gli3\u00a0mutants, Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>. As expected, exogenous Gli3<sup>WT</sup> had the same change as the endogenous Gli3. Interestingly, like the Gli3<sup>WT</sup>, the protein levels of Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> were still subjected to the modulation of Set7, whereas the protein levels of Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> were not responding to either knockdown or overexpression of Set7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>). These findings suggested that the methylation at K436 but not K595 causes stability change of Gli3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>). Finally, the reduced half-life of Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, but not Gli3<sup>WT</sup> or Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> was defined by western blot in cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>). Therefore, these data indicated that Set7 mediated methylation on K436 increases the protein stability of Gli3."

To examine whether Set7 also affects the DNA binding ability of Gli3, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in NIH-3T3 cells in the presence of Shh. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, knockdown of Set7 greatly decreased the binding of Gli3 on <i>Gli1</i>\u2019s promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although Shh treatment can almost completely block the processing of Gli3 full-length to Gli3<sup>R</sup>, trace Gli3<sup>R</sup> background may still disturb the result of ChIP assays. In order to address this concern, we established NIH-3T3 cell lines with stable expression of C-terminal flag-tagged Gli3 (Gli3-flag). Thus, only the Gli3 full-length can be recognized by anti-flag antibody. ChIP assays with anti-flag antibody demonstrated that Set7 knockdown markedly affected the binding of Gli3 on <i>Gli1</i>\u2019s promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>), suggesting that Set7 augments the DNA binding of Gli3 full-length. Given that K595 is on the zinc finger which is important for DNA binding of Gli3 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pavletich and Pabo, 1993</a>), it\u2019s conceivable that the Set7 mediated methylation on K595 may contribute to increased DNA binding of Gli3. Stable cell lines expressing Gli3<sup>WT</sup>-flag, Gli3 mutants (Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>-flag and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>-flag) were established. Comparable expression of flag-tagged Gli3 was detected in those three cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). ChIP assays with anti-flag antibody showed dramatically impaired the DNA binding ability in Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>-flag, whereas the Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>-flag presented the similar DNA binding ability to Gli3<sup>WT</sup>-flag (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>), suggesting that Set7 mediated methylation at K595 enhances the DNA binding ability of Gli3. In addition, the binding ability of Gli3 was also examined in the promoter regions of <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Hhip</i> by ChIP assays. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, the binding of Gli3 to these regions was markedly impaired after Set7 knockdown. In conclusion, Set7 improved the protein stability and DNA binding ability of Gli3 through methylation of K436 and K595 sites respectively."

                                "text": "Misregulation of Shh pathway has been reported in many types of cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and lung cancer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gialmanidis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hui and Angers, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jiang and Hui, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yuan et al., 2007</a>). Since Set7 can augment Shh activation by increasing Gli3 stability and its DNA binding ability on the promoter regions of <i>Gli1</i>, we then determined whether this Set7-Gli3-Gli1 axis plays a role in tumor development. By comparison on the mRNA levels of <i>Set7</i> and <i>Gli1</i> between Beas2B, a normal bronchial epithelial lung cell line, and A549, a non-small cell lung cancer cell line, we found that both <i>Set7</i> and <i>Gli1</i> were extensively expressed in A549 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, the GEO database search (GSE10245) showed a positive association between <i>Set7</i> and <i>Gli1</i> in NSCLC tumor samples, suggesting the involvement of this Set7-Gli3-Gli1 axis in the development of NSCLCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To examine the existence of this regulation axis in A549 cells, we performed Shh luciferase reporter assays and qPCR to evaluate the activity of Shh signaling in A549 cells with Set7 knockdown. Depletion of Set7 displayed a decreased luciferase activity and reduced expression of <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Our above findings indicate that unmethylatable mutations at either K436 or K595 cause a significant reduction of Shh signaling activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013J</a>). To examine whether unmethylatable mutations at both sites will lead to a synergistic suppression on Shh signaling activation, we constructed a double arginine substitution mutant of Gli3, Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup>, in which both K436 and K595 were mutated to arginine. To further examine whether Gli3 methylations at K436 and K595 are important for Set7-mediated Shh activation in A549 cells, we performed luciferase assays and qPCR. Compared to A549 cells with stable Gli3<sup>WT</sup> expression, reduced luciferase activity and transcripts of <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i> were detected in cells stably expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). In addition, more severe suppression on luciferase activities and <i>Ptch1</i> mRNA, but not <i>Gli1</i> mRNA, was observed in cells expressing Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup>, suggesting that the methylation at these two sites plays a synergistic role in regulating Shh signaling activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>). In line with the reduced Shh activation, MTT assays showed attenuated growth in cells stably expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> compared to cells with Gli3<sup>WT</sup> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Since anchorage-independent growth is tightly associated with tumor development, we then determined whether Set7-mediated Gli3 methylation affects this feature. The ability to form colonies in soft agar was dramatically impaired in stable transfectants with the expression of Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> compared to Gli3<sup>WT</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G and G\u2019</a>). In agreement with these in vitro growth assays, A549 cells with stable expression of Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> showed retarded tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013J</a>)."

One possible explanation comes from the differential cellular localization of Gli3<sup>R</sup> and Gli3 full-length in the absence of Shh. A recent study demonstrates that the stability of Dnmt1 can be dynamically regulated by Set7 and demethylase, Lsd1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). Since Lsd1 is a nuclear protein, it is conceivable that Lsd1 can also remove the methylation modifications of Gli3<sup>R</sup>, resulting in these signals undetectable either by mass spectrometry or western blot. In addition, we found increased Set7 levels in cells treated with Shh or SAG, suggesting a positive feedback loop between Set7 and Shh signaling. Thus, in the presence of Shh signaling, although Gli3 full-length also translocates into the nucleus subjected to Lsd1 mediated demethylation, increased Set7 could possibly compensate this demethylation effect, resulting in augment in Shh signaling. Therefore, it will be particularly interesting to examine whether Lsd1 and Set7 can dynamically regulate the activation of Shh signaling by demethylation and methylation of Gli3 respectively."

More important thing is that this phenomenon is repeatable.

Given that Shh signaling plays an important role in the development of multiple embryonic tissues of mice (Ingham &amp; McMahon, 2001), we started to examine whether these methylation signals exist in the Gli3 in several responsive mouse embryonic tissues, such as brain, lung, skin, skeleton and gut, by western blot. These embryonic tissues were collected from embryos at 14.5 (dpc). Gli3 methylation signals were detected by western blot using Me-K436 and Me-K595 antibodies respectively. The methylation signals on Gli3 full length were only detected in embryonic lung tissues. Consistent with our original manuscript, methylation signals were not detectable in Gli3 truncated forms of all embryonic tissues tested.

Because of this bipartite feature of Gli3, its oncogenic potential has been long neglected. However, recent emerging evidence indicates that Gli3 actually promotes tumor progression in multiple cancer types such as cervical cancer and colon cancer (Kang et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2015). Similar to these two cancer types, we demonstrate the oncogenic role of Gli3 in lung cancer in our current study. The tumor promoting role of Gli3 may be probably attributed to its transactivation of <i>Gli1</i> or other oncogenes."
