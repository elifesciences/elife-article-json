While patients with ANE syndrome have fewer mature ribosomes, it is unclear how this mutation disrupts ribosome assembly. Here we use yeast as a model system and show that the mutation confers growth and pre-rRNA processing defects. Recently, we found that Nop4 is a hub protein in the nucleolar large subunit (LSU) processome interactome. Here we demonstrate that the ANE syndrome mutation disrupts Nop4\u2019s hub function by abrogating several of Nop4\u2019s protein-protein interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR demonstrate that the ANE syndrome mutation in RRM3 of human RBM28 disrupts domain folding. We conclude that the ANE syndrome mutation generates defective protein folding which abrogates protein-protein interactions and causes faulty pre-LSU rRNA processing, thus revealing one aspect of the molecular basis of this human disease."

While patients with ANE syndrome have fewer mature ribosomes, it is unclear how this mutation disrupts ribosome assembly. Here we use yeast as a model system and show that the mutation confers growth and pre-rRNA processing defects. Recently, we found that Nop4 is a hub protein in the nucleolar large subunit (LSU) processome interactome. Here we demonstrate that the ANE syndrome mutation disrupts Nop4\u2019s hub function by abrogating several of Nop4\u2019s protein-protein interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR demonstrate that the ANE syndrome mutation in RRM3 of human RBM28 disrupts domain folding. We conclude that the ANE syndrome mutation generates defective protein folding which abrogates protein-protein interactions and causes faulty pre-LSU rRNA processing, thus revealing one aspect of the molecular basis of this human disease."

While little is known about the role of human RBM28, it is known that the equivalent protein in yeast \u2013 known as Nop4 \u2013 plays a critical role in forming a network of proteins needed to assemble ribosomes, the machines that make proteins."

The fundamental cellular process of ribosome assembly requires the coordinated action of all three RNA polymerases, over 200 biogenesis factors, and a number of small nucleolar RNAs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Thomson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Pevida et al., 2015</a>). In yeast, ribosome biogenesis initiates in the nucleolus with the transcription of the 35S polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor by RNA polymerase I. The 35S pre-rRNA undergoes a number of cleavage and modification events to give rise to the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. Mutations that partially disrupt ribosome assembly or function are often deleterious and can lead to disease in humans. Collectively, these diseases of ribosome biogenesis are called ribosomopathies. Ribosomopathies are caused by mutations in proteins that function in all stages of ribosome assembly (<a href=\"#bib22\">McCann and Baserga, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Armistead and Triggs-Raine, 2014</a>)."

The mutation segregated in the family in an autosomal recessive manner and was mapped to a single leucine to proline amino acid substitution at position 351 (L351P) of RBM28. This residue resides in the first \u03b1-helix of its third RNA recognition motif (RRM3; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). ANE syndrome was classified as a ribosomopathy because RBM28 is localized to the nucleolus and because patient fibroblasts showed reduced numbers of ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Damianov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Nousbeck et al., 2008</a>). While the L351P mutation is predicted to disrupt the first \u03b1-helix of RRM3 and thereby impair RBM28 function, it is not known how this single amino acid substitution disrupts the normal function of RBM28 in the nucleolus.

Consistent with these findings, circular dichroism and NMR reveal that the ANE mutation in RRM3 of the Nop4 human ortholog, RBM28, disrupts folding of the entire domain, not just the first \u03b1-helix. Together, these results suggest that the molecular basis of ANE syndrome lies in defective protein folding that reduces protein interactions and the function of RBM28 as a hub protein, resulting in pre-rRNA processing defects in the nucleolus."

Therefore, we used yeast genetics to pinpoint the molecular basis of ANE syndrome. A ClustalX alignment of the yeast Nop4 and human RBM28 amino acid sequences permitted identification of the orthologous ANE syndrome mutation in Nop4 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Over their entire length, the amino acid sequences of Nop4 and RBM28 are ~26% identical and 34% similar, and both contain four RRMs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The ANE syndrome mutation in human RBM28, L351P, is within the third RRM. Inspection of the alignment revealed an orthologous leucine in the third RRM of yeast Nop4, which we mutated to proline to introduce the ANE syndrome mutation into Nop4 (L306P; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As growth defects caused by mutation of a nucleolar protein are often indicative of ribosome biogenesis defects, we tested whether the growth defects conferred by Nop4 L306P were due to disruption of ribosome biogenesis. Previously, it has been shown that the mature 25S rRNA and the 27S and 7S pre-rRNA precursors are severely reduced in yeast depleted of Nop4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berg\u00e8s et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sun and Woolford, 1994</a>). To determine whether Nop4 L306P similarly disrupts production of the 25S rRNA, total RNA was harvested from strains bearing plasmids expressing no Nop4 (empty vector; EV), Nop4 WT or Nop4 L306P and depleted of endogenous Nop4 for 0 and 48\u2009hr. The 25S and 18S rRNAs were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, quantified and the ratio of 25S/18S, a measure of the relative levels of the mature rRNAs, was calculated and normalized to Nop4 WT for each time point (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> top panels). The observed decrease in the 25S/18S ratios correlated with the trend of the observed growth defects. The EV control, which had the most severe growth defect, also had the most severe reduction in 25S/18S ratio levels in comparison to Nop4 WT. Nop4 L306P conferred a moderate growth defect and a moderate, but statistically significant, reduction in the 25S/18S rRNA ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), consistent with reduced 25S levels."

To test this, we analyzed WT and mutant human RBM28 RRM3 domains (amino acids 330\u2013419) by circular dichroism (CD) and NMR. We used RBM28 RRM3 because Nop4 RRM3 was not soluble. We found that the L351P mutation disrupts the backbone structure of the RBM28 RRM3 domain. The CD spectra of WT and L351P RBM28 RRM3 showed notable differences in ellipticities [\u03b8] at 208, 215 and 222 nm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), indicating that the amino acid substitution reduced \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet content.

We confirmed the disruption of domain folding by NMR. <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC of WT RBM28 RRM3 showed well dispersed resonances (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), indicating the presence of both \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands, as expected for an RRM domain(<a href=\"#bib25\">Nagai et al., 1990</a>). In contrast, the majority of resonances in the spectrum of L351P ANE syndrome mutant RRM3 were clustered around 8.0~8.5 ppm in the proton dimension, demonstrating that the mutant protein backbone is disordered. A homology model of the human RBM28 RRM3, based on an NMR structure of mouse RBM28 RRM3, indicates that L351 is buried within the core of the domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

RRMs 3 and 4 of Nop4 alone are necessary and sufficient for Nop4 protein-protein interactions and for yeast growth and pre-rRNA processing.

An RRM is comprised of a 4-stranded \u03b2-sheet, which forms the primary RNA binding interface, and 2 \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#bib21\">Maris et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cl\u00e9ry et al., 2008</a>). The \u03b1-helices of the RRM often mediate interaction between protein pairs, leaving the \u03b2-sheet accessible for RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kielkopf et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Selenko et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tripsianes et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively, in the case of the Y14-Mago complex, the interaction is through the \u03b2-sheet, which precludes RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fribourg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lau et al., 2003</a>). RRMs also can serve as oligomerization domains. In the case of Human antigen R (HuR), the third RRM promotes dimerization through its \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#bib29\">Scheiba et al., 2014</a>). These examples highlight the possibility that RRMs 3 and 4 of Nop4 may mediate protein binding and hub function through more than one of its structural motifs. The ANE mutation lies in an \u03b1-helix and the mutation disrupts not only the \u03b1-helix, but unfolds the RRM tertiary structure. Since the mutation abrogates some but not all protein-protein interactions, a subset of Nop4 interactions may be mediated by unstructured peptide elements in RRM3 or by the RRM4 domain."

In the yeast model system, the mutation confers reduced growth and mild pre-rRNA processing defects when compared to the Nop4 null (EV).

One experimental issue is that Nop4 functions within the nucleolus and thus needs to be targeted there to function. A quick perusal of the literature shows no published information on how Nop4 enters the nucleus \u2013 which it must do to access the nucleolus. There are a number of predicted classical nuclear localization motifs and most are in the C-terminal domain of the protein. While this is not an issue for the two-hybrid system which presumably contains a nuclear targeting module, this could be an issue for the functional studies. The authors should really include localization as an aspect of their studies to validate their conclusions that the Rrm3-4 mediates the essential function of Nop4 and that Rrm1-2 is not sufficient to do so (see detailed comments below)."

They show that when this mutation is transferred to the yeast gene, the formation of 25S rRNA is partially disrupted, (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and that the interaction of Nop4 with a number of other proteins is reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These are interesting findings, but perhaps not surprising since the mutation causes substantial reduction of 60S ribosome synthesis in human cells. The rest of the paper is concerned with Nop4 and its fragments in yeast, where they conclude that only the C=terminal half of Nop4 is sufficient for growth, but only at 23 degrees. Quite similar experiments were reported by Sun &amp; Woolford in 1997 (L611) that suggested all 4 RRMs were essential. But the difference is simply a matter of temperatures used for growth. Finally, (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) some protein structural measurements suggest that the L&gt;P mutation disrupts the structure of RRM3 suggesting that leads to loss of interactions with other members of the processosome."

The authors first validate the model system, demonstrate that the ANE mutation affects Nop4 \"hub\" function, investigate the molecular biology of the RRM3 and RRM4 domains of Nop4 and conclude with biophysical analyses demonstrating that the L351P mutation disrupts folding of the RRM3 domain. This is a very straightforward study employing basic yeast molecular genetics and complemented with some nice biophysical studies. The conclusions are warranted by the data. However, the work could benefit from some minor improvement, and some of the data analyses are questionable."

G&amp;D). They show that when this mutation is transferred to the yeast gene, the formation of 25S rRNA is partially disrupted, (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and that the interaction of Nop4 with a number of other proteins is reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These are interesting findings, but perhaps not surprising since the mutation causes substantial reduction of 60S ribosome synthesis in human cells. The rest of the paper is concerned with Nop4 and its fragments in yeast, where they conclude that only the C=terminal half of Nop4 is sufficient for growth, but only at 23 degrees. Quite similar experiments were reported by Sun &amp; Woolford in 1997 (L611) that suggested all 4 RRMs were essential. But the difference is simply a matter of temperatures used for growth. Finally, (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) some protein structural measurements suggest that the L&gt;P mutation disrupts the structure of RRM3 suggesting that leads to loss of interactions with other members of the processosome.</i> With all due respect, the reviewer is mistaken that we know that \u201cthe mutation causes substantial reduction of 60S ribosome synthesis in human cells.\u201d Indeed, this is not known, either for human or yeast cells. Our work here is the first time the consequences of the mutation have been investigated experimentally in either organism. In Nousbeck et al. (2008) where the ANE syndrome was first described, the authors counted mature free cytoplasmic ribosomes in micrographs of cultured fibroblasts by transmission EM, and found that numbers were reduced in patients with ANE syndrome. That is the extent of the experiment: no analysis of 40S or 60S synthesis was done. So we do not yet know how the ANE syndrome mutation affects ribosome biogenesis in any organism. That is one reason why our work presented here is so important and highly significant."
