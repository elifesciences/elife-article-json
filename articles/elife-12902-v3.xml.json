The C-terminal domain (CTD) of Ska1 binds microtubules and was proposed to facilitate kinetochore movement on depolymerizing spindle microtubules. Here, we show that Ska complex recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to kinetochores. This recruitment requires the Ska1 CTD, which binds PP1 in vitro and in human HeLa cells. Ska1 lacking its CTD fused to a PP1-binding peptide or fused directly to PP1 rescues mitotic defects caused by Ska1 depletion. Ska1 fusion to catalytically dead PP1 mutant does not rescue and shows dominant negative effects. Thus, the Ska complex, specifically the Ska1 CTD, recruits PP1 to kinetochores to oppose spindle checkpoint signaling kinases and promote anaphase onset. Microtubule binding by Ska, rather than acting in force production for chromosome movement, may instead serve to promote PP1 recruitment to kinetochores fully attached to spindle microtubules at metaphase."

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of Ska1 binds microtubules and was proposed to facilitate kinetochore movement on depolymerizing spindle microtubules. Here, we show that Ska complex recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to kinetochores. This recruitment requires the Ska1 CTD, which binds PP1 in vitro and in human HeLa cells. Ska1 lacking its CTD fused to a PP1-binding peptide or fused directly to PP1 rescues mitotic defects caused by Ska1 depletion. Ska1 fusion to catalytically dead PP1 mutant does not rescue and shows dominant negative effects. Thus, the Ska complex, specifically the Ska1 CTD, recruits PP1 to kinetochores to oppose spindle checkpoint signaling kinases and promote anaphase onset. Microtubule binding by Ska, rather than acting in force production for chromosome movement, may instead serve to promote PP1 recruitment to kinetochores fully attached to spindle microtubules at metaphase."

Until metaphase, APC/C activity is restrained by the spindle checkpoint. Recent studies indicate that a key element in extinguishing checkpoint signaling when chromosomes align at metaphase is the displacement of the critical checkpoint signaling kinase, Mps1, from its substrate, Knl1, at kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aravamudhan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hiruma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ji et al., 2015</a>). Then, to allow anaphase onset and mitotic exit, Mps1 phosphorylation events must be reversed by phosphatases. Previously, we showed that depletion of the Ska complex leads to a strong metaphase arrest or delay (<a href=\"#bib5\">Daum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sivakumar et al., 2014</a>). Even when Mps1 was directly inhibited with a strong chemical inhibitor, cells depleted of the Ska complex exited mitosis more slowly (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sivakumar et al., 2014</a>). These results suggested that the Ska complex played some role in opposition to, or downstream of, checkpoint signaling. Here, we provide evidence that the Ska complex recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to kinetochores, consistent with a role in opposing checkpoint signaling by kinetochore-associated kinases."

The Ska complex interacted with similar amounts of PP1 in control and Knl1-depleted cells. Knl1 also co-IPed similar amounts of PP1 from control and Ska3-depleted cells, indicating that Ska depletion did not affect the Knl1-PP1 interaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). By antibody staining and by using a\u00a0HeLa-PP1\u03b3GFP stable cell line, we found that kinetochore PP1 levels were low and were slightly above the background signals of soluble, non-kinetochore PP1. Individual depletions of Knl1 or Ska3 reduced the kinetochore PP1 levels to the background levels. Thus, we were unable to determine the individual contributions of Ska and Knl1 toward kinetochore recruitment of PP1 by immunostaining.

Endogenous Ska1 was depleted using Ska1 siRNA. Hoechst 33342 was added at 25\u00a0ng/ml to visualize DNA. Cells were then imaged by time-lapse microscopy, and\u00a0% of mitotic cells arrested in metaphase was plotted. As expected, expression of siRNA-resistant mCherry-Ska1 rescued metaphase arrest caused by Ska1 depletion while expression of mCherry-PP1 or mCherry-Ska1\u0394CTD did not. Expression of Ska1\u0394CTDPP1 fusion in Ska1 depleted cells completely rescued metaphase arrest. (<b>B</b>) The interval from NEB to anaphase onset is plotted for cells that progressed to anaphase while expressing Ska1 constructs without or with depletion of endogenous Ska1. As expected, Ska1\u0394CTD-expression showed a dominant negative effect delaying mitotic progression in control cells not depleted of endogenous Ska1. Expression of the fusion, Ska1\u0394CTDPP1, caused no delay. When endogenous Ska1 was depleted, 38% of cells arrested at metaphase and did not progress to anaphase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The rest showed delayed progression from NEB to anaphase with an average of 110 min compared to control cells (35 min). As expected, the delay was rescued by expression of mCherry-Ska1 but was not rescued by expression of mCherry-PP1 or mCherry-Ska1\u0394CTD. Expression of Ska1\u0394CTDPP1 showed significant rescue of the delay cause by Ska1 depletion with an average time from NEB to anaphase of 62 min. (<b>C</b>) HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and then treated with mock or Ska1 siRNA. Expression of Ska1\u0394CTD fused to a phosphatase dead PP1 (Ska1\u0394CTDpdPP1) failed to rescue Ska1 depletion. Indeed, expression of phosphatase dead fusion, on its own, induced a potent metaphase arrest phenotype in cells not depleted of endogenous Ska1. Moreover, it exacerbated the metaphase arrest in cells depleted of Ska1. (<b>D</b>) Ska1\u0394CTDpdPP1 causes a longer delay to anaphase onset than Ska1\u0394CTD even without depletion of endogenous Ska1. (<b>E</b>) Chromosome alignment is delayed in Ska1 depleted cells and this is recapitulated by expression of Ska1\u0394CTDpdPP1 without endogenous Ska1 depletion. Delays in chromosome alignment are not observed upon expression of Ska1\u0394CTDPP1 fusion. (<b>F</b>) Hypothetical model for dynamic balance of Mps1 kinase and PP1 phosphatase activities during mitotic progression. Photobleaching studies have shown that Mps1, Ska, and PP1 all exhibit high turnover at kinetochores with a residence times of a few seconds (<a href=\"#bib36\">Raaijmakers et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Howell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2003</a>). Before microtubule attachment, Mps1 concentration at kinetochores remains high due to interaction with the CH domains of the Ndc80 complex. Correspondingly, Ska-PP1 concentrations are low because of the paucity of microtubules. The high Mps1 and low PP1 concentrations maintain high phosphorylation Mps1 substrates, Knl1 and Bub1. Microtubules compete with Mps1 for binding to the CH domains of the Ndc80 complex, resulting in depletion of Mps1. The binding of Ska to microtubule protofilaments increases PP1 concentration. High Ska-PP1 and low Mps1 result in dephosphorylation of substrates, promoting release of Bub1\u2013Bub3 and Mad1\u2013Mad2 complexes. Diminished checkpoint signaling due to release of Bub1\u2013Bub3 and Mad1\u2013Mad2 from kinetochores promotes anaphase onset and mitotic exit."

Expression of PP1 H248K (phosphatase dead PP1/pdPP1) without fusion to Ska1 was toxic to cells and induced cell death in interphase (data not shown). Expression of Ska1\u0394CTD-PP1 H248K (Ska1\u0394CTDpdPP1) allowed cells to enter mitosis, but failed to rescue the mitotic delay of Ska1-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7C,D,E\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The chromosome alignment delays observed upon Ska1 depletion were also rescued by expression of Ska1-PP1 fusion protein but not by expression of Ska1\u0394CTDpdPP1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Indeed, mere expression of Ska1\u0394CTDpdPP1 without Ska1 depletion resulted in phenotypes remarkably similar to those caused by Ska1 depletion, indicating that this mutant acted in a dominant negative manner.

This signaling requires the KMN complex, composed of the Knl1 protein, the Mis12 protein complex, and the Ndc80 protein complex. The central checkpoint kinase, Mps1, phosphorylates several methionine-glutamate-leucine-threonine (MELT) motifs on Knl1. The Bub1\u2013Bub3 complex binds to phosphorylated MELT motifs and further recruits its binding partner, the BubR1\u2013Bub3 complex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yamagishi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shepperd et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">London et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Primorac et al., 2013</a>). Mps1 also phosphorylates Bub1 to promote recruitment of the Mad1\u2013Mad2 protein complex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yamagishi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">London et al., 2012</a>). In the absence of microtubules, Mps1 associates with kinetochores via the Calponin homology (CH) domains of the Ndc80 complex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hiruma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ji et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kemmler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nijenhuis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>). Photobleaching studies show that Mps1 binding to kinetochores is highly dynamic, with a turnover time of ~13 s (<a href=\"#bib17\">Howell et al., 2004</a>). The binding of microtubules to the Ndc80 complex displaces Mps1, and in budding yeast, this results in a rearrangement of kinetochore substructure such that Mps1 loses access to Knl1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aravamudhan et al., 2015</a>). In metazoans, microtubule binding to Ndc80 displaces Mps1 from kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hiruma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ji et al., 2015</a>). Thus, displacement of Mps1 from the Ndc80 complex by microtubule binding appears to be a central element of turning off kinase signaling. In metazoans, dynein 'stripping' of checkpoint proteins, including Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1, plays an additional role in down regulating the checkpoint signal."

Abrogating checkpoint signaling with a chemical inhibitor of Mps1 induces mitotic exit in cells arrested in mitosis with high concentrations of microtubule poisons, but this exit is slower in cells depleted of Ska (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sivakumar et al., 2014</a>). This result is consistent with the idea that Ska functions in opposition to and downstream of checkpoint signaling. Here, we show that the Ska complex is required for full kinetochore recruitment of PP1, a likely candidate for reversing checkpoint kinase phosphorylations. The fact that Ska depletion cannot completely block mitotic exit when Mps1 inhibitors are added likely reflects the fact that other pools of PP1 or other phosphatases, particularly PP2A, may also play a role in mitotic exit (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Grallert et al., 2015</a>).

Since the C-terminal domain is involved in binding to both PP1 and microtubules, we propose to name this domain simply as the CTD, instead of the MTBD. Consistent with a role in opposing Mps1 checkpoint signaling, we find that in cells where PP1 binding to Ska1 is compromised, there is a 30% increase in phosphorylation of a MELT motif on Knl1 and a 20% increase in recruitment of Bub1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). A similar (30\u201340%) increase in MELT phosphorylation and Bub1 levels also occurs upon mutation of Knl1 to inhibit its binding to PP1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</a>). We sugggest that the pools of PP1 at the kinetochore are distinct and may play cooperative and specific roles at different stages of mitosis. It remains possible that there are unidentified targets whose dephosphorylation is more reliant on PP1 bound to Ska. The increase in Bub1 levels that we observe is also consistent with our earlier finding that Bub1 levels on kinetochores were increased in cells depleted of Ska3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Daum et al., 2009</a>). Although Ska does localize at kinetochores not attached to microtubules, it accumulates to its highest levels on kinetochores of cells at metaphase, the moment in time when quickly reversing checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation would be most useful in initiating anaphase."

It has the characteristics of a winged helix domain, a fold previously implicated in DNA binding and in mediating protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). It was shown that the Ska1 CTD binds microtubules through multiple sites and can bind both straight and curved microtubule protofilaments (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). The same Ska1 CTD is also required for PP1 binding. Because the Ska1 CTD binds to both microtubules and PP1, its functions in promoting chromosome alignment and anaphase onset might be a consequence of either or both activities. In previous work, it was shown that mutation of three conserved arginine residues in the Ska 1 CTD (R155A/R236A/R245A) compromised binding to microtubules in vitro and produced only a partial rescue of the metaphase delay caused by Ska1 depletion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). We found that this mutant of Ska1 R3A was still able to co-precipitate PP1 in extracts from cells where both were expressed as transgenes (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). On the other hand, complete replacement of the CTD by a PP1-binding motif or by PP1 itself resulted in nearly complete rescue of all Ska1 depletion phenotypes, suggesting that microtubule binding by the Ska complex can be made dispensable. We previously reported that Ska depletion does not impair chromatid separation in cells induced to enter anaphase by application of a chemical Cdk1 inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sivakumar et al., 2014</a>). Based on that work and the data presented here, we propose that the microtubule-binding properties of Ska1 do not play a strong mechanical coupling function for kinetochore movement on microtubules. We were unable to find a Ska1 point mutant that retained microtubule binding but was deficient in PP1 binding to further test this idea. Given the clear molecular evidence for Ska binding to microtubules and to microtubule protofilaments, we favor the idea that microtubule binding to Ska serves a regulatory role. We propose that Ska1 CTD binds near the ends of kinetochore microtubules, where separated protofilaments are enriched. This binding in concert with Ska complex interactions with other kinetochore components, may control the local concentration, dynamics, or substrate specificity of the Ska-PP1 complex at kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

The N terminus of all Knl1 homologs from yeast to mammals contain conserved PP1-binding motifs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). In budding and fission yeast, expression of Knl1 mutants unable to bind PP1 impaired the ability of the cells to overcome checkpoint signaling and strongly compromised cell growth (<a href=\"#bib26\">Meadows et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rosenberg et al., 2011</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i> embryos, RNAi-mediated depletion of wild type Knl1 and its replacement with a PP1-binding mutant led to slow chromosome congression, delays at metaphase, and partial embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib9\">Espeut et al., 2012</a>). The role of Knl1 binding of PP1 was studied in mammalian cells treated with nocodazole to disrupt microtubules and induce a strong spindle checkpoint arrest. Under these conditions, cells in which Knl1 was replaced with a PP1-binding mutant showed slower mitotic exit in comparison to controls when spindle checkpoint signaling was experimentally extinguished with a chemical inhibitor of Mps1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</a>). Together these studies have led to a model in which PP1 binding by Knl1 is a key factor in opposing checkpoint signaling for promoting the onset of anaphase and mitotic exit. However, one important result argues that this model does not fully explain the regulation of the metaphase-anaphase transition in normal mammalian cell mitosis. In mammalian cells with intact spindles, not treated with microtubule drugs, replacement of wild type Knl1 with a mutant Knl1 unable to bind PP1 results in only a modest, 10-min delay at metaphase (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, loss of PP1 recruitment by the Ska complex during normal mitosis causes a lengthy delay or complete arrest at metaphase. Importantly, Ska homologs have not been identified in budding or fission yeast, consistent with the importance of PP1 recruitment by Knl1 in those organisms. In <i>C. elegans</i>, a two-protein Ska complex is present (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). However, RNAi and mutant studies on Ska homologs in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos have not revealed an essential role in chromosome segregation (Arshad Desai, personal communication). Interestingly, an elegant approach for manipulating protein interactions within kinetochores in budding yeast at nanometer resolution indicated that recruitment of the yeast PP1 homolog to outer kinetochores was important for reversing Mps1 phosphorylations of Knl1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aravamudhan et al., 2015</a>). In mammalian cells with intact mitotic spindles, our study suggests that Ska, an outer kinetochore protein complex, is a critical recruiter of PP1 in opposing spindle checkpoint kinase signaling at kinetochores."

Interestingly, similar to the Ska1 CTD, the N-terminal region of Knl1 adjacent to its PP1-binding motif also binds microtubules in vitro (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cheeseman et al., 2006</a>). It is conceivable that the microtubule-binding domains of Knl1 and Ska1 may each regulate their associated PP1 pools, allowing them to be sensitive to the attachment status of the kinetochore. In addition, several other PP1-interacting proteins, including Cenp-E, SDS22 and Repo-man, have been identified as playing roles in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Posch et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</a>). However, these proteins, when expressed at endogenous levels, do not normally accumulate at kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Eiteneuer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wurzenberger et al., 2012</a>). During other stages of mitosis, prometaphase and anaphase, they may function in regulating PP1 activities on kinetochores, chromosome arms, and in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eiteneuer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wurzenberger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Qian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Qian et al., 2011</a>). In the future, it will be important to determine which specific protein phosphorylations are targeted by Ska-PP1 or by other PP1-binding proteins during mitosis. Finally, it is clear that PP2A, and possibly other phosphatases also play vital roles in regulating phosphorylation to control chromosome movement and cell cycle progression in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Foley et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Grallert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kruse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Porter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Espert et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "In summary, here we make the surprising discovery that a chimeric Ska1-PP1 fusion lacking the microtubule-binding domain of Ska1 rescues nearly all the mitotic phenotypes observed upon Ska depletion, including delays in chromosome alignment and metaphase arrest. This rescue is fully dependent on the phosphatase activity of the chimera. Moreover, when expressed on its own, the phosphatase-dead Ska1-PP1 chimera has dominant phenotypes that closely mimic those of Ska depletion. Thus, rather than serving a mechanical coupling function between kinetochores and microtubules, the microtubule-binding properties of the Ska complex may primarily aid in coordinating PP1 recruitment to, or activity at, kinetochores. Our data suggest that PP1 recruitment is a critical function of the Ska complex for opposing mitotic kinases that destabilize kinetochore-microtubule attachment and that signal the spindle checkpoint. Thus, the Ska complex may integrate chromosome alignment at metaphase with full recruitment of PP1, thus opposing spindle checkpoint kinases signaling and promoting the metaphase-anaphase transition."

The instrument\u2019s LED (illumination) power was set to 25% and the MST laser power was set to 40%. Measurements were performed at ambient temperature, ca. 23\u00b0C. The times of data acquisition were 5 s before the activation of the MST laser, 30 s with the laser on, and 5 s after extinguishing the laser. Data analysis was performed in PALMIST (biophysics.swmed.edu/MBR/software.html) using the T-Jump mode (<a href=\"#bib38\">Scheuermann et al., 2016</a>). A negative control experiment in which Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) was titrated into labeled PP1 under identical conditions showed only a weak trend in T-jump behavior (data not shown)."

Whole cell HeLa cell extracts were lysed in buffer (25\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 75\u00a0mM NaCl, 5\u00a0mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% NP-40, 0.4% Triton X 100, 1\u20135\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5\u2009\u03bcM okadaic acid, 5\u00a0mM NaF, 0.3\u00a0mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 10\u00a0mM \u03b2 Glycerophosphate, 50 units/ml Turbo-nuclease (Accelagen, San Diego, CA))containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysate was cleared by high-speed centrifugation at 20,817\u00a0g for 20 min. The supernatant after centrifugation was added to antibody coupled beads and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20134\u2009hr by end-over-end rotation. After incubation, the beads were washed three\u00a0to\u00a0four times and the immunoprecipitation reaction was terminated by addition of 2X SDS sample buffer. The immuno-precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and blotted with specific antibodies. Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-GFP antibody (made in house), mouse anti-Myc (Roche), rabbit anti-Knl1 (made in house) and rabbit anti-Ska3 (made in house). Membranes were washed in TBS/0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and then incubated with secondary antibodies in 5% NFDM/TBST. Secondary antibodies were Dylight fluorescent dye conjugated (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and the membranes were analyzed with the Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging system (LICOR, Lincoln, NE). The protein bands on the membranes were quantified using Image Studio software (LICOR). Every experiment was repeated at least three times, and the quantification shows the mean with SEM in each case."

PP1 activity is essential to reverse the spindle checkpoint and promote anaphase, so the findings in the paper are significant to the field of mitosis as well as to those interested in phosphatase regulation. The authors suggest that PP1 and Ska1 interact through the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Ska1 and that the phenotypes of cells containing mutants in this domain are due to defects in PP1 recruitment to kinetochores. While the findings in the manuscript are potentially exciting, the major concern with the work is that a direct interaction between PP1 and the Ska1 CTD was not demonstrated. This leads to the concern that the association could be indirect, so the following work needs to be completed for a revision to be accepted."

Active PP1 is difficult to purify in large quantity, which is a requirement for ITC. MST is a relatively new and sensitive technique to measure protein interactions in vitro. To perform MST, we sought help from an expert, Chad A Brautigam, who has been added as a co-author. We determined that the K<sub>d</sub> of the Ska1 CTD-PP1 interaction is 1.5 \u03bcM. This is comparable to other protein-protein interactions that allow dynamics. We have presented these data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> of the revised manuscript. Note that these data are also supported by the gel filtration (SEC) data that we originally included that shows a direct interaction between PP1 and the Ska complex with recombinant proteins. These SEC data demonstrated a requirement for Ska1 CTD in direct PP1 binding. We could not, however, detect an interaction between PP1 and the isolated Ska1 CTD using SEC, presumably due to the moderate affinity of this interaction. Concentration of the Ska complex at kinetochores may allow cooperative binding, or other components of the Ska complex may contribute to PP1 binding."
