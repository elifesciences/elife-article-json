Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding the optimal dose, duration, and mechanisms of action in the context of healthy aging. Here we show that 3 months of rapamycin treatment is sufficient to increase life expectancy by up to 60% and improve measures of healthspan in middle-aged mice. This transient treatment is also associated with a remodeling of the microbiome, including dramatically increased prevalence of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. We also define a dose in female mice that does not extend lifespan, but is associated with a striking shift in cancer prevalence toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from non-hematopoietic malignancies. These data suggest that a short-term rapamycin treatment late in life has persistent effects that can robustly delay aging, influence cancer prevalence, and modulate the microbiome."

Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding the optimal dose, duration, and mechanisms of action in the context of healthy aging. Here we show that 3 months of rapamycin treatment is sufficient to increase life expectancy by up to 60% and improve measures of healthspan in middle-aged mice. This transient treatment is also associated with a remodeling of the microbiome, including dramatically increased prevalence of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. We also define a dose in female mice that does not extend lifespan, but is associated with a striking shift in cancer prevalence toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from non-hematopoietic malignancies. These data suggest that a short-term rapamycin treatment late in life has persistent effects that can robustly delay aging, influence cancer prevalence, and modulate the microbiome."

By delaying the biological aging process, it may be possible to reduce the impact of age-related diseases, which could have great benefits for society and the quality of life of individuals. A drug called rapamycin, which is currently used to prevent organ rejection in transplant recipients, is a leading candidate for targeting aging. Rapamycin increases lifespan in several types of animals and delays the onset of many age-related conditions in mice."

For example, the high doses of rapamycin used in transplant patients cause side effects including poor wound healing, elevated blood cholesterol levels, and mouth ulcers. Before rapamycin can be used to promote healthy aging in humans, researchers must better understand at what point in life the drug is most effective, and what dose to use to provide the biggest benefit while limiting the side effects."

In the experiments, mice were given two different doses of rapamycin for only three months starting at 20 months old (equivalent to about 60-65 years old in humans). After receiving the lower dose, both male and female mice lived about 50% longer than untreated mice, and showed improvements in their muscle strength and motor coordination. When given the higher dose, male mice showed an even greater increase in life expectancy, but the female mice did not. These female mice had an increased risk of developing rare and aggressive forms of blood cancer, but were protected from other types of cancer."

The drug rapamycin is a promising candidate for such an intervention, as it has been shown to increase lifespan in numerous species (<a href=\"#bib18\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>) and to delay or reverse multiple age-associated phenotypes in mice including cognitive decline (<a href=\"#bib14\">Halloran et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Majumder et al., 2012</a>), cardiac dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Flynn et al., 2013</a>), immune senescence (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2009</a>), and cancer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anisimov et al., 2011</a>). Recently, a six week treatment with the rapamycin derivative RAD001 was reported to improve immune function in elderly people, as measured by response to influenza vaccine (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mannick\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>), suggesting that at least some of the effects on aging in mice are conserved in humans. Despite these impressive results, the utility of rapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors to delay aging may be limited by side effects. The high doses of rapamycin and its derivatives used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection are associated with adverse events, including impaired wound healing, edema, elevated circulating triglycerides, impaired glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal discomfort, and mouth ulcers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Augustine et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Oliveira et al., 2011</a>). While many of these side effects have not been observed in mice at the lower doses that extend lifespan, chronic treatment with encapsulated rapamycin (eRapa) in the diet at 14 ppm has been reported to cause gonadal degeneration in males, increased risk of cataracts, and impaired response to a glucose tolerance test (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wilkinson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lamming et al., 2012</a>)."

We initially used a treatment regimen consisting of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 8 mg/kg rapamycin daily for 90 days. This dose was selected because we have previously found that it increases survival and alleviates disease phenotypes in short-lived mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, and the severe mitochondrial disease Leigh Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ramos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>). Based on efficacy in the Leigh Syndrome mouse model and serum drug levels in wild type mice, we estimate that this treatment regimen is comparable to dietary delivery of eRapa at approximately 378 ppm (<a href=\"#bib19\">Johnson et al., 2015</a>), or 27-fold higher levels than initially shown to extend lifespan in mice when continuous treatment is initiated at either 9 months or 20 months of age (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Miller et al., 2011</a>). Because prior studies have noted differences in the magnitude of lifespan extension following continuous rapamycin treatment in male versus female animals (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Miller et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2014</a>), we examined the effect of this regimen in both sexes independently. Serum rapamycin levels did not differ significantly between male and female animals in our study (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Decreased body weight persisted for several weeks following cessation of treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This was accompanied by a striking increase in median life expectancy from the end of treatment of 60% (p=0.02, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and an increase in overall median lifespan from birth of 16% (p=0.03, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This effect is larger than both the absolute and relative magnitude of lifespan extension resulting from continuous treatment to death with 14 ppm eRapa starting at around the same age in UMHET3 mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>). The longest-lived rapamycin-treated male in our cohort survived for 710 days post treatment to approximately 1400 days of age. Based on a survey of the literature, this is likely one of the longest-lived wild type C57BL/6 animals ever reported."

Cox proportional hazards regression with robust standard errors and adjusting for cohort indicated significant evidence of a treatment difference between male and female mice (p=0.023). We speculated that this lack of lifespan extension results from an increase in aggressive hematopoietic cancers in the rapamycin treated females. Histopathological analysis showed that while 6/12 control females had round cell tumors (lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma of hematopoietic origins), comparable to previous studies in C57BL/6 mice (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackwell et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Treuting et al., 2008</a>), all the rapamycin-treated females examined (16 out of 16) had round cell tumors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, p=0.002). Additionally, an uncommon variant of lymphoma with plasmacytoid morphology affected 4 out of 16 mice examined in the rapamycin group and no vehicle treated mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Round cell tumors affected more organs in rapamycin treated females, with multiple (\u22652) organs affected in all of the rapamycin treated females compared to only 3 vehicle treated females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>,\u00a0p=0.01). Together, these data indicate a more aggressive phenotype of hematopoietic tumors in the high dose rapamycin treated females. In contrast, the incidence of non-hematopoietic neoplasms was dramatically decreased in the rapamycin group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Nine non-hematopoietic neoplasms (5 pituitary adenomas, and 2 pulmonary adenomas, and 2 thyroid adenomas) were detected in 7 out of the 12 examined vehicle treated mice; whereas, only 1 out of 16 rapamycin treated females had non-hematopoietic neoplasia (1 pituitary adenoma) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, p=0.004)."

Several male mice also had eosinophilic (hyaline) protein droplets in the renal tubules consistent with lysozyme accumulation associated with histiocytic sarcoma (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hard and Snowden, 1991</a>). Of the examined vehicle treated males, all (14 out of 14) had hematopoietic neoplasia affecting at least one organ. Additionally, 7 other types of neoplasia were detected on histopathology from the vehicle treated male group, including 1 gastric neoplasia, 1 thyroid adenoma, and 5 pulmonary adenomas. One male mouse had a subcutaneous facial mass characterized by sheets of round cells, most consistent with an extramedullary plasma cell tumor or mast cell tumor. Rapamycin treated males also had a high incidence of systemic round cell neoplasia affecting at least one organ (9 out of 13). In the rapamycin treated male group, 12 additional non-round cell tumors were detected on histopathology, including 1 hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 intestinal adenomas, 1 splenic hemangiosarcoma, 5 pulmonary adenomas, 1 pulmonary carcinoma, 1 thyroid adenoma, and 1 Zymbal\u2019s gland adenoma (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the male group, no cases of systemic lymphoma with plasmacytoid morphology were seen. Although the number of mice examined is relatively small, based on these observations we speculate that this regimen of rapamycin treatment induced the detrimental side effect of aggressive hematopoietic cancers specifically in female mice, which occurred earlier in life and were sufficient to prevent lifespan extension in these animals despite other beneficial effects, such as reduced non-hematopoietic cancers. When data from both sexes are pooled together, daily injection of 8 mg/kg rapamycin for three months resulted in a non-significant (p=0.16) increase in life expectancy of 23% (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Between randomization and the end of treatment, 5 male mice (3 vehicle, 2 rapamycin) died of non-age related causes and were excluded from the analysis. Their inclusion in the analysis of survival does not significantly affect the results as described above (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In contrast with the effects of daily injection of 8 mg/kg rapamycin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2A</a>), body weight and food intake were largely unaffected by this dietary rapamycin regimen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4 A,C,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), except for a transient, small increase in body weight in female mice fed eRapa, as determined by Student\u2019s t test (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Median post-treatment life expectancy was significantly increased by 42% when female and male animals were considered together (p=0.002, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) and overall lifespan was increased by 13% (p=0.003, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>).

This difference was present in both dry (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>) and freshly excreted feces (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that water content is not a major factor affecting feces size. In addition, feces size was affected independently of the method of rapamycin delivery (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), and the effect was persistent after cessation of treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). We hypothesized that changes in the microbiome may underlie this phenotype and therefore analyzed the fecal microbiome for each of the cohorts used in this study by deep-sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA. Distance based permutation multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson, 2001</a>) indicated that rapamycin treatment induced a significant change in the composition of fecal microbiome (p=0.018 for injection cohorts. p=0.015 for feeding cohorts.p=0.005 for pooled cohorts), even after accounting for delivery method and batch effects (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6s3\">3</a>)."

SFB are intestinal Gram-positive bacteria with a segmented and filamentous morphology, and are not normally present at high levels in aged mice (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ericsson et al., 2014</a>). The SFB genome lacks a majority of virulence factors and SFB are not invasive (<a href=\"#bib29\">Prakash\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011</a>); however, their tight adhesion to the intestinal epithelial cell induces differentiation of host immune cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atarashi et al., 2015</a>). The increase in SFB following rapamycin treatment was confirmed by real-time PCR of DNA from fecal samples obtained from both mice receiving injections or encapsulated rapamycin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), as well as by semi-quantitative histological scoring of the small intestine in an independent cohort of mice obtained from the Harrison Lab at the Jackson Laboratory and injected with 8 mg/kg/day of for 3 months at the University of Washington (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Since increased SFB DNA was observed both in mice injected with rapamycin and mice fed dietary eRapa, this effect is independent of mode of drug delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first pharmacological intervention to increase SFB in any animal. It will be of interest to determine whether these and other effects of rapamycin on the microbiome are shared across species and play any causal role in the beneficial or detrimental effects of this drug."

This work extends prior evidence indicating that short-term rapamycin treatment can improve health in mice, including one experiment suggesting that 4 mg/kg rapamycin every other day for 6 weeks enhanced survival until around 30 months of age in a small cohort (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2009</a>), and studies reporting improvements in cardiac (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Flynn et al., 2013</a>) and immune (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2009</a>) function following transient treatment with rapamycin. In the animals treated with the 126 ppm eRapa diet in this study, the improvements in lifespan and health were achieved without overt detrimental side effects, although it is possible that some side effects were undetected, and we did not explicitly test for cataracts, gonadal degeneration, and other adverse outcomes. In the case of the 8 mg/kg/day injection regimen, serious side effects were noted in female, but not male mice. Intriguingly, a dramatic shift toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from non-hematopoietic cancers was observed in these female mice. This is consistent with a similar weak trend seen in kidney transplant patients receiving rapamycin to prevent organ rejection, suggesting a possible conservation of mechanism and clinical relevance (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mathew et al., 2004</a>). Our data indicate a need to carefully consider sex effects when optimizing treatment regimens and mechanism of drug action. They also illustrate the importance of better understanding the effects of mTOR inhibitors on differential cancer risk, particularly as mTOR inhibitors are being tested and used clinically for a variety of purposes including the treatment of some rare forms of cancer. The importance of evaluating potential risks and adverse side effects when developing interventions to promote healthy aging should not be underestimated."

From a translational perspective, a healthy aging intervention that can be applied for a relatively short period of time during mid- or late-life is likely to have advantages in cost, practicability and quality of life of people, and we look forward to further developments in this area."

Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages (Allentown, Allentown, NJ) containing corncob bedding (Andersons, Maumee, OH) and nestlets.

Mice were inspected daily, and medicated for non-life threatening conditions as directed by the veterinary staff. Date of death was recorded when mice were found dead or unlikely to survive longer than 48 hr at the time of inspection. Mice were euthanized according to the following criteria (modified from the Intervention Testing Program protocol [<a href=\"#bib16\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>]) when they showed one of these symptoms: (1) inability to eat or drink, (2) severe lethargy, as indicated by a lack of response such as a reluctance to move when gently prodded, (3) severe respiratory difficulty while at rest, indicated by a regular pattern of deep abdominal excursions or gasping, or showing any combination of the following features: (a) severe balance and gait disturbance, (b) an ulcerated or bleeding tumor, visible to the naked eye and breaking through the skin of the animal, or rapid weight gain associated with visible or palpable masses, or (c) Body Condition Score equal to 1 or loss of 20% of body weight in the course of seven days. Survival data is shown from the end of treatment (23\u201324 months of age). Deaths before and during the three month treatment period by group were as follows: 2 vehicle-injected males, 3 rapamycin-injected males, 1 eudragit fed female, 1 eRapa fed male. Sentinel mice (Crl:CD1[ICR]; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were tested quarterly and were negative for endo/ectoparasites, mouse norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, mouse parvovirus, and rotavirus. Sentinel mice were tested annually for Mycoplasma pulmonis, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus 3, Sendai virus, and Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus. All care of experimental animals was in accordance with the University of Washington institutional guidelines and experiments were performed as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee."

Assessment of some healthspan metrics (grip strength and rotorod performance) is also included. The authors present intriguing data showing sex-specific differences with high dose rapamycin in terms of lifespan extension and effect on cancer development, and congruent effects on longevity in both sexes with lower dose, oral administration. Finally, they report differences in the composition of gut microbiota that are associated with rapamycin administration. Reviewers agreed that the manuscript has a number of strengths, but also several weaknesses."

Furthermore, the association with changes in microbiota composition present some intriguing potential explanations for rapamycin's effects. Yet, this aspect of the study also represents its major limitation, as the authors do not provide any direct link between SFB colonization and lifespan extension. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the aged mice used for analysis of SFB colonization and lifespan studies derive from different animal colonies. The inclusion of additional data that strengthen the connection between SFB, rapamycin and lifespan regulation is needed. In addition, it is essential to assess plasma levels of rapamycin achieved by the different dosing regimens in male vs. female mice."
