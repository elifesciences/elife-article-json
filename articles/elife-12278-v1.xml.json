The membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF2 is released into the cytosol upon its phosphorylation by Akt. In this study, we show that ZNRF2 interacts with mTOR on membranes, promoting the amino acid-stimulated translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes and its activation in human cells. ZNRF2 also interacts with the V-ATPase and preserves lysosomal acidity. Moreover, knockdown of ZNRF2 decreases cell size and cell proliferation. Upon growth factor and amino acid stimulation, mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 on Ser145, and this phosphosite is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 6. Ser145 phosphorylation stimulates vesicle-to-cytosol translocation of ZNRF2 and forms a novel negative feedback on mTORC1. Our findings uncover ZNRF2 as a component of the amino acid sensing machinery that acts upstream of Rag-GTPases and the V-ATPase to activate mTORC1."

The membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF2 is released into the cytosol upon its phosphorylation by Akt. In this study, we show that ZNRF2 interacts with mTOR on membranes, promoting the amino acid-stimulated translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes and its activation in human cells. ZNRF2 also interacts with the V-ATPase and preserves lysosomal acidity. Moreover, knockdown of ZNRF2 decreases cell size and cell proliferation. Upon growth factor and amino acid stimulation, mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 on Ser145, and this phosphosite is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 6. Ser145 phosphorylation stimulates vesicle-to-cytosol translocation of ZNRF2 and forms a novel negative feedback on mTORC1. Our findings uncover ZNRF2 as a component of the amino acid sensing machinery that acts upstream of Rag-GTPases and the V-ATPase to activate mTORC1."

In contrast, when cells are starved of amino acids, this phosphate group is removed from ZNRF2, which then returns to the membranes. On membranes, ZNRF2 also influences the activity of a pump called V-ATPase, which controls the internal acidity of the membrane-enclosed vesicles named lysosomes that help to recycle amino acids inside cells.

Through phosphorylation of its substrates, including ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and the eIF4E-binding proteins (4-EBP), mTORC1 stimulates mRNA translation and, ultimately, cell growth and proliferation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fingar and Blenis, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Showkat et al., 2014</a>). mTORC1 activation involves its recruitment onto late endosomes and lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ogmundsdottir et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sancak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zoncu et al., 2011</a>). Growth stimuli regulate mTORC1 via the heterotrimeric TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex, which negatively regulates the Rheb-GTPase, an activator of mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dibble and Manning, 2013</a>). In parallel, amino acids signal to mTORC1 via the Rag GTPases, which consist of RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hirose et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sancak et al., 2008</a>).

More recently, work from the Sabatini group identified the GATOR1 complex as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the RagA/B GTPases, and as a major negative regulator of the amino acid sensing pathway, loss of which causes mTORC1 signalling to be completely insensitive to amino acid deprivation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</a>)."

The V-ATPase pump was shown to interact with the Ragulator complex in an amino acid-sensitive manner. This pump also supports the amino acid-promoted interaction between Ragulator and Rags, and the export of amino acids from the lysosome <i>via</i> PAT1 (proton-assisted transporter 1) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bar-Peled and Sabatini, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nada et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zoncu et al., 2011</a>). The V-ATPase is a large, multisubunit H<sup>+</sup> pump composed of V1 (catalytic) and V0 (membrane-spanning) subcomplexes.

                                "text": "To better understand the molecular function of ZNRF2, we aimed to identify ZNRF2-interacting proteins. To do this, extracts of HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP-ZNRF2 (N-terminal tag, non-myristoylated) and ZNRF2-GFP (C-terminal tag, myristoylated) were subjected to immunoprecipitation. After SDS-PAGE, strong bands at the molecular weights expected for the GFP-tagged ZNRF2 proteins were identified as such by mass spectrometric analyses (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). As reported previously, the E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2N/UBC13 co-purified with both forms of ZNRF2, whereas the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>ATPase ATP1A1 subunit co-purified only with the N-myristoylated ZNRF2-GFP protein (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</a>). In addition, we identified mTOR as a high-score hit in the immunoprecipitates of N-myristoylated ZNRF2-GFP protein (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). The interactions of mTOR with ZNRF2 was confirmed by Western blotting, which showed that endogenous mTOR bind to ZNRF2-GFP, but not to the GFP-only control nor to an N-myristoylation-defective mutant (G2A) of ZNRF2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</a>), indicating that N-myristoylation of ZNRF2 is important for this interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). ZNRF2 also interacted with other components of the mTORC1 complex, namely raptor and mLST8 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>) and showed co-localization with mTOR in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). To test whether the binding of ZNRF2 to mTOR was direct or mediated by one of the mTORC1 or mTORC2 components, we immunoprecipitated ZNRF2-GFP from cells depleted of Raptor or from mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lacking rictor, Sin1 and mLST8 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1e,f</a>, respectively). ZNRF2 interacted with mTOR under all these conditions, indicating that raptor, rictor, Sin1 and mLST8 do not mediate the binding of ZNRF2 to mTOR (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1e,f</a>). We next aimed to identify regions in ZNRF2 responsible for interacting with mTOR. mTOR bound to both the N-terminal (1 to 156) region of ZNRF2 and C-terminal RING (catalytic) domain-containing region of ZNRF2, provided these fragments also carried an N-terminal myristoyl group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), but was not able to interact to ZNRF2 with a defective UBZ domain (Cys160Ala/Cys163Ala mutations) or to the RING domain alone (residues 156-end). These data indicate that membranal localization is required for the mTOR-ZNRF2 interaction, consistent with lack of mTOR binding to non-N- myristoylated ZNRF2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), and suggest that while the UBZ domain is involved, more than one domain of ZNRF2 contributes to mTOR binding."

                                "text": "We hypothesized that ZNRF2 is a substrate of mTOR. To explore this, we first performed in vitro kinase assay using bacterially purified ZNRF2-GST as a substrate of mTOR, which was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells. mTOR could phosphorylate ZNRF2-GST in vitro, and this was prevented by the mTOR-specific inhibitor Ku-0063794 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed a single phosphorylated residue, namely Ser145 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). Though ZNRF2 is conserved across eukaryotes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013c</a>), Ser145 is conserved only in the vertebrate proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2c</a>). To validate this phosphorylation, we raised a phospho-specific antibody against Ser145. In cells, the mTOR catalytic inhibitor, Ku-0063794, decreased Ser145 phosphorylation in response to IGF1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). Since this compound inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, to distinguish between these complexes, we selectively stimulated mTORC1 with either amino acids or cycloheximide (CHX) in the absence of growth factors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g,h</a>, respectively). Ser145 was markedly phosphorylated in response to these treatments and this effect was blocked by the mTORC1 specific inhibitor, rapamycin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g,h</a>), suggesting that mTORC1 rather than mTORC2 mediates Ser145 phosphorylation. However, while mTORC1 is solely responsible for amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser145, rapamycin decreased, but did not abolish Ser145 phosphorylation in response to IGF1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1g</a>), which suggests that another IGF1-activated kinase can also phosphorylate this site. The phosphorylation of Ser145 was not affected by the p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)-specific inhibitor PF-4708671 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pearce et al., 2010</a>), indicating that ZNRF2 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 rather than via S6K (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1j</a>). Moreover, phosphorylation of Ser145 was not decreased in rictor or mLST8 knock-out MEFs, ruling out the possibility that mTORC2 phosphorylates this site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1k and 1l</a>, respectively). Together, these data are consistent with Ser145 of ZNRF2 being phosphorylated by mTORC1 in response to growth factors and amino acids."

Consistent with mTORC1 being a Ser145 kinase, rapamycin increased the membranal localization of ZNRF2-GFP (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</a>). In addition, Ser145Ala mutation of ZNRF2 resulted in a more distinct membranal localization in comparison to the wild-type protein (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>). The expressed ZNRF2-GFP and Ser145Ala-ZNRF2-GFP co-localized predominantly with Golgi and to a lesser extent with the lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a,b</a>)."

The PP6 holoenzyme is a heteromeric complex, comprising the catalytic (PPP6C), three regulatory subunits PP6R1/2/3 (also called SIT4 phosphatase\u2013associated protein (SAPS1/2/3) and three ankyrin repeat-domain containing regulatory subunits (ANKRD28/44/52) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stefansson and Brautigan, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Stefansson et al., 2008</a>).

PP6 is also proposed to dephosphorylate GCN2 when mTORC1 is inhibited in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wengrod et al., 2015</a>). Since we found that ZNRF2 is a substrate of mTORC1 and interacts with PP6, we tested whether PP6 could dephosphorylate ZNRF2 in vitro. Active PP6 holoenzyme, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, dephosphorylated phosphoSer145, but not phosphoSer19 (Akt site) in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Importantly, rapamycin treatment of HEK293 cells decreased phosphorylation of Ser145 and this was rescued by PPP6C knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,f</a>). These data suggest that Ser145 is phosphorylated by mTOR and dephosphorylated by PP6 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i</a>). We also tested the effect of PP6 knock-down on known substrates of mTORC1 such as p-S6K, p-ULK1 and 4EBP1, and observed that while PP6 knockdown increases S6K phosphorylation, it does not affect ULK1 phosphorylation or 4EBP1 mobility shift (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>).

This augmented activation of mTORC1 did not occur when the overexpressed ZNRF2-Ser145Ala mutant also carried a Gly2Ala mutation, rendering ZNRF2 non-myristoylatable (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a>). Interestingly, enhancement of mTORC1 activation by amino acids upon expression of wild-type or Ser145A ZNRF2 was decreased 2-fold by ligase dead C199A mutation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1f</a>).

Since amino acids stimulate lysosomal recruitment and activation of mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sancak et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">2010</a>) we asked whether ZNRF2 affected the lysosomal translocation of mTOR.

The mTOR-LAMP2 colocalization was reduced by 30% upon knockdown of ZNRF2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>).

According to size-exclusion chromatography analysis, knockdown of ZNRF2 has no effect on V-ATPase or mTORC1 complex assembly. However, several observations indicate that ZNRF2 promotes the trafficking of newly-synthesized V-ATPase to the lysosomes. When ER to Golgi trafficking was resumed after a BFA block and also after V-ATPase was released from inhibition by ConA, we found that ZNRF2 depletion prevented the recovery of amino acid-stimulation of mTORC1. Furthermore, ZNRF2 knockdown reduced the association of the V-ATPase V0A2 subunit with lysosomes, with a parallel increase in lysosomal pH. These data suggest that ZNRF2 is a key regulator of V-ATPase trafficking, impacting on its key function of maintaining vesicle pH. Lysosomes are acidic (pH ~4.5) intracellular organelles and their primary function is degradation of extracellular and intracellular material (<a href=\"#bib1\">Appelqvist et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Settembre et al., 2013</a>).

Constitutively active Rag GTPase mutants can rescue the decrease in mTORC1 activity due to knockdown of ZNRF2. This finding suggests that ZNRF2 regulates mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes upstream of Rag GTPases.

Our findings are consistent with ZNRF2 having been identified in an unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomics screen aiming to find mTOR substrates (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yu et al., 2011</a>). Together with previous work (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</a>), this study suggests that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ZNRF2 on Ser145 enhances the release of ZNRF2 from intracellular membranes into the cytosol. We therefore propose the existence of an auto-inhibitory feedback loop in which the release of ZNRF2 from membranes limits the activation of mTORC1 in response to amino acids and growth factors, perhaps preventing unrestrained cell growth. Consistent with this proposal, overexpressing wild-type ZNRF2 enhanced cellular mTORC1 activation by amino acids, and expressing a Ser145Ala mutant did so to greater extent. This finely balanced dynamic regulation of ZNRF2 is reminiscent of the negative feedbacks by mTORC1 via S6K on IRS1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harrington et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shah et al., 2004</a>) and Grb10 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hsu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yu et al., 2011</a>)."

Consistent with this proposal, ZNRF2 knockdown results in decreased mTORC1 signalling in cells lacking TSC2, that have constitutively active mTORC1 (data not shown).

Mechanistically, ZNRF2 is required for proper trafficking of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) to the lysosome. In ZNRF2-depleted cells, a decrease in lysosomal V-ATPase inhibits amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation. In addition, the authors showed that mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145 and releases ZNRF2 from membranes. This ZNRF2 release from a membrane compartment inhibits amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation, serving as a negative feedback loop."

Putative ZNRF2 orthologues in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (Pib1p), <i>D. melanogaster, C. elegans</i> and vertebrates share most similarity in their UBZ and RING E3 ligase domains. The <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>C. elegans</i> orthologues of ZNRF2 also have a conserved N-myristoylation signal, which is critical for membranal localization of ZNRF2. Notably, the S288C strain of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> that carries a null allele for ZNRF2 orthologue Pib1p has abnormal vacuolar morphology, increased replicative lifespan and decreased growth in minimal medium, indicative of roles analogous to the V-ATPase- and mTOR-related functions of ZNRF2 that we describe in this study (<a href=\"http://www.yeastgenome.org\">http://www.yeastgenome.org</a>).\u201d"

Does Ser145 phosphorylation affect the interaction of ZNRF2 with mTOR?</i> We demonstrate that ZNRF2 knockdown affects the lysosomal recruitment of mTORC1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which is mediated by the Rag GTPases, the Ragulator complex and the V-ATPase. Zoncu et al. (2011) proposed an inside-out mechanism for sensing amino acids which requires the V-ATPase, which in turns interacts with the Ragulator complex. It still remains unknown how the V-ATPase regulates the function of Ragulator and Rag GTPases. Our data shows that ZNRF2 binds to V-ATPase and Ragulator subunits and that ZNRF2 knockdown diminishes the association of V-ATPase with the lysosomes and affects lysosomal pH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5F</a>). We hypothesize that the attenuation of mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosomal membranes could involve the impaired function of V-ATPase and its subsequent effects on the Ragulator and the Rag GTPases. It seems that ZNRF2 regulates mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes upstream of Rag GTPases, as constitutively active Rag GTPase mutants can rescue decrease in mTORC1 activity due to knock-down of ZNRF2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).
