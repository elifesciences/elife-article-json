A major challenge in understanding ALS disease pathology has been the identification and atomic-level characterization of these conformers. Here, we use a combination of NMR methods to detect four distinct sparsely populated and transiently formed thermally accessible conformers in equilibrium with the native state of immature SOD1 (apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>). Structural models of two of these establish that they possess features present in the mature dimeric protein. In contrast, the other two are non-native oligomers in which the native dimer interface and the electrostatic loop mediate the formation of aberrant intermolecular interactions. Our results show that apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> has a rugged free energy landscape that codes for distinct kinetic pathways leading to either maturation or non-native association and provide a starting point for a detailed atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms of SOD1 oligomerization."

A major challenge in understanding ALS disease pathology has been the identification and atomic-level characterization of these conformers. Here, we use a combination of NMR methods to detect four distinct sparsely populated and transiently formed thermally accessible conformers in equilibrium with the native state of immature SOD1 (apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>). Structural models of two of these establish that they possess features present in the mature dimeric protein. In contrast, the other two are non-native oligomers in which the native dimer interface and the electrostatic loop mediate the formation of aberrant intermolecular interactions. Our results show that apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> has a rugged free energy landscape that codes for distinct kinetic pathways leading to either maturation or non-native association and provide a starting point for a detailed atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms of SOD1 oligomerization."

This antioxidant enzyme detoxifies harmful chemicals that are the byproducts of normal cellular activity. The mature active form of this enzyme contains two SOD1 proteins, each of which binds one copper ion and one zinc ion. Each protein in a pair also contains a strong bond that helps to stabilize its three-dimensional structure. However, immature copies of this protein, which lack the strong bond and metal ions, often fold into the wrong shape. These misfolded proteins can clump together into clusters, and potentially lead to the development of ALS."

As a result, protein samples generally contain very small fractions of misfolded molecules and most techniques for investigating protein structure are ill-suited to probe the process of misfolding. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (or NMR for short) is one technique that has been used to visualize flexible proteins, and protein folding and misfolding, down to the level of individual atoms. Recent improvements in NMR spectroscopy have opened up the possibility of studying protein structures that exist at levels as low as 1% of the sample."

The mature enzymatically active form of this antioxidant protein (Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup>) is a homodimer comprised of 153-residue monomer subunits, each of which binds 1 Cu and 1 Zn ion and contains one intra-subunit disulfide bond (<a href=\"#bib90\">Valentine et al., 2005</a>). Mutations in the <i>sod1</i> gene encoding for this enzyme account for \u223c20% of all familial ALS (fALS) cases, or about 2% of all ALS occurrences (<a href=\"#bib74\">Robberecht and Philips, 2013</a>). Despite the link between SOD1 and fALS and the identification of over 150 disease causing mutants, the molecular events leading to disease remain poorly understood. Inclusions containing SOD1 have been observed in patients afflicted with both familial and sporadic ALS, suggesting that both forms of the disease may share a common pathway (<a href=\"#bib62\">Matsumoto et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Rotunno and Bosco, 2013</a>). However, whether cytotoxicity arises from the aggregates or from soluble misfolded conformers further upstream remains unclear. In its metal-bound oxidized form SOD1 is exceptionally stable, with a melting temperature over 90\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib83\">Stathopulos et al., 2006</a>) and is highly resistant to aggregation (<a href=\"#bib82\">Stathopulos et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Broom et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, the most immature form of SOD1, apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, that lacks metal ions and the disulfide bond has a much higher propensity to misfold and aggregate in vitro (<a href=\"#bib33\">Furukawa and O'Halloran, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Broom et al., 2014</a>) and has been hypothesized to be the primary cause of toxicity in vivo (<a href=\"#bib98\">Zetterstr\u00f6m et al., 2013</a>).

Residues belonging to process II are localized to a region in the electrostatic loop that is unstructured in apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> yet forms a short helix in Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup> (<a href=\"#bib90\">Valentine et al., 2005</a>). Process II is thus a transient local folding event involving formation of a helix from a disordered region in the ground state. This conclusion is further reinforced by the secondary structural propensity (SSP) score (<a href=\"#bib61\">Marsh et al., 2006</a>) calculated from chemical shifts of the excited state for nuclei reporting on process II (residues 130\u2013140). SSP scores for the ground and excited states computed from chemical shifts of the two interchanging conformers show that the helical content in this region of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> increases considerably (by up to \u223c50%) in the excited state, establishing that process II involves local structuring of a helix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Notably both processes I and II are independent of each other since the ALS mutant G85R (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cao et al., 2008</a>) eliminates II with little effect on I (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A, 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and both involve the partial transformation of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> into a mature native-like state, limiting the flexibility of the Zn-binding and electrostatic loops (processes I, II respectively) and sequestering key structural elements, such as strands \u03b21 and \u03b28 (process I). Fits of the processes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, provide an estimate of the population and lifetime of each excited state (25\u00b0C), with values of 2%, 13 ms and 3%, 3 ms for the helix and the native dimer respectively at an overall protein concentration of 1.3 mM, along with a dimer dissociation constant of 85 \u00b1 50 mM."

Thus the amino acid sequence can code for the organization of the electrostatic and the Zn-binding loops in a manner independent of metal binding. Our results establish that metal binding is not a requirement for loop organization and further that zinc binding may, in part, proceed through a conformational selection mechanism whereby zinc binds to excited state conformers that contain the transiently formed helix in the electrostatic loop. The negative end of this helix dipole, which has been postulated to stabilize the metal-bound conformation in SOD1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cao et al., 2008</a>), may also facilitate zinc ligation by guiding the metal to the binding pocket through electrostatic interactions. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the G85R mutant, which has a reduced affinity for zinc (<a href=\"#bib90\">Valentine et al., 2005</a>), does not transiently form this helix as established by the absence of minor state CEST dips for the helix forming residues (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> blue, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In this experiment, transverse relaxation rates of NMR probes are modulated by applying a variable number of chemical shift refocusing pulses during a fixed time element (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mulder et al., 2001</a>). Application of increasing numbers of pulses decreases the effective chemical shift differences between exchanging sites, resulting in a decrease in the measured effective transverse relaxation rate. Thus, dispersion profiles, R<sub>2,eff</sub> vs rate of application of refocusing pulses (\u03bd<sub>CPMG</sub>), showing a decrease in R<sub>2,eff</sub> with increasing \u03bd<sub>CPMG</sub> are a hallmark of chemical exchange, while flat profiles indicate either that there is no exchange or that it proceeds much faster than the rate of application of the pulses."

(<b>B</b>) These dispersion profiles cannot be fit together with those from residues reporting on non-native oligomerization process III and the resulting \u0394\u03d6 values are in error (<b>C</b>, blue).

Further, the pervasive nature of exchange in this system significantly complicates analysis of the CEST and CPMG data. This is especially the case because there is considerable overlap in the regions that report on the various processes, with residues associated with the native dimer interface participating in three of the four exchange events that have been characterized. Not surprisingly, therefore, in some cases the relaxation data show complex exchange behaviour. This does not necessarily imply that the four exchange events discussed here are coupled, but can also result from spin probes reporting on one process \u2018sensing\u2019 fluctuating fields from proximal exchange events. For example, CEST profiles of G51, N53, T54, and G61 clearly establish that these residues report on native dimerization, with shift differences in excess of \u223c4 ppm between ground and excited state conformers. Yet, for these residues, <sup>15</sup>N CPMG relaxation dispersion profiles recorded on pWT samples could not be fit to models of two-site exchange. In contrast, the corresponding profiles from a G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> mutant, where process II is eliminated and process IV reduced, could be fit to the simplest two-state exchange model. Further, the CEST profiles for these residues in pWT and G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> are very similar, suggesting that process I has not been significantly affected via the mutation. A likely explanation is that the \u2018seemingly more simple exchange behaviour\u2019 in the G85R mutant is the result of the elimination of local field fluctuations from these additional processes. The inability to fit the dispersion data for these residues in the pWT protein is, thus, at least in part the result of fluctuating local magnetic fields that arise from a number of simultaneous proximal processes."

A total of 28 and 14 restraints were used in structure calculations of symmetric dimers corresponding to excited states derived from processes I and III, respectively (these numbers are doubled to indicate that a restraint from monomer A to B also pertains from B to A), with 7 restraints for the calculation of the excited state from process IV (asymmetric). The energy funnels obtained in the structure calculations (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) support the view that the structures have converged. For the non-native dimers, we have further evaluated the robustness of the calculations by repeating them after first removing 1 restraint at a time. Very similar ensembles to those illustrated in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a> were obtained indicating that the structure calculation is not driven merely by a single restraint. For process III, we also obtain very similar structures if only restraints from <sup>15</sup>N CPMG data are included.

Passive residues are solvent accessible surface neighbours of the active residues. The active residues used to generate the native dimer (process I) in HADDOCK calculations are localized to a single region of pWT apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, as are those for non-native dimer 1 (process III). L67, indicated by * was consistently violated in docking calculations for non-native dimer 1 and was removed from the active restraint list. It appears that spin probes from L67 are not localized to the non-native dimer interface but rather report on a secondary process that depends on dimerization, such as a change in conformation. In contrast to residues associated with process III, active residues for process IV (non-native dimer 2) do not cluster and can roughly be divided between a pair of sites, denoted by black and orange circles in (<b>A</b>). (<b>B</b>) HADDOCK calculations for non-native dimer 2 converged well when the interface was enforced to derive from active residues in the \u2018black\u2019 circle in one monomer and from active residues from the \u2018orange\u2019 circle for the second, leading to an asymmetric dimer (red, denoted by \u2018distinct interfaces\u2019 in the figure panel <b>B</b>). Notably, restraints from residues S68 and N86 (residues indicated by * in <b>A</b>) were consistently violated and these were subsequently removed from further calculations. Convergence was not achieved when the restraints derived from all active residues for each of the monomers were enforced without first separating them as described above and shown in the circles in <b>A</b> (green, denoted by \u2018single interface\u2019), with on average \u223c80% of the restraints violated over the 200 final calculated structures and an average violation of 4.7 \u00c5. By contrast, modelling Process IV as involving distinct interfaces (i.e., asymmetric dimer) leads to less than 1 restraint violated on average, per structure, with an average distance of 0.4 \u00c5 per violation. Plots of the HADDOCK score vs RMSD (to the lowest scored structure, left) and a histogram of restraint violations (right) illustrate this. In these initial simulations both electrostatic and Zn-loops were kept fixed to the X-ray coordinates (<a href=\"#bib84\">Strange et al., 2003</a>), but were allowed to move in further calculations to generate the final set of structures, as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. (<b>C</b>) Ensembles of the native and non-native dimers including structures with the 10 lowest HADDOCK scores. Corresponding plots of HADDOCK score vs RMSD (to the lowest scored structure) for each of the dimers are shown below the structures. The larger RMSD spreads for the non-native dimers reflect to a large extent the fact that both electrostatic and Zn-loops were allowed to be flexible in the final set of calculations while the Zn-loop was fixed for the native dimer. Averaged over the lowest 10 members of the ensemble, 4 restraints were violated per structure with an average violation of 0.5 \u00c5 for the native dimer, 1.5 restraints per structure with an average violation of 0.7 \u00c5 for non-native dimer 1 and 1 restraint per structure with an average violation of 0.8 \u00c5 for non-native dimer 2."

It is stabilized by an interface very similar to that of the native dimer, involving Zn-binding and \u03b26-\u03b27 loops, as well as strands \u03b21 and \u03b28. Notably, the restraints used to model the excited state formed via this process (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) localize to the native dimer interface on one side of the monomer, consistent with the symmetric dimer structural model. These restraints are a subset of those for process I, and it is reasonable to ask why the native structure is not generated in this case. This can be understood by noting that the native dimer interface involves contacts between residues from \u03b21\u2013\u03b28 in one monomer and residues localized to the Zn-loop from a second, placing the corresponding \u03b21\u2013\u03b28 residues in the second monomer far from those in the first. In contrast, since the restraint residues for process III include those from \u03b21\u2013\u03b28 but not the Zn-loop, the process of satisfying the restraints (i.e., bringing restraint residues within a prescribed distance from each other) places \u03b21\u2013\u03b28 from both monomers of the dimer in proximity, leading to a structure where one of the monomers is rotated 180<sup>o</sup> compared to the native dimer."

Most applications of either CEST or CPMG relaxation experiments have involved systems where the majority of residues report on a single exchange event, although in some cases the processes have been more than two-state (<a href=\"#bib47\">Korzhnev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Grey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Neudecker et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Korzhnev et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Sugase et al., 2007</a>). When more than a single exchange event is present residues reporting on a specific process may be localized structurally (<a href=\"#bib91\">Vallurupalli and Kay, 2006</a>), simplifying the analysis. The situation is more complex for apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>. Because the dimer interface plays critical roles in both native and non-native oligomer formation, residues do not cluster spatially to separate processes and a large number of different experiments are thus necessary to resolve each exchange event. Untangling the four exchange processes described in the present study has required a combination of both CEST and CPMG relaxation experiments, as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 \u2018Separating probes of processes I\u2013IV\u2019, and summarized in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. For example, an initial <sup>15</sup>N CEST study showed large minor state dips for G51, N53, T54, and G61 that were very well separated from the ground state (8.3 ppm, 8.1 ppm, 3.8 ppm, and \u22127.3 ppm, respectively). These chemical shifts matched those of Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup>, so that a straightforward assignment of reporters of process I was obtained, along with the identification of the nature of the exchange event. By comparison, the corresponding CPMG dispersion profiles for these residues could not be well fit together, although those for N53 and T54 could be fit, that reflects the sensitivity of the dispersion profiles to more than a single exchange process. CEST profiles can, of course, also be sensitive to multiple exchange events and indeed, those from G51, N53, T54, and G61 are. However, unlike dispersion data that must be rigorously fit to extract shift differences, the chemical shifts of the excited state can be obtained by simple inspection of CEST profiles so long as they are significantly different from those of the ground state. In cases involving multiple processes where only one has large chemical shift differences between interconverting conformers it is therefore possible to get accurate shift values for residues of this excited state from the position of the minor dips, as is made clear from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D,E, 4D,E</a>. In contrast to process I where CEST data were critical, the small chemical shift differences between states involved in processes III and IV (less than 1.5 ppm, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 \u2018Separating probes of processes I\u2013IV\u2019) precluded analysis via CEST since major and minor state dips are, in general, poorly resolved. In these cases, however, high quality two-state fits of the CPMG dispersion data are obtained (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A, 6A</a>)."

A detailed description of the approaches that have been used is given in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. Briefly, we have distinguished between intra- and inter-molecular processes by recording experiments as a function of protein concentration, separating process II which was concentration independent (electrostatic loop helix formation) from the other exchange events that showed increased minor state dips (CEST) or larger dispersion profiles (CPMG) at the higher protein concentrations. Temperature dependent studies were also performed that clearly distinguished processes I and III (increased CPMG dispersion profiles with higher temperature) from process IV (decreased profiles). Residues involved in processes I and III could be separated because different exchange parameters gave rise to profiles that could not be fit simultaneously. Finally, studies on G85R and A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> have provided confidence in our assignment of residues to particular exchange events, since reporter residues of a particular process in the WT protein that is subsequently abolished via mutation no longer show evidence of conformational exchange. By means of example, process II is eliminated in G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, while processes I, III, and IV can no longer be detected in A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>."

Experiments on G85R and A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> have further clarified details of this kinetic network by providing insights into the interconversion between different excited state conformations. For example, evidence that helix formation and dimerization are largely uncoupled is provided by mutations in apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> that eliminate either helix folding (G85R) or dimerization (A4V). The A4V mutant has no effect on helix folding, while G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> does not influence dimerization processes I and III with only some effect on IV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, helix formation is not on-pathway for formation of the native dimer or non-native dimer I from apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>. In addition dimerization is not a prerequisite for helix formation (process II) since this would entail a concentration dependence for the helix process which is not observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Moreover, relaxation dispersion data from residues reporting on processes III and IV are all well fit to a two-state model. While this certainly does not prove that the exchange mechanisms for aberrant dimerization cannot be more complex, our present data do not justify such an interpretation. Accordingly, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> depicts the simplest kinetic scheme consistent with the spin relaxation data recorded on apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> where each of the four processes studied in this work has been shown separately. We cannot rule out the existence of a more complex network in which for instance the helical population dimerizes, the electrostatic loop in the dimeric population folds, or native and non-native dimers form larger assemblies. However, these processes involve populations of conformers that are below the detection limits of CEST and CPMG methods."

Despite the fairly low resolution of the calculated models important insights can, nevertheless, be obtained. For example, identification of the interfaces of the aberrant oligomers helps explain why Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup> is so resistant to oligomerization, and potentially, why many of the ALS mutants localize to the dimer or the metal-binding region. The key elements of these non-native inter-molecular interfaces are strands \u03b21, \u03b28 and part of the Zn-binding loop, which are sequestered and hence protected upon formation of the native dimer, as well as the electrostatic loop, which is rigid in Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and thus less likely to form promiscuous interactions. The protective nature of loop ordering is made clear in studies of S134N SOD1, which has a disordered electrostatic loop even in the holo state and has been suggested to form oligomers in solution (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banci et al., 2005</a>). Crystals of this variant show non-native symmetric interactions whereby the disordered electrostatic loop from one monomer interacts with the cleft between strands \u03b25\u2013\u03b26 of the other (<a href=\"#bib27\">Elam et al., 2003</a>). Loss of metal and disruption of quaternary structure thus promote improper association both by destabilizing the protein and making higher energy conformations thermally accessible and by exposing regions of the protein most prone to forming these intermolecular interactions. It is noteworthy that the stabilizing disulfide bond in mutants of SOD1 is more easily reduced than in wild-type (<a href=\"#bib89\">Tiwari and Hayward, 2003</a>), thus leading to larger concentrations of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> and a higher tendency for forming aberrant oligomers."

CPMG measurements recorded here show that many residues from the termini of SOD1 as well as from H110\u2013H120 participate in both exchange processes III and IV. Moreover, nanosecond timescale simulations starting from dimeric SOD1 in the absence of bound metal show that the Zn and electrostatic loops become flexible and move away from one another, exposing strands \u03b24 and \u03b25. These observations led to the hypothesis that the initial events in SOD1 oligomerization may be triggered by the misfolded form of the protein possessing flexible Zn and electrostatic loops as well as exposed \u03b24 and \u03b25 strands (<a href=\"#bib85\">Strange et al., 2007</a>).

The high propensity of the exposed dimer interface and the flexible electrostatic loop to self-associate results in the formation of three distinct oligomeric forms which exist in equilibrium with the native state of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>. Structural models for the two non-native oligomers reported here may provide insight for the rational design of therapeutic agents to prevent the early stages of nascent SOD1 aggregation and ultimately formation of the cytotoxic species that leads to disease."

(In contrast, dispersion data from process III and IV were well fit to a two state model.) As a result a three-state model was chosen in the analysis of processes I and II, with fits performed in several stages. First, a number of residues whose <sup>15</sup>N CEST and CPMG profiles indicated large chemical shift differences between the ground and excited states were identified for each process (Gly 51, Asn 53, Thr 54 and Gly 61 for process I and Thr 135 and Thr 137 for process II); these residues were used in subsequent analyses to extract exchange parameters. Next, a complete set of three-state models was chosen making use of the fact that the chemical shifts for probes in two of the three states are known from CEST profiles, referred to as the ground (N) and the excited state (H) in what follows. Note that only two dips are observed in the CEST profiles, suggesting that the third state has similar chemical shifts to either N or H. There are, thus, three classes of linear three-state models that can be selected, depending on the relative position of the hidden intermediate (I; not observed in the CEST profile in the \u2018reaction scheme\u2019), as illustrated below.

Values of k<sub>AB,ex</sub>, k<sub>BC,ex</sub>, p<sub>H</sub> and p<sub>I</sub> along with \u0394\u03d6<sub>NH</sub> (that can be obtained directly from the positions of the major and minor dips in the CEST profiles) were kept fixed in each fit, while \u0394\u03d6<sub>NI</sub> was allowed to vary along with the relaxation rates R<sub>2N</sub>, R<sub>2H</sub>, R<sub>2I</sub>, and R<sub>1N</sub>.

Previous studies of ground states of monomeric (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banci et al., 2003</a>) and dimeric (CMD and EMM, unpublished) forms of apoSOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup> clearly show that the <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift of G61 moves from \u223c108 ppm to \u223c100 ppm upon dimerization. The presence of such a similarly large chemical shift change for G61 in an excited state of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> provides strong evidence that the transition observed via CEST is a dimerization process to a native-like conformation. In addition to G61, three other residues were identified with minor state dips that were well separated from those of the ground state (G51: 8.3 ppm, N53: 8.1 ppm, T54: 3.8 ppm chemical shift changes), and all localized to the same region of the protein structure. As with G61, these chemical shift differences were essentially identical to those observed between monomeric and dimeric apoSOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup> in conventional NMR studies of ground state conformers.

Because these residues localize to a region of the protein that comprises the dimer interface in Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup> and report on native dimerization, we included additional residues as reporters so long as a decrease in solvent accessible surface area of greater than 2 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> was calculated between the monomer and the native dimer.

Therefore, additional fits involving three-state models, as described above in \u2018Three-state fitting of CEST and CPMG data\u2019 were performed, based on an extensive grid search of parameter space to obtain optimum rate constants of exchange and populations of the interconverting states.

This is not unexpected given that the native dimer interface participates in three different oligomerization processes (I, III, and IV), as discussed in the text. In order to estimate the excited state dimer population and its lifetime for the pWT protein, residue-specific CEST data at each B<sub>1</sub> field were fitted separately (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Large CEST dips corresponding to a minor state conformation were observed in pWT apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> profiles for both T135 and T137 that match the expected positions of a state in which the helix is present (\u223c10 ppm upfield from resonance positions of the major conformation in both cases). This provides strong evidence for an excited state in which the electrostatic loop helix is formed. Amino acids localized to the electrostatic loop (residues 130\u2013140) were thus selected as reporting on process II (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Focusing on <sup>15</sup>N CEST profiles for residues in this region with large separations between major and minor dips (\u0394\u03d6 values &gt; 3 ppm) clearly establishes that the sizes of the minor dips are independent of protein concentration, as expected for a unimolecular process (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, all the minor state <sup>15</sup>N CEST dips assigned to this process disappeared in the G85R mutant, as would be expected for residues reporting on the same event. Further, in A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> minor dips in <sup>15</sup>N CEST profiles involving residues reporting on process II could be distinctly observed, though those for the concentration-dependent processes I, III, and IV were no longer present.

(ii) Residues involved in the generation of the excited state of process III localize to a very specific region of structure (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Formation of a symmetric dimer with each monomer contributing the same interfacial region can account for the shift changes. More complex models of oligomerization need not be invoked, but if they are then additional interfaces would have to be involved. This is not consistent with the localization of chemical shift changes to only a specific region of structure. (iii) Residues involved in the interface of the oligomer generated from process IV localize to two distinct regions and the chemical shift perturbations can be explained by the formation of an asymmetric dimer, as the simplest model (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). This does not prove that the structure is dimeric and as is shown in <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, more complex models involving additional subunits can be generated simply by extending the basic dimeric building block using the same interfaces as those involved in formation of the various dimers via processes I, III and IV.

Residues belonging to process I with |\u0394\u03d6<sub>MD</sub>| &gt; 0.3 ppm, as established from <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C\u2032 or <sup>13</sup>C\u03b1 CEST measurements, were chosen. All residues identified on the basis of the concentration- and temperature-dependence of their <sup>15</sup>N or methyl-<sup>13</sup>C R<sub>ex</sub> values (calculated as described above) were used as \u2018restraints\u2019 in the calculation of excited states for processes III and IV. A list of residues is supplied in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> (see \u2018Separating probes of processes I\u2013IV\u2019 above for selection criteria of residues to each of the different processes). The solvent accessible subsets of residues from the lists generated as described above were determined using the software package NACCESS (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hubbard and Thornton, 1993</a>) using 40% exposure of either backbone or sidechain atoms as the selection criterion; residues in this subset were chosen as \u2018active\u2019 in the HADDOCK docking protocol. One monomer from the Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S\u2013S</sup> crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib84\">Strange et al., 2003</a>) was chosen as the starting structure in the generation of excited state dimers, since the folds of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> and each of the monomers of the mature dimer are similar; both have intact \u03b2-barrels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and differ predominantly in the arrangement and dynamics of the loops. The Zn-loop residues (49-80) and the electrostatic loop (126\u2013143) were fixed to the coordinates of the crystal structure in initial trial runs, but subsequently defined as completely flexible segments to generate dimers for processes III and IV. For process I, only the electrostatic loop was allowed to be fully flexible because chemical shifts indicate that the Zn-loop becomes ordered upon forming the excited state dimer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In all HADDOCK runs, histidine protonation states were set using the software WhatIf (<a href=\"#bib97\">Vriend, 1990</a>). Docking was done in three stages starting with an initial rigid body step, followed by semi-flexible simulated annealing and a final refinement in explicit water. 1000 structures were generated in the initial rigid-body docking step and the 200 lowest energy structures were chosen for subsequent annealing and refinement."

The system is of exceptional biomedical importance given its involvement in ALS. The authors used an integrated NMR approach spearheaded by CEST and CPMG techniques that provide structural, kinetic and thermodynamic information on alternate, lowly populated conformational states. These very detailed experiments revealed, for the first time, that apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> undergoes at least 4 distinct conformational exchange processes, three of which involve protein dimerization and the other one an intramolecular helix folding transition. Very interestingly, two of the dimerization processes involve the formation of non-native dimers. Untangling such a complex conformational equilibrium (summarized in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) is extremely challenging. In addition to obtaining kinetics and populations of the excited states, they also determined the chemical shifts of these states and using docking programs they were able to obtain structural models of the various conformational states."

It is not clear which one of these schemes is correct, however only the second scheme (off-pathway) is mentioned in the text and no explanation of this behavior is offered. Might it be due to isomerization of proline 62, with the cis and trans states forming helix at different rates? A number of residues around Pro62 show splitting in the HSQC spectrum.

The kinetic scheme in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> seems to suggest that native helix formation in the monomer (process II) precludes the formation of any dimer, including the native dimer. Can the helical state of the monomer dimerize? If not, then why is helix formation not also observed in process I? The processes that form the three dimer species are not independent but are mutually exclusive in that the formation of one dimer means that a different dimer does not form. Further, given that all the dimers are simply rotations of one of the subunits there is no reason to believe that they cannot directly exchange with one another. In this case a much more complex cubic kinetic scheme would be more appropriate than <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>."

Given the numerous processes involved (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), it would appear that much of the protein would show multi-state exchange profiles. Identification of chemical shift changes that are uniquely associated with individual processes is difficult and assignment of contact restraints is questionable. Is it not possible that some of the shift changes reflect conformational changes rather than direct contacts within the dimer states? How can the authors justify removal of the restraint for L67, simply because it is violated in structure calculations for non-native dimer 1? This appears to be the only active restraint for process III that differentiates the non-native dimer 1 structure from that of the native dimer formed by process I (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A better explanation is required as to how the structure of non-native dimer 1 was determined when the only active restraint was persistently violated. Many of the residues that apparently report on process III are not used as restraints in the docking calculation (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1). Why is this? This comment also applies to process IV (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1). The residues identified with process IV in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> appear to be scattered over much of the protein surface and there seems to be more going on than formation of a non-native dimer.

There are two reasons why L67 was not considered in process I. Firstly, it does not bury significant surface area at the native dimer interface, which is the criterion for selecting a residue to report on process I. Secondly, the amide resonance of L67 is in an overlapped region of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum and reliable CEST profiles of L67 could not be obtained.
