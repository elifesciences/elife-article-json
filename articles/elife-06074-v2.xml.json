We present crystallographic and biochemical analyses of Btk, which together reveal molecular details of its autoinhibition and activation. Autoinhibited Btk adopts a compact conformation like that of inactive c-Src and c-Abl. A lipid-binding PH-TH module, unique to Tec kinases, acts in conjunction with the SH2 and SH3 domains to stabilize the inactive conformation. In addition to the expected activation of Btk by membranes containing phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), we found that inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>), a soluble signaling molecule found in both animal and plant cells, also activates Btk. This activation is a consequence of a transient PH-TH dimerization induced by IP<sub>6</sub>, which promotes transphosphorylation of the kinase domains. Sequence comparisons with other Tec-family kinases suggest that activation by IP<sub>6</sub> is unique to Btk."

We present crystallographic and biochemical analyses of Btk, which together reveal molecular details of its autoinhibition and activation. Autoinhibited Btk adopts a compact conformation like that of inactive c-Src and c-Abl. A lipid-binding PH-TH module, unique to Tec kinases, acts in conjunction with the SH2 and SH3 domains to stabilize the inactive conformation. In addition to the expected activation of Btk by membranes containing phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), we found that inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>), a soluble signaling molecule found in both animal and plant cells, also activates Btk. This activation is a consequence of a transient PH-TH dimerization induced by IP<sub>6</sub>, which promotes transphosphorylation of the kinase domains. Sequence comparisons with other Tec-family kinases suggest that activation by IP<sub>6</sub> is unique to Btk."

This molecule recognizes a previously unnoticed binding site on the PH-TH module, and causes the PH-TH module in the inactive Btk enzyme to bind briefly to the PH-TH modules in other Btk enzymes. This brief binding event is an important step in the process that activates the enzyme. IP<sub>6</sub> might also be involved in recruiting the Btk enzyme to the cell membrane in B cells, but this proposal needs to be tested experimentally. The details of the BTK activation mechanism reported by Wang et al. could prove useful to researchers developing new treatments for immunodeficiency diseases."

These phosphorylation-dependent signals are generated by three kinds of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, linked to the receptor by membrane co-localization (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dal Porto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kurosaki, 2011</a>). Src-family kinases (principally Lyn and Fyn in B-cells, Lck and Fyn in T-cells), resident at the plasma membrane, respond first to receptor activation. They phosphorylate pairs of tyrosine residues in ITAM motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of activated receptors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">M\u00f3csai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wang et al., 2010</a>), which in turn recruit the tandem-SH2 domain tyrosine kinases Syk (in B-cells) and ZAP-70 (in T-cells). Membrane localization of Syk or ZAP-70 leads to the recruitment and activation of Tec-family tyrosine kinases, Btk (in B-cells) and Itk (in T-cells) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andreotti et al., 2010</a>)."

One structure is of the Src-like module, in an assembled and inactive conformation, resembling those of inactive c-Abl and of the Src kinases c-Src and Hck (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sicheri et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Xu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nagar et al., 2003</a>). The other is of a Btk construct that lacks the SH3 and SH2 modules and that links the PH-TH module directly to the kinase domain. We find that the PH-TH module stabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase by interacting with the N lobe. The inactive conformation of Btk is thus a compact one, in which the PH-TH module cooperates with the SH2 and SH3 domains to maintain an inactive structure. Several structures of isolated domains of Btk have been determined previously, as summarized in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>, which also lists structures of fragments of other Tec family kinases."

IP<sub>6</sub>-triggered transient dimerization of the PH domain may provide a membrane-independent mechanism for activating Btk in the nucleus or cytoplasm or may have a role in feedback stimulation of Btk that has been activated by PIP<sub>3</sub> at the membrane. The prior model for Btk activation involved only a PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent membrane recruitment as the key step in switching on the kinase. The ability of IP<sub>6</sub> to activate Btk points to an as yet unappreciated complexity to the activation mechanism."

Arg 544 stacks in turn on Arg 520, clamping the latter against the phenyl ring of Phe 574. Each of these arginines also appears to have an amino\u2013aromatic interaction: Arg 544 with Phe 517 and Arg 520 with Phe 574. In the active conformation of Btk, the same two arginines are expected (based on the structure of the active Lck kinase domain, PDB: 3LCK; [<a href=\"#bib77\">Yamaguchi and Hendrickson, 1996</a>]) to engage in salt bridges with a phosphorylated Tyr 551.

The inhibitory interactions between each of the regulatory modules and the kinase domain were preserved, but various intra-domain rearrangements occurred during the course of these trajectories. The overall conformation of Btk at the end of the trajectories is very similar to the initial structure. The averaged r.m.s. deviations of the PH-TH module and the SH3 domain between the crystal structures and the end of trajectories, aligned on the Src-like module of the kinase, were \u223c4 \u00c5 and \u223c2.5 \u00c5, respectively. The former is comparable to the value found in simulations of the PH-TH-kinase, but the latter is larger than in simulations of the Src-like module, probably because the SH3 domain reorients with respect to the kinase domain. The SH3 rotation results in a polar interface between SH3 and PH-TH, with good electrostatic complementarity, which preserves the interactions between the SH3 domain, the linker and the N lobe of the kinase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In these simulations, the r.m.s. deviations of the SH2 domain and the kinase N lobe are \u223c2.6 \u00c5 and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively, after 360 ns, similar to those of the Src-like module simulations.

It seems unlikely that IP<sub>6</sub> works by displacing an inhibitory interaction between the kinase and the PH-TH module, because the Src-like module (lacking the PH-TH module) activates only slightly faster than full-length Btk in the absence of IP<sub>6</sub>. Nevertheless, in order to test this possibility, we introduced two mutations (Y133E and R134E) at the PH-TH-kinase interface that are expected to disrupt the inhibitory docking of the PH-TH module on the kinase domain. Full-length Btk bearing these two mutations retains activation by IP<sub>6</sub>, showing that IP<sub>6</sub> does not act by dislodging the interactions seen in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

Formation of the Saraste dimer interface is compatible with the simultaneous engagement of PIP<sub>3</sub> by both PH domains in the dimer, raising the possibility that IP<sub>6</sub> can stimulate dimerization of membrane-tethered Btk (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). IP<sub>6</sub> binding to the peripheral binding site may also enhance PIP<sub>3</sub> affinity in the canonical binding site and sensitize Btk to PIP<sub>3</sub> levels. The linker connecting the PH-TH unit to the SH3 domain promotes dimerization of Btk by interacting with the SH3 domain of a second molecule, providing an additional mechanism for Btk dimerization at high local concentration (<a href=\"#bib37\">Laederach et al., 2002</a>). High levels of IP<sub>6</sub> may down-regulate the amount of Btk on membranes by competing for PIP<sub>3</sub> binding in the canonical binding site, as proposed for Akt1 regulation by IP<sub>7</sub> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chakraborty et al., 2010</a>)."

The four residues at the peripheral binding site that coordinate IP<sub>6</sub> in Btk are not conserved in Itk, unlike those that coordinate PIP<sub>3</sub>/IP<sub>4</sub> at the canonical lipid-binding site. This lack of conservation also extends to the key residues at the inhibitory interface between the PH-TH module and the kinase domain in Btk and to residues at the Saraste dimer interface (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A different soluble inositol phosphate, IP<sub>4</sub>, promotes PIP<sub>3</sub> binding by the Itk PH-TH module; this activity is important for Itk regulation in T-cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2007</a>). Thus, regulation by soluble inositol phosphates may be a general feature of Tec family kinases, but the specific effector and the molecular mechanism of the kinase response may be different in each case. The regulation of tyrosine kinases by soluble second messengers has not received much attention in the past. Our discovery that IP<sub>6</sub> activates Btk, along with the known effect of IP<sub>4</sub> on Itk, points to the importance of further studies on these and soluble effectors."

After initial energy minimization, the systems were subjected to 100 ps of constant number, volume and temperature (NVT) equilibration, during which the system was heated to 300 K. This was followed by a short equilibration at constant number, pressure, and temperature (NPT, 100 ps). Finally, the production simulations were performed under NPT conditions, with v-rescale thermostats in Gromacs 4.6.2, respectively, in the absence of positional restraints. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed, and particle-mesh Ewald summations were used for long-range electrostatics and the van der Waals cut-off is set at 10 \u00c5. A time step of 2 fs was employed and the structures were stored every 2 ps. His 143, Cys 154, Cys 155, and Cys 165, which coordinate Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the PH domain were set to be deprotonated. No additional positional restrains are applied to the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion, and its sp<sup>3</sup> tetrahedral coordination remains intact during all MD simulations."

We used a simple Michaelis-Menten scheme, shown in this figure, to model the autophosphorylation kinetics of Btk. We make two assumptions in this scheme: first, that IP<sub>6</sub> binding increases the on-rate of dimer formation of Btk by a factor of 10, and that once Btk is phosphorylated, the catalytic rate constant for transautophosphorylation increases by a factor of 10. Using physically reasonable values for the on and off rates and the catalytic rates we show that a small increase in on-rate for Btk dimer formation leads to a dramatic increase in the rate of autophosphorylation, even though the concentration of Btk is two orders of magnitude below the value of the dissociation constant. We think that this simple calculation helps explain an observation that might otherwise be counter-intuitive to some readers, which is that IP<sub>6</sub> can activate Btk at Btk concentrations that are well below the dissociation constant for dimerization. Text referring to this new figure is in the last paragraph of \u201cFusing the Btk PH-TH module to the catalytic module of c-Abl promotes autophosphorylation of c-Abl in the prescence of IP<sub>6</sub>\u201d."
