ECT-2, the exchange factor responsible for RhoA activation, is regulated to ensure spatiotemporal control of contractile ring assembly. Centralspindlin, composed of the Rho family GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 and the kinesin MKLP1/ZEN-4, is known to activate ECT-2, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. We report that ECT-2-mediated RhoA activation depends on the ability of CYK-4 to localize to the plasma membrane, bind RhoA, and promote GTP hydrolysis by RhoA. Defects resulting from loss of CYK-4 RhoGAP activity can be rescued by activating mutations in ECT-2 or depletion of RGA-3/4, which functions as a conventional RhoGAP for RhoA. Consistent with CYK-4 RhoGAP activity contributing to GEF activation, the catalytic domains of CYK-4 and ECT-2 directly interact. Thus, counterintuitively, CYK-4 RhoGAP activity promotes RhoA activation. We propose that the most active form of the cytokinetic RhoGEF involves complex formation between ECT-2, centralspindlin and RhoA."

In vitro, the GAP domain of CYK-4 efficiently activates the GTPase activity of the Rho-family GTPases, CED-10/Rac1 and CDC-42. CYK-4 also has GAP activity towards RhoA, but it is far less active towards RhoA as compared to Rac1 and CDC-42 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tour\u00e9 et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bastos et al., 2012</a>). Despite extensive effort, there is no consensus for the biological role of this GAP activity (see <a href=\"#bib42\">White and Glotzer, 2012</a> for review).

These studies have focused largely on a temperature-sensitive, separation-of-function substitution mutation, E448K, that lies in the RhoGAP domain of CYK-4, <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Canman et al., 2008</a>). The mutant protein can complex with the centralspindlin kinesin, ZEN-4, and bundle microtubules in the central spindle. However, cytokinesis does not proceed to completion in these embryos. Interestingly, depletion of CED-10/Rac1 or the actin nucleator subunit ARP-2 enables these embryos to complete cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Canman et al., 2008</a>). These genetic interactions have been interpreted to indicate that the GAP domain of CYK-4 is important to keep CED-10/Rac1 inactive and prevent the accumulation of branched actin in the equatorial region (<a href=\"#bib7\">Canman et al., 2008</a>). However, subsequent analysis demonstrated that <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i>; <i>ced-10(\u2212)</i> embryos are phenotypically abnormal (<a href=\"#bib27\">Loria et al., 2012</a>). In particular, <i>cyk-4</i>; <i>ced-10</i> mutant embryos have reduced accumulation of RhoA effectors as compared to <i>ced-10</i> mutants alone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Loria et al., 2012</a>). These results suggest that this mutation in CYK-4 affects more than the RhoGAP activity of CYK-4 or that CED-10/Rac1 is not the relevant target of the GAP domain, or both."

Upon fertilization, embryos exhibit RhoA-dependent contractility that promotes embryo polarization and culminates in the formation of a transient furrow known as the pseudocleavage furrow. This wave of contractility requires a poorly conserved protein known as NOP-1 and is largely independent of centralspindlin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tse et al., 2012</a>). Cytokinetic contractility, on the other hand, involves both NOP-1 and centralspindlin. However, <i>nop-1</i> is nonessential; loss of function mutants are viable and fertile (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rose et al., 1995</a>). Cytokinesis proceeds to completion in the absence of NOP-1, although furrow initiation is slightly delayed and RhoA accumulates to lower levels at the cleavage furrow (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tse et al., 2012</a>). Due to its role in RhoA activation, polarization in NOP-1-deficient embryos is also delayed. Mutational inactivation of NOP-1 permits direct analysis of centralspindlin-dependent furrow formation. Notably, when NOP-1 is inactivated, <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i> embryos are completely defective in RhoA activation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tse et al., 2012</a>)."

Given that the <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i> substitution renders the protein thermosensitive, it is possible that these phenotypes are not the sole consequence of loss of GAP activity; this mutation could affect other functions of the GAP domain, the adjacent C1 domain may also be affected. To clarify these issues, we performed a targeted structure-function analysis of the C1 and GAP domains of CYK-4. We demonstrate that the <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i> allele indeed affects its ability to associate with the membrane and show that this activity contributes to RhoA activation. We further show that the active site of the GAP domain contributes to the accumulation of downstream effectors of RhoA and RhoA-dependent contractility. Furthermore, we find that the catalytic domains of CYK-4 and ECT-2 directly interact in vitro. Finally, we show that hypomorphic defects in CYK-4-mediated RhoA dependent contractility can be suppressed by either loss of the RhoGAP activity provided by RGA-3/4 or by either of two activating mutations in ECT-2. These activating mutations in <i>ect-2</i> rescue <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i> and GAP-deficient CYK-4. Our results indicate that CYK-4 GAP activity is involved in ECT-2-mediated RhoA activation."

We established a rescue assay based on single copy integrants of GFP-tagged CYK-4 transgenes driven by the <i>cyk-4</i> promoter inserted at a defined locus in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome using Mos1-mediated integration (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fr\u00f8kjaer-Jensen et al., 2012</a>). The transgenes were expressed at consistent levels (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The transgenes were rendered resistant to an RNAi construct that could effectively deplete endogenous CYK-4 by targeting the 3\u2032 UTR and portions of the coding sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). By combining the appropriate mutant transgene with RNAi to specifically deplete endogenous CYK-4, we obtained embryos that express CYK-4<sup>MUT</sup>. In this and all subsequent experiments, when a given variant is assayed, endogenous CYK-4 is depleted by RNAi; these will be referred to as <i>cyk-4</i><sup><i>mut</i></sup> embryos. We first sought to validate the rescue assay, by assaying <i>cyk-4<sup>E448K</sup></i> embryos and found that they closely phenocopy <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i> embryos in which endogenous CYK-4 has the E448K substitution (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This phenocopy indicates functional depletion of endogenous CYK-4. Additionally, a wild-type transgene was fully functional as it could complement a large deletion in CYK-4 to viability and fertility (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As <i>cyk-4(or749ts)</i> is temperature sensitive, we considered the possibility that the thermosensitivity also destabilizes the C1 domain that lies adjacent to the CYK-4 GAP domain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, at the restrictive temperature, CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> exhibits a similar defect in localization as CYK-4<sup>\u2206C1</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). CYK-4 also associates with the membrane in the germline and indirect evidence suggests that this localization is compromised in embryos expressing CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). We generated strains in which both the endogenous <i>cyk-4</i> and the GFP-tagged transgene contained the E448K mutation. At the permissive temperature, CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> membrane recruitment was readily detected in the germline, however this localization was lost as animals were shifted to the restrictive temperature (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Similarly, the C1 domain is required for membrane localization in the gonad (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> impairs membrane localization, and it is likely to impair the function of both its GAP and C1 domains."

Importantly, when NOP-1 activity is compromised, inactivation of CED-10/Rac1 does not suppress the defect in furrow ingression caused by CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J,I</a>), suggesting that CYK-4 does not act directly on CED-10."

                                "text": "To begin to determine the role of the catalytic activity of CYK-4 during cytokinesis, we first studied the consequence of mutating the highly conserved catalytic arginine that stabilizes the transition state during GTP hydrolysis. Substitution of the catalytic arginine with alanine strongly attenuates GAP activity against Rac in a variety of CYK-4 orthologs and is widely used to inactivate Rho family GAPs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rittinger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yamada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Miller and Bement, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bastos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zanin et al., 2013</a>). As expected, CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> GAP domain retains the ability to bind to RhoA\u2022GTP, demonstrating that the protein is well folded in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While CYK-4 GAP exhibits GAP activity towards both RhoA and CED-10/Rac1, CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> GAP lacks detectable GAP activity towards either GTPase (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In order to determine if catalytic activity is required for viability, we used a strain heterozygous for a deletion mutant of CYK-4, <i>cyk-4(ok1034)</i>. One quarter of the embryos from these heterozygous hermaphrodites contain maternally provided CYK-4 and lack zygotic CYK-4. These zygotic null embryos fail to hatch and arrest with a variety of terminal phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left). Many, but not all, embryos contain muscle tissue and have undergone partial morphogenesis. The embryos also contain enlarged cells, likely due to defects in cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sugimoto et al., 2001</a>). We introduced the GAP-defective transgene into this strain. Remarkably, <i>cyk-4(ok1034)</i>; <i>cyk-4<sup>R459A</sup></i> animals hatch and develop to adulthood. However, these animals are sterile (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, middle). Thus, the GAP activity of CYK-4 is not essential for post embryonic development but it has an important role in gonad development, likely due to a requirement for post-embryonic cell proliferation in the germline. As a consequence, it is not possible to use classical genetic tools to obtain embryos in which CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> is the sole form of CYK-4."

They undergo pseudocleavage, mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, central spindle assembly during anaphase, and CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> becomes highly enriched on the spindle midzone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Cleavage furrow initiation occurs and the furrow ingresses at near wild-type rates to near completion. However, cytokinesis does not complete and the furrow ultimately regresses; this phenotype was fully penetrant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>); these embryos also fail to complete cytokinesis following meiosis II (data not shown).

If furrow formation is dependent on CYK-4 binding to either CED-10/Rac1 or CDC-42 to generate a positive regulatory complex, then inactivation of these GTPases would be predicted to cause a phenotype at least as severe as a mutation that weakens the GTPase binding site of CYK-4. However, mutation of CED-10/Rac1, or depletion of CDC-42, does not affect the rate of cleavage furrow ingression (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Loria et al., 2012</a>), even when combined with mutations in NOP-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Indeed, cytokinesis occurs efficiently and proceeds to completion in embryos in which NOP-1, CED-10/Rac1, and CDC-42 are simultaneously inactivated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). We infer, therefore, that RhoA is the relevant GTPase that CYK-4 binds to promote cleavage furrow formation. Due to its direct role in furrow ingression, it is not possible to test RhoA in the same manner."

Previous studies proposed at least three models for the phenotype seen in <i>cyk-4<sup>R459A</sup></i> embryos. First, the GAP domain could function as canonical GAP that acts on RhoA, causing CYK-4 GAP-deficient embryos fail to complete cytokinesis because of a requirement for RhoA inactivation at late cytokinesis. Second, CED-10/Rac1 could be an important target of CYK-4 GAP activity, causing CYK-4 GAP deficient embryos to accumulate ectopic Rac1 activity that interferes with cytokinesis. Third, although it is counterintuitive, CYK-4 GAP activity could somehow promote RhoA activation, and therefore the CYK-4 GAP deficient embryos may fail cytokinesis due to incomplete RhoA activation.

Remarkably, although furrows in <i>cyk-4<sup>R459A</sup>; nop-1</i> embryos barely ingress, when RGA-3/4 is depleted, furrow ingression is completed in 100% of embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This result also rules out the possibility that RGA-3/4 depletion allows completion of cytokinesis because it stabilizes RhoA that was activated in a NOP-1-dependent manner.

We therefore assayed whether CYK-4 GAP domain mutations affect accumulation of RhoA effectors. Because the RhoA biosensor and the CYK-4 transgenes are both GFP-tagged and integrated at the same position of the genome, we assayed the accumulation of RFP-tagged non-muscle myosin, NMY-2, a key effector of RhoA, as a proxy for RhoA activation. To validate that NMY-2::mRFP is a valid proxy for RhoA activity levels, we compared the accumulation of these two markers to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis when co-expressed. The recruitment of NMY-2::mRFP and the RhoA biosensor are highly correlated in space, time, and intensity (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). In addition, the correlation between these markers remains strong when either NOP-1, CYK-4, or RGA-3/4 are depleted, despite the significant changes in the extent of recruitment caused by these perturbations. Thus NMY-2::mRFP provides a reliable proxy for RhoA activation."

These regulatory mechanisms converge to promote local accumulation of active RhoA at the cell equator which is an essential prerequisite for contractile ring assembly. Whereas it is widely accepted that the RhoGEF ECT-2 is the primary activator of RhoA and the centralspindlin component CYK-4 contributes to RhoA activation, the mechanism(s) by which CYK-4 promotes RhoA activation have been rather unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CYK-4 has multiple functional domains that are required for it to promote RhoA activation. In addition to the previously characterized binding interaction with ECT-2, we show that both the C1 domain and the catalytic activity of the RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 are also required for full activation of ECT-2. Furthermore, our results indicate in order for the CYK-4 GAP domain to promote RhoA activation, it has to act catalytically on RhoA\u2022GTP. This implies that RhoA plays a role in promoting its own activation."

However, neither CED-10/Rac1 nor CDC-42 is required for cytokinesis, even in NOP-1-defective embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), whereas weakening GTPase binding by the CYK-4 GAP domain strongly impacts cytokinesis.

Our mutational analysis has trapped ECT-2 in four distinct states that form an allelic series (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We propose that the least active form of ECT-2 is not bound to CYK-4 and has little GEF activity. Once CYK-4 is phosphorylated, it can be bound by the ECT-2 N-terminal BRCT domains rendering it weakly activated (equivalent to CYK-4<sup>EE</sup>). This form may also exhibit some interactions between the GEF domain of ECT-2 and the GAP domain of CYK-4, as these domains can interact in vitro without RhoA present. If CYK-4 can bind to RhoA\u2022GTP, it induces a higher activity state, as evidenced by the increased activity of CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup>, which is sufficient for zygotic development. Finally, if CYK-4 can induce GTP hydrolysis by RhoA, this results in the fully active ECT-2/CYK-4/RhoA\u2022GDP or ECT-2/CYK-4/RhoA\u2022GDP + Pi state populated by the wild-type protein.

As numerous studies have shown that active RhoA can indirectly inhibit Rac1 (see <a href=\"#bib19\">Guilluy et al., 2011</a> for review), some of the results that point to a role for CYK-4 GAP activity in attenuating Rac1 levels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bastos et al., 2012</a>) may be indirectly caused by a reduction RhoA activation or by indirectly controlling cortical tension. Thus, many previous results can be explained without proposing that the CYK-4 GAP domain performs different functions in different organisms or cell types. We do not rule out the possibility that, in certain contexts, CYK-4 or its orthologs negatively regulate Rac or Cdc42. Recent evidence indicates that the <i>Xenopus</i> ortholog of CYK-4 concentrates at cell\u2013cell junctions and negatively regulates GTPases at that site (<a href=\"#bib5\">Breznau et al., 2015</a>). Further work is required to resolve why CYK-4 acts as a positive regulator of RhoA in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos and a negative regulator in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos (<a href=\"#bib28\">Miller and Bement, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Breznau et al., 2015</a>)."

Our favored model, in which RhoA promotes its own activation, is reminiscent of the positive feedback in Cdc42 activation during yeast budding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Howell and Lew, 2012</a>) and the activation of the SOS1 RasGEF domain by a molecule of Ras\u2022GTP that serves as an allosteric activator (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gureasko et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, ECT-2 has also been implicated in SOS regulation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canevascini et al., 2005</a>). Likewise, CYK-4 is not the only protein with a GTPase activating domain that plays a role in promoting GEF activity. A similar function, in cis, has been seen in p115 RhoGEF, which is activated by G\u03b113 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). In this case, the binding of a molecule of G\u03b113 to an allosteric site on the RhoGEF domain of p115 is stabilized by p115's N-terminal RGS domain (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). RGS domains accelerate GTP hydrolysis by G\u03b1, that is, they are G\u03b1 GAPs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tesmer et al., 1997</a>). As RhoGEF activation is not an obvious function for a RhoGAP domain, additional cases may have gone undetected."

In addition to cell-cycle regulated changes in the phosphorylation state of CYK-4 and ECT-2 that control their binding and localization (<a href=\"#bib45\">Y\u00fcce et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Su et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zou et al., 2014</a>), full activation of RhoA also involves membrane binding by CYK-4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) which, in turn, requires centralspindlin oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib1\">Basant et al., 2015</a>). Like the requirement for CYK-4 GAP activity, the requirement for the C1 domain of CYK-4 is context dependent. Whereas the C1 domain makes a major contribution to furrow ingression in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos, studies in Hela cells demonstrate that the C1 domain contributes to RhoA activation, but it is not essential (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lekomtsev et al., 2012</a>). Thus, centralspindlin has several domains that contribute to maximal activation of ECT-2. However, not all cell types may require maximal activation of ECT-2 either because of physical properties of the cell (cell size, cortical tension, and tissue organization) or because of their biochemical properties (expression of RGA-3/4 orthologs). Nevertheless, the evolutionary conservation of all of these functions suggests that they play critical roles during some stage(s) of metazoan development."

Through structure-function analysis of CYK-4 GAP they have identified that the GAP activity of CYK-4 is essential for cytokinesis, and performs at least 2 different functions. They make the important discovery that the GAP activity is crucial for nucleotide exchange on RhoA, the GTPase that activates both actin polymerization and myosin II activation. The work is very thorough and I particularly like the experiment where, through an unbiased screen for suppressors of CYK-4 GAP mutants, they identify new alleles of the RhoA exchange factor ECT2 itself. They further go on to show that CYK-4 physically interacts with ECT-2 and that an Ect2 mutant they isolated has higher nucleotide exchange activity (albeit a modest one)."

The two key experiments are: 1) how do the GAP mutants behave in the physical interaction experiments with ECT2 and 2) how does the presence of wild-type or GAP mutants of CYK-4 affects the ECT2-mediated nucleotide exchange on RhoA. These experiments are crucial if they are to advance the model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."

Their data strongly support the conclusion that the primary role of CYK-4/RhoGAP is to activate RhoA through its RhoGEF ECT-2. This is a counter-intuitive finding, as normally one thinks of GAPs as negative regulators of GTPases, not activators. The authors provide a rationale for this surprising role, and their evidence certainly supports the conclusion and also can to a large extent explain alternative views (invoking either indirect effects on other GTPases, or indirect effects from depletion of other GTPases to explain results suggesting that either the GAP activity of this family of RhoGAPs is not necessary or that it acts on other GTPases, in particular Rac as reported by <a href=\"#bib7\">Canman et al., 2008</a>). The authors provide an elegant and impressive analysis of this issue, using a powerful combination of mutational analysis, live cell imaging and biochemistry. This manuscript provides the most extensive and compelling analysis of how CYK-4 influences cytokinesis via the RhoGEF ECT-2 and the RhoA GTPase, and should go a long ways toward resolving this complex issue."

The cell biological and genetical data that the Glotzer lab has been providing in a recent series of papers are indeed very difficult to explain with Rac or Cdc42 as sole targets of CYK-4 but are consistent with the positive role of CYK-4 on RhoA activation. A major difficulty of this theory is that a GAP usually promotes conversion of a GTPase from GTP-form to GDP-form, which is in general an inactive form, by stimulating the GTP hydrolysis. A clear molecular mechanism for CYK-4 to activate RhoA has been a huge missing link in the file of cytokinesis."

By combination with the loss-of-function of NOP-1, a mysterious activator of Ect2 RhoGEF specific for nematodes, and RGA-3/4, a well conserved GAP that specifically inactivates Rho, the authors have strengthen their previous conclusion \u201cthat the RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 has an essential role in RhoA activation\u201d (this is the title of <a href=\"#bib27\">Loria, 2012</a>) except for a concern about the presence of other Rac proteins in addition to CED-10 (see below), which was not considered.

For example, as the explanations for the similar weaker cortical accumulation of the E448K and EE mutants, which show very similar in vivo phenotypes (slow ingression and regression at \u223c50% ingression around 300s, weaker cortical accumulation, no furrowing upon <i>nop-1</i> loss-of-function), they employed different reasonings, indirect effect on the function of C1 domain and the weakened interaction with RhoA, respectively. I agree with the authors on that mutations inside a protein fold might make the folding less stable more frequently than surface mutations and understand that a concern about this possibility prompted the current studies. However, this is an issue to be answered by proper biochemical/biophysical assays such as circular dichroism spectroscopy, which was undertaken in a recent paper from the Glotzer lab (White et al., 2013 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707682/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707682/</a>). Otherwise, based on the phenotypic similarity, it would be more reasonable to explain the phenotype of the E448K mutation is also caused by the reduced affinity to Rho (or other GTPases). Anyway, there are different possible mechanisms for the cortical recruitment of CYK-4 that are not necessarily exclusive to each other; C1-phosphoinositide interaction, GAP-Rho interaction, interaction with astral microtubule gathered by the ingressing furrow. This should be explained more explicitly rather than picking up a convenient one for individual cases."

However, this point is addressed by Basant et al. In that paper we showed that <i>nop\u20131;air\u20132</i> embryos are defective in contractility and this defect can be completely reversed by depletion of par\u20135. Furthermore, the hypercontractility phenotype caused by depletion of PAR\u20135 is phenocopied by mutation of ZEN\u20134 S682A (which is unable to bind PAR\u20135). PAR\u20135 was previously shown to inhibit centralspindlin oligomerization by binding to phospho-S682 MKLP1 (PMID 20451386). Collectively, these results indicate that the defect in RhoA activation in <i>nop\u20131; air\u20132</i> mutants is caused by a failure of centralspindlin to oligomerize. Furthermore, in Basant et al., we showed that the hypercontractility caused by PAR\u20135 depletion (which is phenocopied by mutation of ZEN\u20134 S682A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) is ECT\u20132-dependent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figire 1 C, D</a>) and is associated with an increase in RhoA activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In summary, hyperoligomerization of ZEN\u20134 (either PAR\u20135 depletion or S682A) induces hyperactivation of RhoA and hypo-oligomerization of ZEN\u20134 (aurora B inhibition) prevents RhoA activation."
