However, it remains unclear whether nucleosomes mobilized by chromatin remodelers can influence TFs that are already present on the DNA template. In this study, we investigated the interplay between nucleosome remodeling, by either yeast ISW1a or SWI/SNF, and a bound TF. We found that a TF serves as a major barrier to ISW1a remodeling, and acts as a boundary for nucleosome repositioning. In contrast, SWI/SNF was able to slide a nucleosome past a TF, with concurrent eviction of the TF from the DNA, and the TF did not significantly impact the nucleosome positioning. Our results provide direct evidence for a novel mechanism for both nucleosome positioning regulation by bound TFs and TF regulation via dynamic repositioning of nucleosomes."

However, it remains unclear whether nucleosomes mobilized by chromatin remodelers can influence TFs that are already present on the DNA template. In this study, we investigated the interplay between nucleosome remodeling, by either yeast ISW1a or SWI/SNF, and a bound TF. We found that a TF serves as a major barrier to ISW1a remodeling, and acts as a boundary for nucleosome repositioning. In contrast, SWI/SNF was able to slide a nucleosome past a TF, with concurrent eviction of the TF from the DNA, and the TF did not significantly impact the nucleosome positioning. Our results provide direct evidence for a novel mechanism for both nucleosome positioning regulation by bound TFs and TF regulation via dynamic repositioning of nucleosomes."

In yeast and other eukaryotic organisms, this DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to make structures called nucleosomes. This compacts the DNA and allows it to fit inside the tiny nucleus within the cell. The positioning of the nucleosomes influences how tightly packed the DNA is, which in turn influences the activity of genes. Less active genes tend to be found within regions of DNA that are tightly packed, while more active genes are found in less tightly packed regions."

In yeast, the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers can disassemble nucleosomes to promote gene activity, while the ISW1 family organises nucleosomes into closely spaced groups to repress gene activity. However, it is not clear if, or how, chromatin remodelers can influence transcription factors that are already bound to DNA."

Thus, processes such as transcription must be mediated by mechanisms that regulate gene function rapidly and reliably (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrera and Ren, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kornberg, 2007</a>). In eukaryotic cells, proper transcriptional regulation depends upon transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific DNA-binding sites (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kadonaga, 2004</a>). Additionally, the repression of transcription has often been correlated with the presence of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin structure, in which histone\u2013DNA interactions act as a barrier for RNA polymerase elongation along DNA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Petesch and Lis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Teves et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, understanding the relationship between TF binding and nucleosomes is essential in understanding gene expression and regulation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Voss and Hager, 2014</a>)."

Nucleosomes and TFs have been shown to compete for binding to DNA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mirny, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lickwar et al., 2012</a>). This competition is based on the respective affinities of the TF and nucleosome for DNA, and depends upon DNA sequence, histone variants, and histone modifications. However, a nucleosome may also be repositioned through the action of chromatin remodelers, suggesting additional levels of transcription regulation. Some TFs are known to recruit nucleosome remodelers. Previous earlier studies focused on how these recruiting TFs affect the outcomes of nucleosome remodeling (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nagaich et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boeger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dechassa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Voss et al., 2011</a>). However, it is unclear how TFs that do not recruit remodelers influence the chromatin landscape. We hypothesize that nucleosome remodeling, without remodeler recruitment, may regulate the state of a bound TF. Specifically, a remodeler may attempt to move a nucleosome to or through a site pre-occupied by a TF. During such an encounter, the TF may be displaced, or it may act as a roadblock for nucleosome remodeling. Thus, chromatin remodeling may serve as an alternative mechanism to regulate transcription through its influence on a bound TF, and a bound TF may dictate the location of a remodeled nucleosome."

SWI/SNF family remodelers are known to be associated with nucleosome disruption (<a href=\"#bib23\">Imbalzano et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Logie and Peterson, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aoyagi et al., 2002</a>) and transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwon et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hassan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>); while ISWI family remodelers have been shown to contribute to the formation of evenly spaced nucleosome arrays (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tsukiyama et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fyodorov and Kadonaga, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lusser et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Torigoe et al., 2011</a>). Despite these opposing characteristics, both remodeler families have been implicated in transcriptional activation and repression (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwon et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Moreira and Holmberg, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hassan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Martens and Winston, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Whitehouse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yadon et al., 2010</a>). On mononucleosome substrates, many ISWI remodelers have been shown to be sensitive to naked DNA segments flanking the nucleosome, preferentially sliding the nucleosome towards the longer segment of DNA (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Blosser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Deindl et al., 2013</a>). This sensitivity to linker DNA is believed to underlie their ability to generate evenly spaced nucleosomal arrays (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gelbart et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stockdale et al., 2006</a>). SWI/SNF remodelers, on the other hand, can shift a histone octamer up to 50 bp off the end of a short DNA fragment (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kassabov et al., 2003</a>). On dinucleosomal templates, SWI/SNF remodelers have been found to shift one nucleosome onto another, indicating nucleosome disruption and eviction characteristics of these remodelers (<a href=\"#bib13\">Engeholm et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dechassa et al., 2010</a>)."

First, we investigated the initial direction of nucleosome remodeling in the presence of a bound Gal4DBD in close proximity. This was achieved by limiting the remodeling reaction to the first remodeling event which we define as a single round of remodeler binding, nucleosome remodeling, and remodeler detachment from the nucleosomal DNA (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shundrovsky et al., 2006</a>). We engineered a DNA template in which a Gal4 binding sequence and a 601NPE were separated by 10 bp. The DNA template containing a positioned nucleosome was then remodeled, by either SWI/SNF or ISW1a, for a short period of time (\u223c1 min), with or without the addition of Gal4DBD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). During such a short remodeling time, \u223c56% of nucleosomes pooled from measurements of multiple single molecules were found to remain at the original location, suggesting a lack of remodeling (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Of the remaining \u223c45% of the nucleosomes that were remodeled, we estimate that \u223c73% were remodeled only once and \u223c27% were remodeled more than once, using a method we previously established (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shundrovsky et al., 2006</a>)."

In the absence of Gal4DBD, the nucleosome was moved away from the template end by several hundred base pairs towards the center region of the template, generating a rather broad distribution. In contrast, in the presence of Gal4DBD, although nucleosomes were still moved away from the end of the template, they were not able to pass the location of the Gal4DBD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

After a single round of nucleosome remodeling, the nucleosome will likely overlap the Gal4 binding site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

Therefore, in order to determine whether a Gal4DBD was present after nucleosome remodeling, we allowed SWI/SNF to carry out multiple rounds of remodeling reactions to potentially reposition the nucleosome sufficiently far from the Gal4 binding site to allow for a definitive assay of the state of binding at the Gal4 binding site."

To answer this question, we allowed a nucleosome to be remodeled by SWI/SNF in the presence of Gal4DBD. We then analyzed each trace to determine whether a nucleosome was remodeled to the opposite side of the Gal4 sequence or to the same side of the Gal4 sequence, relative to the 601NPE. For the traces where nucleosomes were remodeled to the opposite side of the Gal4 sequence, we did not detect any Gal4DBD unzipping signature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This indicates that SWI/SNF was able to move the nucleosome in such a way that the Gal4DBD was evicted from its binding sequence. For traces where a nucleosome was remodeled to the same side of the Gal4 sequence relative to the 601NPE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), we also did not detect any Gal4DBD unzipping signature. This implies that these nucleosomes were likely first remodeled towards the bound Gal4DBD, as indicated by <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, resulting in the eviction of Gal4DBD. This was followed by subsequent remodeling events that moved nucleosomes to other positions. Control experiments SWI/SNF is unable to evict a bound Gal4DBD in the absence of a nucleosome or in the absence of ATP (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). An increase in the separation between the Gal4 binding site and 601NPS to 24 bp still permits SWI/SNF remodeling to evict Gal4DBD (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, we conclude that SWI/SNF remodeling is able to evict a bound TF and this eviction requires the presence of a nucleosome."

Because the Lac repressor is only found in prokaryotic cells and has no known relationship with any chromatin remodeler in eukaryotic cells, it can act as a biologically neutral bound protein. When ISW1a remodeled an end-positioned nucleosome on a template also containing a bound Lac repressor, the Lac repressor effectively dictated the position of the remodeled nucleosome, with ISW1a centering the nucleosome on the DNA with the Lac repressor acting as a barrier (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast, SWI/SNF was able to slide a nucleosome in either direction, displacing the bound Lac repressor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

In contrast to bulk biochemical studies that typically use DNA ends as boundaries on short DNA templates, our studies using bound TFs as potential barriers better mimic a situation that will more likely occur in vivo."

Biochemical studies and the crystal structure of ISW1a indicate that the DNA-binding domain of ISW1a binds to \u223c29 bp of the extranucleosomal DNA, which has been proposed to act as an anchor to pull the nucleosome towards ISW1a (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gangaraju and Bartholomew, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hauk and Bowman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hota et al., 2013</a>). Our finding that ISW1a moves nucleosome away from a TF adjacent to the nucleosome is consistent with an important role of the DNA-binding domain in engaging fully accessible DNA immediately flanking the nucleosome. In contrast, while it has been widely acknowledged that SWI/SNF does not require extra-nucleosomal DNA binding to remodel a nucleosome, cryo-EM and DNA-crosslinking experiments have shown that the Snf6 subunit of SWI/SNF binds to \u223c15 bp of the extra-nucleosomal DNA and the rest of the SWI/SNF slides the nucleosome away from where the Snf6 subunit binds (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dechassa et al., 2008</a>). Although the Snf6 subunit has not been shown to be essential for remodeling, it has DNA-binding affinity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sengupta et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dechassa et al., 2008</a>). We speculate that it may help to orient SWI/SNF binding on the nucleosome. In the presence of a barrier adjacent to a nucleosome, Snf6 may prefer to bind to the side of the nucleosome with more linker DNA and thus orient SWI/SNF to slide a nucleosome towards the TF."

These results have significant implications for the mechanism of nucleosome spacing in vivo. Genome-wide nucleosome mapping in budding yeast revealed that deletion of ISWI in yeast disrupts nucleosome spacing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that ISW1 remodelers are key players in generating evenly distributed nucleosomal arrays. In addition, several recent studies have shown that certain DNA-binding factors located at the promoter region are also responsible for nucleosome positioning (<a href=\"#bib64\">Whitehouse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yadon et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hughes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Parikh and Kim, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Struhl and Segal, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lieleg et al., 2014</a>). Our finding that a bound Gal4DBD is a barrier to ISW1a now provides direct evidence to illustrate that ISW1a can potentially use a TF around the promoter region as a reference point to evenly position nucleosomes into the gene body."

                                "text": "Our study shows that TF eviction is an intrinsic property of SWI/SNF remodeling and is independent of SWI/SNF recruitment (<a href=\"#fig4 fig5\">Figures 4 and 5</a>). It has been previously shown that SWI/SNF recruitment by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) induced histone loss in nucleosomes and this was immediately followed by GR and SWI/SNF eviction from the template (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nagaich et al., 2004</a>). Our current work demonstrates that, in the absence of remodeler recruitment, TF eviction via nucleosome remodeling can take place without substantial nucleosome loss. Although SWI/SNF can translocate along naked DNA (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lia et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sirinakis et al., 2011</a>), raising the possibility for TF eviction solely by SWI/SNF, we found that in the absence of a nucleosome, SWI/SNF did not displace Gal4DBD from its binding site (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Thus, SWI/SNF translocation alone is insufficient to displace a bound Gal4DBD and TF eviction requires nucleosome remodeling. Previous work by Owen-Hughes and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lia et al., 2006</a>) found that translocation by RSC was highly sensitive to a force in the DNA. Therefore, although SWI/SNF is known to translocate along naked DNA, it may have limited ability in dealing with a road block, such as a bound protein. It is also possible that SWI/SNF is unable to efficiently locate a bound protein in the absence of a nucleosome. We speculate that TF removal may be accelerated once a nucleosome is repositioned over the bound TF. Indeed, a recent single molecule fluorescence study of Gal4 binding kinetics on nucleosomal DNA showed that a nucleosome regulates Gal4 binding not only by preventing Gal4 binding, but also by dramatically increasing the Gal 4 dissociation rate from the DNA (<a href=\"#bib42\">Luo et al., 2014</a>)."

Genome-wide mapping of yeast indicates that, apart from localizing to nucleosomes around transcription start sites, SWI/SNF family remodelers are also enriched upstream of the promoter regions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yen et al., 2012</a>). Genome-wide analysis of the locations of human chromatin remodelers also found that Brg1, Chd4, and Snf2h are highly enriched at the promoter and distal upstream regions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Morris et al., 2014</a>). Since many relevant transcriptional modulators, such as enhancers (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ren, 2010</a>) and insulators (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 2001</a>), are located further upstream of promoters, SWI/SNF family remodelers could move promoter nucleosomes to dynamically regulate these factors. Thus, although SWI/SNF alone does not possess any ability to remove TFs on its own, our work shows that SWI/SNF can slide nucleosomes to displace neighboring TFs around the promoter region, providing a mechanistic basis for dynamically clearing both nucleosomes and other bound factors upon SWI/SNF recruitment (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nagaich et al., 2004</a>)."

The unzipping methods have been previously described (<a href=\"#bib36\">Li and Wang, 2012</a>) and briefly summarized here. Whenever the unzipping fork encountered an interaction that prevented the fork progression, the unzipping force was ramped up linearly with time (15 pN/s) until the interaction was disrupted. When two interactions occurred in close vicinity, upon the disruption of the first interaction the force was unable to relax back to the baseline before being ramped up again for the second interaction, subjecting this subsequent interaction to a higher initial force. Therefore, for each region of interactions, the dwell time histogram highlighted the edge of the region first encountered. Another feature of this method was the display of the distinctive force signature for a nucleosome, allowing for robust identification of the nucleosome structure."

While the biochemical properties and mechanisms of action of ATP-dependent remodeling factors have been studied extensively, relatively few studies have examined how DNA-binding proteins impact and are impacted by nucleosome remodeling. Using a previously described unzipping assay, the authors present evidence that a Gal4 derivative (1-147) or the Lac repressor can block nucleosome sliding by ISWI1a. By contrast, the data suggest that SWI/SNF action leads to eviction of both Gal4 and LacR. The authors find that DNA-binding proteins serve as a barrier to nucleosome sliding by Isw1a, and nucleosomes tend to become evenly spaced between the DNA-binding protein and a barrier on the other side (such as the end of the DNA fragment). By contrast, SWI/SNF preferentially remodels nucleosomes toward the DNA-binding protein and displaces the DNA-binding factor in the process. This displacement by SWI/SNF depends on nucleosome remodeling. The experimental results as shown appear solid, but there are several concerns with the experimental design that create serious issues as described below."

We agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to gain additional mechanistic insight to determine whether the loss of a bound Gal4DBD occurs either due to the invasion of the nucleosome or prior to this invasion. We had indeed contemplated the possibility of examining the fate of Gal4DBD during the initial remodeling event. Unfortunately we concluded that this experiment does not appear to be feasible for the following reason. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, after the initial remodeling event, SWI/SNF repositions the nucleosome by \u223c 30 bp towards a bound Gal4DBD so that the nucleosome will likely overlap the Gal4 binding site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, the force signature of a bound Gal4DBD is subtle compared to that of a nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and thus the presence or the absence of a bound Gal4DBD cannot be definitively differentiated from the nucleosome by the unzipping force. Therefore, in order to determine whether a Gal4DBD was present after nucleosome remodeling, we allowed SWI/SNF to carry out multiple rounds of remodeling reactions to potentially reposition the nucleosome sufficiently far from the Gal4 binding site to allow for a definitive assay of the state of binding at the Gal4 binding site. We have now revised the main text to clarify this point (subsection headed \u201cSWI/SNF remodeling evicts Gal4DBD from DNA\u201d)."

In contrast to ISW1a-remodeled nucleosomes that were always located within a rather narrow distribution on one side of the TF, SWI/SNF remodeled nucleosomes were located over a much broader range of positions on both sides of the Gal4 binding site. For a given remodeling reaction time, the farther the Gal4 binding site is separated from the 601NPE, the lower the probability of detecting a remodeled nucleosome that is repositioned to the other side of the Gal4 binding site. In addition, in order to determine whether the Gal4DBD is still present on the template when a nucleosome is repositioned to the other side of the Gal4 binding site, the nucleosome must be located sufficiently far from the Gal4 binding site so that the footprint of the repositioned nucleosome does not overlap with the Gal4 binding site (see our answer to comment #2).

In the Workman experiment, the Gal4 binding site, separated by \u223c20 bp from the nucleosome, was used to recruit SWI/SNF via a bound Gal4-VP16. Under this configuration, nucleosomes were remodeled off the template, away from the Gal4 binding site. In contrast, our template design placed the Gal4 binding site 10 bp from the 601NPE, and we found that the nucleosome was remodeled towards the Gal4 binding site. We attribute the opposite directionality from these two studies to SWI/SNF orientation on the nucleosome. In the Workman experiment, the 20 bp separation was sufficient for the binding of Snf6 subunit of the SWI/SNF, and thus the Gal4-VP16 oriented the SWI/SNF to slide the nucleosome away from the Gal4 binding site. In our experiment, the 10 bp separation prevented binding of Snf6 subunit so that the Snf6 could only bind on the site of the nucleosome distal to the Gal4 binding site. This difference in directionality also highlights the difference in nucleosome remodeling with and without specific recruitment."
