Engineering of next-generation lentiviral vectors targeting safe genomic harbors for insertion is therefore of high relevance. In a previous paper (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cai et al., 2014a</a>), we showed the use of integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) as carriers of complete gene repair kits consisting of zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) proteins and repair sequences, allowing gene correction by homologous recombination (HR). Here, we follow this strategy to engineer ZFN-loaded IDLVs that insert transgenes by a homology-driven mechanism into safe loci. This insertion mechanism is driven by time-restricted exposure of treated cells to ZFNs. We show targeted gene integration in human stem cells, including CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Notably, targeted insertions are identified in 89% of transduced iPSCs. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of nuclease-loaded \u2018all-in-one\u2019 IDLVs for site-directed gene insertion in stem cell-based gene therapies."

Engineering of next-generation lentiviral vectors targeting safe genomic harbors for insertion is therefore of high relevance. In a previous paper (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cai et al., 2014a</a>), we showed the use of integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) as carriers of complete gene repair kits consisting of zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) proteins and repair sequences, allowing gene correction by homologous recombination (HR). Here, we follow this strategy to engineer ZFN-loaded IDLVs that insert transgenes by a homology-driven mechanism into safe loci. This insertion mechanism is driven by time-restricted exposure of treated cells to ZFNs. We show targeted gene integration in human stem cells, including CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Notably, targeted insertions are identified in 89% of transduced iPSCs. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of nuclease-loaded \u2018all-in-one\u2019 IDLVs for site-directed gene insertion in stem cell-based gene therapies."

Lentiviral vectors offer an effective gene delivery route, but also suffer from prevalent gene insertion into transcriptionally active regions\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Schr\u00f6der et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Modlich et al., 2009</a>). Novel strategies to attain targeted gene integration (TGI) into predetermined genomic loci are highly warranted. TGI using lentiviral vectors can be achieved by delivering donor sequences for insertion by homologous recombination (HR) into double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by tailored endonucleases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lombardo et al., 2011</a>). Development of programmable nucleases, ZFNs, TALENs, and now CRISPR/Cas9, has made effective gene disruption feasible, even in stem cells, but genetic operations involving TGI in stem cells are still challenged by low membrane permeability, low HR efficiency, and high sensitivity to external manipulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Genovese et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Hockemeyer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hendel et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib32\">Tay et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Tiyaboonchai et al., 2014</a>)."

Here, building on these findings, we report a simple method for establishing TGI by treating cells with integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) packaged with both the transgene-containing donor template and ZFN proteins fused to the N-terminus of lentiviral Gag and GagPol polypeptides. Locus-directed cleavage and TGI is evident in cell lines, CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) upon transduction with ZFN-loaded vectors. Notably, the prevalence of TGI in two safe harbors in the human genome, the <i>CCR5</i> and <i>AAVS1</i> loci, is high in iPSCs treated with ZFN-loaded lentiviral vectors, resulting in non-mosaic clones harboring a site-directed gene insertion and no additional cutting at top-ranked off-target sites."

Principles of production, transduction, and integration of such vectors are illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. Together with a dimer of lentiviral vector RNAs, approximately 5000 copies of Gag and GagPol polypeptides (of which about half carry a ZFN fused to the matrix protein) form the capsid, which is wrapped in a segment of the membrane during budding from the producer cells. ZFNs are released from Gag and GagPol upon cleavage by the viral protease during maturation of the virus particle. The mature virus particles contain two types of ZFNs, left and right, which upon DNA binding in the target cell form a catalytically active dimer. After viral entry in the target cells and endosomal escape, vector RNA is reverse transcribed to DNA, which can serve as donor for homology-directed insertion at targeted breakage sites generated by the co-delivered ZFNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lower panel)."

Initially, three days post-transduction, a higher frequency of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells was observed among cells transduced with IDLV/<i>egfp</i> than for cells transduced with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<i>egfp</i> (59.1% versus 44.7%), indicating that the overall transduction potential was higher for IDLVs that did not carry ZFNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D and 1E</a>). Nevertheless, at later time points 2.5% of the cells were eGFP<sup>+</sup> after treatment with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<i>egfp</i>, whereas the percentage dropped to below 1% in IDLV/<i>egfp</i>-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). PCR amplification and sequencing of the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 junction sites including part of the donor sequence and the regions flanking the inserted transgene cassette showed that events of correct integration into <i>AAVS1</i> locus were evident after treatment with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<i>egfp</i>, whereas PCR products indicative of site-directed insertion did not appear for IDLV/<i>egfp</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

Encouraged by this, we reasoned that the efficiency could be further increased (i) by using higher MOIs, (ii) by pretreating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with Vpx-loaded lentiviral particles (to degrade the reverse transcription inhibitor SAMHD1 [<a href=\"#bib16\">Laguette et al., 2011</a>]), and (iii) by treating the cells with an extra dose of ZFNs delivered by LP-ZFNs.

Transduction of iPSCs with IDLV-ZFN(CCR5)/<i>puro</i> resulted in effective colony formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Among the puromycin-resistant clones, we randomly picked, isolated and expanded 15 clones (clones 1\u201315) and showed by PCR analysis of each of these colonies that the transgene cassette in all 15 clones (100%) had been inserted site-specifically into the <i>CCR5</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). For a single representative clone, stemness was verified using alkaline phosphatase (AP) and the TRA-1-60 pluripotency marker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Once again, we pooled more than 100 puromycin-resistant iPSC clones and performed next-generation sequencing on PCR amplicons amplified from the on-target locus and nine high-ranked off-target sites in the pooled DNA sample (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Notably, we identified an indel in approximately 19% of the <i>CCR5</i> alleles that did not already carry a TGI, demonstrating that the second <i>CCR5</i> allele was cleaved by ZFNs in approximately one of every five clones harboring a <i>CCR5</i>-directed insertion. Importantly, off-target cleavage and indel formation by NHEJ was not evident in any of the nine analyzed off-target candidate loci. Hence, not even the <i>CCR2</i> locus (off-target 3), which is highly homologous to the <i>CCR5</i> site and a known off-target cleavage site for <i>CCR5</i>-targeted ZFNs, harbored detectable levels of indels."

It is still unclear to which extent this biased integration pattern induces toxicity due to insertional mutagenesis, but new approaches to alter the integration properties of lentiviral vectors remain attractive. Different strategies have been employed to reprogram the integration machinery of lentiviral vectors including (i) addition of a DNA-binding zinc-finger protein to the integrase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bushman and Miller, 1997</a>), (ii) fusion of a chromosomal binding domain to LEDGF, a cellular co-factor of the integrase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gijsbers et al., 2010</a>), and (iii) insertion of lentiviral DNA intermediates by transposases and recombinases (<a href=\"#bib34\">Vink et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Staunstrup et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Moldt et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib3\">Cai et al., 2014b</a>). These approaches successfully alter the integration preference, but do not allow site-specific insertion into a preferred locus. Here, we present an alternative homology-directed insertion strategy facilitated by nuclease-directed DNA cleavage. By co-packaging designer nucleases and donor sequences into lentiviral vectors and utilizing cellular HR repair pathways to integrate the transgene, we can guide lentiviral cargo toward a safe harbor in up to 84% of HEK293T cells and 89% of iPSCs that were transduced with the \u2018all-in-one\u2019 vector system. The efficiency may likely be further improved by exploiting heterodimer-forming rather than homodimer-forming FokI domains (<a href=\"#bib5\">Doyon et al., 2011</a>)."

Despite the potential of genetic therapies based on TGI in stem cells, like CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and iPSCs, existing technologies remain insufficient and highly toxic (<a href=\"#bib7\">Genovese et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Hoban et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib23\">Merling et al., 2015</a>). Exploiting the capacity of lentiviruses to co-deliver nucleases and a transgene cassette, we showed TGI in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells transduced with ZFN-loaded IDLVs without affecting the viability, proliferation, or colony-forming capacity of the cells. However, the efficiency was only modest, suggesting that a selective growth advantage of the TGI-engineered cells, as in SCID-X1, would be required for successful engraftment. Possibly, efficacy could be boosted by combining virus treatment with exposure to chemicals enhancing stem cell self-renewal, by supplying NHEJ inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chu et al., 2015</a>), or by manipulating cell cycle conditions in favor of HR (<a href=\"#bib19\">Marniemi et al., 1975</a>)."

                        "text": "Stable transduction rates with ZFN-loaded IDLVs leading to TGI are undoubtedly reduced relative to conventional lentiviral gene delivery strategies. In iPSCs, however, transduction with IDLVs carrying ZFNs targeting either the <i>AAVS1</i> or the <i>CCR5</i> locus generated a high number of puromycin-resistant clones. Remarkably, 34 out of a total of 38 analyzed clones contained the transgene expression cassette inserted precisely into the locus targeted by the ZFNs. Also, as typically observed in relation to the standard use of IDLVs, we found that a few clones contained an additional, randomly inserted transgene cassette, which could be of relevance for potential future therapeutic use. Importantly, however, we found that lentiviral ZFN protein delivery did not lead to detectable off-target cleavage. Hence, cleavage in a total of 16 predicted off-target loci (7 for <i>AAVS1</i> and 9 for <i>CCR5</i>) did not appear as analyzed by deep sequencing of large pools of clones carrying the transgene cassette. If desired, this approach can be combined with removal of the selection marker by seamless excision, exploiting for example lentiviral protein transduction of <i>piggyBac</i> transposase (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cai et al., 2014b</a>). Remarkably, in a large pool of iPSCs, most if not all carrying a site-targeted gene insertion in the <i>CCR5</i> locus, off-target cleavage and indel formation at the neighboring <i>CCR2</i> locus was not evident after deep sequencing analysis. This is in contrast to higher levels of <i>CCR2</i> targeting reported in previous studies using other delivery strategies based on adenoviral vectors, plasmid transfection, or administration of recombinant proteins (<a href=\"#bib27\">Perez et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib6\">Gaj et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that lentiviral delivery of site-targeted endonucleases supports safer engineering of the genome. Together, our findings demonstrate that lentivirus particles can ferry programmable nucleases, facilitating homology-driven, site-directed genomic insertion of a co-delivered transgene. Such co-delivery ensures time-limited exposure of the treated cell to nucleases and, yet, results in frequent TGI with particular applicability in iPSCs."

In all the experiments, cells or lentiviral particles were washed three times with PBS before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Coverslips were stored in 70% ethanol for at least 15\u2009min. To visualize HA-tagged ZFNs, fixed cells or lentiviral particles were incubated with mouse-derived primary HA monoclonal antibody (Covance,\u00a0Princeton,\u00a0NJ) and secondary Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (LifeTechnologies). To visualize p24, the lentiviral particles were stained with rabbit-derived primary p24 polyclonal antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific,\u00a0Waltman,\u00a0MA) and secondary Alexa Fluor 568 Donkey-anti-Rabbit IgG (LifeTechnologies).

For example, instead of just saying IDLV-ZFN/<i>egfp</i>, it should read IDLV-CCR5/<i>egfp</i> or IDLV-AAVS1/<i>egfp</i> in each part, or something similar. The manuscript needs a thorough review in this regard and Figures and legends should be described and labeled accordingly.

The authors demonstrate the specificity of targeting to the <i>AAVSI</i> locus in HEK293 cells by conventional PCR and Southern blot analyses. They show that greater long-term transgene expression (eGFP, Luciferase, or puromycin) is achieved when cells are transduced with IDLV packaged with ZFN (targeted integration, 2.5%) than without (random integration, &gt;1%). Interestingly, the authors note that integrations were not wholly by homologous recombination (HR), but a few events were due to non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). They further apply the strategy in CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells and iPSCs, and show successful transgene integration into the <i>AAVS1</i> locus. Finally, the authors argue that treatment with IDLV-ZFN/<i>puro</i> vectors do not alter the integrity of iPSC stemness evidenced by stem cell marker expression and karyotyping."

Notably, in all of 15 analyzed iPSC clones the transgene cassette was inserted into the <i>CCR5</i> locus. Also, in the revision we are the including the analysis of 15 additional iPSC clones treated with AAVS1-directed \u2018all-in-one\u2019 vectors bringing the total number of analyzed <i>AAVS1</i> clones up to 23. Of these 23 clones, 19 harbored an inserted transgene in the <i>AAVS1</i> locus. Moreover, to address the second point, we have now markedly improved our analysis of specificity and potential off-target cleavage. Hence, we performed next-generation sequencing on pools of iPSC clones appearing after treatment with <i>AAVS1</i> and <i>CCR5</i>-directed \u2018all-in-one\u2019 vectors. Importantly, deep sequencing of panels of top-ranked off-target gave no indication of cleavage at off-target sites. Encouragingly, our analysis also showed that targeted gene insertion into the <i>CCR5</i> locus by lentiviral ZFN protein delivery was not accompanied by cleavage and indel formation in the <i>CCR2</i> locus, a well-known off-target locus, which is known from the literature to be frequently targeted when other delivery approaches are utilized."

However, as mentioned, we have extended the analysis now to include lentiviral vectors loaded with <i>CCR5</i>-targeting ZFNs and verify the use of such IDLVs for prominent site-directed transgene insertion into the <i>CCR5</i> locus. Notably, all clones generated by this approach harbored the site-directed gene insertion (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). We obviously agree with both reviewers that a NGS-based approach was required to strengthen the analysis. This analysis has now been carried out on lentivirally transduced iPSCs harboring insertions in either the <i>AAVS1</i> or the <i>CCR5</i> locus. Hence, the analysis focuses on identifying cleavage leading to indels in the non-modified on-target allele or in panels of top-ranked off-target sites, including in the case of <i>CCR5</i> the <i>CCR2</i> locus (off-target 3). NGS data showing on-target cleavage in both the <i>AAVS1</i> and <i>CCR5</i> loci (3 and 19%, respectively) do not provide evidence of any off-target cleavage in any of the predicted sites (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3H and 3L</a>). Interestingly, targeting of the <i>CCR2</i> after delivery of CCR5-directed ZFN proteins is at the background level, indicating that cells harboring an on-target <i>CCR5</i> insertion do not have indels in the most prominent and well-known off-target locus. Hence, in comparison to other delivery methods protein delivery using lentiviral vectors seems gentler on the off-target loci even in cells where the nucleases are cutting both on-target alleles."

However, it is in this reviewer's opinion that conventional PCR and Southern blot analysis are limited in their ability to detect the prevalence of additional off-target events. Although the authors do query 5 top off-target sites, these are only predicted sites that are based on the designed ZFN's position weight matrix using the PROGNOS tool. They do not consider off-target integration events at hotspots that are independent of ZFN activity.

We acknowledge the point that more information on insertion patterns (than we originally provided) would support the claims made in the original submission. We chose to focus our additional analyses on iPSCs, in which we find frequent site-directed gene insertion using the \u2018all-in-one\u2019 gene delivery system. We carried out PCR of 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 junction sites as well as Southern blot analysis on 15 additional clones generated with <i>AAVS1</i>-directed vectors. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, the PCR data were in complete accordance with the Southern data clearly identifying clones that contained a site-directed gene insertion. Obviously, Southern blotting additionally provides information on the appearance of additional insertions in specific clones. One example is clone 22 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>. Hence, in this context Southern blotting is sufficient to identify events of randomly inserted lentiviral vectors. It is well known from the literature that even IDLVs (integrase-defective lentiviral vectors) may occasionally insert into the genome, and this is obviously confirmed by our data. However, it would not be relevant here to carry out genome-wide studies to identify such off-target random insertion sites that are not necessarily related to ZFN function. Although it cannot be excluded that such events may occur, it is much more relevant, as noted by the reviewer, to focus on the analysis on indel formation in off-target recognition sites. One can argue that a complete genome-wide analysis would be relevant for this matter (also to detect translocations), but we believe that an extensive, NGS-based analysis of an extended panel of predicted off-target loci was sufficient to demonstrate the specificity of the approach. In addition to work involving <i>AAVS1</i>-targeted vector, we also (as mentioned) included a whole new series of experiments including <i>CCR5</i>-targeted vectors. Here, we confirmed site-directed insertion by PCR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>) and concentrated on the NGS analysis of ZFN activity at a panel of 9 off-target loci including the <i>CCR2</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>). The lack of detectable cleavage in the <i>CCR2</i> locus (as shown by the lack of indel formation in this locus in a large pool of clones with ZFN-induced <i>CCR5</i>-directed insertions and evidence of substantial biallelic cleavage) is to us a strong indication that this ZFN delivery approach \u2013 possibly due to the strongly time-restricted presence of ZFNs \u2013 has unprecedented specificity and is safe. Overall, we believe that we have carefully addressed key issues related to achieving site-directed gene insertion. We acknowledge the importance of the genomic integrity and long-term potential of ZFN-engineered iPSCs, but also feel that such studies belong in a future report that may not fit in this \u2018Research Advances\u2019 format."
