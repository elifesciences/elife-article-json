Little is known about the interaction between individual myofilaments and membrane-bound actin filaments. Here we reconstituted a minimal actin cortex to directly visualize the action of individual myofilaments on membrane-bound actin filaments using TIRF microscopy. We show that synthetic myofilaments fragment and compact membrane-bound actin while processively moving along actin filaments. We propose a mechanism by which tension builds up between the ends of myofilaments, resulting in compressive stress exerted to single actin filaments, causing their buckling and breakage. Modeling of this mechanism revealed that sufficient force (\u223c20 pN) can be generated by single myofilaments to buckle and break actin filaments. This mechanism of filament fragmentation and compaction may contribute to actin turnover and cortex reorganization during cytokinesis."

When polymerized, it forms robust filaments that participate in a variety of cellular processes. For example, actin filaments are involved in the contraction of muscles, and they are also a major component in the various structures that maintain and control the shape of cells as they move and divide. These structures include the cell cortex, a meshwork of actin filaments that is bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane by anchor proteins. However, both the cell cortex and the plasma membrane must undergo dramatic changes when a cell divides, and the forces that drive these changes are generated by another protein, myosin II."

Like actin, myosin II proteins also form filaments, but these myofilaments have a distinctive structure: the tail domains of two Myosin II proteins join together, with the motor domains being found at both ends of the filament. When activated, the motor domains grab actin filaments and pull against them in a \u2018powerstroke\u2019. However, the details of the interactions between the myofilament motor domains and the actin filaments in the cell cortex, which are bound to the plasma membrane, are not fully understood."

They show that the myofilaments move along the actin in the cortex, breaking up the filaments and compressing them in the process. They propose that tension builds up between the ends of the myofilaments, leading to compressive stress being exerted on the actin filaments. Computer simulations confirm that the forces generated are high enough to cause the actin filaments to buckle and break. The in vitro model developed by Vogel et al. should allow researchers to clarify the basic biophysical principles that underpin the structure and function of the cell cortex."

It plays a pivotal role in providing mechanical stability to the cell membrane, and in controlling cell shape changes during cell locomotion and cell division (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wessells et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bray and White, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Diz-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sedzinski et al., 2011</a>). Many of these features rely on proper functioning of the actin motor myosin II (<a href=\"#bib8\">De Lozanne and Spudich, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cramer and Mitchison, 1995</a>). Myosin II in the actin cortex functions as assemblies of motor proteins forming anti-parallely arranged bipolar filaments (myofilaments) with motor domains on both filament ends ((<a href=\"#bib36\">Verkhovsky and Borisy, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Verkhovsky et al., 1995</a>), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Besides being the force generator necessary for cell cortex remodeling and actomyosin ring constriction during cytokinesis, there is evidence that myofilaments also contribute to actin filament turnover during cyotkinesis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burgess, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Guha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</a>). In all these processes, the microscopic mechanism of the interaction between individual myofilaments and membrane-bound actin filaments is not understood. Due to the vast complexity of cellular systems, much effort has been spent to investigate the consequences of actin-myosin interactions from the in vitro perspective (<a href=\"#bib3\">Backouche et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Smith et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Schaller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kohler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Soares e Silva et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gordon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Reymann et al., 2012</a>) However, these studies focused on myosin-induced actin structure formation on a mesoscopic scale, rather than on the interaction between actin and individual myofilaments. In addition, membrane-bound minimal actin systems have only recently begun to be functionally reconstituted (<a href=\"#bib38\">Vogel and Schwille, 2012</a>). To fill the gap in understanding individual myofilament\u2013actin interactions, we directly visualized the action of myofilaments on membrane-bound actin filaments in a minimal in vitro system and complemented the experimental findings with a theoretical model."

We used Alexa-488-phalloidin stabilized as well as non-stabilized (data not shown) actin filaments for the MAC composition. By varying the amount of biotinylated lipids present in the lipid bilayer, we have control over the density of the actin layer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In order to understand the origin of contractility observed in cell cortices, we tested the response of the MAC upon addition of myosin motors. Rabbit muscle myosin II was purified and reassembled forming bipolar synthetic myofilaments with a typical length of 500\u2013600 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Time lapse imaging of MACs with various actin densities using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) showed a dynamic rearrangement of the actin filaments, and subsequently the formation of actomyosin foci in an ATP-dependent manner immediately after addition of myofilaments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Movie 1</a>). Actin pattern formation occurred at ATP concentrations between 0.1\u20131 \u00b5M in systems where ATP is enzymatically regenerated (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) in 94% of the experiments (n = 45 experiments). At higher and lower ATP concentrations, actin pattern formation in the MAC is absent. Actin structure formation after ATP depletion has been also reported for experiments using actin and myofilaments in solution (<a href=\"#bib31\">Smith et al., 2007</a>). At low ATP concentrations, myofilaments were predicted to function as active temporary crosslinkers, which may drive self-assembly of actin filaments into actin clusters."

If crosslinking of actin by myofilaments were the only prerequisite for pattern formation, we would expect no (fast) pattern formation in low density MACs, due to the long distances between the actin filaments in relation to the length of myofilaments. Strikingly, myofilament addition to low density MACs displayed breakage events and compaction of actin filaments, resulting in their shortening over time in all experiments (n = 21, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Movie 2</a>). After 20 min, the majority of the actin filaments have been shortened to, on average, half of their original length, and most of the fragments coalesced into single foci (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Movie 2</a>). Note that actin filaments remained intact when imaged in the absence of myofilaments (data not shown). Upon myofilament addition, actin filaments frequently showed deformations prior to actin filament breakage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, yellow arrowheads, <a href=\"#media3\">Movie 3</a>), indicating that force is exerted by the myofilaments and stress along the actin filament may build up until the actin filament breaks. Similarly, recent evidence implied that exposure of actin/fascin bundles to myofilaments can induce their disassembling and severing by an unknown process (<a href=\"#bib3\">Backouche et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Haviv et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Thoresen et al., 2011</a>)."

Subsequently, the fluorescence signal of actin filaments proximal to the breakage site increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, white arrowheads, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The detected increase in the fluorescence intensity of actin filaments implies that actin fragments are further dragged along the remaining actin filaments by the myofilaments during their movement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,D</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Movie 4</a>). We analyzed our TIRFM data in greater detail by tracking single myofilaments during their directed movement along an actin filament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rogers et al., 2007</a>)) and determining the velocity from the trajectories (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, red curve). Simultaneously, the fluorescence intensity in the green (actin) channel of the area occupied by the myofilament during its movement was measured, indicating breakage events as the dragged fragment leads to an increase of fluorescence proximal to the breakage site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, blue and black curve). The velocity fluctuates during the movement of the myofilament along the actin filament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, red curve), whereby acceleration events (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, red arrowheads) are closely followed by an increase in the actin fluorescence, indicating that a breakage event occurred (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, black arrows, blue and black curve). We hypothesize that phases of increasing tension between the ends of the myofilament lead to deformation of the actin filament and coincide with a decrease in velocity, while the phases of tension release immediately after actin filament breakage may result in acceleration of the myofilament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>)."

One end of the myofilament, which we will refer to as the \u2018leading end\u2019, is oriented towards the actin plus end (barbed end), as the filaments in a muscle, and can therefore walk along the actin filament while hydrolyzing ATP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The other end of the myofilament, which we will refer to as the \u2018trailing end\u2019, separated from the leading end by the approximately 160 nm long bare zone (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Khayat et al., 2010</a>) without myosin heads, is oriented in the opposite direction. While the trailing end still interacts with the actin filament, its opposite orientation results in a much slower directed motion towards the actin plus end (<a href=\"#bib33\">Spudich et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sellers and Kachar, 1990</a>). Every myosin head independently follows the biochemical cycle consisting of ATP hydrolysis, binding to actin, powerstroke accompanied by phosphate dissociation, ADP dissociation, ATP binding, and finally detachment from actin ((<a href=\"#bib15\">Howard, 2001</a>), <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). We assume that the heads on the trailing end still interact with the actin filament and go through the same cycle, but either do not perform steps that would lead to a processive motion (probability of making a step p<sub>st</sub>=0), or make steps with a small probability (p<sub>st</sub>=0.1). When a myosin head makes a step (step size d = 5 nm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Howard, 2001</a>)) it tries to move the whole myosin filament towards the actin plus end, but other attached myosin heads are holding it back, thus generating friction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The myofilament trailing end functions mainly as a source of friction (an effective \u2018brake\u2019), but is also moved towards the plus end by the pulling force exerted by the leading end (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Since mainly the leading end is actively moving and the trailing end is either passively pulled (p<sub>st</sub>=0) or contributes only weakly to its own motion (p<sub>st</sub>=0.1), tension builds up within the myofilament, and is transferred onto the actin filament as a compressive force. If sufficiently high, this compressive force can cause buckling, and finally breakage, of the actin filament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). After the breakage, the leading end can move unhindered further towards the plus end, while dragging along the broken-off part of the actin filament attached to the trailing end (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The trailing end can also attach again to the actin and further breakage events on the same filament can follow."

The force needed to buckle and break a filament is F = \u03c0<sup>2</sup> EI/l<sup>2</sup>. With the length l of the myofilament bare zone of 160 nm, this gives a force of 23 pN. Can the tension within the myofilament reach up to this force? We performed simulations of this model, describing the attached myosin head as a spring with a spring constant equal to the myosin head stiffness \u03ba = 1 pN nm<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaya and Higuchi, 2010</a>), and equilibrate all forces after every step and every detachment of a myosin head. From the AFM image of the myofilament (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and the known myofilament structure (<a href=\"#bib41\">Woodhead et al., 2005</a>), we estimated that there are n<sub>m</sub> = 30 interacting myosin heads per filament. The result is a net movement of the whole myofilament towards the actin plus end, with fluctuating tension force, velocity and number of attached myosin heads, the mean values of which depend on the ATP concentration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A,B and 6</a>). We note that the tension force increases with decreasing ATP concentration, reaching forces necessary for breakage only at low (lesser than \u223c3 \u00b5M) ATP concentrations, in agreement with the experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, see also <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). When the actin filament was allowed to bend in simulations at the point where the buckling force of 23 pN was reached (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), thus releasing the excess tension, the filament curvature steadily increased at low ATP concentrations, reaching the critical curvature of breaking of 5.6 \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup> ((<a href=\"#bib2\">Arai et al., 1999</a>), <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). At intermediate ATP concentrations, the actin curvature fluctuated, at times exceeding the curvature threshold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C and 7B</a>). At higher ATP concentrations, the threshold force was reached for too short periods for the filament to be bent to the breakage point (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D and 7C</a>). The results do not depend significantly on whether the myosin heads on the trailing end perform steps (p<sub>st</sub>=0.1) or not (p<sub>st</sub>=0). The simulations thus support the idea that in the ATP concentration range used in the experiments, the differences in the interactions of the trailing and leading ends of the myofilament with actin can generate compressive forces on the actin filament, and that these forces are sufficiently high to bend and break the actin filament."

To bend and break the actin filament, the myofilament has to be attached to the actin for sufficient time, and sufficient force has to be generated, requiring a certain mean number of heads being attached to actin at any given time. Given the small number of interacting myosin heads this translates to a requirement that a large fraction of heads is in the bound state. In our assay this was achieved with low ATP concentrations. It is tempting to speculate that actin breakage by myofilaments in vivo is governed by the ATP level in the cell. Recent evidence exists that ATP levels indeed vary significantly inside living cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Imamura et al., 2009</a>). However, physiological ATP concentrations, derived from methods that provide averaged ATP levels with no high spatial and temporal resolution from cell extracts, are usually found in the millimolar range (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beis and Newsholme, 1975</a>). Here it is important to mention that skeletal muscle myosin II (used in this study) has a lower duty ratio and is therefore less processive than non-muscle myosin in cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harris and Warshaw, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). By lowering the ATP concentration in our assay, we increased the duty ratio of our myofilaments and thereby made them more processive (supplementary text in \u2018Material and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Movie 5</a>), similar to non-muscle myosin, which is in line with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib16\">Humphrey et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Smith et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Soares e Silva et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, processivity of myofilaments in animal cells may be also controlled by phosphorylation of myosin light chains through other proteins that modify the kinetic rates of the biochemical cycle and thereby increase the duty ratio of the myosins shifting the observed behavior to a region of high physiological ATP concentrations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tan et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">DeBiasio et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Matsumura et al., 2001</a>)."

Most importantly, it shows that sufficient force needed to bend and break the actin filament can be generated by a single myofilament, assuming only the difference in the interaction between the leading and trailing myofilament ends (making a step vs not making a step). This result implies that neither actin nor myosin attachment to a support or any other rigid structure is necessary for the observed process. The forces act within a single myofilament. Binding of the actin filaments to the membrane provides confinement of the filaments to a plane, without rigidly tethering the filaments to a support or a scaffold. The motion of actin is only restricted by the effectively higher viscosity of the membrane compared to the buffer solution. The simulation further yields quantitative details of the model, for example, the mean fractions of myosin heads in the six possible states (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), and describes the fluctuations of the actin filament curvature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Other parameters that can be derived from the simulations and could be compared with new experiments include the processivity of myosin, as a function of the ATP concentration, and the dependence of the overall behavior on the length of myofilaments."

We directly show that single myofilaments can interact with actin in such a way that sufficient force can be generated to break the filament, without either the myofilament or the actin being firmly attached to a solid support or scaffold. We suggest that fragmentation and compaction by myofilaments contributes to the observed large-scale pattern formation of actomyosin networks also in other in vitro systems (<a href=\"#bib3\">Backouche et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Smith et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Soares e Silva et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gordon et al., 2012</a>). In vivo breakage of actin bundles has been shown to occur in neuronal growth cones in a myosin II dependent manner, and is thought to be important for recycling actin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Medeiros et al., 2006</a>). We propose that the observed fragmentation and compaction of membrane-bound actin filaments by myosins in our in vitro system may serve as a possible general mechanism for actin turnover and actin cell cortex remodeling."

By assembling myosin motors into filaments, the myofilaments become processive due to the coupling of a higher number of myosin heads that are in contact with the actin filament. In our minimal system directed movement accompanied by actin filament fragmentation only occurred at low ATP concentrations between 0.1\u20131 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Movie 3</a>). The lower ATP concentrations are expected to increase the duration of the actin-bound post-working stroke state of the myosin head, thus increasing the duty ratio and processivity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Howard, 2001</a>). Extremely low ATP concentrations are on the other hand not sufficient for myosin motor activity. To check the effect of ATP concentration on processivity we added Alexa-647 labeled myofilaments to medium density MACs and tracked (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rogers et al., 2007</a>) the movement of individual myofilaments at low (1 \u00b5M) and high (4 mM) ATP concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Movie 5</a>). (Note that fragmentation and compaction of actin filaments only occurred at low ATP concentrations). Comparison of the trajectories illustrates that low ATP trajectories are on average longer than high ATP trajectories indicating a higher processivity at low ATP conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Movie 5</a>). Moreover the number of tracked myofilaments at low ATP concentration with a dwell time greater than 900 ms was more than six times higher than at high ATP concentration suggesting a higher duty ratio at low ATP levels (n = 681 at low ATP, n = 102 at high ATP; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Movie 5</a>). High ATP concentrations therefore lead to a faster detachment of myofilaments from actin filaments than at low ATP concentrations (<a href=\"#media5\">Movie 5</a>). We propose that the increase in processivity due to ATP deprivation is necessary for the processive movement and a prerequisite for fragmentation and compaction of actin filaments."

The six states are schematized in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. Unbound myosin head with ATP (state 1) hydrolyses ATP with the rate k<sub>1</sub> = 100 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (state 2), binds to the actin filament with the rate k<sub>2</sub> = 30 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (state 3), rapidly releases phosphate while performing a powerstroke with rate k<sub>3</sub> = 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (state 4), releases ADP with the rate k<sub>4</sub> = 1000 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (state 5), binds ATP with the rate k<sub>5</sub> = k<sub>t</sub> [ATP], where k<sub>t</sub> = 4 \u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, (state 6), and dissociates from the actin filament with the rate k<sub>6</sub> = 2000 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (state 1). These rates determine the average time the myosin heads spend in every state (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In this simple model the rates are assumed to be independent of the strain of the myosin head. The myosin step size is d = 5 nm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Howard, 2001</a>). The myosin heads of the leading myofilament end always perform a step as a result of the powerstroke between the states 3 and 4. The heads of the trailing end either do not make a step (the probability of making a step p<sub>st</sub>=0), or, in separate simulations, make a step with the probability p<sub>st</sub>=0.1. This value is based on the observations that the trailing myofilament end moves along actin with approximately ten-times slower speed than the leading end (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sellers and Kachar, 1990</a>)."

With four myosin head pairs around the myofilament circumference per every 14.5 nm (<a href=\"#bib41\">Woodhead et al., 2005</a>), there are on average 110 head pairs on each myofilament.

Soft, rectangular silicon cantilevers (CSC38/noAl, Micromash, Tallin, Estonia) with a nominal spring constant of 0.03 N/m were used. The cantilever sensitivity in V/m was determined before each measurement. The spring constant was calibrated by using the thermal fluctuations method. Clean, circular glass cover slips (d = 24 mm, #1.5, Menzel Gl\u00e4ser, Thermo Fisher, Braunschweig, Germany) were hydrophilized by air plasma cleaning. The AFM fluid cell was assembled by using the glass slide and filled with 400 \u00b5l of the reaction buffer. Directly before AFM imaging, myofilaments were diluted with reaction buffer to a concentration of 10 nM. 5 \u00b5L of 10 nM myofilaments in reaction buffer were added to the fluid cell. In experiments with combined AFM and fluorescence imaging, Alexa-488 labeled myofilaments were used. After 15 min incubation most of the myofilaments adhered to the hydrophilic surface, residual non-adherent filaments were removed by washing with reaction buffer. AFM imaging was performed in contact mode with a scan rate of 1 Hz. The imaging forces were kept very low (&lt;0.5 nN) by continuously adjusting the deflection setpoint and using optimized feedback gains. Raw AFM images were line and plane fitted by using the open source software Gwyddion (<a href=\"http://www.gwyddion.net\">www.gwyddion.net</a>)."

Confocal microscopy was performed using a LSM 510 Meta system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 40\u00d7 water immersion objective (C-Apochromat, 40\u00d7/1.2, Carl Zeiss). The 488 nm line of an Argon-ion laser was used to excite the sample. Fluorescence excitation and emission were separated using a microscope build-in dichroic mirror (HFT 488/633) and band pass filter (BP 505\u2013550) in front of the detector. Myofilament length measurement of the AFM images was manually performed with the software Gwyddion. Myofilament length distribution of the confocal images with xy-pixel size of 110 nm was obtained manually using Image J. The accuracy of the length determination based on confocal microscopy was verified by colocalization with AFM images. Identical lengths of the filaments were obtained using both methods (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.99, n = 47) and therefore justified bulk measurements using confocal microscopy."

Actin filament length measurement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) was performed using the NeuronJ Image J plugin, for details see (<a href=\"#bib23\">Meijering et al., 2004</a>). The fluorescence intensity profiles for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> (main text) were obtained using the segmented line tool and plot profile command in Image J. To determine the fluorescence intensity in the area occupied by a myofilament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> [main text]) a custom written macro in Image J was used. In brief, the image sequence in the 647 nm channel of the Alexa-647 labeled myofilament (red) was converted to 8-bit, binarized by using a threshold filter and an area selection (corresponding to the myofilament) for each binary image was created. The mean fluorescence intensity in the corresponding 488 nm channel images of the Alexa-488-phalloidin labeled actin filaments (green) was computed in the selected area. Smoothing of intensity profiles in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> was conducted using a sliding-average smoothing algorithm (interval 2 s) implemented in Igor Pro."

Given the small number of interacting myosin heads, this translates into a requirement that a large fraction of heads is in the bound state. In our assay, this was achieved at low ATP concentrations. Here, it is important to mention that skeletal muscle myosin has a lower duty ratio and is therefore less processive than non-muscle myosin in cells (Harris De at. al 1993; Wang et. al. 2003). By lowering the ATP concentration in our assay, we increased the duty ratio of our myofilaments and thereby made them more processive (Figure 5, Movie 5), similar to non-muscle myosin, which is in line with previous studies (Soares et. al. 2011; Smith et. al. 2007; Humphrey et. al. 2002)."

Changing the ATP concentration will change the average residence time of the individual heads in the six states of the motor cycle. As stated by the reviewers, a low ATP concentration will increase the number of heads in the rigor state (corresponding to state 5 in Figure 8). However, this state is a part of the biochemical motor cycle, and a higher population of heads in state 5 does not indicate that these heads are \u2018inactive\u2019, but describes the fact that individual filaments populate the fifth (rigor) state longer (in temporal average) before proceeding to the next state. Hence, all heads are active and only the distribution of states in the motor cycle changes. To further illustrate this aspect, the mean fractions of heads in the individual states are now shown in the new Figure 9."

In this study, it was observed that some filaments broke into fragments after they bound to the myosin-coated surface. In contrast to our assay, in these experiments filaments broke at high (1 mM) ATP concentrations, and condensation into foci was not observed. Moreover, the surface density of bound myofilaments had to be high, as actin filaments break less frequently on a low-density myosin substratum. This suggests that breakage of actin filaments in their study occurred because of interaction with at least two or multiple myofilaments. Last, their myofilaments are fixed to a support, while our myofilaments are not tethered to a support."

We directly show that single myofilaments can interact with actin in such a way that sufficient force can be generated to break the filament, without either the myofilament or the actin being firmly attached to a solid support or scaffold. Note that membrane-anchored actin exhibits lateral diffusion on the membrane. <i>In vivo</i> myosin localization may indeed depend on certain domains of the myosin protein but does not necessarily imply that myosin is physically fixed to the cell membrane or any rigid scaffold. It is more likely that myosin interacts <i>in vivo</i> with other cortical proteins that help to maintain their cortical (equatorial) localization in cells (Piekny et al., 2008). Typically protein\u2013protein interactions are transient and can be best described by attachment and detachment rates.
