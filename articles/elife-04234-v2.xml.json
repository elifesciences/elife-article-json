The mechanism by which the passenger domain is secreted is poorly understood. Here we show that a conserved OM protein insertase (the Bam complex) and a molecular chaperone (SurA) are both necessary and sufficient to promote the complete assembly of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 autotransporter EspP in vitro. Our results indicate that the membrane integration of the \u03b2 domain is the rate-limiting step in autotransporter assembly and that passenger domain translocation does not require the input of external energy. Furthermore, experiments using nanodiscs strongly suggest that autotransporter assembly is catalyzed by a single copy of the Bam complex. Finally, we describe a method to purify a highly active form of the Bam complex that should facilitate the elucidation of its function."

Autotransporters are single polypeptides that consist of two domains, an N-terminal domain (\u2018passenger domain\u2019) that is exposed on the cell surface and that often mediates a virulence function, and a C-terminal domain (\u2018\u03b2 domain\u2019) that resides in the outer membrane (OM). Following their translocation across the OM, many passenger domains are released from the cell surface by a proteolytic cleavage. Passenger domains vary widely in sequence and size (\u223c20\u2013400 kD), but almost always form an unusual repetitive structure known as a \u03b2 helix (<a href=\"#bib21\">Junker et al., 2006</a>). \u03b2 domains are typically \u223c30 kD in size and, like the vast majority of bacterial integral OM proteins, fold into a \u03b2 barrel structure. While the sequences of \u03b2 domains are also very heterogeneous, the structures of all of the \u03b2 domains that have been solved to date are nearly superimposable (<a href=\"#bib29\">Oomen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barnard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van den Berg, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhai et al., 2011</a>). After autotransporters are translocated across the inner membrane (IM) through the Sec complex they interact with molecular chaperones that presumably maintain them in an assembly-competent state (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ruiz-Perez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ieva et al., 2011</a>). Subsequently the \u03b2 domain is targeted to the Bam complex, an essential heterooligomer consisting of an integral OM protein (BamA) and four lipoproteins (BamBCDE) that catalyzes the membrane insertion of \u03b2 barrel proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Voulhoux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sauri et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hagan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ieva et al., 2011</a>). X-ray crystallographic analysis suggests that the BamA \u03b2 barrel domain is unstable and may open laterally to allow the escape of client proteins into the lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib28\">Noinaj et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2014</a>)."

Based on the observation that deletion of the \u03b2 domain abolishes passenger domain translocation, it was originally proposed that the \u03b2 domain serves as the transport channel for the passenger domain (whence the name \u2018autotransporter\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pohlner et al., 1987</a>). At first glance, this hypothesis seems to be supported by crystallographic studies showing that upon completion of translocation the two domains are connected by an \u03b1-helical linker that is embedded inside the \u03b2 domain pore (<a href=\"#bib29\">Oomen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barnard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van den Berg, 2010</a>). The same studies, however, revealed that the \u03b2 domain pore is only \u223c10 \u00c5 in diameter. Because the directionality of translocation presumably requires the formation of a C-terminal hairpin followed by the sliding of medial and N-terminal segments past a static strand, both strands of the hairpin would have to be in a fully extended conformation to fit inside the pore. On the contrary, available evidence indicates that the polypeptide that resides inside the \u03b2 domain forms an \u03b1 helix prior to the completion of translocation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ieva et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Peterson et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, small folded polypeptides have been shown to be secreted efficiently by the autotransporter pathway and a subset of naturally occurring passenger domains undergo disulfide bonding in the periplasm (<a href=\"#bib39\">Skillman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jong et al., 2007</a>). Finally, BamA has been shown to interact with the passenger domain during the translocation reaction (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</a>). While the \u03b2 domain does appear to play a role in translocation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Saur\u00ed et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlova et al., 2013</a>), these and other results strongly suggest that autotransporter assembly is more complex than originally envisioned. In one scenario, the Bam complex might facilitate the membrane insertion of the \u03b2 domain and the translocation of the passenger domain in a concerted reaction, but it is also possible that other factors are also required to transport the passenger domain across the OM."

                        "text": "The energy source for passenger domain translocation has also remained poorly understood. Although most protein translocation reactions require external energy in the form of ATP or a membrane potential, the periplasm is devoid of ATP and there is no membrane potential across the bacterial OM. It is conceivable that an IM protein that derives energy from the hydrolysis of cytoplasmic ATP or from the electrochemical gradient across the IM interacts with the passenger domain and drives translocation, but such a protein has never been identified. To explain the energetics of secretion, it has been proposed that the sequential folding of segments of the \u03b2 helix in the extracellular space drives translocation and prevents retrograde movement into the periplasm (<a href=\"#bib25\">Klauser et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Junker et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with this vectorial folding model, mutations that impair the folding of C-terminal segments of two different passenger domains significantly reduce the efficiency of secretion (<a href=\"#bib31\">Peterson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Renn et al., 2012</a>). Mutations that perturb the folding of medial and N-terminal segments of the passenger domain, however, produce only a modest translocation defect (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kang\u2019ethe and Bernstein, 2013b</a>). Furthermore, the intrinsically disordered receptor domain (RD) of the <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> RTX toxin has been shown to be secreted efficiently by the autotransporter pathway (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kang\u2019ethe and Bernstein, 2013a</a>). Interestingly, the presence of a large number of acidic residues is critical for the secretion of the RD. This observation, together with the finding that naturally occurring passenger domains are predominantly acidic, suggests that charge interactions may play a significant role in driving the translocation reaction."

In our experiments, we used the <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 autotransporter EspP, as a model protein. Following the completion of translocation, the passenger domain of EspP and other members of the SPATE (<span class=\"underline\">serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae</span>) family is released in an unusual intrabarrel cleavage reaction that requires accurate folding of the \u03b2 domain and precise positioning of the passenger domain-\u03b2 domain junction (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dautin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barnard et al., 2012</a>). Although it was previously shown that the insertion of small <i>E. coli</i> \u03b2 barrel proteins such as OmpT and OmpA into proteoliposomes can be catalyzed by the purified Bam complex and the periplasmic chaperone SurA (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hagan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hagan and Kahne, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hagan et al., 2013</a>), we did not observe assembly of EspP using the same methodology. Using an alternative expression and purification strategy, however, we obtained an apparently more active form of the Bam complex that, together with SurA, was both necessary and sufficient to promote the membrane integration of the EspP \u03b2 domain and the translocation and cleavage of the EspP passenger domain. Remarkably, passenger domain translocation did not require the input of any additional energy. In addition to defining the minimal set of factors required for autotransporter assembly, our work provides a valuable resource for future studies on the function of the Bam complex and its role in the biogenesis of the broader class of OM proteins."

The native EspP passenger domain is 968 residues in length (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), but a derivative that contains only 26 residues of the \u223c28 residue C-terminal segment that reside inside the \u03b2 domain in an \u03b1-helical conformation (EspP\u03945) is assembled as efficiently as the wild-type protein in vivo (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlova et al., 2013</a>). The modification or deletion of residues in the \u03b1-helical segment, however, can profoundly perturb the folding and integration of the \u03b2 domain into the OM and/or the proteolytic release of the passenger domain, which requires precise alignment of the cleavage junction with key catalytic residues (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dautin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ieva et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barnard et al., 2012</a>). Because EspP\u03945 and other derivatives that expose no more than a short segment on the cell surface are structurally similar to generic \u03b2 barrel proteins such as OmpT, it might be expected that they would have similar assembly requirements. Indeed any autotransporter-specific assembly factors might only be required once the passenger domain reaches a threshold size. Based on this reasoning, we first analyzed the assembly of an EspP derivative designated EspP(46+\u03b2) that consists of EspP\u03945 plus 20 N-terminal residues derived from the cloning vector (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We expected that the accurate assembly of EspP(46+\u03b2) would result in the proteolytic release of the 46 residue passenger domain and the accumulation of a folded \u223c30 kD \u03b2 domain that, as previously shown, is resistant to SDS denaturation unless heated (<a href=\"#bib39\">Skillman et al., 2005</a>)."

In this assay, <i>E. coli</i> BamAB and BamCDE are first expressed and isolated independently. The two subcomplexes are then mixed together to form a holocomplex and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. In the presence of the proteoliposomes and a molar excess of SurA, denatured OmpT folds into a stable structure that is enzymatically active and resistant to SDS denaturation. We attempted to express and purify the Bam complex exactly as described, but for reasons that are unclear we did not observe efficient formation of the Bam holocomplex unless we purified BamAB through an additional step. Nevertheless, we ultimately obtained a single peak on a gel filtration column that was highly enriched in the reconstructed complex, which we designated Bam(AB)(CDE) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). After the peak fractions were pooled, most of the Bam holocomplex could be reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Subsequently we purified SurA to homogeneity as described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hagan et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To assess the folding of OmpT, we used an activity assay in which the cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity over time. Consistent with previous results, we observed a fluorescent signal when OmpT was incubated in the presence of Bam(AB)(CDE) and SurA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, purple curve). EspP(46+\u03b2) purified from inclusion bodies (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was mixed with the same components, and the proteolytic maturation of the protein was assessed by Western blotting using an antiserum against an EspP C-terminal peptide. No free \u03b2 domain was detected, however, even after a prolonged incubation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

An octahistidine tag was introduced at the C-terminus of BamE to facilitate Bam complex purification. All of the proteins co-eluted on gel filtration columns (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). This observation strongly suggests that Bam holocomplexes were formed efficiently in vivo. When the peak fractions were pooled and analyzed by Blue Native PAGE, a single band that migrated slightly slower than the 242 kDa marker was seen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The Bam complex is only \u223c200 kDa, but it has previously been shown to migrate slower than its actual molecular weight on Blue Native gels (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hagan et al., 2013</a>). In the presence of <i>E. coli</i> phospolipids, almost all of the purified protein, which we designated BamABCDE, could be reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Remarkably, the intensity of the fluorescent signal in the fluorogenic peptide cleavage assay indicated that OmpT folded much more efficiently in the presence of BamABCDE than Bam(AB)(CDE) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, compare green and purple curves). These results suggested that the activity of the Bam complex is optimized when all of the subunits are expressed together."

The urea-denatured EspP derivative was incubated at 30\u00b0C with proteoliposomes containing the Bam complex and SurA, and samples were removed at various time points. Folding of the protein and subsequent proteolytic maturation were monitored by Western blot using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum and a fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody. A rapidly migrating (\u223c27 kD) band that corresponds to the folded form of the free EspP \u03b2 domain appeared within 5 min and was more prominent at later time points when the samples were not heated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). When the samples were heated, a much more intense \u223c30 kD band that corresponds to the unfolded \u03b2 domain was observed. This marked difference in intensity has been observed previously (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barnard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlova et al., 2013</a>) and presumably results from the occlusion of the C-terminal epitope in the folded form of the \u03b2 domain. No proteolytic processing was observed if either SurA or BamABCDE was omitted from the reaction or if BamAB or BamCDE subomplexes were used in place of the holocomplex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Single plasmids were also used to produce Bam complexes that lack either BamB or BamC, but curiously only \u223c50\u201370% of the purified partial complexes could be reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). BamABDE and BamACDE both promoted the assembly EspP(46+\u03b2), but less effectively than BamABCDE (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Finally, the addition of purified Skp to reactions containing BamABCDE and SurA inhibited EspP(46+\u03b2) assembly (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and ATP (0.1 mM) blocked assembly altogether (data not shown)."

The efficiency of assembly did not appear to be limited by the concentration of either reconstituted BamABCDE or SurA. A moderate increase in efficiency was observed when the BamABCDE concentration was increased from 0.05 \u03bcM to 0.2 \u03bcM (the concentration used in the experiments described here), but no increase was observed at higher concentrations (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>).

To this end, we expressed and purified EspP derivatives that contain progressively longer portions of the native passenger domain plus 20 N-terminal residues derived from the cloning vector (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because proteolytic maturation of EspP is absolutely dependent on the completion of passenger domain translocation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Peterson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlova et al., 2013</a>), we initially assessed translocation by monitoring the appearance of the cleaved \u03b2 domain. Indeed available evidence strongly suggests that the completion of \u03b2 domain assembly (and the assembly of the active site) is a late event in autotransporter biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ieva et al., 2011</a>), possibly because the \u03b2 domain forms at least part of the passenger domain transport channel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As Western blot analysis using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum indicated, EspP derivatives that have passenger domains ranging in size from 72\u2013734 residues were all processed with approximately the same efficiency as EspP(46+\u03b2) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The largest derivative lacks the N-terminal globular segment of the EspP passenger domain, but contains the entire \u03b2 helical segment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These results not only suggest that BamABCDE and SurA are sufficient to promote passenger domain translocation, but also suggest that the passenger domain does not readily adopt a translocation-incompetent conformation that independently limits the efficiency of autotransporter assembly."

Initially we found that after incubating EspP(96+\u03b2) with proteoliposomes containing BamABCDE and SurA for 30 min, the cleaved \u03b2 domain was both subject to heat denaturation in SDS and resistant to proteinase K (PK) digestion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This result provided direct evidence that the \u03b2 domain was not only properly folded, but also inserted into the proteoliposomes. Subsequently we examined the assembly of EspP*(96+\u03b2), a non-cleavable version of EspP(96+\u03b2), under the same conditions. In the absence of PK, a band that migrates slower than the folded \u03b2 domain (\u223c35 kDa vs \u223c27 kDa) and that corresponds to the folded form of the full-length protein was observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The finding that the \u223c35 kDa polypeptide was resistant to PK digestion unless detergent was added showed that the passenger domain was translocated into the lumen of the proteoliposomes. We also performed an initial analysis of the assembly of EspP(HA-251+\u03b2), a derivative that contains 251 residues of the EspP passenger domain plus an N-terminal HA tag (14 additional residues). After we incubated the protein with proteoliposomes containing BamABCDE and SurA we detected the \u03b2 domain and the cleaved passenger domain on Western blots probed with anti-EspP C-terminal and anti-HA antisera, respectively, and both fragments were resistant to PK digestion unless detergent was added (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Because the epitope tag is the last segment of the protein that traverses the membrane, these results confirm that the translocation reaction went to completion."

We used 0.2 \u03bcM substrate in these experiments because we found that doubling the EspP concentration moderately increased the efficiency of assembly. As suggested by a study on OmpT, the enhancement of assembly might be a fortuitous effect of increasing the concentration of urea, which presumably helps to maintain the folding-competence of the substrate (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hagan and Kahne, 2011</a>). Western blot analysis using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum showed that EspP(46+\u03b2) underwent substantial proteolytic processing within 2 min (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, top and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, blue curve). Interestingly, EspP(HA-251+\u03b2) was processed at a very similar rate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, blue curve). Indeed the rate constants obtained by fitting the assembly data for the two EspP derivatives to either a single exponential or two-step model were nearly identical (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In the case of the EspP(HA-251+\u03b2) derivative, a PK-resistant \u223c30 kD polypeptide that corresponds to the cleaved passenger domain accumulated in parallel with the cleaved \u03b2 domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, top). This observation confirmed that the passenger domain was translocated into the lumen of the proteoliposomes during the assembly reaction. We also introduced a mutation (G1066A) that slightly impairs folding of the \u03b2 domain and thereby delays the initiation of passenger domain translocation by \u223c1 min in vivo (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlova et al., 2013</a>) into EspP(46+\u03b2) and EspP(HA-251+\u03b2). The mutation caused a similar delay in the assembly of both EspP derivatives in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

A PK-resistant \u223c80 kDa polypeptide that corresponds to the cleaved passenger domain accumulated during the assembly reaction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). As expected, this polypeptide was degraded when the proteoliposomes were solubilized with detergent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Taken together, the results indicate that passenger domain translocation is relatively fast, and that the assembly of the \u03b2 domain is the rate-limiting step in autotransporter biogenesis. Curiously, the introduction of a short linker into EspP(HA-714+\u03b2) that impairs passenger domain folding and stalls translocation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</a>) only modestly affected assembly in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This observation, along with the finding that an EspP chimera containing a &gt;200 residue intrinsically disordered passenger domain segment that is secreted efficiently in vivo could also assemble in the in vitro assay (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggests that in the absence of an exogenous energy source translocation is not driven exclusively by protein folding."

Furthermore, given that autotransporter assembly is inherently more complicated than the assembly of generic \u03b2 barrel proteins, it is conceivable that the Bam complex exists in a distinctive oligomeric state during its interaction with autotransporters. To determine whether a single copy of the Bam complex can mediate the assembly of EspP derivatives, we reconstituted BamABCDE into \u223c10\u201312 nm nanodiscs using conditions that facilitate the incorporation of a single copy of the ABC transporter MalFGK<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bao et al., 2012</a>). The nanodiscs eluted at about the same position on gel filtration columns as BamABCDE monomers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Analysis of the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE suggested that the scaffold protein MSP1D1 was present in excess over the Bam complex proteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Because nanodiscs are stabilized by two copies of the scaffold protein (<a href=\"#bib11\">Denisov et al., 2004</a>), however, this observation is consistent with the prediction that they contained a single copy of the Bam complex. In addition, the nanodiscs produced a single band on Blue Native PAGE that migrated only slightly slower than a BamABCDE monomer (compare <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a> to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Western blot analysis using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum revealed that both EspP(46+\u03b2) and EspP(HA-251+\u03b2) were assembled into nanodiscs about as efficiently as they were assembled into proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Although the non-vesicular nature of nanodiscs precluded assessment of passenger domain translocation using a PK-sensitivity assay, we found that the \u223c30 kDa passenger domain of EspP(HA-251+\u03b2) accumulated in parallel with the cleaved \u03b2 domain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These results not only provide evidence that a Bam complex monomer is sufficient to catalyze autotransporter assembly, but also show that the curvature of the proteoliposome membrane is not itself required for the assembly process."

Initially we showed that the Bam complex reconstituted into proteoliposomes and SurA and both necessary and sufficient to catalyze the folding and proteolytic processing of a simplified version of EspP that consists of the \u03b2 domain plus a short passenger domain fragment that protrudes only slightly from the \u03b2 domain pore. This derivative is similar to generic \u03b2 barrel proteins such as OmpT that reside almost entirely in the OM, except that it contains an internal \u03b1-helical segment. In subsequent experiments we found that the same two factors are sufficient to catalyze the translocation of passenger domain fragments associated with much larger EspP derivatives. Interestingly, the efficiency and kinetics of assembly was largely independent of the length of the derivative. While this observation does not exclude the possibility that there are other factors that stimulate passenger domain secretion in vivo, it does suggest that they would either play a limited role in the translocation reaction per se or serve to prevent misfolding in the crowded periplasmic space. Finally, experiments using nanodiscs provided evidence that EspP assembly is catalyzed by a single copy of the Bam complex. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which the passenger domain is secreted through a channel consisting of the open \u03b2 domain and/or the BamA \u03b2 barrel in an open conformation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

The results are surprising because ATP hydrolysis is required to drive protein translocation through the Sec complex in an analogous reconstituted assay system (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brundage et al., 1990</a>) and because other types of protein translocation reactions appear to require a significant energy expenditure (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alder and Theg, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shi and Theg, 2013</a>). The high energy cost may result in part from a tendency of proteins to slide backwards at specific stages of the translocation reaction (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schiebel et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bauer et al., 2014</a>). In the autotransporter pathway, the folding of the passenger domain in the extracellular space has been shown to play a role in driving translocation in vivo, and folding may also promote translocation in the in vitro assay. Available evidence, however, neither supports the notion that stepwise folding alone drives translocation nor explains the efficient secretion of the intrinsically disordered RD domain or polypeptides that fold in the periplasm. As previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kang\u2019ethe and Bernstein, 2013a</a>), electrostatic or other types of interactions between passenger domains and the Bam complex or membrane lipids may facilitate translocation. Like the FimD protein that secretes type I pilus subunits, the Bam complex might also guide passenger domains along a low-energy pathway (<a href=\"#bib12\">Geibel et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively, the Bam complex might catalyze at least the initial stages of translocation and the assembly of the \u03b2 domain in a concerted fashion. Indeed a model in which a polypeptide segment is pushed across the membrane during the membrane integration of the \u03b2 domain might explain the efficient secretion of \u223c100 residue fragments that are too short to fold (<a href=\"#bib39\">Skillman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlova, et al., 2013</a>). While the coupling of translocation to \u03b2 domain assembly might also explain the assembly of a folding-deficient mutant such as EspP(HA-714+\u03b2)586TEV in vitro, the observation that stalled translocation reactions can be restarted in vivo (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</a>; JHP and HDB, unpublished results) strongly suggests that energy can be harnessed after the insertion of the \u03b2 domain is largely complete."

Pulse-chase labeling and photocrosslinking experiments have previously provided evidence that \u03b2 domain assembly is slower than passenger domain translocation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ieva et al., 2011</a>), but the interpretation of these experiments is complicated by the fact that the synthesis of the 1300 residue EspP protein is itself rather slow (\u223c45 s). The use of fully synthesized EspP derivatives in the in vitro assay has enabled us to circumvent this problem and assess the contribution of the translocation step to the overall reaction kinetics more effectively. It is noteworthy that the ability of the \u03b2 domain to remain assembly-competent also appeared to limit the efficiency of the assembly reaction. This observation corroborates the conclusion that even long passenger domain segments fold slowly and consequently resist aggregation, at least in vitro (<a href=\"#bib21\">Junker et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, given that the \u03b2 domain clearly interacts with Skp in vivo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ieva et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlova et al., 2013</a>), it is striking that the presence of the chaperone inhibited assembly in vitro. Presumably we could not recapitulate the productive interaction between Skp and the \u03b2 domain that occurs in vivo, or a factor that is required to release Skp from client proteins was not present (or was present but not fully functional) in our assay."

It is striking that, at least in our hands, BamABCDE was more active than Bam(AB)(CDE). While this disparity may simply be due to technical issues, our results also raise the possibility that the structure of the Bam complex assembled in vivo differs from that of the Bam complex reconstructed from BamAB and BamCDE subcomplexes in vitro. Indeed it is conceivable that while a stable heterooligomer can be formed from the two subcomplexes, the Bam complex is actually assembled by a different pathway inside living cells. In this regard it should be noted that in preliminary experiments we obtained evidence that the Bam complex remains intact in vivo and does not undergo a dynamic cycle in which BamAB and BamCDE subcomplexes rapidly dissocate and reassociate (JHP and HDB, unpublished results)."

To generate plasmid pJH113, a new Nde I site was introduced into the polylinker of a derivative of pTRC99a that lacks the endogenous Nde I site (<a href=\"#bib40\">Szabady et al., 2005</a>) using the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with the oligonucleotide pTRC/Nde and its complement (all oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). The genes that encode all five subunits of the Bam complex were then cloned sequentially into pJH113 to create plasmid pJH114. Each gene was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from <i>E. coli</i> strain AD202 as a template (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama and Ito, 1990</a>). <i>BamA</i> was first cloned into the Nde I and BamH I sites of pJH113, and the other genes were then cloned into the BamH I site of the resulting plasmid. In the final round of cloning an octahistidine tag was added to the C terminus of BamE during PCR amplification. Plasmids pJH115, pJH116 and pJH117, which encode BamACDE(His<sub>8</sub>), BamABDE(His<sub>8</sub>), and BamCDE(His<sub>8</sub>), respectively, were constructed in the same fashion except that one or more of the cloning steps were omitted. Plasmid pJH118, which encodes (His<sub>6</sub>)BamAB, was made by first introducing an Eag I site into pJH113-<i>bamA</i> using oligonucleotide BamA.Eag(+) and its complement. A hexahistidine tag was then introduced at the N-terminus of the mature region of BamA using oligonucleotides BamAHis(+) and BamAHis(\u2212). Finally, a Kpn I-Xba I fragment encoding the C-terminus of BamA and BamB was excised from pJH113-<i>bamAB</i> and cloned into the cognate sites of this plasmid.

To assess the sensitivity of the EspP \u03b2 domain to SDS denaturation, half of each sample was heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min while the other half was maintained at room temperature. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose using an iBlot apparatus (Life Technologies). Western blotting was conducted using antisera generated against an EspP C-terminal peptide (<a href=\"#bib40\">Szabady et al., 2005</a>) or the HA (Y-11) peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Antibody-antigen complexes were detected by incubating filters with an IRDye 680-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum and monitoring fluorescence at 700 nM using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Licor, Lincoln, NE). Percent substrate cleavage at each time point was defined as 100 \u00d7 (cleaved \u03b2 domain/unprocessed substrate + cleaved \u03b2 domain)."

The advance in this paper lies partially in its technical aspects and partially in the conceptual insights. The technical advance relates to the optimization of highly functional Bam complex purification and reconstitution, while the conceptual advances relate to defining the minimal factors for autotransporter assembly and resolving key issues such as lack of an energy requirement. There is little to criticize about the experiments shown in this study, and the technical advance should now make it possible to perform detailed mechanistic analysis, for example by applying biophysical assays for different steps and interactions in the pathway. The insights into autotransporter assembly appear to largely support contemporary models based on earlier in vivo and structural work."

This architecture led to models postulating that the beta-barrel domain was the translocator for the passenger domain and that the folding of the passenger domain drove translocation. The dependence of autotransporter biogenesis on the Bam (beta-barrel assembly machine) complex shifted the field of autotransporter biogenesis away from these models. Recently, the Bernstein lab has proposed a model stating that the beta-barrel domain is inserted in the outer membrane by the Bam complex and that the translocation of the passenger domain involves Bam and an intermediate in the folding of the beta-barrel domain. Furthermore, they have also proposed that the energy driving translocation is provided in part by the folding of the passenger domains and uncharacterized interactions involving acidic residues in the passenger domain. Much of this model is based on cross-linking experiments, which can be hard to interpret. In addition, it was not clear if other factors assist in this process. Here, using an in vitro reconstitution system, the Bernstein lab shows that the chaperone SurA and the Bam complex are required and sufficient for the assembly of the EspP autotransporter into proteoliposomes and nanodiscs. This is a major accomplishment and a significant contribution to the field that can be used to study the mechanistic details of autotransporter biogenesis. Indeed, the authors perform kinetic measurements and conclude that the assembly of the beta-barrel domain is the rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of this autotransporter. These findings are consistent with their aforementioned model of translocation of the passenger domain occurring during the assembly of the beta-domain."

Their new method is based on the co-expression and co-purification of all 5 components of the Bam complex, as opposed to the separate expression of two sub-complexes of two and three Bam members that are later assembled together. It is clear that in their hands their new method yields a more active Bam complex. I assume this is a reproducible finding across different preparations, but I am not sure if this is a lab-specific phenomenon or not. I agree with the two possible explanations (technical issue vs biological significant) given in the last paragraph of the Discussion, although I recommend the authors remove the last sentence as it is based on being unable to detect something. Their comparison of the two methods should remain in the manuscript but I suggest that the authors tone down the development of a novel method (for example, remove the last sentence of the Abstract)."

The authors describe a method for producing a purified Bam complex that has increased function over Bam complexes produced using previous purification/reconstitution methods. They use this Bam complex with purified SurA to demonstrate that these proteins are sufficient for assembly of EspP proteins into proteoliposomes and PK-digestion experiments provide evidence that the passenger domains are translocated across the membranes. The results demonstrate that no external energy is needed for the assembly/translocation process. The results are supported by experiments using nanodiscs and the nanodisc experiments provide compelling evidence that a single copy of the Bam complex is sufficient to translocate EspP. The manuscript is extremely well written and easy to follow, which is especially commendable given the complexity of the experiments and the data. The experimental design is appropriate for the questions being addressed, appropriate controls were included, and conclusions drawn were justified by the data. The results represent a large step forward in understanding how proteins of the autotransporter family are inserted into the outer membrane in their proper orientation and in membrane protein biogenesis in general. The results, and the approaches used in this manuscript, will be of interest to a broad audience."

However, here, two proteins that show altered or impaired translocation in vivo are able to be assembled/translocated in vitro almost as efficiently as 'wild-type' proteins.

Their new method is based on the co-expression and co-purification of all 5 components of the Bam complex, as opposed to the separate expression of two sub-complexes of two and three Bam members that are later assembled together. It is clear that in their hands their new method yields a more active Bam complex. I assume this is a reproducible finding across different preparations, but I am not sure if this is a lab-specific phenomenon or not. I agree with the two possible explanations (technical issue vs biological significant) given in the last paragraph of the Discussion, although I recommend the authors remove the last sentence as it is based on being unable to detect something. Their comparison of the two methods should remain in the manuscript but I suggest that the authors tone down the development of a novel method (for example, remove the last sentence of the Abstract)</i>."

The experimental design is appropriate for the questions being addressed, appropriate controls were included, and conclusions drawn were justified by the data.

We found that only one EspP derivative that was assembled in the in vitro assay shows impaired translocation in vivo [EspP(HA-714+\u03b2)TEV586]. The second protein that the reviewer alludes to (the RD-EspP chimera) is assembled efficiently in vivo. We have now revised the text to clarify this point. Although we discuss the behavior of EspP(HA-714+\u03b2)TEV586 in the in vitro assay, we really do not know why the linker insertion exerts a stronger effect on the assembly of this EspP derivative in vivo. Of course our assay, like any in vitro assay, may not perfectly replicate all aspects of a biological process. As we note, our results suggest that a factor (or perhaps an activity of SurA or the Bam complex) that promotes the dissociation of EspP from the molecular chaperone Skp in vivo may be missing from the current assay system."
