These enzymes rely on \u201ccofactors\u201d to perform their chemistry: the most widely studied of these cofactors contains iron and molybdenum, and hence is called the FeMo-cofactor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Despite the fact that nitrogenase activity was discovered in 1934, a comprehensive understanding of how it works has remained elusive due to the intrinsic complexity of both the FeMo-cofactor and the nitrogen fixation reaction (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hoffman et al., 2014</a>). Now, in eLife, Thomas Spatzal, Kathryn Perez, James Howard and Douglas Rees report that\u00a0some of the atoms that make up the FeMo-cofactor migrate in unexpected ways during catalysis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Spatzal et al., 2015</a>)."

The molybdenum-iron protein is home to the FeMo-cofactor and a cluster of iron and sulfur atoms that transfers electrons between the iron protein and the FeMo-cofactor. During the reaction cycle, the FeMo-cofactor orchestrates the reduction of two distinct substrates, N<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup>, and allocates hydrogen atoms into products (NH<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>). Elucidating a detailed mechanism for this process is important for understanding how molybdenum nitrogenase is able to achieve this challenging chemical transformation."

Unexpectedly, this structure revealed that carbon monoxide replaces the sulfur atom at the S2B position in the FeMo-cofactor; this atom is one of three \"belt sulfurs\" that form bridges between pairs of iron atoms in the cofactor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Significantly, this process is reversible; reactivated molybdenum-iron protein was shown to once again contain sulfur in the S2B position. These structures serve to shed light on substrate binding in molybdenum nitrogenase and suggest a previously unanticipated kinetic instability, or lability, of the FeMo-cofactor."

Selenocyanate is a compound that contains selenium, and has recently been identified as a substrate and inhibitor of nitrogenase. Spatzal, Perez et al. therefore used X-ray crystallography to identify changes in the molybdenum-iron protein after nitrogenase had reacted with selenocyanate. In particular, they used the fact that selenium scatters X-rays differently from sulfur to confirm that selenium replaces sulfur at the S2B position, further strengthening the notion that S2B is a labile element in the FeMo-cofactor."

Taking a series of crystallographic snapshots of the selenium-containing cofactor at different stages of catalysis revealed that under turnover conditions, selenium migrates to the other two belt-sulfur positions. Selenium is then replaced by sulfur after reacting with multiple substrates. However, this migration of selenium is only observed when N<sub>2</sub> or acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) are used as substrates, and not when H<sup>+</sup> is the exclusive substrate."

Already this method has allowed us to see selenium waltzing around the FeMo-cofactor center, and it is hard to imagine what surprises this enzyme has in store for us next."
