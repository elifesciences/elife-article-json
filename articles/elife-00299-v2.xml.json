We carried out an integrative, longitudinal study combining genetic, transcriptional, and immunologic data in humans given seasonal influenza vaccine. We identified 20 genes exhibiting a transcriptional response to vaccination, significant genotype effects on gene expression, and correlation between the transcriptional and antibody responses. The results show that variation at the level of genes involved in membrane trafficking and antigen processing significantly influences the human response to influenza vaccination. More broadly, we demonstrate that an integrative study design is an efficient alternative to existing methods for the identification of genes involved in complex traits."

We carried out an integrative, longitudinal study combining genetic, transcriptional, and immunologic data in humans given seasonal influenza vaccine. We identified 20 genes exhibiting a transcriptional response to vaccination, significant genotype effects on gene expression, and correlation between the transcriptional and antibody responses. The results show that variation at the level of genes involved in membrane trafficking and antigen processing significantly influences the human response to influenza vaccination. More broadly, we demonstrate that an integrative study design is an efficient alternative to existing methods for the identification of genes involved in complex traits."

By presenting a weakened (or dead) form of a pathogen, or its toxins or surface proteins, to the immune system, vaccines trigger the production of antibodies against the virus or microorganism. If a vaccinated individual then encounters the pathogen, their immune system should be able to recognize and destroy it. Many vaccines also include a secondary agent, known as an adjuvant, to further stimulate the immune response."

Seasonal epidemics occur each year affecting 2\u20137% of the population. According to the World Health Organization, influenza leads to nearly 5 million hospitalizations each year and causes up to half a million deaths. Vaccination is a primary strategy for the prevention of seasonal influenza, but responses to the vaccine vary markedly, partly because of variation in the genetic makeup or genotype of individuals. However, the details of how genes influence response to vaccination, and indeed susceptibility to influenza, remain unclear."

They identified 20 genes that contributed to differential immune responses to the vaccine. Almost half of these encode proteins that are not specifically associated with the immune system, but have more general roles in processes such as membrane trafficking and intracellular transport."

Attempts at immunization pre-dated the isolation of the virus from humans in 1933 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Smith et al., 1933</a>) and vaccination remains the cornerstone of prevention strategies. Since 1977, strains of influenza A (H3N2), influenza A (H1N1), and influenza B have been responsible for the majority of documented human infections and trivalent vaccines are updated annually to contain the circulating strains. Animal models have demonstrated that immune responses and susceptibility to influenza infection can be strongly influenced by host genetic factors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Trammell and Toth, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Srivastava et al., 2009</a>). As with viral infection, variability in the immune response to vaccination is likely to be influenced by genotype. Accordingly, twin and sibling studies have shown heritability estimates as high as 45% for a varicella vaccine (<a href=\"#bib13\">Klein et al., 2007</a>) and 90% for a measles vaccine (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tan et al., 2001</a>). Studies investigating influenza vaccine immunogenicity in humans have consistently shown large inter-individual variability, but the genetic contribution to this variability remains poorly understood."

Moreover, genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of variants associated with human disease risk that are also eQTL, implying that the mechanism by which they influence risk involves variation in transcriptional responses (<a href=\"#bib9\">Emilsson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cookson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Naukkarinen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Nicolae et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rotival et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barreiro et al., 2012</a>) Finally, integrative genomic studies in model organisms (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schadt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2009</a>) have demonstrated that the combination of genetic and transcriptional information can allow direct tests of causal mechanisms in controlled experiments. We hypothesized that integrating genome-wide genotype data with serial measurements of the transcriptional and humoral responses to an influenza vaccine in a clinical study could be used to identify loci that influence vaccine responsiveness and subsequent immunity to influenza in humans."

We began by identifying SNP-transcript pairs with both significant evidence of a <i>cis</i>-acting eQTL and significant changes in gene expression in response to vaccination. Thresholds for local significance were initially explored, since only SNPs flanking each reporter sequence were tested for <i>cis</i> association. In the discovery cohort, 3229 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 408 unique genes, exhibited significant genotype-expression association (genotype effect p&lt;1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>) and concomitant evidence of a transcriptional response to the vaccine (day effect p&lt;0.01). Of these, 2606 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 256 genes, were validated in the independent cohort of female volunteers (genotype effect p&lt;0.05 and day effect p&lt;0.01). When more stringent thresholds were applied, 756 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 114 unique genes, exhibited significant genotype-expression association (genotype effect p&lt;5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>) and concomitant evidence of a transcriptional response to the vaccine (day effect p&lt;0.01) in the discovery cohort. Of these, 654 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 93 genes, were validated in the second cohort (genotype effect p&lt;0.05 and day effect p&lt;0.01).

We now considered alternative models for the relationships between these distinct types of association (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), and we evaluated our data to determine which of these alternatives appears most consistent with our observations. The alternative models considered were: (i) genotype association with gene expression is independent of genotype association or trends of association with antibody response (independent model); (ii) genotype association or trends of association with antibody response are mediated by gene expression patterns that are strongly correlated with genotype (causal model); and (iii) genotype associations to antibody response are not mediated by expression, but instead gene expression patterns are a response to the antibody trait or its early correlates (reactive model). To perform a comparative analysis of these alternatives we extended the framework for causal modeling (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pearl, 2010</a>) in eQTL data recently developed by others (<a href=\"#bib16\">Millstein et al., 2009</a>) and applied the method to our time-course gene expression study. We used the 137 eQTL SNP-transcript pairs from the 20 loci with the strongest evidence of genetic variation influencing the immune response to the vaccine, as described above. We found that the patterns in the data trend toward the causal model compared to the reactive model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), but a power analysis based on the distribution of the empirical effect sizes of our observed associations also indicates that our sample size is too modest to support definitive conclusions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

Even in healthy, young individuals, there are a significant number of people who do not develop a protective antibody response after influenza vaccination. If these individuals could be identified prior to vaccination, modifications to the type or dose of vaccine could be attempted, with the goal of reducing the number of unprotected vaccinated individuals. The genes identified in this study as playing a role in variation in the humoral response to vaccination would be a logical starting point for the development of DNA- or RNA-based predictive biomarkers. Prospective evaluation of such biomarkers would be the next step towards clinical implementation."

The dynamic nature of the measurements also allowed us to uncover genetic effects that are either enhanced by or only evident after the experimental perturbation. The specificity of gene identification in this study emerges from the genome\u2019s acute response to the perturbation, which cannot be assessed by a cross-sectional eQTL analysis or a genome-wide association study.

First, we studied two samples of healthy young adults, thereby excluding the segments of the population that are most likely to have a poor response to influenza vaccination: children, the elderly, and individuals with severe illnesses. Second, in order to minimize the risk of false associations related to population stratification, we studied an ethnically homogeneous group of individuals. Third, while an interesting aspect of our study design is that it could open the door for direct comparisons of causal and reactive models, the sample size in this study was not sufficient to establish whether or not there is a causal relationship between the loci for which an association was identified and the antibody response to the vaccine. Finally, while antibody titers have historically been used to evaluate vaccine responsiveness, it is clear that they do not capture the complexity of the human immune response to vaccination. Additional studies would be necessary to determine whether the genes identified are also related to variation in influenza vaccine responses in groups other than the one chosen for this study, whether there is a causal relationship between these genes and the antibody response, or whether they also influence the cell-mediated immune response to the vaccine."

Because we have repeated gene expression measurements on the same individuals over a series of time points, we performed a random effects linear model analysis. For each SNP-transcript pair, we fit a model with terms for day, additive effects for genotype and day\u2013genotype interactions, and a random effect for each person:Where <b><i>Y</i></b> = observed expression value, <b><i>i</i></b> = day (0, 1, 3, 14), <b><i>j</i></b> = individual, <b><i>D</i></b> = day effect, <b><i>g</i></b> = genotype effect, <b><i>P</i></b> = person effect (random), and <b><i>e</i></b> = random error. We fit this model using the R package nlme and the estimation method of the same name. The day effect (<b><i>D</i></b>) is a shift term which considers time-ordered change in expression. The genotype effect (<b><i>g</i></b>) is a main effect for genotype that considers the expression differences between genotypes to be additively related to the number of copies of a reference allele. The day\u2013genotype interaction allows the additive effect to vary by day (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> for a visual representation of the analysis scheme). The person effect (<b><i>P</i></b>) is modeled as a random effect; this term helps to efficiently account for the fact that the same individual appears in each time point, without overfitting the expression model to the particular sample ascertained in our study. We explored different parametrizations, such as allowing the person effect to vary by day, and found that the simplest model with a single term for each person was effective. This person effect can account for inter-individual or batch differences which are stable within individuals for the duration of the study."

This allowed estimates of the proportion of expression variance explained by individual genotypes from the model\u2019s coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>). This model permitted a more detailed examination of the changes in the strength of the genotypic association with expression at each time point. To detect SNP-transcript pairs where the magnitude of the genotype effect varied after immunization, we took the difference in R<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> measures (\u0394R<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>) from pairwise linear models fitted after (days 1, 3 and 14) and before vaccination (day 0). We then took the top 1% \u0394R<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> values between day 0 and a later time point. This <i>cis</i>-acting eQTL subset represents the loci that show significant changes in the genetic effect as a result of the vaccine."

The relationship is modeled aswhere <b><i>T</i></b> is trait, <b><i>E</i></b> is gene expression, and <b><i>G</i></b> is genotype at a locus. In our experiment, the term <b><i>E</i></b> includes a separate value for each day. The term <b><i>G</i></b> has a separate effect on the trait under the independent null model, while under the causal alternative, where it acts through gene expression, its influence is entirely transmitted through <b><i>E</i></b>. The statistic used to assess the influence of <b><i>G</i></b> is the partial F reported by the \u2018aov\u2019 function in R (version 2.15.1). The analyses utilize an equivalence test approach, where the null hypothesis is that the second independent variable has an effect on the response conditional on the first variable, while the alternative is complete co-linearity in the associations. The null distribution of the F statistic\u2013which under parametric assumptions would have a non-central F distribution\u2014is derived using a permutation test procedure, as follows: The relationship between <b><i>E</i></b> and <b><i>T</i></b> is decoupled by regressing <b><i>E</i></b> on <b><i>G</i></b>, permuting the resulting residuals, then adding the permuted residuals to the predicted values to arrive at <b><i>E*</i></b>, which is independent of <b><i>T</i></b> but maintains the marginal variance and <b><i>G</i></b>-correlation of <b><i>E</i></b>. This procedure enforces the assumption of the independent model, while leaving other properties unchanged. The partial F statistic for <b><i>G</i></b> inrepresents a sample from the distribution under the independent null hypothesis. This process, repeated 1000 times, provided a null distribution. The p-value for the observed F is the proportion of the null distribution that is below the observed value."

This normalizes to each individual's starting point. Furthermore, a difference of r<sup>2</sup> between time points can have multiple causes (as the authors point out). It seems to us that what they are most concerned with is cases where the effect size (beta) of a given eQTL differs between time points, <i>or</i> where the actual response (transcription time point x\u2212transcription baseline) differs between individuals.

However, it should not result in confounding with other biologically important variation, particularly in the validation of eQTLs.

We observed that the association between SNP and antibody, as measured by non-zero R<sup>2</sup> values, disappeared after accounting for gene expression. This reduction in R<sup>2</sup> was not observed in randomly-sampled sets of SNPs.
