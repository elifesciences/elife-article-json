Fish are particularly vulnerable to the oiling of spawning habitats, and crude oil causes severe abnormalities in embryos and larvae. However, the underlying mechanisms for these developmental defects are not well understood. Here, we explore the transcriptional basis for four discrete crude oil injury phenotypes in the early life stages of the commercially important Atlantic haddock (<i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i>). These include defects in (1) cardiac form and function, (2) craniofacial development, (3) ionoregulation and fluid balance, and (4) cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. Our findings suggest a key role for intracellular calcium cycling and excitation-transcription coupling in the dysregulation of heart and jaw morphogenesis. Moreover, the disruption of ionoregulatory pathways sheds new light on buoyancy control in marine fish embryos. Overall, our chemical-genetic approach identifies initiating events for distinct adverse outcome pathways and novel roles for individual genes in fundamental developmental processes."

Fish are particularly vulnerable to the oiling of spawning habitats, and crude oil causes severe abnormalities in embryos and larvae. However, the underlying mechanisms for these developmental defects are not well understood. Here, we explore the transcriptional basis for four discrete crude oil injury phenotypes in the early life stages of the commercially important Atlantic haddock (<i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i>). These include defects in (1) cardiac form and function, (2) craniofacial development, (3) ionoregulation and fluid balance, and (4) cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. Our findings suggest a key role for intracellular calcium cycling and excitation-transcription coupling in the dysregulation of heart and jaw morphogenesis. Moreover, the disruption of ionoregulatory pathways sheds new light on buoyancy control in marine fish embryos. Overall, our chemical-genetic approach identifies initiating events for distinct adverse outcome pathways and novel roles for individual genes in fundamental developmental processes."

The findings add further support to the idea that exposure to crude oil causes heart and face defects because it interferes with how the cells that develop into these structures use calcium ions. Signals sent via calcium ions are not only important for the contraction of muscle cells, but they are also essential for regulation of some genes. So, by interfering with the circulation of calcium ions, crude oil can have consequences for both how muscles work and how genes are regulated."

Firstly, genes that help to regulate the ion and water content of the tissues were highly affected in young fish exposed to crude oil. Some of the genes were more active than normal, while others were less active. This finding in particular would explain why oil-exposed embryos often accumulate fluids, and suggests that the larvae may have altered buoyancy too. Secondly, the oil-exposed embryos showed signs of a shortage of cholesterol and other fatty molecules. This is most likely because they absorbed less material from their yolk, which could also explain why larvae exposed to crude oil grow more slowly than normal."

Mechanistic relationships between environmental stress and adverse health outcomes are most readily studied in model laboratory organisms. However, domesticated experimental models may be relatively insensitive to real-world environmental change. Emerging genomic technologies, including high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), are providing new opportunities to profile physiological stress in wild, non-model species at a transcriptional level. This approach is premised on the full anchoring of gene expression to physiological or morphological injury phenotypes."

However, developmental analyses in wild species can be challenging due to limited access to embryos and larvae. Also limited are molecular and cellular tools for imaging-specific structures (e.g. fluorescent protein-expressing transgenes). This includes, for example, a lack of species-specific probes for visualizing gene expression via <i>in situ</i> hybridization. On the other hand, one of the major vertebrate models for studying developmental genetics is a fish. Zebrafish have been a focus for high-throughput experimental techniques for more than three decades. This has yielded a wealth of information on embryonic gene expression patterns, with comparable data often available in chick and mouse embryos. The zebrafish platform therefore provides a powerful mechanistic context for anticipating environmental health impacts in marine fish spawning habitats."

Crude oil spills such as the 1989 <i>Exxon Valdez</i> (Prince William Sound), 2002 <i>Prestige</i> (Spain), and 2010 <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> (Gulf of Mexico) continue to threaten fisheries worldwide. Haddock are commercially valuable in Norway and other North Atlantic countries, and they spawn in areas proposed for future crude oil production (e.g. the Lofoten archipelago in Nordland). Similar to many other fish species, haddock embryos are vulnerable to developmental defects from crude oil exposure (Norwegian Sea crude; [<a href=\"#bib88\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016b</a>]). Moreover, we recently showed that RNA-seq applied to normally developing haddock clearly anchored organogenesis phenotypes to the expression of genes involved in determination and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib87\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016a</a>)."

This is particularly true for tissue-specific patterns of gene expression that are highly conserved across vertebrates\u2014for\u00a0example, genes involved in cardiac organogenesis."

There are several reasons to expect divergent effects of crude oil on marine fish embryos and larvae. These are attributable to differences in physiology and life history. For example, accumulation of cardiac edema is a canonical form of crude oil toxicity in both freshwater and marine species. Yet marine embryos are hyposmotic to the surrounding water and hence expected to lose water with circulatory failure. This suggests that PAHs may have distinct impacts on ionoregulation and related processes. Also, unlike zebrafish, many pelagic marine embryos are buoyant and have a characteristic morphology not found in species with demersal (sinking) eggs and larvae. Shelbourne first described a relationship between this unique morphology of pelagic fish larvae, osmoregulation and buoyancy control in the mid-twentieth century (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shelbourne, 1955</a>, <a href=\"#bib78\">1956</a>, <a href=\"#bib79\">1957</a>), but there has been little progress in the decades since, particularly at a molecular scale."

The development and application of AOPs is an ongoing movement to improve risk assessments. AOPs are derived from detailed toxicological cause-and-effect relationships that span multiple levels of biological organization, ideally from molecular initiating events to species, community or ecosystem scale responses of regulatory concern (e.g. reduction in a fisheries abundance target). AOPs are widely used in risk assessments for both human and environmental (ecological) health (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ankley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kramer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Villeneuve et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Garcia-Reyero, 2015</a>) Our long-term aim is to develop AOPs specific to oil spills and fish populations, premised on well-studied early life stage toxicity. AOPs based on crude oil cardiotoxicity in developing fish are already fairly well constructed (<a href=\"#bib41\">Incardona and Scholz, 2016</a>) but currently lack details at the molecular level at several steps, particularly in relation to cardiac dysmorphogenesis. We anticipate that identification of changes in gene expression associated with oil-induced developmental defects will further complete these AOPs and expand the molecular toolkit for quantifying oil spill impacts."

This approach allowed us to explore gene regulation in association with three distinct phenotypes: (1) heart form and function defects, (2) craniofacial deformities, and (3) fluid balance abnormalities and the characteristic pelagic larval form. We also identify perturbations in cholesterol homeostasis linked to poor absorption of yolk as a novel form of crude oil toxicity in marine fish embryos. Our findings are interpreted in the context of highly conserved gene regulation in zebrafish and other vertebrates."

This yielded internal total PAH doses of 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 \u00b5g/g wet weight, 0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 \u00b5g/g, and 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 \u00b5g/g, respectively (see [<a href=\"#bib88\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016b</a>] for experimental details). Although the low and pulsed exposures led to similar total PAH accumulation in embryos, phenotypes were slightly more severe in the latter due to relatively higher exposure concentrations during critical windows of early development (<a href=\"#bib88\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016b</a>). The embryonic exposure began at 2 dpf and ended shortly after the end of organogenesis at 10 dpf, just prior to hatch. Larvae were exposed to the same regimen from day of hatch to 18 days post hatch (dph). As expected, tissue PAH accumulation was lower than for embryos, with 0.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 \u00b5g/g, 0.086\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.015 \u00b5g/g, and 0.081\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.024 \u00b5g/g, for high, low, and pulse doses, respectively. Except where indicated below, phenotypes were quantified as described in detail previously (<a href=\"#bib88\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016b</a>), with 96% of high-dose animals showing abnormal phenotypes, ranging to\u00a0~60% for pulse dose and\u00a0~35% for the low dose. Representative terminal phenotypes in high dose are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> for the embryonic exposure at 3 dph and larval exposure at 18 dph. Grossly, as in other species, crude oil exposure led to defects in cardiac function and morphology and accumulation of edema around the heart and in the yolk sac (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Defects in cardiac morphology included a failure to properly loop the atrial and ventricular chambers from a linear to an adjacent orientation, and reduced size of the ventricle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). In addition, oil-exposed haddock embryos displayed craniofacial defects in their larval stages that ranged in severity\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>), from marked reductions in upper jaw/skull base structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) to near complete lack of upper and lower jaws (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Moreover, the anterior portion of the dorsal marginal finfold was collapsed or missing and the hindbrain ventricle typically failed to fill with cerebrospinal fluid in embryonically exposed larvae with severe edema (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>). Finally, in more severely affected embryos, a failure of yolk absorption was obvious at 3 dph (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J,K</a>). Even in mildly affected embryos, yolk absorption was reduced after hatch as assessed by measuring the two-dimensional area of the yolk mass in lateral images (control yolk area control 0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 mm<sup>2</sup>, low-dose group 0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11, high-dose group 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3; mean \u00b1 s.d., ANOVA p&lt;0.0001). In contrast, there was no measurable difference in yolk area at day of hatch. After larval exposure, the primary morphological defects were reduced jaw growth and edema accumulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L,M</a>), the latter in the peritoneal cavity. In contrast to embryos, the dorsal anterior subdermal space accumulated fluid in larvae and did not collapse."

We did not quantify this effect, because it was demonstrated earlier in zebrafish that small eyes result from loss of cardiac function by either genetic or chemical means (<a href=\"#bib39\">Incardona et al., 2004</a>), and hence, this phenotype is not specific to crude oil toxicity."

After 24\u00a0hr of oil exposure (sampling stage E1; 3 dpf), relatively few genes were differentially expressed, and most were significantly downregulated (Supporting dataset 1,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib89\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2017</a>). From sampling point E2 (6 dpf) through E6 (three days post hatch, dph), however, the number of DEGs was substantial, particularly in response to the high dose exposure. With the exception of the initial sampling point (E1), a total of 28 DEGs were shared across all embryonic stages (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). As expected, the largest category (nine DEGs) included genes associated with stress response and xenobiotic metabolism. The remaining genes play a role in tyrosine catabolism, myofibrillar establishment and cardiac tissue repair, central nervous system (CNS) function and degeneration, ATP metabolism, and cholesterol synthesis."

Genes known to have tightly restricted cardiac expression generally had read count values below 100, with <i>bmp10</i> and <i>kcnh2</i> just above detection limits (10 reads). At the onset of expression in zebrafish, <i>bmp10</i> transcripts are detected by <i>in situ</i> hybridization in perhaps fewer than 100 cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Laux et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, <i>bmp4</i> is more widely expressed in zebrafish at the segmentation stage, including the eye, tailbud, and epidermis in addition to the heart. As expected, this gene had a correspondingly higher read count (265) in haddock. Genes expressed more strongly throughout the entire heart tube had read counts above 60 (e.g. <i>nkx2.5</i> at 85 and <i>fhl2</i> at 65). The cardiac-specific Serca2 isoform (<i>atp2a2</i>) had a read count of 312, while the isoform expressed in skeletal muscle (<i>atp2a1</i>) had a read count of 9114. Similarly, read counts for the atrial-specific isoform of myosin heavy chain (<i>myh6</i>) and the major skeletal muscle isoform <i>myh1</i> were 176 and 2543, respectively. Genes expressed in the neural tube, a tissue mass much larger than the heart but less than the myotomes, had intermediate read counts that also fit with their relative expression patterns. For example, <i>pax6</i> and <i>nkx2.2</i> had read counts of 1773 and 333, respectively, with <i>pax6</i> expressed in a fairly wide dorsal domain of the neural tube, and <i>nkx2.2</i> expressed in a narrower ventral region."

At these stages, these lipid transport genes are most strongly expressed in the yolk syncytial layer. Notably, IPA also detected larger scale enrichment of eye genes, almost all down-regulated, accounting for roughly 50% of developmental pathways during pigmentation of the retina, but prior to obvious differences in eye sizes after hatch."

In addition, morphology became more severely impacted over time, with later defects including failure of looping and poor ventricular growth becoming prominent by 0 dph/E5. There are several possible etiologies for ventricular size reduction. For example, although the precise mechanism by which intracellular calcium regulates embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation is still unknown, a disruption of calcium cycling could reduce proliferation, thereby yielding fish with smaller hearts (<a href=\"#bib73\">Rottbauer et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ebert et al., 2005</a>). We therefore focused on genes involved in cardiac morphogenesis. The earliest alteration was a fourfold increase in the signaling molecule, <i>bmp10</i> at 6 dpf/E2 while the heart was at the midline cone stage, and appeared unaffected in oil-exposed embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). IPA also identified Bmp signaling as a significantly enriched pathway at this time point, under the Organismal Development category. Elevation of <i>bmp10</i> was followed by the upregulation of the cardiac transcription factor <i>nkx25</i>, to a threefold increase at 10 dpf/E4 and a nearly sixfold increase at 11dpf/E5, when the heart was beating regularly. At hatch (0 dph), the expression of the transcription factor <i>tbx3</i> was elevated eightfold. Lastly, atrial natriuretic factor (<i>nppa</i>), a key homeostatic regulator of contractility, was downregulated by 2.3-fold in larvae at 3 dph (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>).

Neural crest cells migrate from the anterior neural tube to form the pharyngeal arches with both dorsal (upper jaw) and ventral (lower jaw) patterning. They then differentiate into chondrocytes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Knight and Schilling, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Sim\u00f5es-Costa and Bronner, 2015</a>) and grow by processes such as convergence-extension (<a href=\"#bib81\">Shwartz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kamel et al., 2013</a>). Concurrently, mesodermal cells differentiate into patterned muscle in appropriate association with partner cartilage. Several lines of evidence suggest multidirectional signaling between all associated tissues, including endoderm (i.e. pharyngeal pouches), mesoderm, and overlying ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib60\">Minoux and Rijli, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Medeiros and Crump, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kamel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kong et al., 2014</a>). Studies on zebrafish craniofacial mutants have primarily focused on the neural crest cell lineage, with less attention to muscle development or interactions between developing muscle and cartilage (<a href=\"#bib57\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). Defects in oil-exposed haddock were marked by a dose-dependent reduction in more anterior cartilages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). This affected the basicranium most severely, with progressive loss of more posterior arch derivatives. Where present, craniofacial cartilage appeared small and distorted, without transformation to dorsal or ventral fates. This morphometry superficially aligns to several zebrafish mutants affecting either neural crest cell (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kimmel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nissen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lu and Carson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kamel et al., 2013</a>) or muscle development (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hinits et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Shwartz et al., 2012</a>).

Although patterns of edema formation vary across freshwater and marine fish species (<a href=\"#bib41\">Incardona and Scholz, 2016</a>), it nearly always involves anatomical compartments adjacent to the heart and the yolk sac. However, marine embryos are hyposmolar to surrounding seawater, and they should therefore lose water along a diffusion gradient if osmoregulation is disrupted as a consequence of heart and circulatory failure. In fish embryos and yolk sac larvae, osmoregulation is controlled by MRCs in the epidermis and yolk sac membrane that actively secrete NaCl (specifically Cl<sup>-</sup>) to maintain an appropriate water and ion balance (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hiroi et al., 2005</a>). Genetic and pharmacologic studies have shown that circulation is required to maintain embryonic MRC cell function. For example, total body osmolality increased in seawater-adapted tilapia embryos with a\u00a0~50% reduction in total cardiac output (<a href=\"#bib61\">Miyanishi et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, edema formation in marine species with oil-induced circulatory defects is not a consequence of water moving into the embryo (as it is for freshwater species) but rather water moving along an internal osmotic gradient from peripheral tissues to the vicinity of the heart and yolk sac. Accordingly, dorsal anterior finfold defects in edematous embryos and larvae (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>) represent a visible phenotypic anchor for ionoregulatory disruption, a third distinct oil-induced adverse outcome pathway."

During fish development, cholesterol is mobilized from the yolk and distributed to cells during embryonic and larval yolk sac stages. Later, after the yolk is absorbed and larvae begin exogenous feeding, cholesterol is transported from the intestines. Crude-oil-exposed haddock embryos and larvae with the most severe morphological abnormalities were visibly unable to effectively mobilize yolk (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J,K</a>). Moreover, larvae from the highest exposure concentration had less visible food in their stomachs relative to controls.

Embryonic exposure to crude oil or component cardiotoxic PAHs produces a coarse chemical phenocopy of the loss-of-function zebrafish mutants affecting heart function or development (<a href=\"#bib39\">Incardona et al., 2004</a>). Many aspects of the oil toxicity phenotype are secondary to a loss of circulation\u2014that\u00a0is, defects in non-cardiac tissues, such as the eye, that require circulation for normal organogenesis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Incardona et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, larval stages are primarily a period of rapid growth after major organogenesis is complete, and the injury phenotype in larvae is less severe. Consistent with this, embryos showed a larger number of DEGs than larvae, with a preponderance of down-regulation. Second, we identified specific changes in the expression of key genes involved in the function or morphogenesis of individual tissues and organs with visible abnormalities. Given unaltered gene expression and lack of statistically enriched pathways associated with apparently unaffected structures such as the liver, the DEGs in oil-exposed haddock indicate a disruption of specific developmental processes, as opposed to non-specific effects (e.g. general developmental delay)."

Our findings have important implications for the utility of RNA-Seq and other quantitative measures of mRNA abundance in whole embryo or larval samples.

Our findings suggest that E-T coupling may link reduced cardiomyocyte calcium cycling to structural defects in the haddock heart. Among vertebrates, <i>bmp10</i> is expressed exclusively in the early tubular hearts of zebrafish, mouse, and chick embryos. The normal function of Bmp10 in the developing heart is primarily to drive ventricular cardiomyocyte proliferation during trabeculation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grego-Bessa et al., 2007</a>), a relatively late process during embryogenesis (around hatching stages in fish). Both loss of and excess Bmp10 leads to severe abnormalities in ventricular development in mouse (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2004</a>). In mice lacking the RyR-associated Fkbp12 protein, disruption of SR calcium handling leads to ventricular defects through elevated <i>bmp10</i> transcription (<a href=\"#bib80\">Shou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2004</a>), probably through calcium-dependent activation of myocardin (<a href=\"#bib98\">Wamhoff et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib99\">2006</a>), the transcriptional activator of <i>bmp10</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Huang et al., 2012</a>).

While <i>bmp10</i> normally functions at late stages of cardiogenesis, <i>bmp4</i> is normally expressed at the cardiac cone stage in zebrafish. At this stage, <i>bmp4</i> levels shift from radially symmetric to elevated on the left side of the cone, to drive proper looping (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2004</a>). Loss of this asymmetry with ectopic <i>bmp4</i> leads to un-looped hearts. Therefore, the premature up-regulation of a more potent family member, <i>bmp10</i>, at the cone stage is very likely to underlie the looping defects observed in oil-exposed embryos. Further evidence for <i>bmp10</i> overexpression initiating abnormal cardiac morphogenesis is the secondary up-regulation of the Bmp10 target gene <i>nkx25</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2004</a>). In zebrafish, <i>nkx25</i> overexpression or loss of function (<a href=\"#bib95\">Tu et al., 2009</a>) yields a reduced ventricle, and <i>nkx25</i> must be down-regulated or antagonised in specific regions of the ventricle in order to form specialised conduction cells through the repressor action of Tbx3 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hoogaars et al., 2004</a>). The higher levels of <i>tbx3</i> that follow upregulation of <i>nkx25</i> and subsequent downregulation of <i>anf</i> thus likely reflect an imbalance between myocardial and non-myocardial cell fates within the ventricle. Thus, normal heart development in zebrafish requires tight control over <i>bmp10</i>, <i>nkx25</i>, and <i>tbx3</i> expression, and all three genes were dysregulated in oil-exposed haddock. The observed ventricular and looping defects may represent chemical phenocopies of the <i>fkbp12</i> mutant, wherein reduced intracellular calcium transients are linked to altered <i>bmp10</i> expression by E-T coupling, thereby changing cell fate and chamber formation in the developing heart. Calcium-mediated E-T coupling may also be a feedback mechanism for altering the expression of genes that encode repolarizing potassium channels."

As is the case with Bmp10, Edn1 is a strong morphogen that must be tightly regulated, as both too much and too little lead to craniofacial defects (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Clouthier et al., 2010</a>). Higher levels of <i>edn1</i> observed here are thus highly likely to be related to the craniofacial defects, which is supported by the subsequent up-regulation of its target <i>dlx</i> genes. However, the phenotype does not appear to reflect changes in dorsal-ventral patterning, as expected for perturbation of <i>edn1</i>-dependent NCC identity. Most studies of craniofacial development in zebrafish and other vertebrates have focused on NCC-derived cartilaginous precursors. However, craniofacial skeletal elements develop in synchrony with their associated muscles (<a href=\"#bib75\">Schilling and Kimmel, 1997</a>), and defects in muscle formation or function produce phenotypes that are in many ways indistinguishable from primary cartilage defects and appear more similar to the phenotypes observed here (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hinits et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Shwartz et al., 2012</a>). Mesodermal precursors of craniofacial muscle cells express <i>edn1</i>, the downregulation of which is associated with terminal muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Choudhry et al., 2011</a>). A failure to downregulate <i>edn1</i> is consistent with failure to up-regulate or maintain <i>myh</i> gene expression. It is unknown whether a failure of skeletal muscle to terminally differentiate would lead to reduced expression of genes associated with NCC development and cartilage growth and survival\u2014that\u00a0is <i>foxi1</i>, Wnt pathway genes (<i>wnt9b</i>, <i>fzd7a, mycn</i>), Fgf receptors and <i>tgfb3</i>. On the other hand, the early expression of <i>foxi1</i> has no clear linkage to craniofacial muscle development in the literature, but it is required for NCC survival indirectly by driving Fgf signaling (<a href=\"#bib20\">Edlund et al., 2014</a>). Sorting out the precise pathways of craniofacial malformation will thus require a concerted spatial localization of these DEGs."

Conversely, the genetic elements of this phenotype provide a starting point to study the molecular basis of buoyancy control in pelagic fish larvae. Our findings suggest that crude oil may disrupt MRC function, leading to decreased expression of MRC channel and transporter genes. These effects could be direct, indirect, or both. First, ion and water balance in embryos require cardiac circulation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Miyanishi et al., 2013</a>). Flow is essential for osmoregulatory counter-current exchange in the gills and kidney (<a href=\"#bib83\">Somero, 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Grosell, 2011</a>), and similar principals should apply to the yolk sac epidermis. Second, epidermal MRCs are likely directly exposed to the highest PAH concentrations, because the highest Cyp1a upregulation in response to oil occurs in the skin of embryos and yolk sac larvae (<a href=\"#bib88\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016b</a>). PAHs or their metabolites could block solute carriers in a similar manner as shown for cardiac calcium and potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brette et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Incardona et al., 2014</a>). Lastly, MRC function could be impaired if the metabolic cost of PAH degradation competes with ion transport. Although the effects of oil exposure on salt and water balance in fish embryos have not been examined previously, exposing water-soluble oil fraction to adult Pacific herring (<i>Clupea pallasi</i>) showed an effect on ion homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kennedy and Farrell, 2005</a>)."

Edema flows along the path of least resistance and accumulates in expandable spaces. In haddock embryos, fluid moves from the dorsal subdermal space to the yolk sac. At the larval stage, the presence of fluid in the dorsal finfold suggests that a developed peritoneal cavity and body wall provide greater resistance than the thin, permeable yolk sac membrane. As a consequence, the central nervous system is likely deprived of water during embryonic development and turgidly stressed at the larval stages. Changes in cell volume can modify intra- and extracellular ionic concentrations, and thus the electrophysiological properties of neurons (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pasantes-Morales et al., 2000</a>). This may underlie the observed down-regulation of the main water channel in the\u00a0brain, aquaporin 4 (<i>aqp4</i>), during and after embryonic exposure. Although not a focus of the current study, there are likely important mechanistic connections between a loss of embryonic MRC function, disrupted osmoregulation in the brain, and pathophysiological impacts on neuronal development."

The delivery of yolk-derived cholesterol not been widely studied in early fish embryos, which are distinct from other vertebrates in that the yolk mass is contained separately from the vasculature by the yolk syncytial layer (YSL, or periblast in older literature). The YSL is a multicellular membrane that forms during gastrulation and has been studied mostly for its role in early pattern formation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carvalho and Heisenberg, 2010</a>). At later embryonic and larval stages, the YSL transports yolk-derived nutrients into the circulation (e.g, [<a href=\"#bib70\">Poupard et al., 2000</a>]). Although cholesterol is exported from the yolk prior to established circulation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fraher et al., 2016</a>), the cellular basis for this is not known\u2014for\u00a0example, by trancytosis or direct membrane transport. Cellular sterol levels are tightly controlled by membrane-bound transcription factors, which are cleaved and activated when membrane cholesterol levels fall, leading to transcription of <i>hmdh</i>, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</a>). Therefore, the brisk up-regulation of intrinsic cholesterol biosynthetic genes, especially <i>hmdh</i>, prior to a visible mobilization of yolk, indicates the importance of yolk-derived cholesterol for embryonic tissues. In zebrafish and other fish, apolipoprotein genes (e.g. ApoB and ApoE) as well as Scarb1 are first expressed in YSL (<a href=\"#bib70\">Poupard et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Thisse et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Otis et al., 2015</a>). The downregulation of multiple <i>apob</i> paralogs and <i>scarb1</i> during early development suggest a specific defect in packaging and transporting of lipoprotein-cholesterol in the YSL, possibly involving Scarb1-dependent transcytosis. At stages subsequent to heartbeat initiation, the upregulation of intrinsic cholesterol biosynthetic genes likely reflects cholesterol deprivation as a consequence of the heart failing to deliver lipoproteins from the yolk (embryos) and intestine (larvae). The identification of broader lipid metabolism pathways by IPA also suggests that oil exposure leads to more global derangements relating to either poor yolk absorption or dysfunction of the YSL. It is well known both that embryonic oil exposure leads to later growth impairment (e.g. [\ufeff<a href=\"#bib30\">Heintz, 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib41\">Incardona and Scholz, 2016</a>]) and that lipids provide critical fuel for marine fish larvae, particularly at the first-feeding stage (<a href=\"#bib94\">Tocher et al., 2003</a>). The consequences of disordered lipid metabolism for larval physiology and survival should be a focus for future studies. Importantly, the induction of cholesterol synthetic genes is a promising and novel indicator of crude oil toxicity to fish embryos."

Our results more clearly define the different categories of developmental injury. We have also identified responsive genes that hold promise as sensitive molecular indicators of physiological stress.

(2016a)</a>. Samtools idxstat (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002105\">SCR_002105</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Li et al., 2009</a>) was used to extract the number of mapped reads which were then normalised to the total number of mapped sequences. NOISeqBIO (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003002\">SCR_003002</a>) (<a href=\"#bib92\">Tarazona et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib91\">2015</a>) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs, threshold of 0.95). The total number of reads averaged 41.39 million per sample and the mapping efficiency averaged 32.69%, giving an overall average of 13.51 million mapped paired end reads (125 bp) for each sample. Given the absence of untranslated regions (UTRs) and mitochondrial genes from the reference cod genome, reads with a UTR sequence and all reads for mitochondrial genes were excluded from the haddock analyses."

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012773\">SCR_012773</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kanehisa et al., 2012</a>) was performed by mapping the KEGG annotated DEGs from NOISeqBIO to KEGG pathways as described in the KEGG Mapper tool. Heat maps were generated from fold change data in R (<a href=\"#bib71\">R\u00a0Core Team\u00a0, 2013</a>) and Venn diagrams were created using the web-tool, Venn (<a href=\"http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn\">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn</a>). Individual genes involved in cardiac and craniofacial development, osmoregulation and lipid metabolism, or not directly linked to KEGG pathways were curated manually in an intensive process that took a full year. In a previous effort, we characterized the transcriptome of normally developing haddock embryos and larvae (<a href=\"#bib87\">S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016a</a>). Through extensive literature searches (PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and reading, lists of roughly 150 key genes involved in cardiac and craniofacial development and cardiac function were assembled. After obtaining the oil exposure RNA-Seq dataset, these lists were expanded by further literature searches. Genes of interest were identified as ones that showed strong dose-dependency and had potential phenotypic association based on the literature. We relied heavily on the expression database at the Zebrafish Information Network (<a href=\"http://www.zfin.org\">www.zfin.org</a>) to determine whether individual genes of interest were expressed in the relevant tissues at the appropriate developmental stage to be associated with phenotypes, helping to narrow in on key linkages. This was performed both by searching individual gene names and by generating lists of all genes expressed in a specific tissue at a time relevant to the phenotypes (e.g. all genes expressed in the ethmoid plate between segmentation and hatch). These lists were cross-referenced to the list of DEGs to identify candidates. If zfin.org lacked expression data, we searched for any papers describing tissue localization by <i>in situ</i> hybridization in other model or non-model species."

The fold change and p\u00a0values were extracted from the original NOISeqBIO output. Fold change values were multiplied by \u22121 to flip the direction (opposite the convention used by IPA), and any fold change values between \u22121 and 1 was set to 1, as non-significant values and those below 10 reads were originally set to 0.5 and 0.75. The cod genes were then BLASTed (version 2.3.0+) against the ENSEMBL zebrafish (GRCz10) and human (GCRh38) databases. The top match for each gene, filtered based on e-value (cutoff 10<sup>\u22125</sup>), was used to build a mapping table of the genes to the IPA database. For genes that lacked mapping at that point, SwissProt information was used to manually map. The mapping information was then combined with the fold change and p-value data and uploaded to IPA. This resulted in 17608 of 20954 genes (84%) mapping to the IPA database. Data were then analyzed using a fold change cutoff of 2.0 for both up- and down-regulation, considering relationships only when confidence was equal to the experimentally observed level. For this analysis, IPA uses a built-in right-tailed Fisher Exact Test to calculate p-values for significant functions and pathways. After each time point was analyzed individually in this manner, data outputs were used in comparison analyses in which the control dataset was compared to each dose at each time point. The output of the comparison analyses included rankings of top pathways in a variety of categories and subcategories. These rankings were expanded in the IPA software interface and inspected manually to generate <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">1C</a>."

More convincing arguments for cause-effect would be supported by data showing that dysregulation of the gene precedes the appearance of the phenotype, and that dysregulation is more pronounced in treatments with more pronounced phenotypic effects (e.g., higher doses). The lack of detail reported here could make a reader concerned that perhaps interpretation of gene-specific responses are not as clear-cut as represented in the text. Are <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a> showing data from any dose, or just high dose? Furthermore, there is no description of how emergence of phenotypes varied with dosing regime. Text (starting paragraph two of the Results section) that describes developmental phenotypes does not distinguish between effects that differ between doses, and all of the images from exposed animals in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> appear to be only from the high dose."

However, it is clear from the reviewer\u2019s comment that more clarification is needed, and we have revised the text in the \u201cGenes associated with defects in cardiac function and morphogenesis\u201d section accordingly. The current study specifically tested a hypothesis concerning transcriptional responses to disrupted E-C coupling. Very few studies have measured the responses of E-C coupling genes (i.e., ion channels) to pharmacologic blockade \u2013 these are cited in the original and revised version of our manuscript. Based on this limited information, we hypothesized a compensatory up-regulation of either the cognate gene for the blocked channel or other channel genes that function in the same pathway. This predicts, for example, an upregulation of the kcnh2 gene in response to potassium channel blockade. Because we observed the opposite, and did not see a compensatory upregulation of genes controlling repolarization, we concluded that the overall response was not a simple pattern of compensation. This suggests that crude oil is having a dual effect on E-C coupling at both the protein and gene levels."

While sophisticated tools are available for model species (e.g., organ-specific GFP expression) to isolate specific cell populations (e.g., by flow cytometry), this is practically impossible for a non-model species. A key aim of our study was to determine whether organ-specific changes in gene expression are detectable and consistent with the development of abnormal structures (phenotypic anchors). At issue is whether changes in gene expression, as visualized by whole-mount in situ hybridization, parallel quantitative changes in transcript abundance. Many previous studies of individual genes have confirmed this. As the reviewer pointed out earlier, the challenge is one of signal-to-noise, or whether gene regulation specific to a very small organ can be detected against a background of more abundant transcripts from a much larger tissue such as skeletal muscle. We have already confirmed this in our assessment of gene expression in normally developing haddock (S\u00f8rhus et al., 2016; Dev. Biol. 411:301). As structures became visible in the embryo over time (somites, heart, eye, etc.), we measured corresponding changes in the abundance of RNAs that are known to be associated with those structures via in situ hybridization. In this paper we show that this is also the case for these same structures that develop abnormally in response to crude oil. Consider, for example, <i>bmp10</i>. In situ hybridization in the three major vertebrate models (mouse, chick and zebrafish) has clearly shown that this gene is expressed exclusively in the heart during early development. In zebrafish, <i>bmp10</i> is expressed in ~ 100 cells. Consistent with this, the read-count data for <i>bmp10</i> in unexposed controls is just above the detection limit. In mutants with malformed hearts, <i>bmp10</i> upregulation is always visible by in situ hybridization. Indeed, changes in both the patterns and levels of gene expression \u2013 as assessed by in situs \u2013 are a fundamental tool in developmental genetics to relate molecular pathways to formation of structure.

Thus the epidermis is the major proximal target organ for PAHs, with an associated metabolic cost. The cyp1a response is uniform throughout the epidermis where the MRCs reside. Still unresolved is whether the ATP demands for PAH metabolism competes with the ATP available for ion transport, or whether PAHs or metabolites (or other compounds) directly interfere with channels, transporters or pumps as they do in EC coupling."

Although nowhere defined by the authors, an AOP describes the entire sequence of events from a molecular initiating event, across multiple levels of biological organization, to an adverse outcome; it is synonymous with \"mechanism of action\" (see e.g. Ankley 2010 Envir. Tox. Chem. and Villeneuve 2011 Envir. Tox. Chem.). When the authors refer to AOPs they are actually referring only to adverse outcomes, not the pathways.

This is what the field has evolved into, but chemical genetics is simply the premise that small molecules can produce abnormal developmental phenotypes in a manner similar to single-gene mutations. Indeed, the logic of the small molecule screening approach was derived from earlier focal studies of teratogens that caused malformations through specific interactions with developmental signaling molecules, such as cyclopamine-hedgehog signaling (Incardona et al., 1998, Development 125:3553). This history is captured in the Introduction to the first published zebrafish small molecule screen (Peterson et al., 2000, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 97:12965). In traditional forward developmental genetics, molecular pathways are identified by relating mutant phenotypes to the physical location of the mutation on the chromosome. On one hand, chemical genetics is simply the use of compounds to alter gene function at the protein end, thereby working towards the same goal (pathway identification) in the opposite direction. Chemically induced phenotypes can provide a greater level of control over the timing of gene function, for example, and sidestep experimental challenges such as embryonic lethality. The power of genetics \u2013 chemical or otherwise \u2013 is derived from the anchoring of gene expression to a careful phenotypic quantification and anchoring to gene expression. This was the goal of the present study, and we believe the use of the term is defensible. We also wanted to emphasize the feasibility of this approach in real-world organisms to study traits that may be absent from the lab models typically used in high throughput screening. Finally, as a study focusing on gene-environment interactions, we draw additional comparisons to analyses of natural compounds. Cyclopamine was initially identified from a similarly complex mixture of compounds produced by a range plant (<i>Veratrum viridae</i>) that induced malformations in pregnant sheep."

The reviewer may be more concerned about false negatives, or missing unidentified genes that might play key roles in heart development, for example. Given current state of technology, this is likely an unavoidable limitation of doing functional genomics in a non-model species where it is extremely difficult to manipulate the embryo with the types of tools available to zebrafish.
