However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic \u2018closed\u2019 conformation, and resulting increase in the A\u03b242/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment."

However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic \u2018closed\u2019 conformation, and resulting increase in the A\u03b242/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment."

Modified PS1 proteins produce harmful amyloid betas and removing the modifications was enough to make PS1 behave normally again.

The idea that A\u03b2 causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation is supported by several studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kuchibhotla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lopez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Busche et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Higuchi et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis affects A\u03b2 production. For example, acute stimulation of the entorhinal cortex using an optogenetic approach increases the A\u03b242 level specifically in the projection area of the perforant pathway (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yamamoto et al., 2015</a>). KCl-induced depolarization causes sustained release of A\u03b242 from AD mouse model synaptoneurosomes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). KCl-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx elevates intracellular A\u03b242/40 ratio in primary neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pierrot et al., 2004</a>).

Here, using FRET-based imaging we show that phosphorylation-inhibited mutations at the\u00a0three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310, S313, and domain 3: S365, S366 and S367) prevents the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated PS1 \u2018closed\u2019 conformational change. Conversely, phosphorylation-mimicking mutations reveal that domain 1 and 2 phosphorylation is necessary, but domain 3, and S367 in particular, is crucial for causing the PS1 pathogenic \u2018closed\u2019 conformation. Moreover, Protein Kinase A (PKA) inhibitors prevent the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced PS1 \u2018closed\u2019 conformational change whereas PKA activators trigger it. Therefore, we conclude that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-increased PKA activity leads to phosphorylation of PS1 at the three domains, inducing the PS1 pathogenic \u2018closed\u2019 conformation. These results provide strong evidence that PS1 phosphorylation at certain residues can potentially be molecular targets for AD prevention."

There was no statistical difference between the FRET efficiencies of WT PS1 and phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutants in vehicle-treated cells (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), indicating that the\u00a0conformation of the phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutants is not different from that of WT PS1 in basal conditions. A23187 significantly increased the FRET efficiency between fluorescently labeled NT and CT of WT PS1 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This indicates that WT PS1 adopts the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation following the treatment with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore. On the other hand, A23187 did not change the FRET efficiencies in T74A, S310A, S313A, S310A/S313A, S365A, S366A, S367A, S365A/S367A and S366A/S367A PS1 transfected cells, suggesting that conformation of these PS1 mutants was resistant to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore treatment (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The A23187-resistant phosphorylation sites on PS1 could be divided into three sub-membrane domains: domain 1 (T74) on NT of PS1, domain 2 (S310, S313) and domain 3 (S365, S366, S367) within the large hydrophilic loop (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

To distinguish between these scenarios, we generated a set of phosphorylation-mimicking G-PS1-R mutants by replacing serine or threonine with aspartic acid (D) in single domains (domain 1, domain 2 or domain 3), in double domains (domains 1\u00a0+\u00a02, domains 1\u00a0+\u00a03 or domains 2\u00a0+\u00a03), or in triple domains 1\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a03. The conformation of G-PS1-R with domain 1, or domain 2 only, or combined domain 1 and 2 mutants was not different from that of WT G-PS1-R (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, the FRET efficiency of the domain 3 phosphorylation-mimicking G-PS1-R isoform was significantly higher than that of WT G-PS1-R, indicating that this mutant forces PS1 into the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Domains 1\u00a0+\u00a03 G-PS1-R, domains 2\u00a0+\u00a03 G-PS1-R and domains 1\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a03 G-PS1-R also adopted the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

                                "text": "Several kinases involved in phosphorylation of the serine residues within the PS1 cytoplasmic loop region, such as PKA, JNK, PKC and GSK3\u03b2, have been identified (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kirschenbaum et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Fluhrer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kuo et al., 2008</a>). However, the kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation that is crucial for the PS1 conformational change remains unknown. To address this, WT G-PS1-R expressing 7\u00a0W cells were incubated with inhibitors of several kinases prior to A23187 treatment. The spectral FRET assay revealed that only the PKA inhibitor (KT5720) specifically rescued the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered \u2018closed\u2019 PS1 conformation, whereas JNK, PKC and GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors did not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This was confirmed using a different PKA inhibitor (H-89) and a complementary antibody-based FLIM assay (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To verify this further in primary neurons, we monitored the change of endogenous PS1 conformation following pre-treatment with the two PKA inhibitors: H-89 or KT5720, or PKA activators: forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP, prior to incubation with KCl. The cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a well known PKA-specific substrate (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989</a>), was used as a positive control for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-induced PKA activation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ferguson and Storm, 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We found that the proximity between the fluorescently labelled PS1 NT and CT was comparable between vehicle and KCl-treated neurons in the presence of H-89 or KT5720 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). On the other hand, the FRET efficiency of forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP treated neurons was significantly higher than that of vehicle-treated neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), supporting the involvement of PKA in the PS1 conformational change. Of note, there was no additive effect with KCl and PKA activators (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The inhibitory effect of KT5720 on the KCl/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 conformational change was also confirmed by real-time spectral FRET imaging in living primary neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To further corroborate the results obtained by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, we employed a dominant negative form of the PKA regulatory \u03b1 subunit (G324D) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Olson et al., 1993</a>). We found that co-expression of the G324D PKA mutant together with G-PS1-R prevents both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 phosphorylation at S310 and the \u2018closed\u2019 PS1 conformation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

First, we found that GFP emission was the strongest in the 875\u2013900 nm wavelength range, whereas RFP emission significantly decreased at\u00a0&gt;800 nm excitation, with barely detectable RFP signal at 900 nm in 7\u00a0W cells expressing G-PS1-R (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Therefore, 900 nm excitation was used in subsequent in vivo experiments. Using two different negative controls for FRET: G-PS1 (donor only) and PS1-R (acceptor only), we ensured that the emission intensity of RFP at 900 nm excitation is caused neither by GFP fluorescence bleed-through, nor by direct RFP excitation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

The <i>ex-vivo</i> spectral FRET assay revealed that PKA activation by 8-Bromo-cAMP led to the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation of endogenous PS1 as indicated by the increased number of neurons with a higher 565 nm/522 nm ratio (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Next, to determine if KT5720 pre-treatment would prevent the Bromo-cAMP-induced pathogenic collapse of PS1, the PKA inhibitor KT5720 or vehicle control were injected into mouse somatosensory cortex 75 min prior to 8-Bromo-cAMP injection. The ex-vivo spectral FRET assay revealed that PKA inhibition could prevent the 8-Bromo-cAMP-triggered \u2018closed\u2019 conformation of PS1 in mouse brain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

Although it has been suggested that aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis affects A\u03b2 production, the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations on PS1/\u03b3-secretase function is unknown. We have recently reported that increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels induce the pathogenic change in PS1 conformation and increase the A\u03b242/40 ratio in cultured neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kuzuya et al., 2016</a>). Considering the rapid and dynamic nature of the conformational changes, it is unlikely that this change is achieved through mechanisms involving transcription or reassembly of PS1 into de novo \u03b3-secretase complexes. However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear, and whether similar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated PS1 conformational changes occur in vivo is unknown. Our current study addresses these questions and demonstrates that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKA-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at domain 1 (T74), domain 2 (S310, S313) and domain 3 (S365, S366, S367) is responsible for the PS1/\u03b3-secretase pathogenic conformational change in vitro and in vivo."

It has been reported that PS1 phosphorylation at several residues enhances stability of the PS1 CT fragment that is necessary for \u03b3-secretase activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lau et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kuo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ryu et al., 2010</a>). Recently, Matz and colleagues have identified eleven new phosphorylation sites in PS1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Matz et al., 2015</a>). They showed that phosphorylation-inhibited mutations of these sites affect neither activity of the PS1/\u03b3-secretase nor A\u03b2 production. Our current study revealed that six amino acids: T74, S310, S313, S365, S366 and S367, all, except for S310, within the newly-discovered PS1 phosphorylation sites, are critical for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 pathogenic, \u2018closed\u2019 conformation linked to increased A\u03b242/40 ratio (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berezovska et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Isoo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Uemura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wahlster et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kuzuya et al., 2016</a>). We found that the\u00a0conformation of the phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutants at these residues is not different from that of the WT PS1. This is consistent with the findings of unaltered A\u03b242/40 ratio in cells expressing PS1 phosphorylation-inhibited mutants (<a href=\"#bib22\">Matz et al., 2015</a>). However, the conformation of the phosphorylation-inhibiting mutants and WT PS1 is very different in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-stimulated condition. This finding suggests that phosphorylation of PS1 at these residues as a result of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx/PKA activation underlies its conformational change."

                        "text": "Our data show that introducing phosphorylation-inhibited mutations within all six residues prevents the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx/PKA activation-triggered PS1 conformational change. This indicates that phosphorylation of domain 1 (T74), domain 2 (S310-S313) and domain 3 (S365-S366-S367) is important for PS1 adopting the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation. On the other hand, the results using phosphorylation-mimicking mutants revealed that phosphorylation of domain 1 and domain 2, though necessary, is not sufficient for the structural change of PS1. Whereas domain 3, specifically S367, is critical for PS1 achieving the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation. These results beg the questions of how domain 3 is phosphorylated and whether phosphorylation of domain 1 and domain 2 is involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 pathogenic conformational change. Although the domain 1 and domain two phosphorylation-mimicking PS1 isoform (T74D/S310D/S313D G-PS1-R) shows the same conformation as WT G-PS1-R, PKA activators were able to induce the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation of this mutant. Therefore, we conclude that PKA is involved in phosphorylation of domain 3. We propose the following model: PKA first phosphorylates PS1 at domain 2, which leads to spatial rearrangements around domain 1, and allows its phosphorylation. This subsequently changes the local conformation around domain 3, enabling its phosphorylation by PKA. This final phosphorylation of S365-S366-S367, with S367 being most crucial, drives the pathogenic conformational alteration of the PS1/\u03b3-secretase (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We propose that local spatial rearrangement around domain three is a key step for PKA-induced domain three phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of domain 1 and domain 2 is necessary for this to occur. This model is consistent with the finding that PKA is able to phosphorylate only S310 within domain 2 in recombinant PS1 hydrophilic loop (263\u2013407) peptide in vitro (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fluhrer et al., 2004</a>). We reason that lack of domain 1 in this recombinant PS1 fragment does not allow change in the local conformation around domain 3, explaining why S365-S366-S367 are not phosphorylated by PKA in this recombinant PS1. Moreover, a recent structural simulation study has demonstrated that 350\u2013373 residues of PS1 containing domain 3, are subject to major movements (<a href=\"#bib29\">Somavarapu and Kepp, 2016</a>). It is highly likely that naturally occurring domain 1 and domain 2 phosphorylation events may trigger these local spatial rearrangements around the 350\u2013373 residues of PS1. We confirmed that domain 1 or domain 3 phosphorylation-inhibited mutant PS1 were still able to get phosphorylated by PKA at domain 2 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that domain 2 is the first step of the phosphorylation. Consistently, except for domain 2, there are no known PKA substrate consensus sequences (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007</a>) around domain 1 or domain 3 of PS1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

Of note, all FRET-based assays only report relative changes in the proximity between the fluorophores, which does not necessarily translate into comparable changes in the distance between the protein epitopes (PS1 NT-CT and NT-loop, in this case). However, regardless of which assay we use, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKA activation reliably and reproducibly increased the proximity between donor and acceptor fluorophores tagging PS1 NT-CT or NT-loop domains. This strongly suggests that we observe conformational changes in the entire PS1 molecule rather than just a change in the orientation of the donor and acceptor fluorophores."

The cAMP-triggered PKA activation in mouse brain and consecutive conformational change of the wild type PS1 that we report confirms PKA-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at endogenous levels. More importantly, we show up-regulation of the domain 2 (S310) phosphorylation in AD brains, demonstrating that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven PS1 phosphorylation at certain residues may be important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Of note, a wide distribution of the phosphorylated PS1 levels observed in AD cases did not correlate with either age or PMI. Since we have selected a relatively homogenous group of AD brains in terms of pathology, Braak and CERAD scores could not be used to explain the wide distribution. Further investigation is necessary to determine if other factors, such as medications taken, disease duration, ApoE genotype, etc. could have affected the p-PS1 levels."

This induces the pathogenic \u2018closed\u2019 PS1 conformation, and leads to subsequent elevation of the A\u03b242/40 ratio, followed by accelerated A\u03b2 oligomerization or deposition. In line with these findings, we have previously reported that PS1 shows a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation around A\u03b2 plaques in the sporadic AD brain (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wahlster et al., 2013</a>), and that higher A\u03b242/40 ratio leads to the pathogenic conformation of PS1/\u03b3-secretase (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zoltowska et al., 2016</a>). It is conceivable that selective inhibition of PS1 phosphorylation at the domain 1, 2 and/or 3 may present a novel opportunity for therapeutics for AD. Since phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutations on these sites do not affect assembly, maturation, or activity of the PS1/\u03b3-secretase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Matz et al., 2015</a>), inhibition of these PS1 phosphorylation residues would affect neither the cleavage of Notch nor other \u03b3-secretase substrates. On the other hand, inhibition of PKA activity may not be a suitable approach to prevent PS1 phosphorylation, due to multiple PKA substrates and potential off target effects in the brain and in the periphery. In future studies, PS1-targeting agents that selectively block PS1 phosphorylation at either one of the three residues could\u00a0be identified, and their efficacy could be examined in vivo using our novel PS1 conformation assays."

Briefly, a mode-locked Chameleon Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) set at 850 nm or 770 nm was used to excite GFP or Alexa Fluor 488 donor fluorophores, respectively. A Zeiss LSM510 microscope and x63 oil immersion objective was used for the imaging. The donor fluorophore lifetimes were recorded using a high-speed photomultiplier tube (MCP R3809; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) and a time-correlated single-photon counting acquisition board (SPC-830; Becker and Hickl, Berlin, Germany). The baseline lifetime (<i>t</i>1) of the donor fluorophore was measured in the absence of the acceptor fluorophore (negative control, FRET absent). In the presence of the acceptor fluorophore (RFP or Cy3), excitation of the donor fluorophore results in reduced donor emission energy if the donor and acceptor are less than 5\u201310 nm apart (FRET present). This yields characteristic shortening of the donor fluorophore lifetime (<i>t</i>2). The acquired FLIM data were analyzed using SPC Image software (Becker and Hickl, Berlin, Germany) by fitting the data to one (negative control) or two (acceptor present) exponential decay curves. In the latter case, <i>t1</i> of the non-FRETing population was \u2018fixed\u2019 and thus excluded from the analysis, and only shorter, <i>t2</i>, values were analyzed.

The ratio of fluorescence intensity in the 598 nm channel (for RFP) to that in the 513 nm channel (for GFP) or 565 nm (Cy3) to 522 nm (Alexa 488) was used as a readout of the FRET efficiency, which reflects the relative proximity between the donor and acceptor."

First, to determine the excitation wavelength that preferentially excites GFP, the G-PS1-R probe was excited at different wavelengths from 750 nm to 975 nm with a mode-locked titanium/sapphire laser (MaiTai; Spectra-Physics, Fremont, CA). The 900 nm wavelength was chosen to selectively excite GFP, and emitted fluorescence was detected by two emission channels: 495\u2013540 nm range for channel 1 (for GFP) and 575\u2013630 nm for channel 2 (for RFP), on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 MPE microscope (x20 objective, water immersion, NA\u00a0=\u00a01.05)\u00a0(Olympus Corporation,\u00a0Tokyo,\u00a0Japan). Time-lapse images were obtained every 10 s for a duration of 2 min. The average pixel fluorescence intensity after subtraction of the background fluorescence for the whole cell was measured using ImageJ in each channel. The R/G ratio was used as readout of the FRET efficiency. Pseudo-colored images were generated in MATLAB."

The authors use a series of experiments, including with biochemical and FRET experiments to systematically dissect the relationship of different phosphorylation states of the protein and its conformational properties in cells and neurons. The model that emerges is a complex one where Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered PKA activity results in sequential phosphorylation of domains 2, 1 and 3, with S367 phosphorylation being critical for change to a closed conformation. An exciting additional set of experiments directly probe FRET in vivo, supporting the developed model. Finally, an important link to disease was uncovered by the observation that the phosphorylation at S310 (domain 2) increased on average in AD brains. Overall, the work represents a strong combination of interesting tools with many important control experiments to develop a mechanistic model for how a PKA phosphorylation cascade results in PS1 conformational changes including in vivo. The obtained novel mechanistic understanding combined with the observed links of phosphorylation levels in AD suggests potential venues for therapeutic strategies. Therefore, I believe the paper would be of interest to the broad readership of <i>eLife</i>. Some technical issues are noted below that should be addressed by the authors."

The statistical difference for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> was calculated based on the assumption that the mean in KCl treated cells is different from 100% (one-sample t-test). Specifically, we have performed six independent experiments of IP/Western blotting to compare the amount of phosphorylated PS1 between vehicle and KCl<sup>-</sup>treated primary neurons. To be able to pull these experiments together for the statistical analysis (and to avoid great variability in the band\u2019s optical density due to different film exposures among different experiments), 100% was assigned to the vehicle treated sample, and the percent change in phospho-PS1 for KCl treated neurons was analyzed in each experiment. Phosphorylation is a very dynamic process and its detection can be influenced by a number of factors. However, even though the average increase in phospho-PS1 after KCl treatment was relatively small, the increase was consistent and reproducible. For the A\u03b2 ELISA measurements (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>),we have conducted five independent experiments, each containing n= 3 to 8 biological replicates (not just triplicates-octuplets), and thus error bars were generated for both vehicle and drug-treated samples.

Thus, we have tested several reported inhibitors of other kinases (i.e., <i>JNK</i>, PKC, and GSK3\u03b2) and found that unlike KT5720 inhibition of PKA, inhibition of these kinases was not able to prevent the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-induced PS1 conformational change(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To further corroborate the conclusion of the involvement of PKA, we have also used a different \u201cpreferred\u201d PKA inhibitor, H-89, and two different PKA activators, forskolin and 8-Bromo-cAMP, and obtained similar results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B, F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

The inhibitory effect of KT5720 on PKA activity has been verified by immunostaining for PKA specific substrate, phospho-CREB (S133), in adjacent mouse brain sections (new <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>)."

We appreciate and agree with the reviewer\u2019s concern about large complexes of the primary + fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. However, the great advantage of using the antibody-based FRET assay is the ability to monitor changes in the proximity between endogenous PS1/\u03b3-secretase domains. We are aware that all FRET-based assays only report relative changes in the proximity between fluorophores tagging these domains, which does not directly translate into comparable changes in the distance between the protein epitopes (PS1 NT and CT, in this case). Nevertheless, both spectral FRET and FLIM assays we used have proven to be highly reliable and reproducible in reporting consistent changes in the FRET efficiency (reflecting PS1 conformational changes) after experimental treatments."

This indicates that the antibody-based FRET assay reliably reflects PS1 conformational change. Moreover, since increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> shortens both the PS1 NT-CT and PS1 NT-loop proximity, we believe we observe conformational change in the entire PS1 molecule rather than just a change in the orientation of the donor and acceptor fluorophores.

The GFP-NT/RFP-loop distance is approximately 70 \u00c5 in the vehicle-treated condition. Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation (A23187, KCl) leads to the average per neuron change in the ~3~4.5 \u00c5 range."
