We modeled the dynamics of organelle biogenesis and predicted that organelle abundance fluctuations depend strongly on the specific mechanisms that increase or decrease the number of a given organelle. Our model exactly predicts the size of experimentally measured Golgi apparatus and vacuole abundance fluctuations, suggesting that cells tolerate the maximum level of variability generated by the Golgi and vacuole biogenesis pathways. We observe large increases in peroxisome abundance fluctuations when cells are transferred from glucose-rich to fatty acid-rich environments. These increased fluctuations are significantly diminished in mutants lacking peroxisome fission factors, leading us to infer that peroxisome biogenesis switches from de novo synthesis to primarily fission. Our work provides a general framework for exploring stochastic organelle biogenesis and using fluctuations to quantitatively unravel the biophysical pathways that control the abundance of subcellular structures."

We modeled the dynamics of organelle biogenesis and predicted that organelle abundance fluctuations depend strongly on the specific mechanisms that increase or decrease the number of a given organelle. Our model exactly predicts the size of experimentally measured Golgi apparatus and vacuole abundance fluctuations, suggesting that cells tolerate the maximum level of variability generated by the Golgi and vacuole biogenesis pathways. We observe large increases in peroxisome abundance fluctuations when cells are transferred from glucose-rich to fatty acid-rich environments. These increased fluctuations are significantly diminished in mutants lacking peroxisome fission factors, leading us to infer that peroxisome biogenesis switches from de novo synthesis to primarily fission. Our work provides a general framework for exploring stochastic organelle biogenesis and using fluctuations to quantitatively unravel the biophysical pathways that control the abundance of subcellular structures."

In a glucose-rich medium, on the other hand, most new peroxisomes are produced by de novo synthesis. The case of the peroxisome thus highlights the possibility of extending this mathematical framework to explain the creation and destruction of organelles and other subcellular structures in a range of organisms and environments."

But while noise in molecular-scale processes such as gene expression and signal transduction have been examined in great detail, fluctuations have not been systematically characterized at one of the most critical scales of biological organization: compartmentalization of the eukaryotic cell into organelles. Two fundamental questions in systems cell biology are: how precisely does the cell control the number of a given organelle, and how do the mechanisms underlying organelle biogenesis affect this precision? It has been suggested, for example, that the cell may be able to count and tightly control the number of a given organelle (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rafelski and Marshall, 2008</a>). However, we lack comparisons of theoretical calculations of cell-to-cell variability in organelle abundances to experimentally measured organelle abundance distributions."

                        "text": "There are four basic processes resulting in organelle abundance changes that can give rise to fluctuations in organelle number: de novo synthesis from a pre-existing membrane source, fission (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lowe and Barr, 2007</a>), fusion (<a href=\"#bib6\">Denesvre and Malhotra, 1996</a>), and decay such as through partitioning during cell division or autophagy (<a href=\"#bib27\">van der Vaart et al., 2008</a>). In the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Golgi abundance is the result of a steady-state determined by the balance of de novo synthesis and decay through maturation and dilution by cell division (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rossanese et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bevis et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Losev et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</a>); though modest levels of Golgi fusion have been reported (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhave et al., 2014</a>) decay appears to be dominated by maturation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Losev et al., 2006</a>). Vacuolar abundance is thought to be primarily determined by the balance of fission and fusion events (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wickner, 2002</a>), though vacuoles can be generated de novo in mutant yeast strains with impaired vacuole inheritance pathways (<a href=\"#bib1\">Banta et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Catlett and Weisman, 2000</a>) and vacuolar membrane is generated de novo in cells to support vacuolar growth; the quantitative contribution of de novo vacuole biogenesis to vacuole copy number remains uncharacterized in physiological conditions. For other endomembrane organelles, however, the processes underlying abundance changes are even less clear. Peroxisomes, for example, are thought to increase in number by both de novo synthesis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hoepfner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">van der Zand et al., 2012</a>) and fission pathways (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hoepfner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Yan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Motley and Hettema, 2007</a>). Mature peroxisomes do not undergo fusion events (<a href=\"#bib20\">Motley and Hettema, 2007</a>). Furthermore, peroxisome abundances can be actively upregulated by culturing budding yeast cells in medium containing long chain fatty acids such as oleic acid (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mast et al., 2010</a>). We lack a quantitative understanding of whether de novo synthesis or fission dominates the generation of peroxisomes in either steady growth in glucose or during active proliferation in oleic acid."

First, for organelles whose abundance-changing processes were previously characterized\u2014the Golgi apparatus and vacuole\u2014we made quantitatively accurate predictions about the size of organelle abundance fluctuations, leading to the surprising conclusion that the cell tolerates the maximum level of variability in Golgi apparatus and vacuole abundances generated by their biogenesis pathways. Second, for organelles where competing processes could contribute to organelle production but whose relative quantitative importance was unknown\u2014the peroxisome\u2014we used the model and experiment to infer that budding yeast cells switch from de novo synthesis dominated peroxisome production when grown in glucose-containing medium to fission dominated production in oleic acid-containing medium. Our theory of organelle biogenesis is very simple, but despite its simplicity we can gain mechanistic insight into the processes underlying organelle biogenesis. Though our framework suppresses details that could be relevant to organelle copy number regulation, such as when organelles share and thus compete for common biogenesis factors\u2014as in the case of mitochondria and peroxisomes, which share fission factors in common for example\u2014or when different processes affecting organelle copy number interact, such as the Golgi checkpoint regulating the progression of the mammalian cell cycle in which organelle biogenesis and decay would be coupled (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sutterlin, et al., 2002</a>), it is easily extendable to account for such effects. We therefore anticipate it will be a useful framework in which to analyze the pathways underlying organelle creation and destruction and subcellular structures more generally."

It is worth noting that our results are virtually unchanged if we incorporate processes mimicking partitioning of organelles at cell division (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whether through deterministic reduction of organelle copy number by half or by probabilistic binomial partitioning to daughter cells at regular time intervals. To compare the variances of the distributions from different simulation regimes, we calculated the variance of the distribution divided by the mean of the distribution, also known as the Fano factor. We chose to work with the Fano factor, rather than alternative metrics for fluctuations such as the coefficient of variation, because it equals 1 for a Poisson distribution, and so we can readily detect the deviations from Poisson statistics that arise from fission and fusion mediated processes by comparing the observed Fano factor to 1."

In this limit <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> reduces to \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1, reflecting the fact that de novo synthesis and first order decay operating alone corresponds to a Poisson process; one of the hallmarks of the Poisson distribution is that its variance equals its mean, and our approximate equation for the Fano factor reduces exactly to this limit. Thus, we would expect that the Golgi abundance distribution should yield a Fano factor of 1. To test this prediction, we performed spinning disc confocal microscopy on a budding yeast strain expressing the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) fused to the Golgi localized marker protein Anp1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Huh et al., 2003</a>). Anp1-mRFP forms punctate spots (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) marking the presence of individual Golgi, whose number we quantified in each cell to generate a Golgi abundance histogram from which we could calculate the Fano factor. We see excellent agreement between the theory and experiment, as the measured Golgi abundance distribution closely matches the Poisson distribution derived from the experimentally determined mean Golgi abundance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and we measure a Fano factor \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, red bar), in agreement with the theoretically predicted \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, blue bar). Interestingly, when we repeat these measurements for the late Golgi by performing confocal microscopy on a budding yeast strain expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the late Golgi marker protein Sec7, we see virtually identical results with the late Golgi abundance distribution closely matching a Poisson distribution (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and thus yielding a measured Fano factor of \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, in order to reduce potentially confounding extrinsic sources of fluctuations due to variations in the phase of the cell cycle each cell in our population is in, we synchronized the cell cycle phases of the cells in our experiments by arresting them in S-phase of the cell cycle through treatment with 100 mM hydroxyurea. We see that synchronizing the cell cycle phases of the cells we examine by microscopy does not affect the Fano factors of the measured abundance distributions for the Golgi or late Golgi (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>).</n></n></n></n>"

First, budding yeast cells tolerate the maximum level of variability generated by the biogenesis pathways governing Golgi apparatus and vacuole abundance, evidenced by the fact that our model predicted the experimental data with high quantitative accuracy without invoking any feedback control mechanisms to control the number of organelles. Second, as expected from theory, different biogenesis mechanisms generate differing levels of abundance fluctuations. At low mean organelle copy numbers, organelles governed by fission and fusion (vacuole; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) inherently exhibit smaller abundance fluctuations than organelles governed by de novo synthesis and decay (Golgi; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In the case of the vacuole, our fluctuation analysis also sheds light on the quantitative role played by de novo vacuole biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Catlett and Weisman, 2000</a>). In particular, even though up to 50% of the vacuole membrane is generated de novo in a given cell (<a href=\"#bib4\">Catlett and Weisman, 2000</a>), actual vacuole copy number is likely not strongly affected by de novo vacuole biogenesis, consistent with the most widely accepted model of vacuole biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wickner, 2002</a>). Thus we can use experimentally measured fluctuations in organelle abundance to make quantitative inferences about the relative contributions of different organelle biogenesis pathways for cases where the pathways are less understood."

The model we use to calculate Fano factors with (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) uses a simplified peroxisome biogenesis process in which de novo peroxisome biogenesis proceeds as a single step of a mature peroxisome budding from the ER. In an alternative, more biologically detailed model (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) we explicitly keep track of the two vesicle types, one bearing the peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) Pex2 and Pex10 on their surfaces and the other the PMPs Pex13 and Pex14 on their surfaces, that fuse in order to form the peroxisome import machinery that then imports the enzymes that allow the peroxisome to carry out its metabolic functions (<a href=\"#bib28\">van der Zand, et al., 2012</a>). To check that our simplification of de novo peroxisome biogenesis does not introduce significant quantitative errors, we compare the mature peroxisome abundance statistics for the two alternative de novo biogenesis models (one-step vs pre-peroxisomal vesicle fusion), isolated from any contributions from fission. We see that when we set the fission rate to 0 and tune the production rates in the two alternative de novo biogenesis models to produce the same mean peroxisome abundance (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the alternative models of de novo peroxisome biogenesis produce abundance distributions whose Fano factors, \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1.0, are virtually identical to each other and to the value we expected from the Poisson distribution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). From this result we conclude that our original simple, one-step de novo biogenesis pathway model is statistically equivalent to the more detailed model of de novo peroxisome biogenesis that explicitly tracks the creation and fusion dynamics of Pex2/10 and Pex13/14 containing vesicles.</n>"

The PTS1 and Pex3 reporters gave virtually indistinguishable results. After measuring single cell histograms of peroxisomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), we calculate that the Fano factors for the peroxisome abundance distributions for cells cultured in glucose is \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), which is also the peroxisome abundance distribution Fano factor we obtain from yeast cells arrested in S-phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), leading us to infer that the organelle is generated primarily by de novo synthesis in glucose. In cells cultured in oleic acid-containing medium, however, we see a marked increase in the size of the organelle abundance fluctuations for peroxisomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), with a measured Fano factor of \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Importantly, when the rates of pre-peroxisomal vesicle production and fusion are increased to match the increased mean mature peroxisome abundance observed in cells cultured in oleic acid medium in the alternative model of peroxisome biogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>), the alternative model cannot explain this rise in the mature, import-competent peroxisome abundance distribution Fano factor upon transfer of cells to oleic acid containing medium (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Therefore, we conclude that increased pre-peroxisomal vesicle production and fusion cannot explain the rise in the mature peroxisome abundance distribution Fano factor obtained from cells cultured in oleic acid medium. Instead we infer that upon transfer to oleic acid containing medium budding yeast cells primarily generate new peroxisomes by fission of pre-existing peroxisomes.</n></n>"

We calculated the Poisson distribution derived from the experimentally measured mean abundances and find that the predicted distributions, even with no fitting parameters, closely describe the experimentally measured abundance distributions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Peroxisome fission is mediated by the proteins Vps1, Dnm1 and its accessory protein Fis1, with the dominant role played by Vps1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kuravi et al., 2006</a>). We engineered yeast strains containing fluorescently labeled peroxisomes and lacking either Dnm1, Vps1, or Fis1, cultured these cells in oleic acid medium, counted the number of peroxisomes in each cell, and calculated the mean and Fano factor of the peroxisome abundance distributions for each strain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We also repeated these experiments in yeast cells bearing peroxisomes labeled by fusing Pex3 with mRFP and obtained virtually indistinguishable results (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We expect that if fission dominates peroxisome proliferation in cells cultured in oleic acid medium, the mean peroxisome abundance will decrease upon deletion of Vps1, Dnm1 and Fis1, and the Fano factor for the peroxisome abundance distribution for the mutant strains will decrease toward \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1, the value for de novo synthesis dominated production. We find that the mean peroxisome abundance decreases by fourfold in <i>vps1\u0394</i> cells, while the peroxisome abundance distribution Fano factor is reduced threefold. As expected, the effects in <i>fis1\u0394</i> and <i>dnm1\u0394</i> cells are weaker: the mean peroxisome abundance decreases by slightly less than twofold in <i>fis1\u0394</i> cells and roughly 10% in <i>dnm1\u0394</i> cells, while the Fano factors for <i>fis1\u0394</i> and <i>dnm1\u0394</i> cells are reduced by \u223c30% and \u223c15% respectively. Most importantly, the Fano factor measured for <i>vps1\u0394</i> cells is \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1.0, exactly what one would expect for de novo synthesis dominated peroxisome production. These results strongly suggest that fission dominates peroxisome proliferation in wild-type cells cultured in oleic acid medium.</n></n>"

Specifically we find that fission or fusion dominated organelle abundance dynamics, respectively, increase or decrease the width of the organelle abundance distribution, as measured by the variance of the distribution divided by the mean (termed the Fano factor), compared to de novo synthesis dominated organelle biogenesis. We then applied this theory to predict the precision with which single budding yeast cells regulate their abundances of the Golgi apparatus and vacuoles. Our results show that budding yeast cells tolerate the theoretically predicted maximum Fano factors consistent with the known mechanisms of Golgi apparatus and vacuole biogenesis. Having validated that the theory could make quantitatively accurate predictions, we then used it to quantitatively distinguish between de novo synthesis-based and fission-based models of peroxisome biogenesis. Our results showed that the peroxisome abundance distribution is consistent with a model in which the organelle is created primarily by de novo synthesis in glucose-cultured budding yeast cells, but then switch to a noisy, fission-dominated biogenesis when cells are cultured in a fatty acid rich environment in which organelle biogenesis is upregulated. We presented additional lines of evidence for this picture in the form of measuring the fluctuations in peroxisome abundances in mutant yeast strains lacking organelle fission factors. Specifically, consistent with our theoretical prediction, we observed significantly decreased fluctuations in peroxisome abundance when these mutant strains were cultured in fatty acid rich medium compared to our measurements in wild-type cells."

This is in stark contrast to the expectation that cells know how to count and tightly control the number of its various organelles (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rafelski and Marshall, 2008</a>). While some subcellular structures such as the nucleus and centrioles are clearly under the control of strong feedback control mechanisms that suppress fluctuations in their abundances (<a href=\"#bib17\">Marshall, 2007</a>), the cell apparently tolerates the maximum amount of variability in endomembrane organelle abundance generated by a given set of biogenesis mechanisms. It must be noted, however, that while the close match between our theory and experiment without invoking any feedback control implies that any feedback control mechanisms operating on endomembrane organelle copy numbers are no more precise than the biogenesis system could achieve without feedback, we do not explicitly rule out the presence of feedback regulation of the organelle copy numbers. Our model is also very simple, and though we were able to obtain new insights into organelle biogenesis using the model we are likely suppressing details that could affect organelle abundance under certain conditions. For example, it has been recently shown that the rate of peroxisome decay via autophagy depends on the existence of a functional fission pathway (<a href=\"#bib16\">Mao et al., 2014</a>). Nevertheless, it would be trivial to extend our model to incorporate such findings; in the case of fission-dependent autophagy rates, for example, one would simply need to rewrite the decay rate to be a function of the fission rate rather than just being a simple numerical parameter. Such effects would of course require us to take greater care in interpreting the results of the model, but do not invalidate that model; indeed deviations from our simple model could even facilitate discovery of effects such as coupling between the different processes affecting organelle copy number and feedback control of organelle copy numbers. Finally, the consequences of these fluctuations in organelle abundance on the fundamental cell biological processes controlled by these organelles, ranging from secretion to metabolism, remain to be explored. Assessing the dependence of cell biological processes on the abundance of the organelles governing these processes requires systematic, quantitative measurements such as, for example, how the rate of secretion depends on Golgi apparatus abundance or how protein degradation rates depend on vacuole abundances."

Given that peroxisomes appear to switch from de novo synthesis to a noisy, fission dominated creation, it will be particularly interesting to measure the degree to which the abundances of peroxisomes with other metabolic organelles such as the mitochondria or lipid droplets are correlated in single cells. These correlation measurements can allow us to infer the design principles underlying cellular responses to fatty acid rich conditions: anti-correlations in noisy peroxisome and lipid droplet production, for example, would suggest a model in which different cells specialize in lipid metabolism vs storage, while correlated production would favor a model in which only a subset of cells specialize in responding to the environmental change. Along with previously developed frameworks examining variability in organelle number (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hennis and Birky, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Marshall, 2007</a>), our model can aid in examining the functional consequences of stochastic fluctuations in organelle abundance."

This collection includes one set of strains used as organelle references against which the localization of all other fluorescently tagged proteins were scored. Strains from this reference strain set contain the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) fused to a protein that localizes to a specific organelle with high reliability. Where possible, as was the case for endosomes, Golgi apparatus, and peroxisomes, we selected these organelle reference strains for visualization. In order to visualize mature, import-competent peroxisomes, we engineered a yeast strain that expressed a fusion of the peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1), consisting of the amino acids serine, lysine and leucine, to the extreme C terminus of the monomeric, yeast-enhanced Citrine fluorescent protein (yemCitrine). We used fusion PCR to generate a construct consisting of the yemCitrine-PTS1 gene flanked by the promoter of the <i>TEF2</i> gene on the 5\u2032 end and the transcriptional terminator element of the <i>ADH1</i> gene on the 3\u2032 end and integrated this construct into the yeast genome at the <i>HIS3</i> locus. For the case of the vacuole, for which no mRFP reference strain was created, we used a strain from the library that was engineered to contain the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the vacuolar membrane protein Vph1."

For those organelles that appear as discrete foci (endosomes, Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes) individual slices of each image stack were filtered with a Gaussian blurring filter to eliminate high frequency noise in the image, followed by a Laplacian second derivative filter to sharpen edges thereby enhancing the foci. The filtered images were then thresholded to identify those pixels belonging to an organelle. Finally the organelles could be assigned to single cells using the manually segmented image. This analysis was carried out in MATLAB. All organelle identification and assignment to single cells was manually verified. In the second case, where the organelle (vacuole) appears as a discrete ring, all quantification of number of organelles per cell was done manually."

In Model 2, we replace the first order decay term with a term that reduces the organelle copy number by half in regular intervals, thereby mimicking organelle partitioning upon cell division. Reducing the organelle copy number by half upon each division of a parent cell into 2 daughter cells is necessary for all cells in the population to achieve steady state organelle copy numbers. Furthermore, studies of vacuole and peroxisome partitioning upon cell division that indicate that partitioning occurs much more equitably than expected from a random binomial process (Weisman et al., J Cell Biol 1987; Fagaransu et al., Biochim Biophys Acta 2006), motivating the approximation of partitioning by reducing organelle copy number by exactly one half. In Model 3, we replace the first order decay term with a term that partitions organelles into the daughter cells with probability p = 1/2, mimicking binomial partitioning upon cell division. Finally, to simplify our analysis, we focus our simulations only on the case where de novo synthesis takes place, setting k<sub>fission</sub> = k<sub>fusion</sub> = 0. We then ran the simulations of Model 2 and Model 3 10,000 times, built up the organelle copy number distributions resulting from each model and plot the Fano factors of these distributions below."

First, for the Golgi apparatus and the peroxisome, the mean abundance is high enough (empirically roughly 4 and higher) that the dynamics of organelle loss in our first order decay approximation do not substantially differ quantitatively from the dynamics achieved through partitioning of organelles at a defined time. Second, for the Golgi apparatus and the vacuole, the cell division timescale is slow compared to the timescales of the other processes (de novo synthesis and maturation for the Golgi, fission and fusion for the vacuole) affecting organelle copy number. Thus, these other processes come to a steady state on the time scale of cell division and only a very small fraction of cells we measure will deviate from this steady state due to partitioning at cell division."

However, since peroxisome abundance decays primarily through dilution from cell division, the cell cycle arrest experiment suggested by the referee that we carried out above will not only arrest the cells in a specific cell cycle stage but will also reduce the peroxisome decay rate. The reduced peroxisome decay rate thus increases peroxisome copy numbers in the cell cycle stage the cells are arrested in even if there were no cell cycle dependent de novo synthesis rate at all."

If, for example, the de novo peroxisome synthesis rate were twice as large in the G1-phase of the cell cycle as in the other phases, then the measured peroxisome abundance distribution would be the convolution of two Poisson distributions, each parameterized by the cell cycle phase specific de novo synthesis rate. Doubling each cell cycle phase specific de novo synthesis rate would double the mean peroxisome abundance, but also pull apart the two underlying Poisson distributions since the mean of the G1-phase specific distribution would increase by much more in absolute terms than the mean of the non G1-phase distribution; indeed in the most extreme case the resulting peroxisome abundance distribution could even become bimodal, with peaks representing the G1-phase and non-G1-phase specific de novo synthesis constants. The change in the Fano factor upon the increased de novo synthesis rate is thus directly proportional to the ratio of the de novo synthesis rates in G1 phase versus non-G1 phase of the cell cycle. In glucose-containing medium, since we obtain a near-doubling of the mean peroxisome abundance in diploid cells without any accompanying increase in the peroxisome abundance distribution Fano factor, we conclude that peroxisome de novo synthesis is unlikely to occur with a cell-cycle-dependent rate."

In this case, as described above, the peroxisome abundance distribution measured from asynchronous cultures would be a convolution of two or more Poisson distributions and result in a higher measured Fano factor even in the absence of fission. To test this possibility, we binned our image data taken from cells expressing fluorescently labeled peroxisomes cultured in oleic acid medium into two categories: one category for cells without a bud, which represent cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle; and another category for cells with either a small or large bud, which represent cells in the S-phase, G2-phase, or M-phase of the cell cycle. If a cell cycle dependent de novo synthesis rate were to explain our data then both categories of cells would exhibit peroxisome abundance distributions with Fano factors \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 1, the hallmark of de novo synthesis driven biogenesis, though presumably with different means. If either category exhibited a peroxisome abundance distribution with Fano factor \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> &gt; 1 the data would be inconsistent with purely de novo synthesis driven peroxisome biogenesis. The subsample of our dataset containing unbudded cells (N = 111 cells) gives rise to a peroxisome abundance distribution with Fano factor \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 2.2 +/- 0.3 while the subsample containing budded cells (N=33 cells) gives rise to a peroxisome abundance distribution with Fano factor factor \u03c3<sup>2</sup>/<n> = 2.0 +/- 0.4. This data suggests that substantial fission occurs in all phases of the cell cycle and thus we need not invoke a cell cycle dependent de novo synthesis rate to explain the increase in the Fano factor of the peroxisome abundance distribution measured from our asynchronous populations.</n></n></n></n>"

We repeated our organelle counting experiments on a budding yeast strain expressing the Sec7 protein fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) taken from the Huh et al. genome-wide GFP-tagged yeast strain library. We would expect that for the late Golgi, the abundance distribution would be governed by a balance between maturation of the early Golgi, which should be described by stochastic de novo synthesis, and loss through further maturation and as well as cell division, which should be described by first order decay. Thus, as in the case of the Anp1-mRFP labeled Golgi apparatus, we would expect that the Sec7-GFP labeled late Golgi abundance distribution would closely follow Poisson statistics with a Fano factor of 1. As shown below, we see exactly this with the experimentally measured late Golgi abundance distribution excellently matched by the Poisson distribution calculated using the experimentally measured late Golgi copy number, thus using no fitting parameters."
