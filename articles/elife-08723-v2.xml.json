                    "text": "The architecture of corticobasal ganglia pathways allows for many routes to inhibit a planned action: the hyperdirect pathway performs fast action cancellation and the indirect pathway competitively constrains execution signals from the direct pathway. We present a novel model, principled off of basal ganglia circuitry, that differentiates control dynamics of reactive stopping from intrinsic no-go decisions. Using a nested diffusion model, we show how reactive braking depends on the state of an execution process. In contrast, no-go decisions are best captured by a failure of the execution process to reach the decision threshold due to increasing constraints on the drift rate. This model accounts for both behavioral and functional MRI (fMRI) responses during inhibitory control tasks better than alternative models. The advantage of this framework is that it allows for incorporating the effects of context in reactive and proactive control into a single unifying parameter, while distinguishing action cancellation from no-go decisions."

We present a novel model, principled off of basal ganglia circuitry, that differentiates control dynamics of reactive stopping from intrinsic no-go decisions. Using a nested diffusion model, we show how reactive braking depends on the state of an execution process. In contrast, no-go decisions are best captured by a failure of the execution process to reach the decision threshold due to increasing constraints on the drift rate. This model accounts for both behavioral and functional MRI (fMRI) responses during inhibitory control tasks better than alternative models. The advantage of this framework is that it allows for incorporating the effects of context in reactive and proactive control into a single unifying parameter, while distinguishing action cancellation from no-go decisions."

You can decide not to swing the bat at the incoming ball if you see that it is a wild pitch that will be way outside the strike zone; this is known as reactive control. Alternatively, you may decide not to move because you were coached never to swing at the first pitch (proactive control). It is thought that the brain processes these signals separately with reactive control being a quick way to put the brakes on a planned movement and proactive control being a more specific suppression of unwanted actions.

These are generally considered to be separable control signals, with proactive suppression being a slower, action-specific process (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aron et al., 2011</a>) and reactive inhibition being a fast global suppression mechanism (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aron et al., 2014</a>). However, it has been argued that a purely reactive form of stopping is unlikely to generalize to many real-world scenarios and, in some cases, response inhibition may result from a combination of proactive and reactive efforts (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aron, 2011</a>). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that these processes interact, with proactive signals modulating the efficacy of reactive stopping (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Forstmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Irlbacher et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jahfari et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stuphorn and Emeric, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Belle et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">van Maanen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zandbelt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zandbelt and Vink, 2010</a>).

In contrast, reactive braking has been linked to premotor and prefrontal areas in the right hemisphere, as well as the subthalamic nucleus, that together compose the hyperdirect pathway (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aron et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cavanagh et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rodriguez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Swann et al., 2012</a>). While in primates the control signals of the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways all project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the primary output of the basal ganglia, it remains unclear whether these signals converge on the same pool of neurons or run in parallel of each other. At the cellular level, successful reactive inhibition depends on the relative timing of descending execution signals from the striatum and fast-braking signals from the hyperdirect pathway at the output of the basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that these two forms of control may, in fact, converge before they continue on to the thalamus."

To capture this, we designed a novel decision model with nested drifting diffusion processes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section). The motor\u00a0decision is modeled as a single variable (hereafter, referred to as the execution process) that is assumed to reflect the differential activity between the direct (facilitation) and indirect (suppression) pathways; that is, as facilitatory systems are recruited more than the suppressive systems, the execution process accumulates toward the decision boundary. The cancellation decision (hereafter, referred to as the braking process) is modeled as a latent competing signal, assumed to originate from the hyperdirect (brake) pathway and whose starting state depends on the state of the facilitation versus\u00a0suppression competition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In this dependent process model (DPM), a response is realized only if the execution process reaches its decision boundary before the braking process reaches its decision boundary and before the trial time window has expired. Otherwise the model does not produce a response.\u00a0Also, since it has been shown that the physiological dynamics of inhibitory control networks are best reflected by models where the race to the decision boundary has dynamic, nonlinear properties (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ratcliff and Frank, 2012</a>), our model also includes a dynamic\u00a0gain that dynamically accelerates the execution process\u00a0as it approaches the time boundary (i.e.,\u00a0the deadline for making a response)."

Indeed, our DPM is conceptually similar to the interactive race model\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Boucher et al., 2007</a>), whereby a response is suppressed by the onset of a braking signal that directly inhibits the execution process,\u00a0preventing it from reaching the action threshold. The interactive race and DPMs make fundamentally different assumptions about the nature of the interaction between the execution and braking processes. The predictions of both the dependent process and interactive race\u00a0models can be contrasted against the traditional independent race model\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Logan et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Logan et al., 2014</a>) where the outcome of the decision is determined by a parallel race between the execution and braking processes."

The task parameters were specifically designed to allow for a competition between proactive and reactive decisions, rather than adapted on a trial-by-trial basis in order to isolate only reactive stopping decisions. On each trial, subjects saw a blue bar \u2018fill\u2019 upwards toward a target line on the screen at a constant rate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section). On go trials, the bar would intersect the target line at 500\u00a0ms after trial onset. Participants were instructed to stop the bar by pressing a key. The closer the bar was stopped to the target line, the higher the financial reward on that trial. In a subset of trials (stop trials; 45% trials), the bar would stop before it intersected with the target (i.e., the stop signal) and participants were instructed to not make a response on these trials. Successful decisions were rewarded and incorrect decisions were penalized. All participants were run in two versions of the experiment: a baseline condition (baseline) and a condition where the feedback signals were more restrictive on accuracy to the target and higher penalties for failing to stop when required while higher rewards were given for successful stops\u00a0(caution). Similar manipulations on feedback have been shown to modulate stopping performance in the stop-signal task\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">Leotti and Wager, 2010</a>; Shenoy and Yu, 2011). As expected, in both conditions it was harder for participants to withhold their responses when the stop signal was delivered later in the trial (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In addition, changing the structure of the feedback promoted more cautious responding, resulting in more successful stopping at later stop signal delays (SSDs) and slower RTs on go trials."

The DPM provided a better fit to both the correct and incorrect RT distributions\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) than either the interactive or independent race models. In addition, the DPM fell within the 95% confidence interval of the mean probability of stopping in each SSD condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), whereas the independent and interactive race models overpredicted the probability of stopping at the longest and shortest delays, respectively.

If the execution signal is determined by a dynamic competition between direct (facilitation) and indirect (suppression) signals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; see also [<a href=\"#bib56\">Wei et al., 2015]</a>), then making a decision to not execute an action may reflect a scenario where the indirect pathways provide enough active suppression of the direct pathway so that no response is triggered. In other words, a proactive no-go decision occurs when the system fails to accrue enough evidence to reach the execution decision boundary."

The overall design was largely similar to the reactive paradigm with the following major changes. First, only one SSD was used. This occurred at 450\u00a0ms and is too late for it to be used as a reactive stopping cue. Second, on each trial the color of the rising bar indicated the probability that the stop signal would be delivered (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>): a purely red bar indicates 0% go probability (i.e., stop\u00a0signal would be presented on every trial), purely blue bar indicates 100% go probability (i.e., stop\u00a0signal would never be presented), and shades of purple indicate mixture probabilities. Rather than rely on the very late reactive stop\u00a0signal, subjects were told to use the proactive cue to decide whether to execute the response or withhold it. Since subjects were asked to make an informed guess, all our analysis collapsed across both correct and incorrect trials."

Also, as expected, participants were faster with higher certainty of a go trial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). It is worth noting that all RTs in this proactive task were much faster than the responses in the reactive task (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), confirming that subjects weren\u2019t relying on the delayed stop signal to make a reactive decision. Thus, this second experiment was able to get subjects to make a fundamentally different decision than in the reactive task, while keeping most other experimental conditions (e.g., sensory signals) constant. Unlike the reactive task, we did not observe a significant influence of demands for control on either the decision curve (<i>F</i>[3.43, 205.8] = 0.76, p=0.53) or response times (<i>F</i>[2.28,132.32] = 0.81, p=0.46) in the proactive task."

To test this we correlated the points of subjective equality (PSE) across subjects, between the reactive (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and proactive (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure\u00a05B</a>) conditions. The PSE reflects the point at which the psychometric curve crosses 50% chance (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section). Collapsing across both the baseline and caution conditions, we found a small but significant correlation in a subject\u2019s reactive control abilities and their proactive decisions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, r = 0.35, p &lt;0.006, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.06). Thus, overall reactive task performance explains \u223c6% of the variance in the proactive condition, which is consistent with a model where these two abilities reflect separable upstream control signals that eventually converge on common output pathways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

Therefore, we fit the same four models that were fit against the reactive task (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), leaving the specific model parameters free across each go trial probability condition (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section). Since there were no differences between the baseline and caution conditions, all data was collapsed together to increase statistical power of the model fits. We found that the drift modulation model was able to capture the proactive no-go decision dynamics significantly better than the other models based on the AIC and BIC scores (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and general patterns of speed and response\u00a0proportions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This means that as the go trial probability decreased, the drift rate of the execution process decreased to the point that the decision boundary was often not intersected by the end of the trial. Thus, we can reliably capture the dynamics of a no-go decision as a modulation of competing\u00a0facilitatory and suppressive signals that results in a failure to accumulate enough evidence to make a\u00a0decision. This provides a fundamental distinction between the control mechanisms of stopping and deciding not to go."

Previous fMRI studies have reliably shown that the magnitude of\u00a0activation\u00a0in cortical decision-making areas approximates the cumulative sum of evidence over time as the decision process approaches its threshold\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Basten et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ho et al., 2009</a>). While the temporal and spatial imprecision of fMRI precludes direct comparison of neural and computational mechanisms\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib48\">Simen, 2012</a>), the overall magnitude of the signal can be taken as a proxy for the duration and distance-to-bound of the decision process\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Forstmann et al., 2010</a>). By integrating the execution process over time we compared\u00a0model-predicted activation levels for both go and no-go decisions (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section) with the task-evoked blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response measured by fMRI\u00a0in corresponding conditions of our proactive task.

The main effect of trial outcome\u00a0(i.e.,\u00a0'go'\u00a0greater\u00a0than\u00a0'no-go') is due to the fact that, on average, withheld responses result from lower levels of evidence accumulation than executed responses (i.e., trials in which the accumulated evidence reaches the threshold). Within \u2018no-go\u2019 decision trials, the increase in drift-rate with higher go-trial certainty leads to higher levels of sub-threshold evidence accumulation at the end of the trial. On the other hand, the increase in drift-rate\u00a0with\u00a0go-trial\u00a0certainty leads to a faster rise-to-threshold\u00a0on\u00a0'go'\u00a0decision\u00a0trials and thus produces slightly less summed activity than executed responses in lower go-trial probability conditions. \u00a0In contrast\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0drift\u00a0modulation\u00a0model, the onset modulation model predicts that\u00a0in addition to a main effect of trial\u00a0outcome, increasing the probability of a go-trial should increase the magnitude of the BOLD response for\u00a0both 'no-go' and 'go'\u00a0decision trials.\u00a0This is due to the fact that there is overall more time for the process to accumulate with earlier onsets, that is, higher go-trial probabilities.\u00a0Thus, in high go-trial probability conditions both \u2018go\u2019 and \u2018no-go\u2019 decisions arise from longer cumulative processing time than in low go-trial probability conditions, and therefore predict greater activation. This\u00a0model\u00a0also\u00a0predicts\u00a0the effect of go-trial probability should be roughly equivalent for withheld and executed responses, which is a contrasting prediction from the drift modulation model which predicts a greater modulation wtih\u00a0go-trial probability on 'no-go'\u00a0decision trials. Finally, the boundary modulation model predicts that increasing go-trial probability will decrease the BOLD response, along with a general decrease in BOLD signal during 'go' decisions. This is because conditions with\u00a0lower boundary heights\u00a0(i.e.,\u00a0greater certainty of a go-trial), allow less time for the process to be active\u00a0and a shorter distance to travel\u00a0and\u00a0thus\u00a0predict lower levels of summed activity."

Healthy subjects (N=20) performed a modified version of the proactive task for the MRI environment (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section). In order to assure that no covert actions were elicited during trials in which a key press was not recorded, we used a modified EMG over the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the responding hand to record muscle activity (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement\u00a01A</a>) so as to identify finger movements on all trials. Viable EMG data was available for 14 subjects and in these subjects suprathreshold muscle activity was only observed in &lt;1% (mean = 0.71%, max 4%) of the trials where no key press was detected. The number of missed key presses was equally distributed across go trial probability conditions.

After adjusting for cluster size (k\u00a0 &gt;\u00a040) and multiple comparisons (q\u00a0 &lt;\u00a00.05) we identified 24 clusters with differential modulation during no-go responses than go responses (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Therefore,\u00a0we extracted out the condition-specific responses in each region of interest (ROI), for all subjects, using a fivefold cross-validation with anatomical priors so as to avoid performing circular inference. Consistent with our predictions, activity in the right caudate nucleus and the left and right thalamic ROIs show a main effect of decision type on evoked activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; caudate: F(1,32) = 2.69, p=0.03; left thalamus: F(1,32) = 4.01, p=0.003; right thalamus: F(1,32) = 4.50, p=0.001). In the thalamus ROI responses selectively scaled with go trial probability, even in the trials where no key press was detected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; left: F(2,32) = 4.13, p=0.025; right: F(3,32) = 3.67, p=0.037), while this effect was not significant in the\u00a0caudate ROI (F2, 32] = 1.77, p=0.19). More importantly the interaction between go trial probability and decision type was significant for both thalamus ROIs (left: F[2,32] = 4.30, p=0.022; right: F[2,32] = 4.13, p=0.025), but not the caudate (F[2,32] = 1.22, p=0.31).

In the IFG, we observed a lateralized interaction between go trial probability and response type in the right hemisphere (F[2,38] = 4.05, p=0.027), but not in the left (F[2,38] = 1.45, p=0.25). This rightward lateralization is consistent with previous reports of the right IFG being implicated in control of the hyperdirect pathway (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aron et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Belle et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zandbelt and Vink, 2010</a>). The SMA also exhibited\u00a0an interaction between go trial probability and response type in both the right (F[2,38] = 4.86, p=0.014) and left (F[2,38] = 4.52, p=0.019) hemispheres. These results are consistent with previous studies implicating SMA and preSMA in uncertainty-related and conflict-related modulation of boundary height in the traditional drift-diffusion model, achieved through connections with the striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Forstmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Frank et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jahfari et al., 2012</a>). This finding supports the notion that modulating the execution drift-rate in our model reflects similar computations as adapting the threshold in the traditional drift-diffusion models without a dynamic pressure on the drift rate. Thus, activation patterns in distributed corticobasal ganglia circuits are largely consistent with the predicted responses from our computational model of competing decision dynamics on execution process drift rates."

First, a DPM, where the initial state of the action cancellation signal depends on the current state of the execution decision, provides a much better fit to reactive stopping performance than\u00a0models where these two processes are independent. As we showed, this dependency is similar to the interactive race model, proposed by <a href=\"#bib8\">Boucher et al. (2007)</a> to describe inhibitory control of saccadic eye movements, in which an accumulating go signal is directly suppressed by a much stronger stop signal, thereby deterministically canceling subthreshold actions. In this model the critical parameter for determining stopping performance is the delay between a stop cue and when the stop signal is actually registered. In contrast, the critical parameters in our model are the race between the execution and braking processes and the state of the execution process when the stop signal occurs. This dependency is largely consistent with the circuit-level architecture of corticobasal ganglia pathways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Utter and Basso, 2008</a>) where the direct (facilitation), indirect (suppression), and hyperdirect (brake) pathways converge at the primary output nucleus of the basal ganglia (i.e., the GPi in primates). Here we show, for the first time, that this dependency better fits behavioral data in the reactive task than the interactive race model, suggesting that there may not be equivalent control dynamics between oculomotor and manual response decisions."

(2013) found that, in rodents, an external stop cue reliably produces a burst of activity in the STN, but only results in a successful stop when this signal reaches the substantia nigra pars reticulata (similar to the GPi in primates). Consistent with classic race models of action cancellation, early activity of movement encoding striatal neurons was sufficient to predict whether hyperdirect stop signaling would reach the substantia nigra pars reticulata in time to prevent a response, rising rapidly on fast go and failed stop trials and more gradually on slow go and successful stop trials. Parts of this action cancellation signal from the STN may also be relegated via arkypallidal pathways (orange pathways in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) that relay inhibitory signals back up to the striatal neurons, offering a route for hyperdirect signals to terminate action plans within the striatum itself (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dodson et al., 2015</a>). Both temporal competition between hyperdirect and descending striatal signals at the GPi and cancellation via arkypallidal pathways are largely consistent with the DPM presented here."

Our framing of the execution process as a dynamic competition between direct and indirect pathways is motivated by the architecture of corticobasal ganglia pathways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), as well as recent electrophysiological and modeling evidence showing that cortical inputs to the striatum dynamically control the balance of direct and indirect signals throughout the basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wei et al., 2015</a>). There are many possible routes for a competition between direct\u2013indirect pathways with the basal ganglia. First, given that STN and globus pallidus projections terminate on common outputs, it is possible that a simple summation of inhibitory and excitatory signals at the GPi itself results in a separate race for disinhibiting pallidal projections to the thalamus. It is also possible that branching collaterals from direct pathway neurons that terminate on indirect pathway neurons in the globus pallidus (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wei et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu et al., 2000</a>) would allow for crosstalk between the two major striatal efferent pathways. Finally, as mentioned previously, indirect pathway output, at the level of the STN, may be relayed back up to striatal direct pathway cells via arkypallidal connections (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dodson et al., 2015</a>). Disambiguating which of these mechanisms may proactively modulate the accumulation of evidence toward an execution decision requires careful physiological analysis within each pathway itself and is left to future studies."

For example, proactive inhibition has been associated with hemodynamic responses in the dorsal striatum (<a href=\"#bib37\">Majid et al., 2013</a>), interpreted as an increased recruitment of the indirect pathway to suppress an action. Yet, electrophysiological recordings in rodents find concurrent activation of both the direct and indirect pathways during action initiation and cancellation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cui et al., 2013</a>). Both of these findings are consistent within the context of our model, in which the relative concurrent activation of direct and indirect pathways determines rate of integration toward the execution decision threshold."

While drift rate and threshold modulations have qualitatively dissociable effects in a standard two-choice drift-diffusion model\u2014increasing the decision threshold leads to a speed-accuracy trade-off, whereas increasing drift rate has a positive effect on both outcome measures\u2014this distinction does not hold true for our DPM. Rather, slowing the rate of the execution process leads to greater stopping accuracy at the expense of response speed. This is consistent with speed-accuracy trade-off produced by raising the response threshold in traditional drift-diffusion models. Also, <a href=\"#bib43\">Ratcliff and Frank (2012)</a> found that synthetic behavioral data generated by a basal ganglia neural network were best described by a drift-diffusion model with a decision threshold that collapsed at a rate that depended on the conflict between choices. Here we included a similar mechanism, but as a dynamic gain signal applied to the execution process, and compared models in which response uncertainty modulated its drift-rate, onset time, or the combination of these parameters. Our findings suggest that in the presence of these temporal dynamics, contextual factors like control demands impose a stronger influence on the rate of the growing urgency to respond than on the onset of the decision process. This finding is consistent with the context-dependent rate decay in the decision threshold found by <a href=\"#bib43\">Ratcliff and Frank (2012)</a>. However, by capturing these dynamics in the accumulating process itself, the DPM allows for incorporating the effects of context in reactive (i.e., penalty and reward structure) and proactive (i.e., probabilistic expectations) control in a single unifying parameter (i.e., execution drift rate), while at the same time distinguishing between action cancellation and no-go decision processes."

Indeed, both tasks produced RT distributions that appeared more normal in shape and lacked a positive skew, adding justification to the assumption of a dynamic bias in the execution process. Compared with the reactive task (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), however, proactive RT distributions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were much narrower, spiking near the end of the trial with a slight negative skew. Correspondingly, best-fit parameter estimates show a muc stronger influence of the dynamic bias signal on \u2018go\u2019 decisions in the proactive than reactive task, suggesting that gain adaptation is differentially recruited during these two forms of inhibitory control. Future studies will be necessary to investigate the contextual constraints and neural plausibility of nonstationary decision mechanisms, particularly with respect to their implementation in corticobasal ganglia networks."

This is particularly true in cortical neurons that plan the action (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pouget et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Purcell et al., 2010</a>).\u00a0However, here we show that the onset modulation model did not fit the behavior or imaging results as well as the drift modulation model. Our model was specifically designed to capture constraints in corticobasal ganglia systems, which are upstream of motor execution neurons, such as those recorded in previous countermanding tasks. Thus, it is possible that the dynamics described here are the mechanism for the delayed onset of activity in downstream cortical motor areas, that is, the onset of action selection neurons happens when the decision processes from the basal ganglia reach their boundary, which becomes delayed as the rate of the execution process is decelerated by the indirect pathway. It is also well established by now that subjects do not rely on a single mechanism for incorporating context into the decision process\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Heitz and Schall, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Standage et al., 2011</a>). While the pattern of observed BOLD responses was generally consistent with the drift modulation predictions, it did share some characteristics with the predictions of the onset modulation model (i.e., increasing activity with go trial probability on \u2018no-go\u2019 trials and greater overall activation on \u2018go\u2019 trials), allowing for the possibility that some subjects may\u00a0alternate\u00a0between strategies of modulating the drift and onset across trials or use both simultaneously. Only careful analysis of coincident electrophysiological recordings in key basal ganglia and cortical regions will fully confirm the compatibility of the two models."

On stop cue trials, a response is suppressed by the onset of a braking process that directly inhibits the execution process, preventing it from reaching the action threshold. The original model was selectively parameterized to fit distinct physiological properties of the oculomotor system in order to test specific predictions about the neural dynamics of this network during an inhibitory saccade task. Here we adapt the model to preserve the basic mechanisms by which a response is executed and suppressed and is a useful model to compare against the DPM. The interactive race model is composed of a single absorbing bound (<i>a</i>), marking the distance from 0 that the execution process must travel in order to elicit a response. The execution process follows <a href=\"#equ3\">Equations 3</a> and <a href=\"#equ4\">4</a>\u00a0above. The braking process in this model is also parameterized by its onset delay (<i>sso</i>) and drift\u00a0rate (<i>v<sub>b</sub></i>), so that\u00a0the absolute onset of the braking process occurs at <i>tr\u00a0</i>ms from the start of the trial and the absolute onset of the braking process occurs at <i>sso</i>\u00a0ms from the presentation of the stop cue (<i>ss<sub>tr</sub></i> = <i>SSD sso</i>). Both execution and braking processes have positive drift\u00a0rates. On trials in which the execution process has not reached the action threshold by <i>ss<sub>tr</sub></i>, the accumulating signal of the braking process is subtracted from the execution signal until the end of the trial."

RT quantiles were then calculated for each aggregate vector of RTs and appended to the vector of response probabilities before being submitted to the cost function.

First, an initial set of parameters was obtained for each model type by leaving all parameters free and using the basin\u00a0hopping algorithm provided by SciPy (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanco-Silva, 2013</a>) to identify a global error basin. The best fitting parameters are then optimized using a Nelder\u2013Mead simplex algorithm (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nelder and Mead, 1965</a>) which explores the basin reached in the previous step for its local minimum. Basin\u00a0hopping seeks to identify a set of parameters at the global minimum of a cost function by stochastically searching the parameter space for error basins, which is especially desirable when there is a high degree of the variability in the model error. However, stochastic search methods are not well suited for fine-grained error minimization which is best achieved by gradient based methods like the simplex algorithm. For reactive models, this average cost function is similar to that shown in <a href=\"#equ8\">Equation 8</a> but without the summation over j conditions and with all empirical statistics representing the average value collapsing baseline and caution conditions. For proactive models, this cost function becomes a single response probability, taken as the average response probability across cues, and five RT quantiles calculated by averaging the quantiles for the high and low go trial probability conditions. At this stage the basin\u00a0hopping algorithm is iterated a maximum of 100 times or until it returns 40 failed attempts to find a new global minimum"

First, the average parameter estimates are submitted to another global optimization procedure in which all parameters are held constant except for the parameter of interest that is optimized individually to each condition of interest using the same basin\u00a0hopping parameters as above. This is performed prior to the final simplex optimization to avoid initiating the parameter(s) at the same value for each condition being fit, as we found this to increase the chances that the Nelder\u2013Mead simplex terminates very close to its initial state and overall generally worse fits. The final simplex minimization was run holding all parameters constant except for those of interest that were left free to vary across conditions. For all models, this procedure was run from start to finish at least three times and the model with the lowest AIC was selected. This includes all compared models of contextual modulation in the reactive and proactive tasks, meaning that constant parameters are held constant across conditions, but not models. By running every model through the same global and local optimization routine multiple times, this avoids the issue of biasing model selection to favor those that are simply better able to explain the data within the constraints of a single set of constant parameters. Thus, parameter estimates listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1 and 2</a> for parameters held constant across conditions reflect the best-fit parameters to the average data for the best-of-three model."

Based on the assumption that the neural activity in regions involved in a competitive execution decision will reflect information about the time and distance of the accumulation process, we generated BOLD predictions from each of the models using the following procedure. For each model, the best fitting parameter estimates from the proactive task were used to simulate 100 trials for\u00a0each\u00a0go trial probability condition. Because we were interested in comparing fundamental differences in how each model predicted BOLD activity across conditions rather than trial-wise or subject-wise predictions, simulations were performed using the best fit parameters from the behavioral experiment rather than performing separate fits to behavior from the scanning session. This was done to take advantage of the fact that the behavioral effects of the task were similar inside and outside the scanner, but with significantly more trials/observations in the behavioral-only session."

For each condition the predicted BOLD magnitude was calculated by taking the cumulative sum of the full execution process over the length of each trial, then averaging across trials. By taking the cumulative sum of the execution process this effectively represents the distance-to-threshold and time-to-threshold of each trial as a single area-under-the-curve estimate. Taking the average area-under-the-curve across trials can then be compared with the observed magnitude of the BOLD response in the corresponding condition."

Finally, they show that neural activity in plausible convergence/output structures for the decision process (caudate, thalamus) is consistent with patterns predicted by their model."

This was applied to model various selective response inhibition tasks as well as stop signal tasks, including the cited Schmidt et al. data. (See also Ratcliff &amp; Frank (2012) for DDM simulations linking STN to threshold changes, and various empirical studies showing cortical- &gt;STN involvement in decision threshold regulation in conflict tasks (e.g. Cavanagh et al., 2011, Green et al. 2013)). This is also related to the more general work in psychology and neuroscience suggesting that probabilities affect baseline-threshold distance (e.g. see Carpenter &amp; Williams, 1995; Platt &amp; Glimcher 1999). Thus you could add a model in which the \"colour of the bar\" affects the threshold as an alternative model, and consider the relation to the above findings/models in Discussion."

The execution threshold has a straightforward interpretation when considering implementations of the DDM and related models in other domains, but the braking threshold (i.e., commitment to non-action) is less straightforward to interpret. While this has precedent in earlier race models in the action cancellation literature, I think it would be fair for someone to wonder whether it would be more parsimonious to implement the current model with a single absorbing boundary (execution) rather than two? Could the authors comment on the potential value in having this lower boundary as a termination point (rather than, e.g., simply allowing paths to cross it and return, and/or simply imposing this as a minimum on theta values)?"

This collapses across important information in the RT distribution, and the history in modeling choice RT with the full distributions has shown that the shape of these distributions is particularly important for making inferences about underlying cognitive processes (Ratcliff has many excellent papers on this). We would be more comfortable interpreting the conclusions made (e.g. that striatum affects drift rate rather than thresholds) with more serious consideration given to the fitting. And this will likely be especially important for disentangling the various alternatives noted above in point 1. Although you might not have the full likelihood of your model that would easily allow full Bayesian parameter estimation as in the HDDM, there are alternative approaches, the most straightforward of which would be to jointly optimize the quantiles and response proportions (i.e. find parameters that minimize a cost function equal to the summed (and appropriately weighted) differences between the two sets of quantiles, and response probabilities). Another approach would be to construct the likelihood of your model using simulation methods, see a recent PBR paper (by Turner, with code available). Aside from disentangling alternative models with more sensitive RT distributions, there really isn't need for a stochastic model if you only fit the mean, and the bootstrapping process doesn't help here (just effectively puts a kernel over the summary statistics with variance proportional to the number of points you resample). Also please include tables of average fit parameters across the different studies/conditions. Finally when performing model comparisons, why not use model fit statistics instead of paired t-tests?"

While the boundary modulation model did capture the behavioral data quite well, it still under-performed the drift modulation model in fits to behavioral data and made predictions that ran counter to the task-related fMRI dynamics observed in output pathways of the basal ganglia (i.e., thalamus). We should point out that the inclusion of the exponential parameter in the execution process drift rate implements a similar process as a collapsing bound on the decision times (Ratcliff & Frank, 2012).

We would be more comfortable interpreting the conclusions made (e.g. that striatum affects drift rate rather than thresholds) with more serious consideration given to the fitting. And this will likely be especially important for disentangling the various alternatives noted above in point 1. Although you might not have the full likelihood of your model that would easily allow full Bayesian parameter estimation as in the HDDM, there are alternative approaches, the most straightforward of which would be to jointly optimize the quantiles and response proportions (i.e. find parameters that minimize a cost function equal to the summed (and appropriately weighted) differences between the two sets of quantiles, and response probabilities). Another approach would be to construct the likelihood of your model using simulation methods, see a recent PBR paper (by Turner, with code available). Aside from disentangling alternative models with more sensitive RT distributions, there really isn't need for a stochastic model if you only fit the mean, and the bootstrapping process doesn't help here (just effectively puts a kernel over the summary statistics with variance proportional to the number of points you resample).
