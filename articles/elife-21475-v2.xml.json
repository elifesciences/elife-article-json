In order to visualise both Poly-, and Mono-, ADP-ribosylation in vivo, we engineered specific fluorescent probes. Using them, we show that amino-acid starvation triggers an unprecedented display of mono-ADP-ribosylation that governs the formation of Sec body, a recently identified stress assembly that forms in Drosophila cells. We show that dPARP16 catalytic activity is necessary and sufficient for both amino-acid starvation induced mono-ADP-ribosylation and subsequent Sec body formation and cell survival. Importantly, dPARP16 catalyses the modification of Sec16, a key Sec body component, and we show that it is a critical event for the formation of this stress assembly. Taken together our findings establish a novel example for the role of mono-ADP-ribosylation in the formation of stress assemblies, and link this modification to a metabolic stress."

In order to visualise both Poly-, and Mono-, ADP-ribosylation in vivo, we engineered specific fluorescent probes. Using them, we show that amino-acid starvation triggers an unprecedented display of mono-ADP-ribosylation that governs the formation of Sec body, a recently identified stress assembly that forms in Drosophila cells. We show that dPARP16 catalytic activity is necessary and sufficient for both amino-acid starvation induced mono-ADP-ribosylation and subsequent Sec body formation and cell survival. Importantly, dPARP16 catalyses the modification of Sec16, a key Sec body component, and we show that it is a critical event for the formation of this stress assembly. Taken together our findings establish a novel example for the role of mono-ADP-ribosylation in the formation of stress assemblies, and link this modification to a metabolic stress."

To validate the functionality of the probe, we treated S2 cells with arsenate, a treatment that, in human cells, elicits PARylation known to be required for stress granules integrity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Leung et al., 2011</a>). Accordingly, YFP-PAD forms defined cytoplasmic structures in arsenate treated S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) that partially co-localise with stress granules (marked by FMR1, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), showing that YFP-PAD is functional.

Using a Fluorescence-to-ImmunoEM correlative method (<a href=\"#bib39\">Vicidomini et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hassink et al., 2012</a>), we showed that GFP-MAD spots correspond to non-membrane bound structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,E\u2019</a>), ranging from 600 nm to two microns in diameter. We tested their reversibility upon nutrient replenishment following starvation and found that they are fully reversible after 30 min of Schneider\u2019s addition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,F\u2019</a>). Last, we show that heat stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,G\u2019</a>) and arsenate treatment (not shown) do not elicit a GFP-MAD pattern, confirming the specificity of MARylation to amino-acid starvation."

In comparison, the depletion of the other PARPs has no effect and GFP-MAD spots form as in mock-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, the overexpression of dPARP16 under growing conditions induces the robust formation of GFP-MAD spots in most of the cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,B\u2019,E</a>). Importantly, 84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% of GFP-MAD spots formed upon dPARP16 overexpression partially or completely co-localize with the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,B\u2019</a>).

Both enzymes are of similar length and they have similar catalytic domain. Human PARP16 has a catalytic site comprising the triad HYY (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hottiger et al., 2010</a>) and using HHpred, we predicted that the catalytic site of dPARP16 consists of the YYY triad (Y199, Y221, Y284) (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

This specificity is sustained by three arguments: (i) MAD is designed and built using PARP14 macrodomains 1\u20133. Crystallography and calorimetric assays show that each macrodomain has a conserved fold with high binding affinity for mono-ADP-ribose (particularly macrodomains 2 and 3) and the affinity required for in vivo visualisation is provided by the three macrodomains together in a cooperative manner. (ii) We show that the mutated G1055E probe (affecting the binding pocket of macrodomain 2 in such as way that it does not bind mono-ADP-ribose any longer) does not elicit a pattern upon amino-acid starvation in vivo. (iii) The amino-acid starvation GFP-MAD pattern is abrogated upon depletion of dPARP16, the closest homologue of an established human MARylation enzyme PARP16. Conversely, overexpression of dPARP16 elicits GFP-MAD spot formation (but not YFP-PAD spots, which rule out PARylation events). This is confirmed by the use of a PARylation detection probe YFP-PAD. It allows the visualization of PARylation events consistent with those reported to occur to RNA binding proteins upon arsenate treatment leading to stress granule formation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Leung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gagn\u00e9 et al., 2008</a>). However, YFP-PAD is not remodelled during amino-acid starvation suggesting that PARylation is not prominent during this stress.

This also suggests that dPARP16 level needs to be kept low in basal conditions to avoid its activation, challenging the detection of its activity in basal conditions. Conversely, dPARP16 is essential during stress, at least amino-acid starvation as depletion of dPARP16 affects the viability of cells during the stress period.

Indeed, The CAAX version of SRDC recruits cherry MAD to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of SRDC leads to the formation of Sec bodies in a dPARP16 dependent manner, and SRCD rescues Sec body formation in Sec16 depleted cells. This suggests that Sec16-SRDC MARylation is a triggering event in Sec body formation."

However, SRCD on its own is not recruited to Sec bodies, and our interpretation is that it may act only as a signalling event for Sec body formation. The nature of this signalling need to be further investigated. This is in line with the fact that GFP-MAD is not readily observed within the Sec body core. GFP-MAD appears as a ring/spot\u00a0at the base of Sec bodies. Although this is consistent with the protein packing and competing binding that takes place during the formation of stress assemblies (that most likely would exclude GFP-MAD), it might also suggest that MARylated Sec16 forms a signalling platform. This would lead to the modifications of other Sec body components allowing their incorporation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>)."

Cells were harvested, placed immediately on ice and washed with ice cold PBS by mild centrifugation (1100 rpm, 4 min at 4\u00b0C). Cells were lysed in 600 \u03bcl lysis buffer (10% glycerol; 1% Triton X100; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 50 mM NaF; 25 mM Na<sub>2</sub>gP; 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>3</sub>; 5 mM EDTA and one tablet Roche protease inhibitor/100 ml) for 30 min upon rotation at 4\u00b0C. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined by using BCA protein assay. The cell lysate was added to 20 \u03bcl GFP-Trap (R) beads (Chromotek) washed in lysis buffer and incubated by rotation at 4\u00b0C. The GFP-Trap beads were then washed 3x for 5 min at 4\u00b0C with 1 ml lysis buffer (at 2000 rpm, 2 min at 4\u00b0C). The supernatant was collected and boiled for 5 min in 50 \u03bcl 2xsample buffer with DTT. Samples (15 mg of protein) were fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, proteins transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blotting was done in blocking buffer (PBST with milk), after which the antibodies were added in the concentrations as described above."

The authors find that in insect cells MARylation is triggered by amino acid starvation. MARylation in these starved cells further leads to the formation of Sec bodies, a stress inducible protein assembly that protect cells from the negative consequences of amino acid depletion. Overall this is an interesting and well executed paper. It adds significantly to our understanding of stress response pathways, and to the function of mono-ADP ribosylation, and of Parp16 in particular. It shows for the first time a link between amino acid metabolism, protein ADP-ribosylation and stress-inducible assemblies."

Furthermore, upon stress relief, the cell recovery in dPARP16 depleted cells is significantly lower compared to the mock depleted. Importantly, the cell survival is unaffected in dPARP16 depleted cells that are maintained in growing conditions. Given the role of dPARP16 in Sec body formation (this manuscript) and given the role of Sec bodies in cell survival (Zacharoggianni et al. 2014), we propose that dPARP16 critically helps to protect the cells from amino-acid starvation through its crucial role in the formation of the pro-survival Sec bodies."

DTT treatment for 3h only leads to a slight decrease in cell viability when compared to amino-acid starvation. This clearly demonstrates that amino-acid starvation is not a middle stress and is in fact stronger than ER stress (and heat shock as shown in Jevtov et al., 2015). Furthermore, dPARP16 depletion has hardly any effect on the survival to DTT treatment, whereas it has a very strong effect on amino-acid starved cells. This shows that in <i>Drosophila</i> cells, dPARP16 is needed to respond to the starvation stress."
