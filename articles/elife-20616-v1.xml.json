Nevertheless, the question how different antigen loads are translated into appropriate IL-2 production to ensure adequate responses against pathogens remains largely unexplored. Here we find that at single cell level, IL-2 is binary (digital) and CD25 is graded expressed whereas at population level both parameters show graded expression correlating with the antigen amount. Combining in vivo data with a mathematical model we demonstrate that only this binary IL-2 expression ensures a wide linear antigen response range for Teff and Treg cells under real spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore, at low antigen concentrations binary IL-2 expression safeguards by its spatial distribution selective STAT5 activation only of closely adjacent Treg cells regardless of their antigen specificity. These data show that the mode of IL-2 secretion is critical to tailor the adaptive immune response to the antigen amount."

Nevertheless, the question how different antigen loads are translated into appropriate IL-2 production to ensure adequate responses against pathogens remains largely unexplored. Here we find that at single cell level, IL-2 is binary (digital) and CD25 is graded expressed whereas at population level both parameters show graded expression correlating with the antigen amount. Combining in vivo data with a mathematical model we demonstrate that only this binary IL-2 expression ensures a wide linear antigen response range for Teff and Treg cells under real spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore, at low antigen concentrations binary IL-2 expression safeguards by its spatial distribution selective STAT5 activation only of closely adjacent Treg cells regardless of their antigen specificity. These data show that the mode of IL-2 secretion is critical to tailor the adaptive immune response to the antigen amount."

At the population level, T cells translate a total pathogen input into an adequate cytokine response over a large dynamic range. Individual T cells sense both antigen affinity and frequency and tailor the collective antigen-specific T cell activation to the antigen amount (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allison et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gottschalk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kellogg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Miskov-Zivanov et al., 2013</a>). The cytokine IL-2 and its signaling are of central importance for these processes. IL-2 is mainly produced by activated Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells (hereinafter referred to as 'Th cells') and mediates diverse pleiotropic actions such as promotion of Th1 and Th2 differentiation, expansion of multiple Th cell populations, as well as generation and maintenance of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg cells) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Liao et al., 2013</a>). Thus, IL-2 positively acts on Th cells through synergistic effects between antigen and cytokines and negatively through preferred binding to and activation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells."

Observations from various knock-out mice (e.g. IL-2R\u03b1, STAT5) and other in vivo studies, however, have challenged some conclusions of these in vitro data and underlined the importance of local antigen concentrations, temporal aspects, cytokine compositions, cell heterogeneity in tissues and much more for the biological outcome orchestrated by IL-2 during an immune response (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib21\">Liao et al., 2013</a>)."

Second, Amado et al. proposed that IL-2 is sensed by both the activated Th cell pool and by Treg cells, which reciprocally regulate cells of the IL-2-producing cell subset in IL-2 reporter mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amado et al., 2013</a>). Third, O\u2019Gorman et al. showed that in the initial phase of antigen-specific activation IL-2-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation occurred primarily in Treg cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">O'Gorman et al., 2009</a>). Fourth, Liu et al. underscored the importance of a fine-tuned local IL-2 availability to limit otherwise constant damage from activated auto-responsive Th cells under steady state conditions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2015</a>)."

Furthermore, there is the open question whether a graded antigen load is translated into binary (also known as digital, all-or-none, switch-like, or bimodal) or graded expression of TCR-dependent genes coding for important cytokines and receptors such as IL-2 and CD25 or CD69, respectively, in vivo. Even in vitro there were conflicting data about binary or graded expression of CD25 and CD69 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allison et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Busse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Feinerman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Podtschaske et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tkach et al., 2014</a>). This is an interesting issue because binary responses are able to filter out noisy signals and can integrate different information to control cell responses. Thereby, binary responses allow parallel and independent control of single cell activation probability and population heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kellogg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">K\u00f6ck et al., 2014</a>)."

Using a murine adoptive transfer model enabled us to study an antigen-specific T cell response in syngeneic recipient mice and cytokine secretion assays to measure the rate and magnitude of cytokine production of individual cells over time. In addition, mathematical modeling allowed us to compare the effects of the hypothesized graded and observed binary IL-2 expression for the first time. The model revealed advantages of the latter for a wide linear scaling of STAT5 activation in Treg and/or Th cells to antigen concentration. Finally, our results demonstrate that the combination of binary IL-2 secretion and graded CD25 expression at the cellular level enables the parallel control of single cell activation probability and population heterogeneity by the respective antigen amount."

Different amounts of antigen used for immunization resulted in changes in the number of IL-2-producing cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left), but almost no change in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IL-2 expression per Th cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right). Thus, the amount of antigen correlates with the proportion of Th cells that produced IL-2, but does not change the amount of IL-2 per cell, which confirms that IL-2 production is regulated in a binary fashion in vivo, too. The IL-2 expression peaked between 6 and 18 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The IL-2 secretion assay detected up to 75% IL-2-producing Th cells at the highest amount of antigen (2 mg) used. This number reflects the in vivo situation better than direct measurement of IL-2 by intracellular staining, which only detected maximally\u00a0~9% IL-2-producing Th cells, considered to be too low (<a href=\"#bib24\">Long and Adler, 2006</a>). Moreover, we excluded an underestimation of cytokine production by confirming that the cytokine capture matrix is not saturated in our experiments (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The data shown were generated with transfer of OVA-specific DO11.10 T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), but were also reproduced using T cells from OT-II mice (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Our results were confirmed in a more thorough statistical analysis in which we explicitly tested for bimodality in IL-2 expression and used mixed gaussian models to extract expression values and percentages of cell subpopulations (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

To this end we used adoptively transferred na\u00efve transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells 7 hr after immunization of mice and co-stained c-Fos, NFATc2, and IL-2 using intracellular staining and cytokine secretion assays, respectively. Interestingly, only the amount of c-Fos but not of NFATc2 per Th cell correlates with the probability of IL-2 expression in vivo. Quartiles with the same cell number but different fluorescence intensities of c-Fos or NFATc2 (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, left) showed that the probability of IL-2 production correlates with the c-Fos amount per cell but is independent of NFATc2 amounts within their physiological range (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, right).

So far, in vitro quantitative single cell studies have produced conflicting results proposing opposite manners of CD25 expression, namely binary (<a href=\"#bib8\">Busse et al., 2010</a>) and graded (<a href=\"#bib12\">Feinerman et al., 2010</a>). Given that CD25 expression peaks between 12 and 24 hr after immunization (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lischke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Long and Adler, 2006</a>), we observed graded CD25 and CD69 expression of adoptively transferred transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells 14 hr after immunization of mice. Different antigen concentrations used for immunization changed the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD25 expression per Th cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right). The amount of antigen correlated with the amount of CD25 expressed per cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left), and thus its ability to respond to IL-2. Notably, CD25 expression was up-regulated only by transferred antigen-specific Th and Treg cells (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s6\">6</a>), but not by endogenous T cells. This fact is pointing to preferential up-regulation of CD25 expression via TCR-stimulated T cell activation. The same holds true for high expression of CD69 (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). However, a small bystander expression of CD69 (CD69<sup>intermediate</sup> cells) was observed on endogenous Th and Treg cells after immunization of mice with OVA + LPS."

This can be understood in the following way: If secretion is graded (i.e. many producers), the distribution of IL-2 is relatively homogeneous across the whole volume. Consequently, all cells are exposed to similar levels of IL-2 and thus are either all activated or not in the graded IL-2 scenario. If secretion is binary (i.e. the number of secreting cells increases with increasing stimulus, the amount is constant), by contrast, then the number of activated cells increases more gradually because cells that are in close proximity to secreting cells are activated first. Binary secretion at the cellular level thus leads to graded activation at the population level and <i>vice versa</i>."

Interestingly, the model simulations predict that Th cells are activated at lower antigen concentrations in the binary than in the graded scenario. However, Treg cells are always activated at lower antigen concentrations than Th cells. This is obviously important for effective control of autoimmunity ensuring Treg cell activation in spatial proximity even if only rare self-reactive IL-2 secreting Th cells exist (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2015</a>)."

We co-stained phosphorylated STAT5 and CD25 directly ex vivo in adoptively transferred antigen-specific Th and Treg cells 14 hr after immunization of mice. As expected, with increasing amounts of antigen (and hence increasing IL-2 secretion) STAT5 phosphorylation increased proportionally in antigen-specific Th and Treg cells. Moreover, antigen-specific Treg cells showed a much higher STAT5 phosphorylation than antigen-specific Th cells. However, the p-STAT5 signals were quite low. Even at the highest antigen concentration (2 mg OVA) only\u00a0~11% of Th cells stained positive for p-STAT5 despite the fact that about 75% of Th cells secrete IL-2 and about 95% express CD25 at this condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Within the Treg cell population about 50% were p-STAT5<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). It is possible that p-STAT5<sup>+</sup> frequencies are underestimated due to difficulties in preserving the p-STAT5 signal during the preparation of cells ex vivo and the staining process. O\u2019 Gorman et al. described that the induction of p-STAT5 is lower in na\u00efve Th cells compared to repeatedly activated cells but lasts longer (<a href=\"#bib29\">O'Gorman et al., 2009</a>). In line with this, our endogenous antigen-unspecific Th cells had a very low expression of CD25 and almost no p-STAT5. In contrast, STAT5 activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) was observed at a similar degree on both Treg cell populations, transgenic (antigen-specific) and endogenous Treg cells."

Furthermore, we incubated one part of the spleen in vitro with IL-2 (200 ng recombinant IL-2 for 25 min). The data clearly show that neither IL-2 treatment of mice nor in vitro IL-2 treatment of Th cells increased STAT5 activation in transgenic Th cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus it is very probable that antigen-specific Th cells are unresponsive to IL-2 by negative crosstalk between antigen and IL-2 signaling as described before (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tkach et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Villarino et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Waysbort et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, our model data are consistent with the experimental data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and reveal the importance of IL-2-activated Treg cells for limiting the immune response of Th cells. First, at low amounts of antigen (&lt;30 \u00b5g OVA) preferentially a proportion of Treg cells is activated by IL-2, and thus can limit the immune response at low danger. Second, binary IL-2 expression tailors the fraction of activated Treg cells proportionately to the antigen amount and avoids that all Treg cells are almost simultaneously activated as would be expected in the graded IL-2 expression scenario. Third, at low antigen amounts binary IL-2 expression ensures by its spatial distribution that only those antigen-specific and unspecific Treg cells are activated, which are in close spatial proximity to the few IL-2 producing Th cells. This is in good agreement with data of Liu et al. concerning observations on self tolerance (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2015</a>)."

Thus, IL-2 from strongly activated clones co-opt a fraction of weaker clones into activation and proliferation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Voisinne et al., 2015</a>) and contribute thereby to continuous heterogeneity of the responding population.

Our model confirmed that Treg cells become activated by IL-2 at lower antigen concentrations than Th cells and predicted that graded IL-2 secretion would result in activation of all T cells in a very narrow range of antigen stimulus, which is represented by a very steep slope of the activation curve of Th and Treg cells. Moreover, the binary IL-2 secretion results in a broadened linear range of initial T cell activation. This suits the needs of a fine-tuned immune response for a broad range of possible antigen loads."

Very remarkably, not only the number of antigen-specific Treg cells but to a similar degree also endogenous Treg cells are p-STAT5 positive and correlate with the antigen amount.

This study convincingly highlighted the role of spatial proximity of few IL-2 producing Th cells and clustering of Treg cells close to them for critical IL-2-driven immune regulatory processes. The reduction of motility of Th and Treg cells within the clusters could secure effective IL-2 delivery for Treg cells even if IL-2 is released in a non-directional manner. Moreover, the number of Treg cells within the cluster might determine how many Treg cells are affected. The point, how IL-2 is shared between Th and Treg cells is extensively studied and discussed in two recent theoretical articles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Labowsky, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Thurley et al., 2015</a>)."

Cells are modeled as circular areas with reactive boundaries that account for either secretion of IL-2 or IL-2:IL-2R-complex formation. Dirichlet boundary conditions were imposed on the outer boundary of the domain. The cells were distributed randomly with a mean cell-to-cell distance derived from considerations about the number of T cells and the size of the T cell zone in the spleen. The dynamics of IL-2:IL-2R-interactions on the cell boundaries was included in terms of a simple Michaelis-Menten type model which accounts for complex formation, dissociation and internalization. We assumed that the receptor dynamics can be approximated by considering only the influence of the expression of the high affinity chain CD25. The influence of unspecific CD25 positive cells was modeled in terms of a homogeneous background degradation of IL-2. The model was written and evaluated in MATLAB making use of the Partial Differential Equation Toolbox."

It provides a culmination of &gt;35 years of research on how the cytokine IL-2 and its receptor make a profound contribution to shaping the T cell response. They re-evaluate the in vivo dose response and time course of IL-2 production, CD25 expression, CD69 expression and proliferation in vivo using DO11.10 and OTII TCR transgenic systems. They claim that IL-2 production is binary (see below)- that as antigen dose increases, the proportion of T cells making a fixed amount of IL-2 over several hours increases. In contrast, CD25 and CD69 responses are reported that all responding T cells make a response proportional to the input antigen dose. While experiments like this have been done before, the results for both IL-2 production and CD25 expression have been reported to be binary or graded in different studies so it was important to clarify the results in vivo using well defined models. They then apply a 2D model the T cell zone to the data to better understand the mechanism by which the combination of a binary IL-2 production and graded IL-2 responsiveness combine to generate a proliferative response in Th that is proportional to the antigen input. To make their case, they use a previously-published computational model of IL-2 dynamics [1] to resolve this paradox: by controlling the number of cells that secrete IL-2 in a graded manner, the system avoids homogenization, adjusts the number of Treg involved in suppressing the response, and establish a nice analog response. Such illuminating insight comes at the time when immunologists are dwelling on issues of scaling and global regulation: Fuhrmann et al. provide a very thorough analysis (both from the experimental and theoretical point of view)."

Fuhrmann et al. report that the frequency of STAT5 phosphorylating cells is very small in conditions when a large fraction of cells is secreting IL-2. This can be well accounted for when taking into consideration the reported negative crosstalk between antigen signaling and IL-2 signaling [3-6]. Such negative crosstalk has already been invoked to explain some of the paradoxical features of STAT5 activation in T cells [3, 4], as well as scaling in IL-2 secretion. One control experiment would help clarify this issue: injecting a large dose of IL-2 or IL-2 complexed with a stimulatory antibody, then monitoring STAT5 phosphorylation would distinguish whether T cells are unresponsive to IL-2 or do not have access to IL-2. Blocking TCR signaling (e.g. using a blocking antibody against CD4) would also resolve whether there is an antigen-dependent active block on IL-2 signaling in vivo."
