Morphine inhibits GABA inhibitory neurons, which shifts the balance between inhibitory and excitatory input to VTA-DA neurons in favor of excitation and then leads to VTA-DA neuron excitation. However, it is not known whether morphine has an additional strengthening effect on excitatory input. Our results suggest that glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons is inhibited by GABAergic interneurons via GABAB receptors and that morphine promotes presynaptic glutamate release by removing this inhibition. We also studied the contribution of the morphine-induced disinhibitory effect on the presynaptic glutamate release to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons and related behavior. Our results suggest that the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release might be the main mechanism for morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors."

Morphine inhibits GABA inhibitory neurons, which shifts the balance between inhibitory and excitatory input to VTA-DA neurons in favor of excitation and then leads to VTA-DA neuron excitation. However, it is not known whether morphine has an additional strengthening effect on excitatory input. Our results suggest that glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons is inhibited by GABAergic interneurons via GABAB receptors and that morphine promotes presynaptic glutamate release by removing this inhibition. We also studied the contribution of the morphine-induced disinhibitory effect on the presynaptic glutamate release to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons and related behavior. Our results suggest that the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release might be the main mechanism for morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors."

By examining the effects of morphine on individual VTA neurons, Chen et al. show that the drug does indeed enhance the activity of the glutamatergic neurons. However, it does so indirectly by inhibiting another group of interneurons that would otherwise silence the glutamatergic neurons. This effect of morphine is dependent on the drug acting on a specific receptor type on the interneurons."

Morphine first inhibits neighboring GABA inhibitory neurons, which shifts the balance between inhibitory and excitatory input to VTA-DA neurons in favor of excitation and then leads to the promotion of VTA-DA neuron excitation. It was also reported that the release of glutamate from least some of the glutamate terminals that synapsed on VTA-DA neurons was inhibited by opioids (<a href=\"#bib30\">Manzoni and Williams, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Margolis et al., 2005</a>). This inhibitory effect of opioids on glutamate release is puzzling (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chartoff and Connery, 2014</a>) because one would expect morphine to produce rapid activation of VTA-DA neurons through both the inhibition of GABAergic input and the excitation of glutamatergic input. In addition, postsynaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ford et al., 2006</a>) or excitation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Margolis et al., 2014</a>) in response to \u03bc opioid receptor activation has also been reported in some VTA-DA neurons. However, the amplitude of the inhibitory outward currents produced by opioids in postsynaptic VTA-DA neurons in the study of Ford et al. was small (2.1 \u00b1 1.5 pA in VTA-DA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and 14 \u00b1 4 pA in those projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ford et al., 2006</a>), while only a small population of VTA-DA neurons (19%) showed depolarization or an increase in firing rate in response to opioids in the study of <a href=\"#bib32\">Margolis et al. (2014)</a>. This low postsynaptic responsiveness to opioids was consistent with physiological and anatomical evidence that only a few VTA-DA neurons had \u00b5 receptors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ford et al., 2006</a>)."

Moreover, the strengthening influence of morphine on glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons is more relevant to its promoting effect on VTA-DA neuron excitation. In this article, we report our observations of the effect of morphine on glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp method, and the results of our study of its mechanism and functional consequences using electrophysiological, biochemical, optogenetic, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches."

                                "text": "We observed the effect of morphine (10 \u00b5M) on the spontaneous firing frequency of VTA-DA neurons in rats. We select 10 \u00b5M of morphine because this concentration is commonly used in in vitro experiments as it elicits a significant effect useful for further analyses (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akaishi et al., 2000</a>), and the effect of morphine at this concentration can be essentially abolished by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (<a href=\"#bib38\">Valentino and Dingledine, 1982</a>). VTA-DA neurons were identified based on I<sub>h</sub> currents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Details of the identification method are given in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section. Using original recordings of spontaneous firing (left panel of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and the time course of spontaneous firing (middle panel of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) in VTA-DA neurons for comparison, we could see that morphine (10 \u03bcM) increased the frequency of spontaneous firing in VTA-DA neurons. The average frequency of spontaneous firing increased from 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 Hz before to 1.4 \u00b1 0.4 Hz for 10\u201315 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from five rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In order to determine the role of glutamatergic input in the morphine-induced increase in the spontaneous firing frequency of VTA-DA neurons, we observed the influence of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) (50 \u03bcM) and the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist 6, 7-Dinitroquinoxalie-2, 3-dione (DNQX) (10 \u03bcM) on the effect of morphine. In the presence of APV and DNQX, morphine no longer increased spontaneous firing frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The average frequency of spontaneous firing was 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 Hz before and 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 Hz for 10\u201315 min after morphine application in the presence of APV and DNQX (n = 6 cells from five rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &gt; 0.05, compared to control with APV and DNQX before morphine, right panel of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These results suggest that the morphine-induced increase in the spontaneous firing frequency of VTA-DA neurons requires AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic input, consistent with a recent report using the NMDA antagonist APV and the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) in in vivo experiments (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jalabert et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "In order to study the effect of morphine on glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons, we examined the effect of morphine on the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in VTA-DA neurons in rats. First, we observed the effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs when the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX) was added to a bath solution to remove spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). Consistent with earlier reports (<a href=\"#bib30\">Manzoni and Williams, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Margolis et al., 2005</a>), in the presence of extracellularly applied PTX (100 \u03bcM), morphine (10 \u03bcM) decreased the frequency of sEPSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The average frequency of sEPSCs decreased from 4.2 \u00b1 0.7 Hz before to 3.5 \u00b1 0.7 Hz for 10\u201315 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, bath application of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists can lead to a wide blocking effect on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors present on different types of neurons, including DA-neurons and GABA neurons, in VTA slices. To circumvent this wide influence and target the inhibition of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to VTA-DA neurons, we added the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist PTX (100 \u00b5M) to the internal solution of microelectrodes as described by <a href=\"#bib2\">Akaike et al. (1985)</a> when recording sEPSCs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by intracellularly applied PTX, we first examined the effect of intracellularly applied PTX (100 \u03bcM) on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) in VTA-DA neurons. The results showed that under this experimental paradigm, IPSCs disappeared (top of panel 1 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, n = 5 cells from two rats), demonstrating that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the recorded VTA-DA neurons were blocked by intracellularly applied PTX. In addition, to further confirm that the spontaneous events we measured in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX were in fact sEPSCs, we observed the effect of the AMPA receptor antagonist DNQX on spontaneous events in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. The results showed that the spontaneous events were completely blocked by DNQX (10 \u03bcM) (bottom of panel 1 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We repeated the experiment in three cells from different slices and obtained similar results. On this basis, we observed the effect of morphine on the sEPSCs in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. Raw current traces (panel 2 of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and the time course of sEPSCs (panel 3 of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) before and after morphine application in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX showed that morphine (10 \u03bcM) increased the frequency of sEPSCs. The average frequency of sEPSCs increased from 4.8 \u00b1 0.6 Hz before to 5.5 \u00b1 0.6 Hz for 10\u201315 min after morphine application (n = 8 cells from five rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, panel 4 of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, morphine (10 \u03bcM) had no significant effect on the amplitude of sEPSCs. The average amplitude of sEPSCs was 16.6 \u00b1 1.3 pA before and 15.3 \u00b1 1.3 pA for 10\u201315 min after morphine application (n = 8 cells from five rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &gt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, panel 5 of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To confirm that the increased spontaneous events we measured in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX after morphine were also in fact sEPSCs, we observed the effect of the AMPA receptor antagonist DNQX on spontaneous events after morphine application in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. The results showed that the spontaneous events after morphine application were completely blocked by adding DNQX (10 \u03bcM) (panel 6 of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We repeated the experiment in three cells from different slices and obtained similar results. We also used the first excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) of paired pulse facilitation (PPF) as an index of EPSC (<a href=\"#bib29\">Maejima et al., 2001</a>), and the PPF of paired EPSC as an indicator of presynaptic glutamate release (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</a>) to confirm the effect of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. As shown in the left panel of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, morphine (10 \u03bcM) increased the amplitude of the first EPSC, which was accompanied by a clear change in the presynaptic parameter PPF. The average amplitude of the first EPSCs was 124.1 \u00b1 9.0 pA before and 161.9 \u00b1 10.8 pA for 10\u201315 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, middle panel of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The average PPF was decreased from 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 before to 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 for 10\u201315 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results supported the suggestion that morphine increased presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. More importantly, when we clamped the membrane potential of VTA-DA neurons at the reversal potential of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channels to remove sIPSCs, as an alternative to the application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, either by the intracellular or bath approach, morphine still exerted a promoting effect on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The average frequency of sEPSCs in this condition increased from 4.4 \u00b1 0.3 Hz before to 5.5 \u00b1 0.4 Hz for 10\u201315 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

One suggestion is that morphine may directly act at glutamatergic terminals to promote glutamate release. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of morphine on glutamate release from the VTA synaptosomes of rats, which are sealed particles containing vesicles, viable mitochondria, and all components necessary to store, release, and retain neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Breukel et al., 1997</a>), using on-line fluorometry. However, we did not find that morphine (10 \u03bcM) had a direct effect at glutamatergic terminals to promote glutamate release. The average concentration of glutamate was 8.1 \u00b1 0.1 nmol/mg before and 8.5 \u00b1 0.7 nmol/mg after morphine application (n = 6 samples from eight rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &gt; 0.05, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We also studied the effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs from mechanically dissociated single VTA-DA neurons in rats, which retained functional synaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akaike and Moorhouse, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ye et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Deng et al., 2009</a>). The left top image of panel 1 of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> shows mechanically dissociated neurons from the VTA. These VTA-DA neurons were identified by only using I<sub>h</sub> currents (the graph on the right of panel 1 of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) without TH staining because in dissociated DA neurons, it was difficult to fix the cell after recording for TH staining. The results showed that morphine (10 \u00b5M) had no significant effect on the frequency of sEPSCs (panels 2 and 3 of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

                                "text": "To explore how morphine promoted presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons, we hypothesized that glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons was inhibited by GABAergic interneurons and morphine disinhibited glutamatergic input by removing this inhibition, thus promoting glutamate release. To test this hypothesis, we first studied whether GABA could inhibit presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons by examining the effect of exogenous applied of GABA on the frequency of sEPSCs of VTA-DA neurons in rats. From raw current traces (left panel of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and the time course of sEPSCs (middle panel of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), we could see that GABA (10 \u03bcM) apparently decreased the frequency of sEPSCs. The average frequency of sEPSCs decreased from 6.7 \u00b1 0.7 Hz before to 4.7 \u00b1 0.6 Hz for 10\u201315 min after GABA application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before GABA, right panel of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Then, we observed whether the activation of intrinsic GABAergic neurons could inhibit presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons in mice. To do this, AAV virus expressing a double floxed-stopped channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mCherry was stereotaxically injected into the VTA of mice expressing Cre recombinase in GABA neurons. 2 weeks after infection, expression of ChR2\u2013mCherry was observed in the VTA (panel 1 of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We then performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording in GABA neurons of the VTA and observed the light-induced action potentials in GABA neurons in order to confirm that ChR2 was indeed expressed in the GABA neurons of the VTA in mice. The results showed that 470 nm light stimulation (20 Hz) elicited action potentials in GABA neurons (panel 2 of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). On this basis, whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed in VTA-DA neurons to observe the effect of 470 nm light stimulation on the frequency of sEPSCs in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX (100 \u00b5M). Following 5\u201310 min of baseline recording of sEPSCs, twenty 470 nm light pulses of 5 ms at 20 Hz were delivered every 4 s for 15 min. Raw current traces (panel 3 of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and the time course of sEPSCs (panel 4 of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) before and after light stimulation showed that the light stimulation apparently decreased the frequency of sEPSCs.

AAV virus expressing a double floxed-stopped eNpHR3.0-EYFP was stereotaxically injected into the VTA of mice expressing Cre recombinase in GABA neurons. 2 weeks after infection, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording in GABA neurons of the VTA and observed light-induced inhibition of firing of action potentials in GABA neurons. The results showed that yellow light stimulation (590 nm) could reliably inhibit the current injection-induced firing of action potentials in GABA neurons (left panel of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). On this basis, whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed in VTA-DA neurons to observe the influence of the light-induced disinhibition of glutamatergic input on the effect of morphine. First, we observed whether this inhibition by light stimulation of GABA neurons affected the frequency of sEPSCs in VTA-DA neurons. As expected, light stimulation increased the frequency of sEPSCs in VTA-DA neurons (middle panel of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The average frequency of sEPSCs was 3.9 \u00b1 0.4 Hz before and 4.5 \u00b1 0.4 Hz for 10\u201315 min after light stimulation (n = 6 cells from five mice, paired <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before light stimulation, right panel of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Then, we observed the influence of the light-induced disinhibition of glutamatergic input on the effect of morphine. From raw current traces (left panel of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) and the time course of sEPSCs (middle panel of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), we could see that the effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs disappeared in the presence of the light stimulation. The average frequency of sEPSCs was 4.5 \u00b1 0.4 Hz before and 4.4 \u00b1 0.5 Hz for 10\u201315 min after morphine application in the presence of the light stimulation (n = 6 cells from five mice, paired <i>t</i> test, p &gt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine with light stimulation, right panel of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). These results suggest that prior removal of the inhibition of GABAergic input on presynaptic glutamate release leads to disappearance of the effect of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons, indicating that morphine promotes presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons via presynaptic disinhibition."

In behavioral experiments, to avoid morphine acting on other brain areas sensitive to morphine, we injected morphine locally into the VTA in rats.

We believe that under the condition of bath application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, the antagonist can produce a wide inhibitory effect on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors present on various neuron subtypes, such as DA neurons and GABA neurons, in VTA slices. Maybe this wide effect shifts the effect of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons toward an inhibitory effect. However, the intracellular application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist only blocks GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the single VTA-DA neuron being recorded. In this case, a clear promoting effect on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons was observed. In addition, to confirm this promoting effect under intracellularly applied PTX, we used the PPF of EPSC as another indicator of presynaptic glutamate release in order to observe the effect of morphine; the result substantiated our conclusion that morphine promoted presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons. More importantly, when we clamped the membrane potential of VTA-DA neurons in the reversal potential of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channels to remove sIPSCs, instead of using the intracellular or bath application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, morphine still promoted presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons. These results strongly suggest that morphine can promote presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons."

The amplitude of the outward currents produced by opioids in the study by Ford et al. was small (2.1 \u00b1 1.5 pA in VTA-DA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and 14 \u00b1 4 pA in those projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus) and thus might not be reflected by the change in action potential firing in our study. In addition, a recent report demonstrated postsynaptic excitation of some VTA-DA neurons by opioids (<a href=\"#bib32\">Margolis et al., 2014</a>), an event that we also did not observe. Only a small population of VTA-DA neurons (19%) showed depolarization or an increase in firing rate in response to opioids in this paper, which is consistent with physiological and anatomical evidence that \u00b5 receptors were present on a small population of VTA-DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ford et al., 2006</a>). Consequently, we believe that we did not observe this effect perhaps because the percentage of the cells responding by excitation was low. Similar to our study, Jalabert et al. did not observe an excitatory effect of firing of VTA-DA neurons by opioids in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jalabert et al., 2011</a>)."

We found that morphine had no significant effect on glutamate release.

                        "text": "Another possible mechanism may be through a local neuronal circuit that promotes glutamate release. It has been proposed that \u00b5 receptors located in GABAergic interneurons are the primary site of action of opiates in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hyman et al., 2006</a>). This is consistent with morphological and functional data showing that \u00b5 receptors are primarily located on non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA (<a href=\"#bib18\">Garzon and Pickel, 2001</a>) and that activation of \u00b5 receptors can inhibit GABAergic interneurons by hyperpolarizing the cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Johnson and North, 1992</a>). In addition, Chefer et al. studied the inter-relationship of \u00b5 receptors, GABA, glutamate, and DA in the VTA of freely moving animals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chefer et al., 2009</a>). They found that there was a positive correlation between basal dopamine levels and the glutamate/GABA ratio in the VTA of wild-type animals. Moreover, in \u00b5 receptor knockout mice, the GABAergic inhibitory tone in the VTA was significantly increased, but the glutamatergic excitatory tone was decreased. These results suggest that activation of \u00b5 receptors may increase presynaptic glutamate release via inhibition of GABAergic interneurons in VTA-DA neurons. This is supported by our results indicating that the \u00b5 receptor antagonist CTOP can block the promoting effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs (the average frequency of sEPSCs was 2.95 \u00b1 0.35 Hz before and 2.97 \u00b1 0.40 after morphine application (10 \u00b5M) in the presence of CTOP (1 \u00b5M); n = 6 cells from four rats, p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, we hypothesize that morphine may act at \u03bc receptors located in GABA neurons, inhibit the function of GABA neurons, and thus disinhibit the presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons, leading to increased glutamate release."

Therefore, we designed a series of experiments to determine if this inhibitory circuit existed. Our results showed that (1) GABA could inhibit the presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons and this inhibition was mediated through GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, rather than GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors; (2) GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were present in synaptosomes from the VTA as shown by Western blotting, and in glutamatergic terminals of VTA-DA neurons as shown by the triple immunofluorescence staining method; and (3) selective stimulation of GABA neurons of the VTA with an optogenetic technique could inhibit the presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons and the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP54626 could remove this inhibitory effect. These results strongly support the presence of an inhibitory circuit from neighboring GABA neurons to the presynaptic glutamatergic terminals of VTA-DA neurons. Moreover, they suggest that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors mediate this inhibitory effect of GABA. On this basis, we checked whether morphine-promoted presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons through the disinhibitory action on presynaptic glutamate release. To test this hypothesis, we used two strategies to remove inhibition by GABAergic input of presynaptic glutamate release and then observed their influence on the effect of morphine on glutamate release. The results showed that \u2018closing\u2019 local GABAergic interneurons both with optogenetic methods and with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP54626 could abolish the promoting effect of morphine on glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons.

In the present study, we demonstrated that morphine-disinhibited presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons by a second mechanism. These two kinds of disinhibitory actions may both contribute to the morphine-induced excitatory effect on VTA-DA neurons. However, there is no direct evidence supporting the suggestion that the disinhibitory action on VTA-DA neurons causes the morphine-induced increase in DA neuron firing. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons by employing the selective presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP36216. Several studies have indicated that pre- and postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in central neurons may be pharmacologically distinct (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dutar and Nicoll, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deisz et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">1997</a>). CGP36216 is a useful lead compound to differentiate between pre- and postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Up to 1 mM of CGP36216 was ineffective in antagonizing baclofen-induced hyperpolarization mediated through postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, but the responses mediated through presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were reversibly antagonized by CGP36216 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 43 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ong et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the contribution of the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons by examining the effect of CGP36216 on the morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors. Our results showed that if GABAergic inhibitory control of presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons was removed, the effect of morphine on the firing of VTA-DA neurons disappeared, indicating that the morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron activity might mainly depend on its disinhibitory action on presynaptic glutamate release. We also observe the effect of removing GABA inhibitory control of presynaptic glutamate release with the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP36216 on morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity, which is often assessed as increased VTA-DA neuron activity at the behavioral level (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vezina, 2004</a>). The results showed that intra-VTA injection of a presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist could abolish the increase in rat locomotor activity induced by both i.p. and intra-VTA-injected morphine. In addition, we observed the effect of removing GABA inhibitory control of presynaptic glutamate release with the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP36216 on morphine-induced CPP, which is initiated by morphine-induced activation of VTA-DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>). The results showed that intra-VTA injection of CGP36216 could abolish morphine-induced CPP in rats. These data suggest that the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release may be the main mechanism in the morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors."

Previous studies have suggested that morphine inhibits GABAergic neurons in the VTA (or the rostromedial tegmental area [RMTg]) to disinhibit dopamine neurons. In the present study, the authors performed a series of experiments in slice and behavior to indicate that morphine increases the frequency of glutamate release onto dopamine neurons. The authors first showed that the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postosynaptic currents (sEPSCs) increased after morphine application in slice. To isolate sEPSCs, the authors blocked inhibitory currents in the recorded neuron by applying a GABA-A receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, from the internal solution of the patch pipette (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akaike et al., 1985</a>). The authors showed increasing VTA GABAergic neuron firing decreased sEPSCs while blocking GABA-B receptors increased sEPSCs. Furthermore, the effect of morphine to increase locomotor activity was blocked by local injection of GABA-B receptor agonist in the VTA."
