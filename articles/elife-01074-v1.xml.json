In this study, using a detailed in vitro gene transcription analysis of the culture-adapted HB3 strain of <i>P. falciparum</i>, we show that antigenic switching is governed by a global activation hierarchy favouring short and highly diverse genes in central chromosomal location. Longer and more conserved genes, which have previously been associated with severe infection in immunologically naive hosts, are rarely activated, however, implying an in vivo fitness advantage possibly through adhesion-dependent survival rates. We further show that a gene\u2019s activation rate is positively associated sequence diversity, which could offer important new insights into the evolution and maintenance of antigenic diversity in <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria."

In this study, using a detailed in vitro gene transcription analysis of the culture-adapted HB3 strain of <i>P. falciparum</i>, we show that antigenic switching is governed by a global activation hierarchy favouring short and highly diverse genes in central chromosomal location. Longer and more conserved genes, which have previously been associated with severe infection in immunologically naive hosts, are rarely activated, however, implying an in vivo fitness advantage possibly through adhesion-dependent survival rates. We further show that a gene\u2019s activation rate is positively associated sequence diversity, which could offer important new insights into the evolution and maintenance of antigenic diversity in <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria."

However, some pathogens, such as the malaria-causing parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, get around this defence through a process called antigenic variation. This involves the parasite switching between different antigens over the course of an infection, preventing the host immune system from learning to recognise them and leading to infections that last many weeks or even months."

Moreover, <i>var</i> genes that were highly diverse were more likely to be activated than more conserved genes: this is the first evidence linking <i>var</i> gene evolution with gene activation probabilities. Together, these factors gave rise to the proposed activation hierarchy, which favours genes optimised for immune evasion and aids their continued evolution and diversification. Further work is now needed to identify the molecular mechanisms that control antigenic switching and to determine whether these could represent new therapeutic targets for malaria."

Continual exposure to <i>P. falciparum</i> infection can lead to a form of semi-immunity, whereby protection against life-threatening disease is acquired after a few infections only (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gupta et al., 1999</a>) whereas sterile and long-lasting immunity against infection is never achieved through natural exposure (<a href=\"#bib20\">Greenwood et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Marsh, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tran et al., 2013</a>). The process of natural acquired immunity therefore coincides with a transition from acute and severe infection in young children to asymptomatic carriage in older individuals (<a href=\"#bib34\">Marsh and Snow, 1997</a>). At the core of this variable outcome of infection and poor development of immunity lies the major parasite virulence factor and variant antigen, <i>P. falciparum</i> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). Members of this family of proteins are expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells and are involved in the binding of parasitised cells to other host cells and tissues (for an overview see <a href=\"#bib26\">Kraemer and Smith, (2006)</a>). The conferred binding phenotypes are believed to enhance parasite survival by avoiding splenic clearance (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boone and Watters, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buffet et al., 2009</a>) and also contribute to malaria pathology through parasite sequestration in the deep vasculature (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ockenhouse et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pongponratn et al., 1991</a>). Mutually exclusive transcriptional switching between PfEMP1 variants during the course of an infection thus affords the parasite an immune evasion strategy and a means to exploit different host tissues (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roberts et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Smith et al., 1995</a>)."

The high diversity of <i>var</i> genes and <i>var</i> gene repertoires is predominantly generated and maintained by frequent recombination and gene conversion events (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deitsch et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ward et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Freitas-Junior et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Taylor et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kraemer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Frank et al., 2008</a>), which has also resulted in a high degree of mosaicism within these genes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ward et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Taylor et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bull et al., 2008</a>).

Of particular interest are the UpsA-type genes, which appear to have diverged from the other groups (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kraemer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bull et al., 2008</a>) and have been shown to be upregulated during severe infections in young hosts (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jensen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bull et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kaestli et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kyriacou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rottmann et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Warimwe et al., 2009</a>). As a possible consequence, acquisition of anti-PfEMP1 immunity appears to follow a particular order, with UpsA variants generally being the first to be broadly recognised in older children (<a href=\"#bib59\">Warimwe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cham et al., 2010</a>). Nevertheless, clear associations between the expression of particular genes or Ups-groups, host age and severity of disease are still missing and could in fact be strain- or location-specific. Understanding the underlying pattern of antigenic switching between <i>var</i> genes is therefore important to explain not only the mechanisms and dynamics of persistent infections but also the relationship between immune-mediated expression of particular PfEMP1 sub-types and infection outcomes."

In this setting, Horrocks et al. (<a href=\"#bib22\">Horrocks et al., 2004</a>) found that the rates at which <i>var</i> genes activate or deactivate are non-random, gene-specific and highly dissimilar. It has furthermore been suggested that <i>var</i> genes occupying subtelomeric loci tend to switch off faster than those positioned in central chromosomal regions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frank et al., 2007</a>), offering a possible explanation for the rapid decline in the transcription of subtelomeric genes in parasites during culture adaptation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peters et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). More recently, <a href=\"#bib46\">Recker et al. (2011)</a> proposed that <i>var</i> gene transcriptional change involves a highly structured pathway that has evolved in response to a trade-off between the within-host and the between-host level fitness. However, most of these previous studies were limited in analytical depth due to restrictions in the number of variants considered and/or time points at which gene transcription levels were measured, and could therefore describe only small fragments of the whole switching network."

This revealed a global hierarchy in <i>var</i> gene activation favouring a highly diverse set of genes in central chromosomal locations. Our results further suggest a role of active gene transcription in the generation of antigenic diversity and will have important implications for understanding the age- and exposure-dependent pathology of <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria."

We have previously proposed that <i>var</i> gene switching can be fully described dynamically by two sets of parameters (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and [<a href=\"#bib46\">Recker et al., 2011</a>]). First, each gene <i>i</i> has an off-rate, <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math>, which is the per generation probability of switching from active to silenced. Second, each gene has a switch bias, <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>, which is the probability that when gene <i>i</i> switches off, gene <i>j</i> becomes activated. We applied our algorithm to the full 38-gene data set and separately to a reduced set of the 16 most transcribed genes, and both models generally gave good and similar fits between the data and predicted transcript levels (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>), with deviations resembling stochastic measurement errors."

As shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, there was a clear hierarchy in gene activation biases spanning over three orders of magnitude. The ranking also appeared to be non-random so that, for example, most genes within central chromosomal location were situated in the top half of the table.

In this study, we found that high transcription levels are confined to a subset of central genes that encode only four PfEMP1 binding domains (termed Type 1 <i>var</i> genes [<a href=\"#bib18\">Gardner et al., 2002</a>]) and, importantly, are the result of high activation biases rather than low off-rates. That is, even though some of the most highly transcribed genes had very low off-rates, the total sum of other genes switching off with high bias towards these genes significantly outweighs the effect of off-rates. This is consistent with our previous study using artificial transcription data, which also showed that off-rates, at least within a biologically plausible range, can have only a modest effect on the total transcript levels within parasite populations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Noble and Recker, 2012</a>)."

Even though these variations were found to have only a modest effect on in vitro switching, they are expected to play a much greater role during infection, where factors such as immune responses and binding affinities can significantly alter the <i>var</i> gene expression profiles. Furthermore, the combination of an activation hierarchy and these specific variations could explain our previously proposed source-sink model underlying antigenic switching in <i>P. falciparum</i> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Recker et al., 2011</a>), in which genes with high in-degrees, i.e., those most commonly switched to, correspond to the genes here identified as having high activation biases. Intriguingly, also, our results suggest that switch biases may be stronger between genes in similar chromosomal locations: central genes prefer to switch to other central genes, and subtelomeric genes prefer to switch to other subtelomeric genes. More data are needed to fully establish the factors influencing variation in switch biases, however, especially for less activated genes, where parameter estimations are more prone to uncertainties."

The discovery of intrinsic <i>var</i> gene activation biases and their associations with chromosomal locations and other genetic features could therefore have important implications for future studies. These factors are clearly correlated, however, and it is uncertain how they are linked by cause and effect. For example, in a recent study it was found that gene length is positively correlated with sequence conservation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buckee and Recker, 2012</a>), and long <i>var</i> genes are more often positioned in subtelomeric regions. Nevertheless, the correlation between activation bias and relatedness, which was found to be independent of chromosomal location, gene length and upstream promoter, suggests a role of gene transcription in facilitating recombination and therefore in generating and maintaining antigenic diversity in <i>P. falciparum</i>. Transcription-associated recombination has been observed in other eukaryotes and may result from increased accessibility to recombination proteins or from stalled replication forks (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prado and Aguilera, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gottipati and Helleday, 2009</a>). Importantly, for <i>P. falciparum</i> this phenomenon could help to explain why different groups of <i>var</i> genes within the repertoire display very different levels of diversity within the population (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buckee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Buckee and Recker, 2012</a>)."

This assumption would also help to reconcile apparent contradictions between our observations and <i>var</i> gene transcription in vivo. That is, various in vivo studies have reported UpsA <i>var</i> genes to be over-expressed during infections in individuals with little previous exposure (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jensen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bull et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lavstsen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kyriacou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Warimwe et al., 2009</a>), despite their low activation rates in vitro. Each <i>var</i> repertoire consists of a set of relatively long and conserved genes, such as those predominantly found with in the UpsA group, and another, short and diverse set of genes, such as those predominantly found within the UpsB and UpsC groups (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buckee and Recker, 2012</a>). Under the assumption that more conserved genes have an in vivo survival advantage, possibly due to higher binding affinities (<a href=\"#bib1\">Avril et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Claessens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lavstsen et al., 2012</a>), these variants will dominate early infections in naive hosts, regardless of activation rates. Their lower sequence diversity, however, will then lead to a more rapid acquisition of protective immunity, causing a transition towards the expression of more diverse variants, facilitated by their inherent activation biases. In light of this we would also speculate that the proposed order in which individuals acquire immunity (anti-UpsA followed by anti-UpsB/C), as well as the proposed associations between the expression of UpsA <i>var</i> genes and severe disease outcome, especially in young children, is less determined by the Ups group itself and is more a consequence of within-host selection of long, conserved genes, which are often but not exclusively found within the UpsA group."

These methods have previously been described in detail and tested using diverse artificial data sets (<a href=\"#bib37\">Noble and Recker, 2012</a>). For some of our analyses it was desirable to use a model of reduced dimension. Previously we have shown that reliable parameter estimates can be obtained from data for the 16 most highly transcribed <i>var</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Noble and Recker, 2012</a>), which in this case comprised the 9 starter genes and the 7 others with highest average transcript levels. These 16 genes together accounted, on average, for more than 92% of the sum of transcript levels in each culture (excluding the culture\u2019s starter gene), whereas none of the excluded genes accounted for more than 1%. To estimate activation biases, we modified the model so that the direction of switching was independent of the previously active gene (i.e., <math id=\"inf16\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mi>j</mi><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> for all <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> and <i>k</i>)."

Additionally, to account for uncertainty in our parameter estimates, we performed tests on the collected output of our MCMC method.

We performed our statistical tests on all the selected parameter sets and calculated mean p-values.

We applied variance stabilising transformations to the data prior to analysis. Specifically, the centrality measure was rescaled and squared, and to each switch bias we applied the logit transformation, added five and then square-rooted the magnitude. These transformations made the data conform better to the assumptions of our statistical model; test results would have been more significant had we instead used the untransformed data."

Genes were initially constructed of randomly chosen homology blocks and were assigned activation biases according to a geometric sequence. For 30,000 iterations, pairs of genes were selected at random, with the probability of selection being proportional to activation bias. A randomly chosen homology block was copied from the first of the chosen genes to replace the corresponding block in the second gene. Homology blocks in all genes also underwent random mutation at a rate 10 times lower than the gene conversion rate. We constructed a relatedness network and calculated centrality in the same way as for the HB3 data."

Assuming that each culture, excluding the parent, began with a single parasite and that populations expanded approximately fivefold per generation, we deduced that the first transcriptional switch most likely occurred, on average, two or three generations after cloning. Therefore we assumed that each of these cultures remained clonal for the first three generations. For the parent culture, we used the first observation as the initial condition. If a switch had occurred in one or more of the initially clonal cultures within the first few generations, when the population was very small, then our assumed initial conditions would be inaccurate. Therefore we also ran our algorithms using the first observations as the initial conditions for all cultures. The parameter estimates were highly consistent with those obtained using clonal initial conditions."

A particular strength of our method was that it also estimated parameters for genes we did not clone. To assess the accuracy of results obtained in this way, we performed cross-validation by sequentially excluding data sets. For example, to derive alternative estimates for <i>var29</i> we ran the MCMC algorithm without the data for culture #8 (which initially expressed <i>var29</i>), and to derive alternative estimates for <i>var27</i> we excluded data for cultures #5 and #6. The results, shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, confirmed our method\u2019s ability to estimate switch biases of non-starter genes with sufficient accuracy to determine the general switching pattern.

Similarly we excluded data from each of cultures #5 and #6 to obtain two sets of estimates for the <i>var27</i> switch biases. For each of the two different data sets we calculated the deviations from the mean switch biases and found these to be positively correlated (Pearson\u2019s <i>\u03c1</i> = 0.43, p=0.015), confirming the validity of our method."

The authors study 11 clones for 98 to 108 generations of growth and assess transcription in each culture at 4\u20137 time points. The relative transcriptional signal (as a percentage of the total <i>var</i> gene transcriptional signal) was documented for every measurement and the resulting transcriptional profile was analyzed according to chromosomal position, promoter type, gene length, and sequence diversity. The authors find an expression hierarchy favoring centrally located <i>var</i> genes, as has previously been found in other parasite isolates. Specifically centromeric type 1 <i>var</i> are found to be highly expressed due to high activation rates. Furthermore it is noticed that frequently expressed <i>var</i> genes are more genetically diverse, leading the authors to suggest that <i>var</i> transcription facilitates generation of antigenic diversity."

Therefore this promoter type could potentially serve as a marker for central <i>var</i> genes in parasite isolates in which chromosomal position of individual <i>var</i> genes is not known. It would therefore be of great benefit to the field if the authors could use their data to ask the question if UpsC promoter off-rates are always very low. For example this data point could be added to the first part of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (all genes) by indicating the promoter types of the central and subtelomeric <i>var</i> genes (central: UpsC, UpsB and Ups A; subtelomeric: Ups B and UpsA).

We have also clarified the terminology and made sure we use important terms, such as \u201cactivation bias\u201d and \u201cswitch bias\u201d, more consistently throughout. Finally, we have conducted additional statistical tests and have added credibility intervals to our parameter estimates. A point-by-point response to specific points is given below."
