                    "text": "Munc13\u20131 acts as a master regulator of neurotransmitter release, mediating docking-priming of synaptic vesicles and diverse presynaptic plasticity processes. It is unclear how the functions of the multiple domains of Munc13\u20131 are coordinated. The crystal structure of a Munc13\u20131 fragment including its C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN) reveals a 19.5 nm-long multi-helical structure with the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains packed at one end. The similar orientations of the respective diacyglycerol- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains suggest that the two domains cooperate in plasma-membrane binding and that activation of Munc13\u20131 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diacylglycerol during short-term presynaptic plasticity are closely interrelated. Electrophysiological experiments in mouse neurons support the functional importance of the domain interfaces observed in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN. The structure imposes key constraints for models of neurotransmitter release and suggests that Munc13\u20131 bridges the vesicle and plasma membranes from the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface."

It is unclear how the functions of the multiple domains of Munc13\u20131 are coordinated. The crystal structure of a Munc13\u20131 fragment including its C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN) reveals a 19.5 nm-long multi-helical structure with the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains packed at one end. The similar orientations of the respective diacyglycerol- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains suggest that the two domains cooperate in plasma-membrane binding and that activation of Munc13\u20131 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diacylglycerol during short-term presynaptic plasticity are closely interrelated. Electrophysiological experiments in mouse neurons support the functional importance of the domain interfaces observed in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN. The structure imposes key constraints for models of neurotransmitter release and suggests that Munc13\u20131 bridges the vesicle and plasma membranes from the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface."

An electrical signal in one neuron triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the cell, which then activate or inhibit electrical signals in neighboring neurons. Inside the cell, neurotransmitters are stored in small bubble-like structures called synaptic vesicles. The vesicles fuse with the membrane that surrounds the cell to release the neurotransmitters. This process must be tightly controlled to ensure that neurotransmitters are released rapidly and at the right time."

                        "text": "The release of neurotransmitters by synaptic vesicle exocytosis is critical for neuronal communication. This exquisitely regulated process involves several steps, including tethering of synaptic vesicles to specialized sites of the presynaptic plasma membrane called active zones, a priming step(s) that leaves the vesicles ready to release, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib57\">S\u00fcdhof, 2013</a>). Each of these steps can be modulated in a variety of presynaptic plasticity processes that underlie multiple forms of information processing in the brain (<a href=\"#bib43\">Regehr, 2012</a>). The protein machinery that controls release (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rizo and Xu, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>) includes the neuronal soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, which play a key role in membrane fusion by forming a tight four-helix bundle (the SNARE complex) that brings the vesicle and plasma membranes into close proximity (<a href=\"#bib55\">S\u00f6llner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hanson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Poirier et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sutton et al., 1998</a>). This complex is disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs; no relation to SNAP-25) (<a href=\"#bib55\">S\u00f6llner et al., 1993</a>) to recycle the SNAREs for another round of fusion (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mayer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee et al., 1996</a>). The Sec1/Munc18 protein Munc18\u20131 and the large (200 kDa) active zone proteins called Munc13s are also crucial for release. Munc18\u20131 binds to a self-inhibited \u2018closed\u2019 conformation of syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dulubova et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Misura et al., 2000</a>) and orchestrates SNARE complex assembly in an NSF-SNAP-resistant manner together with Munc13, which helps to open syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Richmond et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ma et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2013</a>)."

                        "type": "paragraph", 
                        "text": "Because of their multiple functions, Munc13s have emerged as particularly central regulators of neurotransmitter release that link the core membrane fusion apparatus to diverse forms of presynaptic plasticity through their multidomain architecture (illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> for Munc13\u20131, the most abundant mammalian isoform). Thus, neurotransmitter release is completely abrogated in the absence of Munc13s (<a href=\"#bib3\">Augustin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Richmond et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aravamudan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>). This phenotype most likely arises because Munc13s play key roles in docking and priming (<a href=\"#bib58\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Imig et al., 2014</a>) that are associated at least in part to their activity in opening syntaxin-1 and thus stimulating SNARE complex formation through their MUN domain (<a href=\"#bib46\">Richmond et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Basu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). However, the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region and the C-terminal C<sub>2</sub>C domain are also critical for release, which may arise because these domains help bridge the vesicle and plasma membranes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2016</a>). There is also evidence for a role of Munc13s in events downstream of priming [e.g. (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, Munc13s are involved in multiple presynaptic plasticity processes, including isoform-specific depression and augmentation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rosenmund et al., 2002</a>), diacyglycerol (DAG)-phorbol ester-dependent potentiation of release via the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent short-term plasticity through the C<sub>2</sub>B domain and a calmodulin-binding region (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Junge et al., 2004</a>). Binding of the Munc13\u20131 C<sub>2</sub>A domain to RIMs also provides a connection to RIM-dependent forms of short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Betz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dulubova et al., 2005</a>). The crucial physiological importance of these modulatory processes was emphatically illustrated by the finding that knock-in mice bearing a point mutation in the Munc13\u20131 C<sub>1</sub> domain that disrupts phorbol-ester-dependent potentiation of release die 2\u20133 hr after birth even though the mutation causes no impairment of evoked release (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>)."

Here, we report the crystal structure of a Munc13\u20131 fragment spanning its C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN), revealing a long, 195 \u00c5 rod formed by 26 \u03b1-helices that packs at one end against the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains. The DAG-binding region of the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding region of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain are near each other and point in the same direction, which is expected to facilitate cooperation between the two domains in membrane binding and thus enable synergy between the effects of DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in neurotransmitter release during repetitive stimulation. Electrophysiological experiments show that mutations designed to disrupt interfaces between different domains of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN impair evoked release and vesicle priming to different extents, and also have differential effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent short-term plasticity as well as phorbol ester-induced potentiation. These results suggest that the highly elongated nature of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and the relative disposition of its domains in our crystal structure are critical for the normal functions of Munc13\u20131 in neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity, placing important structural constraints on possible models for the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity."

While crystals were obtained for several of the fragments that we prepared, they tended to diffract poorly. Key for the success in obtaining crystals of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN of sufficient quality to diffract in the 3\u20133.5 \u00c5 range were the choice of N- and C-termini (residues 529 and 1531, respectively), as well as the removal of residues 1408\u20131452, which correspond to a long loop within the MUN domain that is poorly conserved and is subject to alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brose et al., 1995</a>). Removal of this loop generally increases the solubility of C-terminal Munc13\u20131 fragments (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Even with the best diffraction data obtained with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, structure determination was hindered by low resolution, significant anisotropy, non-isomorphism and an inability to obtain selenomethionyl-derivatized protein. These problems were overcome by the use of single wavelength anomalous dispersion phases obtained from a dataset collected at the tantalum LIII edge on native crystals soaked with a tantalum bromide cluster, coupled with molecular replacement phases obtained from the previously determined structures of the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shen et al., 2005</a>), the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>) and the nearly complete MUN domain of Munc13\u20131. For this purpose, it was necessary to first re-refine the structure of the nearly complete MUN domain (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2015</a>) using the deposited structure factors (PDB code 4Y21) to reduce the level of side chain outliers and of steric clashes, as well as to correct the sequence numbering (see Materials and methods). Placement of the C<sub>1</sub> domains in the cell of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN crystals (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was verified by an anomalous difference map calculated from data collected on native crystals at the zinc K-edge energy. Data collection and refinement statistics for the final structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, as well as for the re-refined structure of the nearly complete MUN domain, are described in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>."

The structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN can be viewed as a highly elongated rod spanning ca. 195 \u00c5 and is formed mostly of \u03b1-helical bundles, with a total of 26 helices; the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains pack at the N-terminal end of the rod (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Much of the long rod is formed by the MUN domain, which is homologous to subunits of complexes that mediate tethering in diverse membrane compartments (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pei et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yu and Hughson, 2010</a>) and was previously shown to be formed by four subdomains of about five helices each (named A-D and colored in blue, green, yellow and orange on <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2015</a>).

(2015)</a> and we re-refined, shows that the MUN domain is very similar in both structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), as expected because this structure was used in crystallographic phase determination by the molecular replacement method. However, the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN shows that the MUN domain actually starts at residue 828 and contains five additional helices (helices H6-H10), resulting in a total of seven helices for subdomain A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In addition, there are five more helices preceding the MUN domain (helices H1-H5; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Four of these helices correspond to the linker sequence between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains, whereas one helix (H1) is spanned by a sequence preceding the C<sub>1</sub> domain (colored in red)."

For instance, Munc13\u20131 fragments starting right at the beginning of the C<sub>1</sub> domain were unstable and we were not able to express fragments containing only the C<sub>1</sub> domain, the C<sub>2</sub>B domain and the linker between them in soluble form. As the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN now reveals, there are extensive contacts between helix H1, the four helices of the linker, the MUN domain, the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D\u2013F</a>), and hence it is not surprising that elimination of some of these interfaces impairs proper folding. We also note that the structures of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN are similar to those determined for the isolated domains (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), although the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops are not visible in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This correlates with the previous finding that these loops were observable in the crystal structure of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup> but not in its crystal structure without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), as our C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure was determined in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

First, the elongated structure and the overall packing of the different domains at the N-terminal end of the structure suggest that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN may function as a rigid or semi-rigid unit that bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. Note in this context that the similarity in the structures of the two molecules from the asymmetric unit of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN crystals (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and between these structures and that of the nearly complete MUN domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) suggest that the overall architecture of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN has limited flexibility. Second, a model of the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN incorporating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, which mediate its interactions with PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), shows that these loops are proximal to the DAG-phorbol ester-binding region of the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). This arrangement is expected to promote cooperation between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains in membrane binding, thus suggesting a natural mechanism for synergy between increases in DAG and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to enhance release probability upon repetitive stimulation. However, it is noteworthy that there are abundant basic residues in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) that could potentially mediate membrane binding in alternative orientations in the absence of DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These observations suggest that increased DAG and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations may alter release probability by promoting a different orientation of the Munc13\u20131 C-terminal region that is more efficient in promoting priming and/or fusion (see Discussion and models described therein). Third, the finding that helix H1 is packed against the MUN domain, with the N-terminus pointing toward the center of the long rod (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggests that N-terminal sequences of Munc13\u20131 not included in this structure could perform their regulatory functions by influencing MUN domain activity. For instance, the calmodulin-binding region of Munc13\u20131 might inhibit release by binding to the middle of the MUN domain, where an NF sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) is known to be critical for opening syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2015</a>), and binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin to this region may enhance release by relieving this inhibition. Interactions of homodimerized Munc13\u20131 C<sub>2</sub>A domain (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2006</a>) with the MUN domain might also underlie the inhibition caused by homodimerization, which is relieved by RIM binding (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deng et al., 2011</a>)."

To address this question, we designed three mutations to strongly disrupt domain interfaces observed in the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure: (i) a V549E,L554E double mutation designed to disrupt the hydrophobic packing of helix H1 against the linker region and against the MUN domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>); (ii) an R750E,K752E double mutation to disrupt salt bridges formed between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>); and (iii) an N940W mutation designed to perturb the interface between the C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We tested the physiological consequences of these mutations by performing rescue experiments in autaptic hippocampal neuronal cultures from Munc13-1/2 double KO mice (<a href=\"#bib58\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>) that express WT or mutant Munc13\u20131s through a lentiviral vector. To dissect which aspects of neurotransmitter release and its regulation might be affected by the mutations, we evaluated spontaneous release, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release triggered by a single action potential (AP), vesicle priming, high-frequency stimulation and PDBu-induced facilitation. Western blot analyses showed that the WT and mutant proteins were detectable at comparable levels (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the differences observed in our electrophysiological measurements arise in part from distinct expression levels, this possibility is unlikely because no significant changes in synaptic properties are observed in heterozygous Munc13\u20131 (+/-) neurons and WT neurons mildly overexpressing WT munc13\u20131 in a Munc13\u20132 KO background (MC and CR, unpublished results)."

Analysis of the EPSC amplitudes revealed that the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface and the N940W mutation in the C2B-MUN interface impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

We found that the N940W mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface caused a decrease in RRP size of close to 40%, similar to the change seen in the evoked response. The H1 helix mutation V549E,L554E decreased the RRP size by nearly 50% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), which contrasts with the lack of an effect of this mutation on evoked release. Furthermore, the disruption of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface by the R750E,K752E mutation led to normal vesicle priming despite reducing the evoked response. These experiments demonstrate that all three mutations impact Munc13\u20131 function but, interestingly, each mutation displays distinct effects on evoked release and vesicle priming. This finding strongly suggests that the domain interfaces differentially regulate the efficiency of the vesicle fusion process, which may lead to differences in vesicle release probability."

The impact on release probability in these mutants was further corroborated by analyzing the degree of facilitation or depression quantified by the paired pulse ratio of two consecutive AP-induced EPSC amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>).

Initial high vesicular release probability predicts more depression of synaptic responses due to more prominent depletion of primed vesicles. However, structure function studies on Munc13 have identified changes in sustained release that are not explained by the initial release probability, and this has been interpreted as Munc13 playing an additional role in synaptic augmentation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rosenmund et al., 2002</a>) and in modifying vesicle replenishment through activity-dependent vesicle re-priming (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). To test how disruption of the interfaces in Munc13\u20131 can affect the activity-dependent vesicle re-priming, we monitored synaptic responses during 10 Hz AP trains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We first defined the function of steady-state depression versus release probability in WT neurons by applying AP trains at various external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and found as expected a robust correlation between release probability and steady state depression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Interestingly, the V549E,L554E mutation in the H1 helix and the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface caused more pronounced depression of sustained release than expected from the initial release probability, while disrupting the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface with the N940W mutation caused less depression than expected from the initial release probability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). These results suggest that each one of the interfaces disrupted by the mutations plays a role in activity-dependent vesicle re-priming, and reinforce the notion that Munc13 exerts multiple functions in shaping release properties at synapses."

The N940W mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface showed more pronounced potentiation than WT Munc13\u20131 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), which correlates with the reduction in steady-state depression during 10 Hz AP trains observed for this mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and indicates an easier transition for Munc13\u20131 to a potentiated state. Conversely, the V549E,L554E in helix H1 led to reduced potentiation by PDBu compared to WT, which likely arises because of the initial high vesicular release probability observed for this mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Remarkably, the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface caused an even more pronounced decrease in PDBu potentiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), which contrasts with the limited effect of this mutation on vesicular release probability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) but correlates with the strong depression observed in the 10 Hz AP trains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

Hence, we used these experiments to examine the effects of disrupting Munc13\u20131 domain interfaces on membrane fusion in vitro and compare them to those observed in our electrophysiological studies. Unfortunately, multiple attempts to express C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bearing the V549E,L554E mutation failed to yield sufficient amounts of soluble protein, and we were also unable to obtain C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bearing a single V549E or L554E mutation, suggesting that both substitutions strongly destabilize the fragment. Since the V549E,L554E mutant was expressed at levels comparable to WT Munc13\u20131 in our rescue experiments, it is plausible that this mutation is less destabilizing in the context of these experiments because of interactions of that region with N-terminal sequences of Munc13\u20131, with other components of the release machinery, or with molecular chaperones."

These two additional substitutions partially compensated for the effects of the R750E,K752E mutation, as the quadruple mutation recovered some of the activity lost in the R750E,K752E mutant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The recovery was modest, but this result is not unexpected because the orientation of the mutated side chains in the quadruple mutant may not be as favorable to form salt bridges as in the WT protein. Hence, the observed functional recovery in the quadruple mutant supports the notion that the effects of the R750E,K752E mutation in the fusion assays are due to disruption of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interactions. We note that all these reconstitution experiments were performed in the absence of synaptotagmin-1 because this Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor does not have a marked influence in the results obtained in these bulk assays under the conditions used, although it may cause an acceleration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion that can only be detected at faster time scales than those used in our measurements (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2016</a>).

Altogether, our results strongly support the notion that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface observed in the crystal structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is important for evoked release and for cooperation between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains in membrane binding during repetitive stimulation to generate an activated state that is stabilized by binding of the C<sub>1</sub> domain to DAG and of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub>. Thus, as we noted previously (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2016</a>), our reconstitutions including DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> in the T-liposomes may recapitulate more closely this activated state than the normal state that leads to release evoked by a single action potential. Interpreting the results of the N940W mutation in the reconstitutions is hindered by the fact that this mutation impaired evoked and sucrose-induced release but had less depression than WT in the 10 Hz trains and a slightly higher potentiation by PDBu (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). The small impairment of fusion observed in the reconstitutions for this mutant may reflect a balance between the inhibitory and stimulatory effects observed in the rescue experiments but, overall, the mild nature of the effect on fusion appears to be more reminiscent of the small (albeit contrary) effects observed in the PDBu treatment, thus supporting also the notion that the reconstitutions emulate an activated state of the release machinery."

The observation that the three mutations designed to disrupt domain interfaces observed in the structure have distinct effects on evoked release, vesicle priming, vesicle release probability, high-frequency stimulation and PDBu-induced facilitation demonstrates the functional relevance of the overall structure and shows that the different domain interfaces perturbed by the mutations play differential roles in release and short-term presynaptic plasticity. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that each of the three mutations uniquely alters the normal relation between vesicle release probability and steady-state EPSC amplitude in 10 Hz AP trains in neurons expressing WT Munc13\u20131 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), a relation that arises from the natural increase in RRP depletion rate as vesicle release probability increases. Similarly, the three mutations also change the normal inverse relation between the extent of PDBu-induced facilitation and the vesicle release probability. This finding is not surprising, as the effects of PDBu are likely to be at least partially related to those observed in 10 Hz trains. Thus, phorbol ester activation of the Munc13 C<sub>1</sub> domain is believed to mimic the effects of increased DAG levels during repetitive stimulation, which result from accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activation of PLCs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>). Accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> also activates Munc13s by binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>)."

These conclusions are supported by the physiological effects of the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface. This mutation leads to a modest impairment of evoked release and to no significant change in the RRP, resulting also in no significant change in vesicular release probability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, this mutation causes a considerably stronger depression during 10 Hz trains than observed for WT Munc13\u20131 and to severe impairment of PDBu-dependent facilitation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). These results suggest that the interaction between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains observed in our crystal structure is important for evoked release but is particularly critical for activation of Munc13\u20131 by phorbol esters as well by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DAG during repetitive stimulation. Note also that this mutation strongly disrupts the ability to increase the release probability after repetitive stimulation observed for WT Munc13\u20131 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Because the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains pack at the N-terminal end of the long helical structure, far from the middle region of the MUN domain that contains the NF residues involved in opening syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), our structure does not support models whereby the C<sub>1</sub> and C2B domains impair the activity of the MUN domain by direct intramolecular interactions, and binding to DAG or Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases these inhibitory interactions [e.g. (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008</a>)]. Instead, our structure suggests that activation of Munc13\u20131 by PDBu or by repetitive stimulation involves cooperative binding of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains to the plasma membrane in a defined orientation that is promoted by increases in the levels of DAG and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; this activated state may be more effective in mediating priming and/or downstream events leading to fusion than the state existing under resting conditions, which may involve a different orientation of Munc13\u20131 with respect to the plasma membrane favored by Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and DAG-independent interactions involving multiple basic residues of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and discussion below)."

The arrows in the top panel are meant to illustrate that complete assembly of the C-terminus of the SNARE complex might pull the membranes radially outwards, which could create strong membrane tension to trigger membrane fusion.

Correspondingly, this mutant exhibits more depression during 10 Hz trains than WT neurons, but the depression is stronger than expected from the observed vesicle release probability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The V549E,L554E mutation also leads to a strong impairment in PDBu-induced facilitation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) that likely arises from the increased Pvr.

The decreases in the RRP observed for both the V549E,L554E and the H567K mutants may result from disruption of coupling between the C-terminal region and the N-terminus containing the C<sub>2</sub>A domain, which contributes to the docking-priming activity of Munc13\u20131 (MC and CR, unpublished results). The increased release probability observed for both mutants suggests that the disruptive structural effects of the two mutations may mimic to some extent the changes involved in activating Munc13\u20131 during repetitive stimulation, which may involve in part the release of inhibitory effects caused by N-terminal sequences. However, note\u00a0that the V549E,L554E mutation prevented the increase in Pvr observed after repetitive stimulation for WT Munc13\u20131 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), indicating that different features govern this increase in Pvr and the release probability in na\u00efve synapses."

These results suggest that the packing of the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface observed in our structure is important for normal vesicle priming and release caused by a single action potential, but the alteration of this interface caused by the N940W mutation favors the activated state that is generated during repetitive stimulation.

Without knowing how Munc13\u20131 interacts with other proteins, interpretation of the structure of Munc13\u20131 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN in terms of specific models of neurotransmitter release is necessarily speculative. Nevertheless, the structure poses critical constraints on working models of release and its regulation. For instance, the model of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> is based on the finding that the Munc13\u20131 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment bridges V-liposomes to T-liposomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2016</a>). Such bridging might facilitate the activity of the MUN domain in opening syntaxin-1 to initiate SNARE complex formation and may involve interactions of the polybasic face of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) with the T-liposomes and of C<sub>2</sub>C with the V-liposomes. Binding of the C<sub>1</sub> domain to DAG and of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to Ca<sup>2+</sup> during repetitive stimulation could change the orientation of Munc13\u20131 with respect to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) in such a way that the two membranes are brought into closer proximity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) and the SNARE complex is formed more efficiently. Importantly, if Munc13\u20131 is located between the two membranes, progress toward complete SNARE complex assembly and fusion would require release of Munc13\u20131 from the fusion complex because otherwise its large size would hinder further membrane proximity. In this scenario, Munc13\u20131 could not underlie changes in release probability directly, but its enhanced activity could lead to an increase in the number of preassembled SNARE complexes that might underlie the increases in release probability caused by up-regulation of DAG, by PDBu treatment or by the K630W mutation in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop of the Munc13\u20132 C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). However, it is difficult to explain with this type of model why the H567K mutation in the C<sub>1</sub> domain does not alter the vesicle refilling rate under resting conditions while increasing the Pvr (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>), and why PDBu changes the vesicle release probability without altering the RRP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Basu et al., 2007</a>)."

Such models predict at least two major actions for Munc13s, one in docking-priming (i.e. orchestrating SNARE complex assembly) and another in fusion. The length of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure suggests that the Munc13\u20131 C-terminal region cannot remain in the central space between two membranes (as in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) after the SNARE complex is even partially assembled. However, the activities of Munc13\u20131 in bridging the two membranes and mediating SNARE complex assembly, as well as potential downstream functions, could be performed with Munc13\u20131 located in the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface, with an arrangement where the large size of Munc13\u20131 does not hinder completion of SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion (e.g. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). With such an arrangement, reorientation of Munc13\u20131 upon binding to DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub> could still underlie an increased activity in facilitating SNARE complex formation, but such reorientation could also lead to an optimization of the primed state that can lead more readily to membrane fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx than that observed without Munc13\u20131 activation. This separation of the roles of Munc13\u20131 into at least two steps can easily explain the differential effects of the V549E,L554E, R750E,K752E and N940W mutations in the different functional assays, including the finding that N940W impairs priming and evoked release, but enhances Munc13\u20131 function during 10 Hz trains or PDBu treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>)."

An attractive feature of this model is that it places the SNAREs on the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface rather than between the membranes, consistent with electron microscopy images of SNARE-mediated liposome fusion intermediates (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>) and of presynaptic terminals showing practically direct contact between docked-primed vesicles and the plasma membrane [e.g. (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harlow et al., 2001</a>)]. With this architecture, the SNARE complex could not induce fusion by bringing the vesicle and plasma membranes into proximity, as they are already in contact before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, but could pull the two membranes radially outwards as assembly of the SNARE complex is completed (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). In this case, fusion would result from the tension created in both membranes, which would favor transient formation of non-bilayer intermediates that might or might not resemble a stalk. Components of the fusion complex that are bound to the SNARE complex and bridge the membranes (e.g. Munc13\u20131 in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) would play an important role to establish support points from which the SNAREs can exert their force on the membranes more efficiently."

This proposal is supported by the findings that the tight Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of membrane fusion in our reconstitution assays (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) arises largely from Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13\u20131 C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2016</a>), and that disrupting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the Munc13\u20132 C<sub>2</sub>B domain did not impair evoked release in rescue experiments but did impair release during repetitive stimulation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>).

These corrections were crucial for successful phasing. Initial phases for C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN were obtained by molecular replacement (MR) with <i>Phaser</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) using the crystal structure of the N-terminally truncated MUN BCD domain (PDB code: 4Y21) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2015</a>) with the coordinates for several loops and residues at the N- and C-termini removed (residues 942\u2013947, 1038\u20131041, 1193\u20131196, 1342\u20131353, 1404\u20131409, 1452\u20131469, 1515\u20131523) as the search model. One C2B domain was located by MR using the crystal structure of the calcium-free C2B domain (PDB code: 3 KWT) as a search model (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). Phasing using MR versus the native dataset stalled at this point, and an iterative MR-SAD/rigid body refinement procedure was then adopted. MR-SAD phases calculated in <i>Phaser</i> from a tantalum bromide dataset collected at the tantalum LIII edge revealed interpretable density for missing helices H7-H9, which were modeled initially with a polyalanine sequence and rigid body refined in <i>Phenix</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). The updated model was placed in the native cell via MR in <i>Phaser</i> and rigid-body refined in <i>Phenix.</i> Density modification using two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry was performed in <i>Parrot</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cowtan,\u00a02010</a>), and automated model rebuilding of only the newly added four helices of each MUN domain was performed in <i>Buccaneer</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cowtan, 2006</a>). Multiple cycles of alternating this procedure between the tantalum and native datasets allowed the modeling and sequence assignment to helices H1-H9, and the placement of the second C2B domain by MR. Subsequently, both C1 domains were located by MR using the NMR structure (PDB code: 1Y8F) as a search model (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shen et al., 2005</a>), and the locations were confirmed by an anomalous difference map calculated from a dataset collected at the zinc K-edge (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The higher-than-average R<sub>free</sub> value is probably due to the relative dearth of lattice contacts (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) for the CD subdomains of MUN chain A of C1C2BMUN, as evidenced by weak electron density and high average thermal displacement factors (ADP) (151.2 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) for those subdomains (residues 1255\u20131517) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Due to the high ADP values for the CD subdomain of chain A, the authors recommend that interpretation of the CD subdomain should be performed on residues in chain B. The density for the remaining domains of chain A as well as chain B of C1C2BMUN is strong and well connected; in fact, the average ADPs for residues 541\u2013950 are lower for chain A (41.0 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) than chain B (62.4 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>).

The series resistance was compensated by 70% and only cells with series resistances\u00a0&lt;10 M\u03a9 were analyzed. Data were acquired using Clampex 10 software (Molecular Devices,\u00a0Sunnyvale,\u00a0CA) at 10 kHz and filtered using a low-pass Bessel filter at 3 kHz. Borosilicate glass pipettes with a resistance between 2\u00a0and\u00a03.5 M\u03a9 were used. Pipettes were filled with internal recording solution contained the following (in mM): 136 KCl, 17.8 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4.6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 12 creatine phosphate, and 50 U/ml phosphocreatine kinase; 300 mOsm; pH 7.4.

Spontaneous release was measured by recording miniature EPSCs for 30 s at \u221270 mV. To detect false-positive events 3 mM of kynurenic acid was applied for an equal amount of time. Action potential-evoked EPSCs were triggered by 2 ms somatic depolarization from \u221270 to 0 mV. The size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) was determined by the application with a fast flow system of 500 mM sucrose added to the standard extracellular solution for 5 s. Evoked sucrose responses are characterized by a transient inward current followed by a steady state current. The steady state component represents refilling of primed vesicles and was used to define the baseline. The area under the baseline in the transient curve component was quantified to determine the total charge released by the RRP (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</a>).

The paired-pulse ratio was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the second EPSC by the amplitude of the first. To analyze release induced by a high frequency stimulation train, EPSCs were evoked at a frequency of 10 Hz for 5 s. To define the quantitative relationship between Pvr and the steady state EPSC amplitudes during a 10 Hz action potential train, we recorded EPSCs and sucrose evoked responses from wildtype neurons. EPSCs and EPSC trains were recorded in external solutions containing 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mM calcium and 4 mM magnesium. The hypertonic sucrose solution for all responses contained 2 mM calcium and 4 mM magnesium. The Pvr was computed and correlated with the mean amplitude of the last 10 EPSCs of the 10 Hz AP train. Phorbol ester experiments were monitored in the same cell, EPSC amplitudes were recorded at 0.2 Hz for 30 s in the absence of 1 \u00b5M PDBu and the following 30 s in its presence. To dissect how an AP train modulates synaptic output, we examined RRP and release probability separately by probing EPSC amplitude and RRP size 2 s following the 10 Hz train. We then compared the relative changes in RRP and EPSC to the corresponding EPSC and RRP values preceding the AP train. An approximately equal number of cells were recorded from control and experimental groups per day from 3\u00a0to\u00a04 consecutive days. The present dataset was acquired from three separate cultures. To minimize variability between cultures the values of mEPSC, EPSC and RRP from each experimental groups of recording were normalized to the mean value of the WT group for each culture. Data were analyzed offline using Axograph X (Axograph Scientific,\u00a0Sidney,\u00a0Australia) and the values were normalized to the WT group. Data summation and statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad).

Munc13 is essential for exocytosis, and it undergoes multiple interactions with other proteins, particularly SNARE proteins, and the plasma membrane, but its precise mechanism of action is not yet understood. Based on the crystal structure that was obtained, the authors designed different mutations to specifically target the interactions between these domains and study the potential cooperation and synergy between the domains. These mutants were expressed in neurons in which the Mun13 isoforms were deleted, thus allowing for assessing the effect of each of the mutations on the function of the protein, yielding novel insights into the cooperative functions of the different domains."

However, we suggest to express these mutants (or at least the domains containing the mutants) in a eukaryotic cell and then check expression of the intact fragments by western blotting. Since unfolded proteins are usually degraded, the presence of non-degraded protein would increase confidence that the expressed proteins do not have major folding defects."

This <i>B</i>-factor sharpening improved the connectivity in the electron density maps and allowed for the tracing of the main chain for many loops that connect secondary structural elements. Unfortunately, in many of these loops the density for the side chains is almost or completely non-existent, and the density that is typically observed in a 3.35 \u00c5 resolution map does not often indicate where to place main chain carbonyl oxygens. Even when certain residues are modeled into acceptable regions of the Ramachandran plot, subsequent reciprocal space refinement may move these residues to unfavorable regions.

(2012) D68, 454\u2013467), he addresses the problems with the Real-space R (RSR) as a validation statistic (see p. 456 and section 4.2 of this article). Basically, the values of the limiting radii used for calculation of the atomic scattering factors are chosen arbitrarily and differ between software implementations used to calculate the electron density maps, which causes RSR to vary according to the software used. Additionally, the value of the RSR increases as a function of the increasing value of the <i>B</i>-factor. This latter problem with the RSR Z-score relates directly to the C1C2BMUN structure, and most especially to the portions of the structure with high values for the <i>B</i>-factor. As mentioned in the Methods section of our paper, the average <i>B</i>-factor of residues 1255 \u2013 1517 of C1C2BMUN chain A (151.2 \u00c52) is considerably higher than the overall average of the rest of the chain (54.1 \u00c52 for residues 541-1254). Average values do not tell the whole story in this case, but a plot of <i>B</i>-factor values versus residues for the two chains are illustrative (the blue trace is for chain A, and the green for chain B).

Reciprocal-space refinement after removal of residues A1255-A1517 from the model resulted in a worsening of the R(free) and model geometry. It is for this reason that we have included a plot of atomic thermal displacement parameters (<i>B</i>-factors) versus residue for both chains as a supplemental figure (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and included the following statement in the Methods section: \u201cDue to the high ADP values for the CD subdomain of chain A, the authors recommend that interpretation of the CD subdomain should be performed on residues in chain B.

The magnitude of bending in the fragment is relatively small, and the differences observed in this study are highest in the CD subdomain, which is the region of weakest density in chain A. Note that an alignment of the fragments from residue 541-1254 of chains A and B results in an r.m.s.d. of 0.71 \u00c5, not terribly different than the maximum likelihood coordinate error estimate of 0.41 \u00c5. Please also keep in mind that initial rounds of refinement of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure used the MUN domain as a reference model for geometry restraints, and the final rounds of refinement removed the reference model restraints but included torsional-angle NCS geometry restraints between chains A and B. For reference we also include below the r.m.s.d. values for the superposition of the MUN domain to each individual C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN chain."

We realize that a structural characterization of the mutants (although certainly desirable and interesting) goes beyond what can be done, particularly when considering that the purification of these mutant proteins may be difficult. However, we suggest to express these mutants (or at least the domains containing the mutants) in an eukaryotic cell and then check expression of the intact fragments by western blotting. Since unfolded proteins are usually degraded, the presence of non-degraded protein would increase confidence that the expressed proteins do not have major folding defects.</i>"

Hence, we believe that expression in yet another type of eukaryotic cell would not be very informative. In the Materials and methods section we have added the following sentence: \u201cThe finding that the mutants eluted at the same volumes as WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in gel filtration and did not exhibit a higher tendency to degradation strongly suggest that the mutations do not cause folding problems.\u201d Below we show the gel filtration chromatograms obtained for the WT and three C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C mutants, but we feel is not necessary to include them into the paper. As we pointed out in the manuscript, we did have problems expressing the V549E,L554E mutant in Sf9 cells. However, the finding that this mutant rescues evoked release as efficiently as WT Munc13-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) strongly suggests that the mutation does not cause major folding problems."

In general, no large change in vesicle priming was observed for WT or any of the mutants, but we found that Pvr was a main modulator underlying train behavior. Thus, the vesicular release probability doubled after the AP train for WT Munc13-1, and increased even more for the N940W mutant. In contrast, no increase in Pvr was observed for the V549E,L554E and R750E,K752E mutants, which depress more strongly than WT Munc13-1 during the AP trains."
